"desensitisation is basically controlled exposure therapy, whereby someone is exposed to mild forms of the object of phobia and allowed to accustom themselves to its presence, then the severity of the form of exposure is increased a little and the process repeated. i think this allows the person to see that nothing bad happens (ie what they fear) as a result of the exposure and it is deliberately mild to ensure the person can use their brain to rationalise against an immediate avoidant response. this technique seems to work best when exposure can be rigidly controlled (ie no surprises) and the patient is in control with someone providing encouragement and enhancing cognitive reasoning. the reason why it is so difficult to address phobias is because the primitive brain is quite powerful to react instinctively to danger to protect the organism and thus overrides the cognitive process to a certain extent. by starting with a mild form of the phobic object, the patient can better cognitively reason against the instinctive response, but it is still not easy. i have deeply entrenched phobias that aren't amenable to desensitisation in a controlled environment because they are not really subject to control. despite this, the medical profession refused to acknowledge the impracticality and suggested desensitisation. of course it didn't work but increased the phobia. it took many years before a psychologist stumbled on some of the causal factors and i was better able to treat myself. part of the treatment issue is often the rush to diagnose to a known condition, even if it doesn't fit right (the shoehorning approach), through expediency and not spending enough time to really understand what is going on. i think desensitisation works best for irrational object orientated phobias, but is less amenable to phobias resulting from repeated bad experiences that may continue to recur. i have a fear of needles resulting from a particularly bad experience when a nurse tried to draw blood 13 times for a test and witnessing young colleagues suffering with vaccinations and blood streaming down their arm. it's not helped by pain experienced from any subsequent needle as it reinforces the initial phobic experience. it's the same with going to the dentist or a medical practice: i have entrenched negative experiences that are difficult to ameliorate when they keep getting repeated. imo, we are acutely sensitive to negative events and avoid those circumstances in future as a defense mechanism that evolved for our survival. correspondingly, positive experiences carry less weight. that is one of the reasons why desensitisation is so slow, because it takes many positive experiences to start to outweigh a single negative experience. if we do experience another negative experience, it generates a severe setback and may overwhelm any future desensitisation approach: that is why desensitisation must be rigidly controlled so that a negative reinforcement does not occur to derail the process. at least, this is how i view the process.",11,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"generalized anxiety disorder with generalized anxiety disorder, panic is not the predominant feature. many of the panic symptoms are present to a lesser degree. instead of brief moments of intense anxiety, the person feels symptoms throughout most of the day. although the specific manifestations of anxiety vary for each person, this chronic state of tension can affect 6 major systems of the body. 1. the cardiovascular system, anxiety increases the blood pressure, which causes tachycradia (rapid heartbeat), constriction of the blood vessels in the arms and legs, and dilation of the vessels surrounding the skeletal muscles. these changes produce symptoms of palpatations (an uncomfortable awareness of the heart rate), headaches, and cold fingers. 2. in the gastrointestinal system, anxiety leads to reduce salivary secretions, spasms within the esophagus (the hollow muscular tube leading from the nose and mouth to the stomach), causing spasms, diarrhea and/or constipation, and cramplike pains in the upper stomach. 3. in the respiratory system, anxiety leads to hyperventilation, or over breathing, which lowers the level of carbon dioxide in the blood, the symptoms of ""air hunger"", deep sighs, and pins and needles sensations. 4. in the genitourinary systems, the anxious person can experience the need for frequent urination. men may have difficulty maintaining an erection during intercourse; women may have difficulty becoming sexually aroused or achieving orgasm. 5. in the musculoskeletal system, the muscles become tense. involuntary trembling of the body, tension headaches, and other aches and pains may develop. 6. through the changes in the central nervous system, the anxious person is generally more apprehensive, aroused, and vigilant, feeling ""on edge"", impaitent, or irritable. he/she may complain of poor concentration, insomnia, and fatigue. there is often a fine line between the diagnosis of panic disorder and agoraphobia and that of generalized anxiety disorder. three features distinguish them. first, the symptoms themselves: if an individual is chronically anxious (he/she weould be with generalized anxiety disorder) and also experience episodes of panic, then panic disorder and agorphobia will be the more likely diagnosis. second, defferent kinds of fearful thoughts are associated with the 2 problems. in most people with generalized anxiety disorder the worries are about the kinds of interactions they will have with others: ""will i fail in this work setting?"" ""are they going to accept me?"" ""i'm afraid he's going to leave me."" ""what if they discover how little i know?"" ""i'll never perform ujp to their expectations."" with panic disorder or agoraphobia, the imagined response of others is secondary to the fear of personal catastrophe or loss of control, and the person's internal statements and questions reflect this apprehension: ""what if i faint [become hysterical, have a heart attack, cause a scene], and have people see me?"" the panic-prone person focuses more on her/his ability to be in 100% control of all her/his physical and mental capacities. the anxious person focuses more on her/his ability to cope with the expectations and responses of thos around him/her. possible physical symptoms during anxiety cardiovascular system tacycardia (rapid heartbeat) palpitations (uncomfortable awareness of the heart rate) headaches cold fingers gastrointestinal system dry mouth difficulty swallowing butterflies in the stomach gurgling sounds of gas in the intestines colon spasms diarrhea and/or constipation cramplike pains in the upper stomach respiratory system hyperventilation symptoms genitourinary system need for frequent urination difficulty maintaining an erection difficulty becoming sexually aroused or achieving orgasm (women) musculoskeletal system muscles tense involuntary trembling in the body tension headaches other aches and pains central nervous system apprehensive, aroused, and vigilant feeling ""on edge"", impatient, or irritable poor concentration insomnia fatigue the third difference has to do with the person's response to her/his fears. the anxious person thinks about withdrawing from the situations that increase her/his anxiety, and may procrastinate on performance tasks. the person with panic disorder or agoraphobia, on the other hand, is quick to use avoidance as a way to diminish discomfort. in a matter of days she/he will begin to identify the situations that are associated with the symptoms and determine how she/he can steer clear of them, immediately viewing avoidance as the single best solution to the problem.",17,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"social phobia social phobia is one of the more common anxiety disorders. it involves fear of embarrassment or humilitation in situations where you are exposed to the scrutiny of others or must perform. this fear is much stronger than the normal anxiety most nonphobic people experience in social or performance situations. usually it's so strong that it causes you to avoid the situation altogether, although some people with social phobia endure social situations, albeit with considerable anxiety. their concern is that they will say or do something that will cause others to judge them as being anxious, weak, ""crazy"", or stupid. the most common social phobia is fear of public speaking. it is the most common of all phobias and affects performers, speakers, people whose jobs require them to make presentations, and students who have to speak in front of their class. other common social phobias include: * fear of blushing in public. * fear of being watched at work. * fear of choking on or spilling food while eating in public. * fear of using public toilets. * fear of crowds. * fear of taking examinations. sometimes social phobia is less specific and involves a generalized fear of any social or group situation where you feel that you might be watched or evaluated. while social anxieties are common, you would be given a formal diagnosis of social phobia only if your avoidance interferes with work, social activities, or important relationships, and/or it causes you considerable distress. as with agoraphobia, panic attacks can accompany social phobia, although the panic is related more to being embarrassed or humiliated than to being confined or trapped. also the panic arises only in connection with a specific type of social situation. treatment for social phobia is often best carried out in a group setting.",19,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"what is a panic attack? a panic attack is a discreet period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes. the attacks are unexpected. we who suffer from panic attacks have great concern about having having additional attacks, about the implications of the attack or its consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, going crazy, dying) because the physical symptoms of panic attacks are so intense, many people who suffer from the attacks feel that the next step must be death. they often end up in hospital emergency rooms and are usually sent home still wondering what was wrong! we fear that the attack will last indefinitely, that we will never recover. in reality, most panic attacks peak within 10 minutes, and then subside. however, we feel so overwhelmed while in the midst of the attack that the few minutes it lasts seems to be forever. after, we ask this question, ""will it happen again?"" that thought haunts us. it's a horrible experience. we develop anticipatory anxiety, also known as fear of the fear. we fear not only the actual panic attack, but also anticipation of it. we think ""what if it happens again?"" the slightest physical symptom can set off waves of anticipation and cause fear of the fear. here are some fearful thoughts some people have during a panic attack: • fainting or collapsing in public • losing control of their body • becoming confused • having a heart attack or other physical illness • being trapped • causing a scene • going crazy • being unable to breathe • being unable to get home or to another ""safe place"" never forget there can be a recovery. effective treatment can eliminate much of the disorder, but it may be susceptible to occasional temporary relapses when you experience stress.",20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) can be a debilitating disorder with the following two anxiety-related essential features : obsessions : undesirable, recurrent, disturbing thoughts compulsions : repetitive or ritualized behaviors people with ocd experience unwanted obsessions, which cause anxiety. severe anxiety produces feelings of dread, worry, fright, and apprehension (see generalized anxiety disorder gad). certain behaviors are performed compulsively in an attempt to lessen this anxiety. although they realize their obsessions are excessive and their behavior is unreasonable, they feel powerless to control either. in fact, their symptoms can overwhelm them and result in severe impairment and dysfunction, which can begin at an early age. incidence and prevalence the national institute for mental health reports that about 3% of people in the united states have ocd. typical age of onset for boys is 6 to 15, while for women it is often later, between 20 and 30. risk factors like genetic predisposition and environmental stress contribute to ocd. also, ocd is more common among people of higher education, iq, and socioeconomic status. men and women, however, are affected equally. though its course is chronic and usually lasts a lifetime, it is treatable with medication, behavioral therapy, and, in extremely rare cases, brain surgery. risk factors risk factors for obsessive-compulsive disorder include the following: genetics postpartum periods environmental stressors although there is no clear genetic evidence, obsessive-compulsive disorder tends to run in families. a person with ocd has a 25% chance of having a blood relative who has it. like other mental illnesses, it is more prevalent among identical twins than fraternal. there is a 70% chance that identical twins with share it, and a 50% chance for fraternal twins. currently, researchers do not understand ocd’s genetic mechanisms, though they suspect multiple genes are involved. women with ocd may experience a worsening of symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum . a recent study suggests that fluctuating hormones may trigger symptoms during pregnancy. the same study reports ocd in 30% of women observed. the arrival of a baby brings new responsibility, a new set of concerns, and changes in routine. while normal reaction to a newborn may include some anxiety, postpartum ocd features disturbing thoughts and excessive behavior regarding the baby’s well-being. the following obsessions and compulsions are common: obsession fear of contaminating the baby compulsion [ repeatedly washing the baby obsession need for reassurances compulsion repetitively calling the physician obsession recurrent fear for the baby's safety compulsion incessantly checking the baby obsession recurrent thoughts of bad mothering compulsion incessantly checking the baby obsession recurrent thoughts of harming baby compulsion avoiding or neglecting the baby obsession ""thoughts of disturbed order"" compulsion ordering and rearranging baby's crib these feelings and behaviors may occur immediately, but often begin 4 to 6 weeks after giving birth. treatment is necessary to control symptoms and to ensure care of the baby. environmental stressors that can worsen ocd symptoms include the following: abuse changes in living situation illness occupational changes or problems relationship concerns school-related problems causes biological factors involving brain structure and activation are associated with ocd. abnormalities of the frontal lobes, basal ganglia, and cingulum are common in people with ocd. basal ganglia are involved in routine behaviors, like grooming, and the frontal lobes in organizing behaviors and in planning. the cingulum consists of fibrous bands that assist in communicating the brain’s behavioral and emotional messages. support for its role in ocd is the fact that surgical severing of the cingulum has relieved and even cured people with the disorder. the serotonin hypothesis an abnormally low level of serotonin is perhaps the most well-established link between the brain and ocd. serotonin is a chemical neurotransmitter that transmits information from one nerve to another throughout the brain. it is released by one synapse(nerve ending), crosses a gap, and is picked up by another synapse. after a message is sent, enzymes in the brain clean serotonin out of the synapses. drugs used to treat ocd, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), increase and sustain serotonin levels and reduce or eliminate symptoms.",23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"there are over 275 types of specific phobias that are listed according to some sources. in order to qualify for the diagnosis of a specific phobia, the person must have an excessive and unreasonable fear due to the presence or anticipation of a specific object or situation; exposure to the stimulus causes an anxiety response; the sufferer realizes that the fear is excessive or unreasonable; and, the avoidance of or distress due to the stimuli causes impairment in functioning. (isolated) phobias these are phobias restricted to highly specific situations such as proximity to particular animals, heights, thunder, darkness, flying, closed spaces, urinating or defecating in public toilets, eating certain foods, dentistry, the sight of blood or injury, and the fear of exposure to specific diseases. although the triggering situation is discrete, contact with it can evoke panic as in agoraphobia or social phobias. specific phobias usually arise in childhood or early adult life and can persist for decades if they remain untreated. the seriousness of the resulting handicap depends on how easy it is for the sufferer to avoid the phobic situation. fear of the phobic situation tends not to fluctuate, in contrast to agoraphobia. radiation sickness and venereal infections and, more recently, aids are common subjects of disease phobias. diagnostic guidelines all of the following should be fulfilled for a definite diagnosis: the psychological or autonomic symptoms must be primary manifestations of anxiety, and not secondary to other symptoms such as delusion or obsessional thought; the anxiety must be restricted to the presence of the particular phobic object or situation; and the phobic situation is avoided whenever possible. includes: acrophobia animal phobias claustrophobia examination phobia simple phobia differential diagnosis it is usual for there to be no other psychiatric symptoms, in contrast to agoraphobia and social phobias. blood-injury phobias differ from others in leading to bradycardia and sometimes syncope, rather than tachycardia. fears of specific diseases such as cancer, heart disease, or venereal infection should be classified under hypochondriacal disorder, unless they relate to specific situations where the disease might be acquired. if the conviction of disease reaches delusional intensity, the diagnosis should be delusional disorder. individuals who are convinced that they have an abnormality or disfigurement of a specific bodily (often facial) part, which is not objectively noticed by others (sometimes termed dysmorphophobia), should be classified under hypochondriacal disorder or delusional disorder, depending upon the strength and persistence of their conviction.",24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"my personal anxiety survival guide hello, i have never been to therapy but just wanted to share the methods i've come up with over the years for managing my anxiety. maybe they can help someone. my anxiety manifests in what i call ""episodes"". an episode usually lasts a number of weeks and always has a ""focus"" - a thought or worry that's actually causing the anxiety. this state of ""being anxious"" is so distinct to me and feels so different from any other of my mental states that i can pinpoint the moment an episode begins usually to within a few seconds, and i can pinpoint when it ends to within a few days (the recovery is more gradual than the onset). the most obvious symptom is the obsessive thought, the focus, that just will not leave my head even for one second. sometimes this thought ""mutates"" over time, almost like a virus evolving to get past your immune system, keeping me feeling anxious even when i thought i'd come to grips with the original problem. i think these methods help me limit the duration of my episodes, and also keep me feeling less anxious during them. 1. the anxiety is unproductive if you're anxious over something that you can do something about, like a deadline or a decision, the best thing to do is to tackle the problem. but otherwise, remember that the anxiety is useless. there is no reason to feel guilty about wanting the anxiety to stop. you're not ""running"" from something. 2. you are not running, you are putting it away temporarily it may well be that there are some decisions that need to be made about whatever you're anxious about, or some genuine thinking that you need to do. but now is not the time! you need to put the fire out in your kitchen before you starting trying to redecorate it! trying to engage with this thought in your current state will be a net negative in the extreme, for every 1% of genuine progress you make on the issue you will suffer 99% setbacks in your overall productivity and well being. you are simply putting this thought away until a time where you can think about it without it triggering panic - that will be the correct time to deal with it. 2. it's not your job to stop being anxious the immediate problem you have is this thought bouncing around in your head constantly. you cannot stop thinking about something by sheer force of will (quick! don't think of a blue elephant). it has been on your mind a lot lately, and so it will continue to be on your mind a lot for a little while, because that is how the mind works. you have to treat this like having a cold. when you have a sore throat, you don't think to yourself that you have to find a way to make the pain stop right now. you just say wow, this sucks, and get on with it. your job is not to stop feeling anxious. every minute that passes that you still feel anxious is not a failure. each time the anxious thought pops into your head again even though you promised you'd stop thinking about it is not a failure. 3. your job is to continue to be productive and live your life just like when you have a cold, all you can ask of yourself is that you continue to be productive in whatever sense is meaningful to you. you are not trying to ""make it stop"", you are trying to respond to it as healthily as possible. 4. ease off the gas, but don't take your foot off the accelerator you are allowed to drop certain responsibilities to make your life easier! just try to do so in a somewhat disciplined and controlled way. if you go to the gym, continue going - but maybe drop your least favorite exercise, or cut your routine down to a ""maintenance"" routine. if you normally avoid snacks, let yourself pick up a chocolate bar on the way home from work every day. drop some of your less urgent chores. 5. soothing, not distraction try to distinguish between things that merely distract you and things that soothe you. distraction keeps your brain occupied but ends up making you feel worse. soothing makes you feel genuinely better, if only a little. the two main things that are soothing for me are taking a walk in daylight, and talking to someone who loves me (about anything, not necessarily the anxiety, although it helps if they at least know you're feeling anxious). repetitive video games, say, are only distracting (to me). one sign that something is actually soothing is that you may find that, while doing it, although your thoughts circle back to your anxiety, they are sometimes tinged with a little more hope and positivity than usual. 6. just stop thinking about it when you notice that you're thinking about it, don't feel guilty, don't feel like you failed, but do stop thinking about it. switch to something else. of course, it will still be in the back of your mind as you try to do this. that's fine. just focus on something else. 7. but sometimes, thinking about it is okay sometimes, your brain finds an angle on the anxiety that it may genuinely be useful to let it pursue for a little while. a good sign that this is the case is if (1) it's genuinely a new angle that you hadn't considered before, and (2) it makes you feel better, not worse. often i find i stumble upon these new thoughts while walking. if it feels okay to you, let yourself pursue the new line of thought until you've exhausted it or it's starting to degrade into negative thoughts again. 7. don't hate your anxiety hedgehogs are anxious too, and it's served them well. evolution creates anxious individuals for a reason, you just need to learn how to harness it productively.",25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"3 months after stopping an antipsychotic (zyprexa) hi, i used to suffer from acute anxiety and panic attacks. i tried various anxiety medications, but none provided relief. my psychiatrist suggested trying an antipsychotic (zyprexa), which finally gave me 100% relief from anxiety. i continued taking zyprexa for 4 years, but it also caused emotional numbness. after 4 years, i couldn't tolerate the emotional numbness anymore, so i decided to stop the medication. with the help of my psychiatrist, i tapered off it slowly. it has been 3 months since i completely stopped the medication, but my anxiety hasn't returned, and the emotional numbness persists. it feels as if i'm still taking the medication. does this mean that zyprexa caused permanent changes to my brain? can i ever overcome this emotional numbness? could you please provide some insight into this situation? your help would be greatly appreciated.",26,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

""don't avoid going out with them, keep going out and the anxiety will go away!"" would be the usual type of advice. however, it turns out that it was a toxic group of friends! sometimes taking another kind of action - cutting the ""friends"" out of my life in this case - is the right thing to do. in other cases it may be appropriate to take small steps and not rush things too much and get overwhelmed, if possible.",29,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

""you're overreacting"" ""you're too sensitive"" ""omg, you're so stupid... i think i felt a little better once i started comparing myself to other celebrities when i was like 12 or 13. like when nicole kidman got with keith urban. he was my celebrity crush, and she was an actress who i really liked and i felt i resembled (not as beautiful, but similar characteristics). i always said my crush throughout school looked just like him, and when they got together, i felt relieved like somehow ""my kind"" wasn't completely hopeless lol of course a lot has changed since then, life and trauma ya know? but i remember how exciting that was for me as well as probably them. even though i never got with my crush (an later it went away), i was so happy (weird i know). not ashamed to admit i hated being what people call ""ginger"" lol it seems stupid to most, but it's more than that. my hair was more strawberry blonde than red, but it had more to do with my skin being ""pasty"" and ""sickly""...and i had bad teeth (maybe genetics or the fact that my depression caused me to let myself go sometimes). i was always very envious when other girls could tan and cover up all their ""problems"" (stretch marks, under eye bags, etc). i hate aging because for me, it happens so fast compared to other people because due to my skin tone the signs of it are very obvious when it happens and no tan to cover it up. nothing wrong with aging, but premature aging (feels like you lost half your life and confidence in your youth). not to mention i'm very sensitive, so when my mother took me to the dentist when i was 17, and the dentist told me i had 8 cavities, i had a meltdown and thought i was losing all my teeth and refused to go back and pretty much gave up on them. it was nice the dentist told me the truth, but also made it to where i ""abandoned all hope"" lol after that there was no dental care for adults, at least not the amount for what it would cost to properly fix them that i could still afford. i was however able to get a student loan a couple years later for classes at an online for-profit university ($20,000 for like 6 classes) that there was no way i would be able to graduate from because i was a jr high drop out, but everyone said we needed to go to college and get a better job....so. i have dentures now so it doesn't matter anyways. just wanted to share because i hoped someone would see so they could understand how maybe not just i feel, but other people like me possibly younger are going through. what's it's like, ya know? this is not to make anyone going through the same things, feel worse about themselves, but i keep hoping if i spam enough, maybe someone will care lol btw ""ginger"" women are very beautiful when they are taken care of, and their health considered just like other people's, and hopefully other people who feel that way who aren't ""ginger"" lol i just want people to see from my point of view about how self esteem correlates to paranoia and stress...anxiety issues. -- wed sep 07, 2022 8:20 pm -- so is this gad or is this body dysmorphia or what? i'm diagnosed gad and bipolar. but most of my anxiety really stems from not feeling attractive or feeling ugly or inferior. like ""why bother"" if the world is the way it is? how do you get over this kind of anxiety? because i really don't feel there's a doctor on earth that could fix it lol at least not with some weird vaccine or microchip that controls my thoughts like a robot. -- wed sep 07, 2022 8:21 pm -- i also have severe anxiety about intelligence and other things, so it's not just looks...it's everything lol",41,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

scared of needles if your friend still hasn't had his blood work done i would recommend he get a small prescription of klonopin or other benzo just for the blood draw ahead of time. i absolutely hate blood tests and have nearly passed out on more than one occasion. taking a benzo beforehand will calm him down. also lying down will help rather than sitting in a chair. if pain of the needle is also an issue you can put a numbing cream on the vein beforehand as well or ask the office if they have a cold spray that briefly numbs the area. i havent had a test since 2016 but know i probably need to get updated bloodwork. i hate it too but it can be bearable.,54,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
scared of needles i also hate needles. the best thing you can do is drink lots of water beforehand and if you don’t like the feeli g get numbing patches for your arm. if you feel sick or faint after tell them and you should lie down with your feel up against a wall so the blood stays in your head.,55,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"school stresses me out way more than usual tw: s**cide, self-harm, anxiety, depression hello. i just found this website and thought it might be good to get my feelings out. i was not sure where to put this post since it fits under several different topics so i put it here. anyways, the title. school is stressing me out way more than usual. like, to an ""unreasonable"" degree. given, it's not just school stressing me out, but that's usually what i tell other people because i don't want to get down into the nitty-gritty. for example, if i have a bunch of homework one night i'll get a big panic attack or suicidal thoughts and usually break down in my closet so not to be in front of anyone. i'm in 10th grade, btw. this sort of stuff has been going on for more than a year (ever since covid started) and it's still not better. in fact, i would say things are getting worse. i now have delusions too, like how my thoughts might be controlled by some outside force or that nothing is real. i sleep way longer than i used to, but often my sleep is interrupted by nightmares. i thought things would get better, because about a year ago i also started seeing a therapist, then taking anti-depressants. my dosage has been increased three times and i still don't feel better. i also take an as-needed anxiety medication that i barely use because it makes me feel even more exhausted. i would tell my counselor about all this but i feel that her advice isn't really helpful and i have trouble talking about sensitive things. my throat tightens and i can't speak. i have had several ""bouts"" of suicidal thoughts in the past, and self harmed occasionally as well. although, i'm not sure if i should contact the text line because i am suicidal, just not sure if i actually will follow through, but it wouldn't take a lot of convincing either way. if you have read this far, thank you, and please give me some advice if you have any.",56,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"prescriptions and supply chain problems i get anxious in a car. that anxiety escalates when i'm sandwiched between two vehicles, or we are in a left-turn lane, and i'm sitting on the right side of the car. i can remedy the second situation by sitting on the left side of the vehicle behind the driver. that way, i'm next to the center medium, putting a bit of distance between me and other cars. i'm in a no-win situation if we are in the left turn lane and there is no center medium. i take 0.25 mg clonazepam four times a day and 10 mg propranolol twice a day, sometimes three times if needed. i've also been taking lorazepam as needed. dosage varies between 0.5 to 2 mg, depending on the severity of the situation. if i'm in heavy traffic, i will take 2 mg of lorazepam, 10 mg propranolol, and 125 mg of simethicone (otc anti-gas). i live in an area where good psychiatric care has been hard to find. therefore i had to go to the county psychiatric facility (which does not prescribe controlled medications such as clonazepam and lorazepam) for my other psychiatric prescriptions and get my clonazepam and lorazepam from my primary care doctor. the powers that be have been cracking down on general practice doctors who prescribe both clonazepam and lorazepam. i had to find a psychiatrist who would prescribe controlled medications. in addition, i've experienced a particularly rough spell since around may or june in which i needed to eat into my reserves. found a new doctor who i first saw on the ninth of this month. she gave me 10 mg escitalopram once a day and will either reduce or eliminate the lorazepam. for the road trip to see her this coming thursday, she told me to take 1 mg of clonazepam instead of the 2 mg of lorazepam. the escitalopram, which i will have been for two weeks, should already be doing its job. i know i have established a lot to get to the problem, but here it is. i keep my ear to the ground to know what will happen. however, what was once theoretical is happening as i speak. we have inflation that is being downplayed (in other words, it's worse than what the powers that be are revealing) and a supply chain problem. what do i do when it's hard or impossible to get my medications? i already mentioned that i had to eat into my supplies during my current rough spell. also, i just started on a new prescription, meaning i won't have a reserve if the current problem manifests sooner than later. i can get some of my medications overseas at an affordable price, such as propranolol, but there is no way to get controlled prescriptions, and the mirtazapine is too expensive. i haven't checked the price or availability of the new medication.",57,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"feel weird being alive itself? severe anxiety because of it? for some reason, 4 months ago, i started thinking about life's existence. like why we are here, ect. i would continue to deep think, and then that caused really strong depersonalization and derealization. then, every day i would wake up and start thinking about that weird feeling, and i got into this cycle where i felt weird so much that i felt strange *being alive*. i started feeling super-conscious and super-aware of my own existence, and i started asking myself these weird questions like am i really a human? is life all a game? and then, i became a solipsist!

"i'm 32 years old and work in an office job that requires me to constantly talk with people face-to-face in meetings. over the past 12-24 months, i've developed a speech impediment whereby i spit while talking. almost without fail, everyone i speak to starts wiping their face while i talk. its incredibly embarrassing and i feel horrible. it makes me think twice before speaking up in a meeting and its really affecting my job and professional relationships. it happens whenever i speak to someone who is closer than 2-3 meters from me. if they are 3+ metres away i feel more confident and i speak more normally. this also happens with my close friends. the only people who i don't spit on while talking are my absolute closest family members (wife, daughter, mum, brother). everyone else cops it. i've done the typical google searches and people say to slow down your speech etc. however, i've tried everything from speaking slowly and speaking quickly, loudly and softly. nothing works. this has started happening at a point in my life where i actually know what i'm talking about at work. i've got a good 12 years experience in the industry. however, this impediment is really holding me back. it seems to be a vicious cycle of spitting while i talk, so i talk softer and appear less confident. feeling less confident makes me struggle to speak properly. does anyone have any thoughts or advice?",60,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"thank you so much for your response. over the past few years since my last reply, my psychologist and i also dig deeper and came to a similar conclusion that you did. it was a thought that triggered an anxiety response. we’ve spent some time getting to the bottom of my feelings of low self worth, how they started through childhood (i had a great childhood, and my parents never meant any intentional harm, but not being behaviourists didn’t know how to meet my needs and so i learnt to cope with their inconsistent emotional availability in whatever ways i could at the time). for those still with this battle, look up generational trauma and start working through it (working through schemas with my psychologist was a crucial first step to understanding feelings of abandonment which possibly led to low self worth which possibly led to social anxiety). there is absolutely a way through this. we tend to hone all of our intention to the one symptom of anxiety (spitting) and the thought directly before it (“oh no i’m going to spit because they’re standing too close to me) and miss the much broader picture that it’s potentially life long coping mechanisms that have been unnoticed and untreated for most of our lives which thus worsened to symptoms we do finally take notice of. good luck everyone, you’ve all got this",67,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"checking emotional response anxiety- can anyone relate? i don't know whether this is due to my pure oiocd, but it’s something i have struggled to understand why i feel this way. it also feels so insignificant compared to other ocd worries that i even feel a bit silly to say it out loud. i have always loved following england at football. some of my best memories are watching them in tournaments, and the trials and tribulations that came with it. something odd occurred in 2010 where i think i subconsciously checked how excited i was when england scored. i didn’t think anything of it, until we got through to the latter stages of the tournament. we were paired with our biggest rivals germany. what would normally come with excitement and anticipation came with some sense of anxiety about not feeling that way about it. the following years watching england, for some reason when england came to nearly scoring, i would feel slightly anxious about how i will react, which would make me not enjoy the moment. i would check others response and feel a bit jealous how they reacted. roll on to 2018 world cup. i think for the first time in that period of time, i over thought it less, and enjoyed the tournament more. i got the feels back big time. however, for one of the games i was ill and couldn’t go out to watch it. when i watched it at home i felt like i was missing out, so when england scored i celebrated, but it felt a bit hollow. i was better for the semi-final and went out to watch it. when england scored first, i had that slight anxiety feeling, which made me not enjoy how i would normally. we eventually lost that game, and where i would normally be gutted, i didn’t really feel anything. roll on to this tournament and it feels rife. every time england look like they’re going to score, i feel a bit anxious, which makes me not be how i would normally be at a game. it makes me feel sad that i am not enjoying the moment how i should be. this has been off the back of a bit of a relapse in some other ocd related issues. i just want to relax and enjoy the football and not have this weird anxiety about checking how i should be feeling when celebrating. against i am feeling jealous of seeing how others are reacting. it feels so irrational, but i am struggling to break out the habit. obvs having ocd means i am questioning and doubting whether i even really like watching england now. however, i know this not to be real. i understand in the grand scheme of things this feels very inconsequential compared to other themes, however because this means so much to me, it really affects me. anyone relate to this? i have read somewhere about a type of ocd where you check your emotional response to events, and this can affect how you feel about things.",71,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"my therapist tried to brain wash me i'm not a professional but here are my thoughts. there are some similarities between brain washing and behavioral health therapy, in my opinion. the idea a lot of the time is to get you, or whomever is in therapy, to change the way they think. for example, if you are like me and have harsh negative thoughts about yourself and want to change the way you treat yourself, if that makes sense. also, noticing the things around you is a common way to ground yourself during an anxiety attack, taking you out of the attack and back into the world by way of taking note of your surroundings. licking the lips could be an unconscious response to your recounts of sexual experiences, as this, along with such things as biting the lip are consistent with body language present when thinking about sexual things. granted i think your therapist should probably be aware of those behaviors and how they make you feel, but they are sometimes unconscious behaviors. and i do think it's rude of him to check the time constantly and yawn when you speak, but you never really know what is driving a person and their actions. perhaps he is anxious about an upcoming event or didn't have time to grab his morning coffee. does this happen often during your sessions? i have anxiety as well and i know it is very easy to look into stuff like this. i am not in your shoes and will not tell you that you are wrong, but things are not always as they seem, especially with anxiety. if you feel that you are being brainwashed, perhaps look into seeing a different therapist.",90,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"i have burning questions that require extinguishing dear psychforumers, i've been having a lot of trouble and, i know this is not a place for a diagnosis ... but i'd like to at least narrow down what my problem may be. in the interest of time, here's an itemized list detailing in chronological order my history of issues. [*]i began experiencing symptoms of ocd at a very young age - one incident involved me having an intrusive thought about breaking something expensive of my mother's that she treasured. i didn't want to and it caused me a lot of distress wondering why the thought crossed me mind. i was eventually convinced - with a little help - that it must be the chatter of demonic persuasion. [*]when i was thirteen, my dad had a heart attack in front of me at six flags and was in a coma for a week. two years later, i began having severe panic attacks (the kind where i thought i'd been poisoned or was dying - i didn't know what panic attacks were). they've all bun subsided, at least the ones with that level of severity. [*]recently, reflecting on my life, i've come to the conclusion that i've been manipulative and self-serving on a lot of occasions. when one incident or another comes into my mind, my stomach sinks like a stone. i feel i've treated people in some pretty heinous ways as a means to and end. a lot of the time - not all - i was unaware that the thing i did was inappropriate. [*]i'm twenty six now. i have no job and hardly ever have had - two weeks was the longest position i've held. my education was arrested in the fifth grade because i ""performed poorly."" i was supposed to be home schooled but that never materialized. i've never kissed anyone. well, i've never kissed anyone and not ###$ up enough to leave myself unembarrassed. i have trouble talking to people of my own age. trouble maintaining friendships. don't know the first thing about flirting. i'm gay so that makes it a bit more unclear how i'm suppose to interact. oh, yeah, and all this has led me to self-medicate (weed... alcohol... y'all know the drill). i've tried to spare as few details as possible. based on what i've told you here, did anything stand out to you as, ""oh, it's probably this?"" i can't seek counseling at this time and i'm not using this as a substitute. i just want to get a little closer to finding some answers. any help along that journey would be greatly appreciated. thank you so much for reading my message. i look forward to hearing from you all.",122,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"fear and anxiety when talking to people hi hotpepper. it sounds to me like your anxiety is connected to the traumatic event/s you described with your previous employer. it’s great that you have already introspected and found part of the problem. in your conscious mind, you understand that he was a poor people manager. you said that he expected things from you without proper explanation, and when you did the correct thing of asking for clarification; he yelled at you and made you feel useless and inferior. this reflects on his poor management skills, and not in any way on your ability or worth. the next step will be to convince your subconscious brain of this, i.e., to genuinely recover your self-esteem. *mod edit* is an interesting article i found on the way we talk to ourselves in our minds, and the impact this has on our self-esteem. take note of the conversations you have with yourself before a social gathering. are they positive or negative? are you reinforcing these anxious thoughts by criticizing yourself even further? if so, make it a habit to speak only kindness and love to yourself (even if you sometimes feel you don’t deserve it). when a negative thought enters your mind, combat it with something like: i am confident, smart and worthy. only good will come from today’s interactions. as i embrace socializing, i will learn and grow every single day. in time, your brain will start to give you these messages and healthy thoughts automatically. i hope this helps and all the best with your journey! last edited by snaga on wed dec 05, 2018 10:26 pm, edited 1 time in total. reason: link removed",126,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
fear and anxiety when talking to people there can be many reasons to feel anxious to talk to people may be you could be nervous of what they will say or that you will say something wrong. i would say don't be afraid . you have to talk to get to know others and you could even make some new friends. also do meditation in the morning which will give you inner peace and confidence.,127,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"electrical feeling? anxiety related? when a social situation gets especially intense, like someone is angry, yelling, or showing extreme emotion (crying hysterically) i get this feeling i can only describe as being overloaded with electricity. i feel like i’m an electrically charged tuning rod that’s literally crackling with energy. it makes me feel like i’m going to explode and i start to shake all over. then—this is going to sound like i’m loony—it feels like what i can only describe as an “other” takes possession of my body and responds to the situation in whatever way necessary to return the emotional intensity into equilibrium. for example, i feel this electricity when i am in a group and someone starts talking and everyone else ignores the person. then, even if i don’t want to, i respond to the person being ignored. another example, recently, my friend was road raging on a group of construction workers to their faces. i started smiling at them and waving even though i knew it’d make us look weird. after we drove off my friend said “you’re too nice you just made me look insane!” and i didn’t want to do that! but the electrical intensity of her outrage was so intense for me i had to diffuse it somehow. what the heck is this? am i insane? when i google about this all i keep finding are web md articles about social anxiety zaps. this is not the same. it isn’t a zap, the intense electrical feeling flows throughout my entire body.",128,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"unusual trigger - please help! hello. something has been weighing heavily on my mind over the last few days, and it's triggered my anxiety. this is based off of something i recently read. i have a fairly high iq, and i know it's ridiculous, but it's a worry nonetheless. maybe someone here can help. my concern is that our consciousness dies in our sleep and is replaced by a copy. at first, i thought that couldn't be the case due to dreams and brain waves that are recorded during sleep studies. but then i read that's not enough evidence for consciousness to continue while we sleep. they said that dreams could just be memories with the illusion of consciousness when we awaken. so on to my question. are brainwaves and dreams proof that our consciousness doesn't die during sleep? help is much appreciated. thank you.",129,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"feeling very sick hello...i have never posted in a forum before, but i am feeling that i must ask questions that i have in my mind in hopes someone can offer feedback. i'm nearly in tears so here goes. i have been on and off with benzos, xanax, valium, and klonopin. i have always been so nervous that i would take them nearly every day, sometimes more than i'm suppose to and would often gain a tolerance. recently, i was placed back on klonopin after discussing with my doctor my feelings about my xanax no longer working... i felt as though after an hour passed by i would start feeling sick and anxious. i thought maybe i had developed a high tolerance and was going through withdrawal... so i was back on klonopin. i haven't been taking it for about a week, and started up again 3 days ago. i know that klonopin is longer lasting, so withdrawals wouldn't begin right away, however, after about an hour i would feel anxious and break out into a sweat. i started to increase the dose until i was calm, and still an hour later i would feel those horrible feelings... is it possible that i am feeling klonopin withdrawal so soon? i have never went any higher than what i was taking... i really don't know what's going on with me and i'm so miserable. maybe its something else? please, if anyone has any advice i'm all ears... also, i was wondering, i'm prescribed seroquel. i have been off it for a few days (it makes me hungry) could that be causing these sick feelings? if i start taking it again would they subside and would i be able to take seroquel and not rely so much on the klonopin? i’m also prescribed adderall, a very low dose. 10mg but i break it in half for 5mg. i noticed when it wears off i don’t feel well and when i take the klonopin it doesn’t help. when i use to take xanax it would relax me more. would my doctor put me back on xanax if i asked him before if i could go on klonopin, because the xanax tolerance went up? maybe it went down? i don’t know how it works thank you so much for allowing me to share my feelings and ask my questions. i would appreciate any feedback.",132,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"gad, mdd or add? a therapist that i was seeing with my wife for marital suggested to me that i might have add, based on some of the problems i told her i was facing at work. i did some research, some reading and answered a few online questionnaires, and had some discussions with my family doctor and with a local psychiatrist. based on those discussions and on my reading and personal research, everything points to me having add or inattentive type adhd (i don't have much of the h symptoms): i have difficulties staying engaged in work discussions and meetings, keeping track of tasks at work, as well as paperwork and bills at home, i am very forgetful, i get distracted very easily, always start grandiose projects and plans but never seem to finish them, and i am very disorganized at home, my car and at my work desk. at work (i'm a developer), i'm often capable of figuring high level conceptual problems and discussing complex abstract solutions, but i do poorly and get into frequent trouble because i am slow and sloppy, and frequently get blocked on small details and simple mistakes. many of these symptoms i remember struggling with since my late teens, but they have gotten much worse in the last couple of years (i'm 40). several people have told that for some people medication really helps. in fact some described it to me as ""it's like having your glasses off, and then putting them on: everything becomes very clear and obvious."" the psychiatrist i was seeing didn't want to put me on medication before i had a formal psychological test. the psychologist who tested me said that i definitely don't have on add, based on my results. he tested me for math skills, memory and vocabulary - basically he was saying my iq was too high for someone with add. but instead that i likely have general anxiety disorder or major depression disorder (he mentioned the word 'anhedonia'). the thing is, i don't usually feel sad, or suicidal or anything like that - although i do feel down from time to time, i feel it is mostly driven by my failures at work and my constant underachievement more than anything else. he insisted that my test results were not consistent with someone with add, and that moreover add improves with age, whereas in my case my symptoms seem to be getting worse. he also mentioned that gad and mdd can have cognitive and functional consequences similar to what i have, and that most likely i will need cbt, not medication, to address my problems. am at loss. my problems at work have always been there (since my days in school) and they are now getting to the point where they are endangering my job. every single second hand and first hand description of add i've had describes my own life perfectly, and i thought i had finally arrived at the root cause of my perpetual underachievement. i thought all i had to do was seek treatment and i would be able to get it. yet the psychologist disagrees and now it seems like i am headed for several more months of therapy and discussions with psychiatrists before i know what to do. what can i do? is the psychologist right? does high iq and math ability contradict an add diagnosis? if so, why do i identify so squarely with the symptoms of add? what can i do? i am getting desperate",133,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

(that's another analogy i've heard: with medication, it's like the radio station you're trying to broadcast is suddenly tuned to the right frequency and you don't have a lot of static to try to get past.) did you have symptoms as a young child also? they may not have interfered with school, but were you a daydreamer, forgetful about chores, etc? i think you need to have had symptoms before age 12. and it's also not true that it improves with age. it can improve, but plenty of adults have enough symptoms to cause impairment. i read somewhere that after one's teens, one third of people with adhd get better, one third stay the same, and one third get worse. the diagnosis isn't made by psychological testing alone--self report measures and reports from family members (your wife, for example) are a key part of the assessment. as long as you meet the criteria in the dsm v and there isn't anything else going on, that's how the diagnosis is made. did this psychologist have expertise in adult adhd? based on what your account of what happened, i would be very surprised if you said he did. a psychiatrist with experience in treating adhd can make the diagnosis (usually these are psychiatrists who also have training in child and adolescent psychiatry)--it often isn't necessary to have formal testing done unless you want accommodations and need ""proof"" that you have it. that's my understanding, anyway. i would say to trust your instincts and your research, and find a professional with the specific expertise that you need. they are out there.

"can someone tell me if this is general anxiety or social? i met a man on a dating app a few weeks ago and we were supposed to meet for a date this weekend. everyday he texts me in the morning and a little bit throughout the day, but we mostly talked at night. today i texted him this morning and he never responded, which is not normal. all day i was really worried, nervous, anxious, on the verge of tears, even my stomach felt like it was in knots and i had no appetite and had to force myself to eat lunch (usually i’m starving), and i felt like i would puke or had to constantly use the toilet even though i knew i didn’t really have to.

(i’ve never had a relationship before and i’m almost 31 so that’s why i was thinking that.) why is he ignoring me? i’ve never ignored him... finally in the late afternoon, i couldn’t take these feelings anymore and i texted him. i saw he was active on social media throughout the day so that added to the anxiety. i was upset at this point, i felt like it was rude to ignore someone that long, especially when i don’t ignore him. so i said that was immature. and he responded with: what are you talking about? now my brain just can’t understand his point of view. didn’t he see the text? didn’t he know he ignored it? didn’t he know that he’s never done that before? so now it feels like i’m the wrong one here, although i wasn’t the rude one, he was. now i feel like i need help for anxiety. i shouldn’t have to feel this way all day long over someone who might not care anymore. is this social anxiety because it’s about a “relationship” and communication or is it general anxiety? and do i need medication or therapy?",137,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"fear is ruining my life - please help my life has been really awful. for a long time, i was a complete failure. i had no friends, terrible relationships with my family, dropped out of high school because of anxiety, terrible self esteem, no job. everything was awful. over time, i got better. i got my ged and went back to school, started getting great grades, made great friends, got great jobs. even when things weren't great-- when i was struggling, suffering, or having other problems with mental health and self worth-- for years now, the one thing i've always been happy with and proud of is how well i've been doing with work and school. i have three amazing jobs in a very competitive field and have a great gpa. this has become such a huge part of my identity, my ability to do well in those areas. it has come to mean everything to me. but now it's all falling apart. every part of my life has been tainted by this horrible mental anguish and exhaustion and anxiety i feel every day lately. i stopped going to classes this semester because i just couldn't leave my house anymore. started to isolate from my friends, telling them not to talk to me, ignoring their pleas to connect. now we're talking again, but every interaction just makes me want to cry. the more i talk to people i love, the worse i feel, and the more i break down and push them away with my crazy ######6 behavior. and for a while, even all of that was okay, because i thought i was still doing well at work, still doing okay in school when i went for tests. but at some point, even that stopped. after years and years of dedicated, non-stop school work and professional work, it's all falling apart. i've started to get terrible, failing grades in all my classes. zeros from absences, and from not handing things in. terrible test grades. i've gotten second chances from so many professors, and still end up failing because i don't take them. i just cant do anything i want to do anymore. every time i go into work, i can't do anything. i can barely get anywhere on time. i'm always rushing around at the last minute, or arriving late, and have been spoken to about my bad attendance at one job recently. i have never been spoken to for *any* disciplinary reason at *any* job before. last week, i went to work and had to leave early and had to have my coworker drive me home because i was so depressed and anxious and generally out of it (dissociative?) i could barely understand where i was or what i was doing. when i didn't feel like i was going to pass out, i felt like i was going to break down and sob hysterically. i felt so out of it and confused that i genuinely thought i may have had a focal seizure or something. my brain just stopped working all of the sudden. at another job, i straight up did not do something i was supposed to do.. and i don't even know why i didn't do it. i have no clue. it was an important thing, and i just didn't do it. and then this week, at that same job, i put something off for three days, and every day i was asked to do it, i said i would do it. and then, i didn't. and i didn't even explain why, or asked to put it off. i just didn't do it. and finally, at the job i care about the most, i slept through my ######6 shift this morning. i woke up 10 minutes before i had to be there to *teach a class*, and had to call and have someone there stop what they were doing to, at the very last minute, teach for me. cover me. because i can't even wake up on time anymore, when people really need me. i'm a ######6 disaster. i'm ######6 garbage. now, it's 3:00 am, and i have a final at 9:00, and i just can't do my ######6 work. i can't. i can't do it. i'm so scared. i'm so panicked. i am failing and i don't know what to do. this class talked to me about my attendance weeks ago, and yet i still have not gone in since spring break. i don't even know if the final is actually tomorrow. i just think it is, based on the schedule. but i don't know for sure because i haven't even been in ######6 class. i don't know how to handle this. i am so ######6 scared. i have fallen so far behind in everything that i don't even know how to fix it anymore. the idea of sitting here and studying for this exam i have in 5 hours feels so overwhelming it makes me want to cry, because studying means i'll have to face exactly how much i've ###$ up and how much i've fallen behind. and how little i can do to fix it. i don't know who i am anymore. i don't know who i am or if i'm worth anything at all. my life was nothing for 95% of the time i've been alive. then, at the very last second, everything changed. everything got better. people said i was worth something. people cared about me, and were proud of me, for the first time. because i did well in school. because i got these great jobs. because i didn't ###$ up. even when i was really overwhelmed, i never ###$ up like this. never. i powered through. i got through every shift, and did well. i got through every class, and did well. and now i can't even submit ######6 homework. i can't even get above a 50 on a test. i was supposed to transfer to my dream school this fall, and now i don't think i'll be able to. i think this is going to ###$ it all up. i was supposed to graduate this summer. i don't think i can now. i think i'm ruining everything i've built for myself these past two years. i think i'm ######6 myself over in every situation. i think the people who used to be proud of me, used to praise me, used to trust me, are now being failed by me. i don't think i deserve any of the things i have. i think they're all going to go away. i think i'm going to be worthless again, and i'm not going to be able to rebuild this time. i'm so scared. i'm so scared. i don't want to ruin this. i don't want to break this. i don't want these people to abandon me. i don't want my bosses to be ashamed of me. i don't want them to get rid of me. i want them to be proud of me. i want to be proud of me. i want to know that i'm doing things right. i just want to do things right, but i never can, and this is so ######6 scary. it's hitting me so hard that i'm not good at anything anymore. at least before, when i was struggling, i could cling to this idea that at least objectively, superficially, professionally, academically, i was keeping afloat. i was preserving a good future for myself, for when i would feel better. but i can't even do that for myself anymore. i'm letting everything i love crash and burn all around me and i'm doing nothing to fix it, except screaming at myself as i lay down in my bed, screaming at myself to get up, screaming at myself to fix my stupid ######6 mistakes, my easily fixable mistakes, and watching my body fall asleep instead please help me. i just want someone to help me. i keep trying to go to therapists but it never works out, we never click and my schedule is always too crazy for me to justify seeing people who i don't have a good theraputic relationship with. i have a lot of trauma related problems and it makes it really hard to see therapists. unfortunately their attempts to help me can often be inadvertently triggering, and i leave. my last therapist i left earlier this spring because she tried to force me to talk about that trauma, she refused to continue seeing me unless i started to talk about it so i just stopped going. and now i'm supposed to be studying abroad this summer and moving in august so it feels like if i try to see someone again i'm going to have to leave the minute i get my first appointment with them. i'm on my own for all of june and i don't even know if i'm going to survive at the rate i'm going. everything is so scary. life is so scary. i am so scary. i am so scared of how capable i am of

"husband is obsessed with my past. i'm not sure where to post this, and i feel odd coming here and writing this, but the problem isn't going away. brief history: husband and i have been married for 7 yrs, been together/lived together for 10 yrs. very happily married, 2 kids, couldn't ask for anything more, except maybe winning the lotto. i've never cheated on him, or even flirted with other guys. i am quite the recluse, not many friends, don't get out much, stay at home mom. the problem lies in my 'relationships' before him. for some reason they really bother him. it's not a constant thing. he can go a long time w/out thinking about it, but then something (don't know what) will trigger the thought, and he obsesses about it. sometimes (like now) it gets so bad he has trouble functioning because he can't get the obsessive thoughts out of his head. technically, he is the only man i have ever dated. my past 'relationships' that bother him consist of: when i was 17, i met a man off the internet, he was 28, and had sex with him. i went back 2-3 times. it was a low point in my life, i have self-esteem issues, and i didn't think it would matter. i had no feelings for the man, wasn't even attracted to him. the second guy, was a friend, and we didn't have sex, i just spent the night with him, and yes, we fooled around a bit, but both decided we didn't want to go any further. that's the extent of my sexual relationships before my husband. at first, years ago, when he mentioned it bothered him, i thought it was the circumstances of the first guy, but now i don't think it would matter who it was, or what the circumstances were. sometimes when he obsessives about it, he doesn't want anything to do with me. other times, it's like he's marking his territory (which trust me, i don't mind) where he's pulling me aside to have sex 3-4 times a day. i kinda like the possessiveness of it, but he told me it bothers him becuause we should be making love out of love, not because he's trying to 'erase' any other guy that's been there before him. how do i help him deal with this? i try to be supportive and just remind him that i love him, but it's not enough. most people would just say get over it, it was before you, but i can't do that, i can see how much it effects him, and i love him too much to belittle his feelings.",142,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"husband is obsessed with my past. i just wanted to write to you - and any one else who ever sees this post who has the same issues- this condition that our partners has, has a name. it’s called retroactive jealousy and can be thought of as kind of like an ocd condition. my husband is also suffering - and making me suffer - from this condition. for 10 years of our marriage he has every so often bought up my past and called me horrible names. the particular event that he is obsessed with happened about a year before i met him. i was horribly drunk to the point of being unconscious and was taken advantage of by 2 men (boys really at the time). i didn’t report it to the police and instead internalised the blame and shame for it. one night when i was really comfortable with my one day to be husband i told him of that event and how awful i felt about it. he shared secrets with me too. but ever since then he has tried to blackmail me into having a threesome because apparently i did it with them why not him? and lately it has come around to me wanting it, not a sexual assault. i have only just come across this condition, and if you google it it will explain what is going on in their heads. i have been put on trial by my husband for years, with any previous information i have given him being held against me. he calls me names and says horrible things to me. but now i know why. if you are in this situation please google retroactive jealousy and if you are unsafe, leave. and for gods sakes, see a counsellor. we shouldn’t have to be defending ourselves for things we did well before we met our partners. it’s not right.",147,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"frustrated for some reason after suffering a stroke about 8 months ago, stress turned into anxiety. i have feelings of some anxiety most of the time and more intense anxiety during stressful situations. it seems like the stroke took away some protection from anxiety. i have been on wellbutrin off and on for years, taking 100mg twice a day with no side effects. it has generally helped my mild depression. i went to see my doctor about the anxiety and he had me take 7.5, mg of buspar twice a day. i experienced dizzy/faint feelings for the whole three weeks i was on it. i went to see my doctor again and he took me off the buspar and gave me the 300mg wellbutrin hoping that would help with the anxiety, it made it worse. i called in and they suggested taking the buspar once a day with the wellbutrin . i think this has helped with the anxiety a little but i still have it and the dizziness/faintness has returned. i am wondering if i should go back to 100mg of wellbutrin and take 1 buspar and see if that helps. any thoughts on what to consider. i have been on the curent mix for a little over a week.",148,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"i dont know if this is the right sub but i need help i'm afraid that i am now a sociopath. i digged too deeply in the reality of the world and now i have seen the truth. about a week ago i started having a series of disturbing thoughts regarded the world and how it is a ###$ up place. thoughts on random fears and thoughts that life is suffering filled my mind and i could not stop or refute them. one thing led to another and now a new thought has absolutely broken me. i am agnostic. i do not believe in religion or their gods. but i never fell into the trap of nihilism that without a god that there is no point.in life. i used to strongly believe in right and wrong and why life is valuable. but i have now lost that thing that kept me falling into the abyss. as i sat ruminating over my thoughts trying to find counter arguments to the thoughts about life was suffering and stuff, an new thought came into my head, that aliens will probably not have the same emotions as us. this led me into a downward spiral of if aliens didnt have the same emotions as us than emotions are not universal. if emotions are not universal than emotions are nothing more than evolutionary adaptions to help our species survive. and then finally if emotions are nothing more than evolutionary adaptions, then then things like love or value does not exist. human life is not special or important. love isnt because you actually love a person, its because evolution is trying to pass on your genes. emotions are illusions. humans are nothing more than machines of evolution. there is no reason for emotions or caring about other people. i never thought this way before. i always believed in humanism, that humans are special and deserve to be treated well. i believed in love, happiness and morality. now those concepts have been dragged out from underneath me. it doesnt matter if someone gets murdered or raped. human life isn't special. just evoutionary robots. i was already pretty emotionless because i was dealing with the thoughts before coming to this realization but when the thought popped into my head it's like something inside me died. i feel nothing anymore. no emotions. nothing. life is worthless and so are emotions. i have become a robot. for the past few days i have done nothing but read philosphy books and books by a philosopherscientist named raymond tallis. he has what i think are convincing thoughts on why evolution, while true, can not account for human behavior or emotions. that humans are more than their biological roots. but no matter how many times i read and read, while i agree with his statements, the thoughts don't care. the thoughts don't believe it. i still believe that life is worthless. if an asteroid came and destroyed the planet tomorrow i would not care. i realize how horrible that statement sounds but i can't help. it won't leave my mind. i am constantly searching for evidence against these thoughts but no matter how much i can logically agree with the counter arguments, i can't force my self to believe it. i am constantly reading stuff on the internet to disprove these thoughts but nothing works. i hate this. why am i like this? i am worried that i will be a sociopath for the rest of my mind. that i will resort to acting like the animal i believe we all are. i want to reset my mind, or rewind time to a time i did not think like this. i have ocd but i don't think this applies here. i have no emotions anymore. i am just an evolutionary robot. please someone read this and slap some sense into me. i'm so scared.",156,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"i dont know if this is the right sub but i need help all humans are sociopaths. all of us. it's just a matter of where you are on the scale. it seems to me you are one of the rare occurrences of an intellectual epiphany. from what i understand from reading your post, you are prone to being highly intellectual, always thinking, always wondering, always analyzing. this is what makes those who make this world and create all that we have. in other words, you aren't one of the billions of sheep on this planet. you have a working mind, and an aggressively questioning intellect. welcome to the club.....been there, done that, bought the t-shirt, went home. lol actually, i'm still there. my mind has never stopped. and yes, i too have had the same type of thoughts passing through my mind over the years. it can be very demanding on your psyche', and it can be very strenuous on your personality and emotional state. and even though you may not ""feel"" like you have emotions at this point, you still do. your just overwhelming yourself with all of this new information, and it's buzzing in your brain without any conceptual connections to anything at this point. you're becoming more sentient of the world and the universe. you are seeing reality and truth in nature, instead of continually believing all the bs, lies, fantasies, and other sanctimonious garbage you've been brainwashed with all your life. what you have to start doing at this point is sifting through it all. take it one piece at a time, analyze it, research it, get the information you need on it, in order for it to make sense to you and be content with the answer or outcome of your research. then go on to the next piece of information rattling around in your brain and do the same. if you start organizing all of this into categories in your head, you can better filter the crap from reality. you have to discover what the lies are, and what the reality is. logic and reason. the two best research tools anyone can ever use in life. you cannot hide logic. it's there in your face, whether you want to believe it or not. it is an absolute. reason will help guide your research to a logical state of understanding and comprehension. to para-phrase mr. sherlock holmes..........when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. for this situation, all the ""impossible"" is all the lies, bs, and fantasy that people have created to live in their own little worlds, with their heads up their butts, refusing to see or admit to any sort of reality. you've got to sift through the bs to find the logic. you've got to sift through all the lies and fantasies you've been brainwashed with since birth, in order to get any reasonable understanding from it. this is how humans are. they ignore what is harmful to them. they refuse to see reality because it is hard fact, and most all humans cannot fathom fact, truth, or reality. it scares them. they hide from it with platitudes, witticisms, phony feelings, fake emotions, and plastic personalities. aliens aside......all living things have different emotional states. if you are of the more scientific persuasion, then ""feelings"" and ""emotions"" are nothing more than chemical reactions in your brain, giving you different outcomes from the different sources crossing your daily path. food is another source of chemical reaction that can have a lot do with your ""emotions"" and ""feelings"", as food is nothing but chemicals arranged in a different manner, which have different effects on different humans. as a concept, this would mean all living things never have the same feelings or emotional states, as they all have different environments and are fed different foods to live. hmmm, does that make any sense? sometimes it's hard to put this stuff into words. what is truth? logic would dictate that truth and logic are one in the same. both are absolutes, which cannot be disproven by any means. it just is. it is undeniable fact. example: the rock is hard. you can fantasize, theorize, and scrutinize the rock all you want and wonder about it all you want.......but the cold, hard, undeniable truths are, it's a rock, and it's hard. hopefully thats not oversimplifying the point too much. your brain and intellect are waking up from the cold, sour encasement of lies, fantasies, and bs that's been pounded into your mind and psyche' all your life so far. and instead of burying it deeper and becoming more sheep like, you are wondering and contemplating. woohoo!!! alright!!! this will take time. but your first step is to find a way to organize all of these thoughts in your head. it's now time to find your truths.",157,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"sex anxiety or erotophobia hi! one of my major insecurities is low number of sexual partners. it just makes me feel incapable of doing anything and usually i lie the count to be bigger than it is, cause in case i get in bed with someone i can just blame them for bad sex or usually just get wasted. but usually when someone approaches me in a sexual way i get this feeling of anxiety that i have no idea what i'm doing and since i'm a guy it's rather a major concern. usually leading to a situation where i rabbit out with an excuse, cause i don't want to get embarrassed. also the high performance stress that spikes in usually makes me incapable of enjoying sex yet the amount that i desire it just grows by year by year. actually i just grave it so much today that i might flirt to random strangers and touch of other people, but yet usually this leads to other people find this creepy or rabbit out by themselves and if it leads to sexual stuff i usually again rabbit out at the last moment. i think i've done the rabbit thing now over 10 times ( like pass out or just i can't do this or ). also have commitment issues cause i strongly belief that if other people knew how screwed up i am they'd leave me on the spot so i rather just not get too close with anyone. i've thought of using sex worker services, but i'm not sure would that make my self-esteem even more worse since i could rabbit out even with them so i thought i'm going to go with the traditional way. but it's rather hard since i'm already 26 and only had like sex three times where i kinda dissociated from it and saw it as a mechanical performance and yes i have never had an orgasm. thanks. feel a lot better even by now.",160,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"terrified of winding up all alone? hello all, ever since i was a young child i have been acutely aware of my status as youngest in the family. that is, i've always had this recurrent, intrusive, thought/fear that someday i will wind up all alone because my parents and both my older brothers will die before me. as a kid i had rather bad separation anxiety, and now i wonder if i still have it? like i said, i'm terrified of someday being all alone because my parents and probably both my older brothers will pass on before i do. i have friends, but we've all been pretty distant since we graduated from high school and now only see each other a couple times a year, except for my closest and longest term friend, whom i see at least once a week when we hang out. i'm in college, but i haven't really made any friends, even though i'm in my fourth year and already thinking about graduation and the possibility of further education. i made a few friends i guess, but you could hardly call them friends and we don't really talk much if at all anymore. i did make one friend in college whom i do see as an actual friend and used to talk more to but he took a year off, and since we haven't been talking as much. i have bad social anxiety, so it's extremely difficult for me to make friends. besides, even if i were to make friends that's no guarantee that they won't also die before me or move away. i've been on a few dates but i've never really had a boyfriend, though i would like to someday get married. still, no offence, but men don't usually live as long as women, so i would probably still wind up alone... the thought of being alone terrifies me, if i'm all alone who will i turn to for reassurance or comfort when i have a bad panic attack or other bad things happen to me? i also have a phobia of vomiting, so i'm terrified of being somewhere/in a situation where might be ill and there is no one there to help me. (i'm also terrified of getting so scared that i throw up and there's no one there to calm me down so i won't throw up.) suffice to say, i'm terrified of many things. besides that, just being alone in general seems like such an awful thing. but, ironically, i think my fear of being alone had contributed to my being alone now. i avoid getting close to others, don't really take care of my personal hygiene, and, i admit, probably spend more time than i should surfing the internet or playing video games just to avoid facing the reality of getting rejected or growing close to someone only to lose them later on because i just can't stand the thought of losing the ones i care about. i do these things to avoid the reality that i am alone, i think, because it's easier. but if that is the case then... what can i do? how can i change this? the thought of losing the ones i care about is almost too much to bear. picturing my parents, especially my mother (who has always been there for me and helped me calm down from panic attacks), is almost too painful for me to even think about. i've always preferred fantasy to real life because fantasy is so much safer and real life is so dull and boring and too painful. i often feel unworthy of others' time and affection, i feel like i have nothing to offer others, and besides that i often find it difficult to be vulnerable around others and when i do open up and reveal potentially embarrassing/intimate things about myself i always end up regretting it. this is why i just avoid making friends. sorry for the long, rambling post, but if anyone has any experience with this or ideas, please, help me.",162,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"about to fail 25 yo male, bs degree, only part time job experience haven't had real job, location: europe. only child. still live at home. middle class, never had ""real"" money problems, spoiled throughout my life. long story. no tl;dr. help a brother out. parents: mother: overprotective. not severely, comically so, but enough to matter. scared that something will happen to me pretty much always. pretty sure this has damaged my self esteem in some way. is not terribly happy herself. actually, her happiness is too much depending on my happiness. she does tasks / chores for me sometimes before i even have a chance to do them myself. has not taught me to do these things myself. has no clue how to help properly support me so i can turn into a functional, competent adult and instead will just get angry when things turn sour. also, because my mother cannot talk to my father properly, she would sometimes talk to me instead as a ""replacement"". this wasn't healthy either. she also made my father look bad on purpose at times. father: ""absent"" (not physically) after age 14-15. realized he is not to blame. he simply cannot engage with people on an actual meaningful level, only sporadically. keeps himself busy at all times. very non judgmental however (at least towards me). cannot understand the viewpoint of my mother and my mother often provokes him and he consistently falls for the same traps. his defense mechanism is to become extremely stubborn. he can also be manipulative but he doesn't to a good job of covering this up. also diagnosed with asd, which makes sense, but then there are some things that don't fit that picture (i guess that is normal?) other family: i hardly have any other family. in the past a bit more. but the amount of people really influencing me in my life has been quite limited. of course friends / school did play an important role (early on). my main problems ai cannot find something i want to study or do for a career. the reason for this is complex, not due to one particular thing. on the one hand, i probably am a little bit of a special snowflake if you will. i do not care about how people view such a statement, i am only interested in laying out the facts. in primary school i was the smartest kid in my (small) class. i felt good about myself at that time, despite being shy in nature. i had interactions with lots of different kids and had a couple of friends i would see fairly regularly also outside school. first three years of high school were pretty much decent too. after that there was puberty and i had various bad experiences with some quite awful people that made me extremely socially anxious. i did not focus on my grades much during this time, more on survival. my family tried to help but they failed to do so in a way that actually helped me. i really had to fend for myself. i was super scared to admit many things i thought and felt, which is common with the disorder. i desperately prayed that someone would see through my various smokescreens, but they did not. since puberty i have had some problems / behaviors that to this day i have not been able to deal with. i feel horrible about this fact, actually, rather before i felt horrible about this fact. a few months ago i experienced something fairly intense which made me re-feel the importance of love. this has reduced my tendency somewhat to destroy myself inside because of my shortcomings. anyway, my most severe problem or symptom rather is severe chronic procrastination. i can guarantee it is the worst case in existence (i should be studied by scientists no joke). goes back partly to the point above: i do not know what i want. i have always been interested in the technical, computers, cars, somewhat engineering in general. but i am not naturally drawn to academia. in fact since puberty, i do not like studying anymore. or rarely. there are a handful exceptions. no i have to be honest. i do not like studying. the whole concept seems unreal to me. i still feel like i am in high school. jeez. 25 and still taking tests, sitting in class i have had enough. but i am not educated enough to get a tolerable job that makes little more than minimum wage money (ok it might be a bit better than that but not by much). ok what i mean by partly: at some point, when stress is low, i do enjoy studying certain topics. even more difficult math type stuff (not a natural at math). but it does not last. and when the point of no return is reached, that is now, meaning i have procrastinated too long, i start hating everything. i probably conflate these two things. but like i said i really do not have the ability to properly govern / control this behavior. it is a deep problem. i cannot get myself to commit myself like a normal person to studying honestly 3 - 4 hours a day without #######4 or excuses. impossible. i enjoy doing my own thing. heck, i enjoy living in my own little world. no restrictions. get to do what i want, by my rules. as a kid, playing with lego, these were the most satisfying experiences for me. hours would pass by in minutes. i love taking computers apart and upgrading them. i love flashing roms on android devices. i love obsessively tinkering with $#%^ for no reason, for no purpose. see, it will never make any money. but it satisfies me deeply. i don't care. nobody is telling me to do it, only me. and yes, i have realized i do enjoy this. i love artists who create music in this way. klayton of celldweller, trent reznor from nine inch nails. they seem like musical tinkerers to me. they think like me. i love those guys to death, for real. i do not have the dedication to creating music that they have, at least not now. i wish i did though. so college. i did / do not like it (just like school, but one huge upside is that there are not ""politics"" or cliques and bs social rules). in college, you can work with teams, for instance on building a racing car to compete against other teams. but i never enjoy this. i can never do what i want. always restrictions. fixed rules, fixed dynamics in place that stifle my freedom. that's why i prefer to stay inside. i enjoy this. some would say this is wrong but it is really my nature. goes back to playing with lego. or video games. oh god, video games. i can't really play them, because then it has to be full time. it is either full time or very little to nothing. i used to be embarrassed about myself all the time. and my god, do i not measure up to what i should be. what kind of pathetic, weak excuse for a man am i??! except i do not care. i do not care about such judgements anymore, and it has been freeing. however, i still cannot for the life of me figure out what i should do with myself career wise. currently have no friends or girlfriend. everything is in my past. i am considering rekindling a friendship which goes wayyyy back, i owe this person an explanation. but not right now, when the time is right. oh, and never had a girlfriend before either. zero experience with women. but my mindset has shifted. i am giving myself all the space and time i need. and worst case, if it never happens, i will still accept myself. i will try to do what i can. if i can help just one person, just one in a genuine way, i feel like my life is justified. my procrastination is the reason i do not have friendships, because i constantly have to lie to people about where i am really at or where my head is at. and i hate doing this so much, especially for the other person. that's why i have finally decided to not involve other people in my $#%^ anymore until i have this a little bit more figured out. the desire to help people makes me think of psychology, but in my mind, i am not convinced that pursuing psychology, and then becoming a therapist for instance, is truly going to make me feel like i genuinely help people. i imagine such a situation to be very difficult. some people i could help really well, while the majority i would honestly not feel i would have much to offer to. maybe i am wrong. this also what draws me to music, because music has saved me in the past. that feeling is overwhelming. peak experience in life i would say. to give that to others would mean much more to me than owning the latest smartphone, having a 700 hp car (ok that's pretty awesome) or a large house. i imagine that to be deeply satisfying. closing thoughts. am about to fail what i am currently studying because i have two weeks to catch up on pretty much everything. which is suicide. only a miracle could save this. so basically i should open my mind to new possibilities. ps. some bad character traits that seem to be constant over time: i get frustrated fairly easily, give up fairly easily. if something doesn't interest me, it is extremely difficult for me to do it. in primary school this was never a problem, as everything was super easy. so i just finished everything as fast as i humanly could, so i could start the fun times!!!!! which was goofing off with other kids or hacking the school computers to change the high score in a .txt file and putting my name at the top of the list with a score of 10000000000!!!! good times.",165,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"i need a job but anxiety is preventing me from getting one hello everyone. i am a 24 year old woman with gad, depression, and bpd. my boyfriend and i moved into our apartment about a year ago and we're struggling to pay rent. my boyfriend is working really hard as a landscaper, but we are still struggling to pay bills and rent. for a while i was thinking of going on disability but i'm not sure anymore. it seems impossible and time consuming to get and i want to start earning money as soon as possible. i'm trying my best to work up the courage to get a job but i honestly don't know if i can do it. the last time i worked was about 3 years ago and i had a traumatic experience where my ex/coworker harassed me at work every day and i had to leave my job. after that when i moved to a different store i started having panic attacks so frequently that it prevented me from doing my job. i stopped working with customers because of frequent panic attacks and agoraphobia and social anxiety and started stocking shelves instead but one day i took a bottle of aspirin off the shelf and just went to the bathroom and took the whole bottle (my second suicide attempt). that was about 2 years ago i believe? i would like to believe i am ready to hold a job now and i desperately need one so i'm trying to remain positive. after that happened i've been extremely reclusive, moreso than ever. my social anxiety and agoraphobia has greatly increased and i believe i'm developing an eating disorder (or an obsession with food and my weight at the very least). i don't leave my apartment often unless i'm with my boyfriend or if i know i won't have to talk to anyone. it's gotten to the point where i can't make eye contact with anyone. i can't even wave to strangers or say hello. i'm riddled with guilty and anxiety over not having a job. i can't take feeling like a failure and a waste of space much longer so i asked my friend to help me get a job where he works. i'm supposed to call today and i didn't sleep last night because i've been so anxious about that alone. i want to believe i can do this, but i just don't know. my boyfriend is very kind and understanding when it comes to my issues and my not having a job, which only makes me feel even guiltier. does anybody have any advice? how can i make myself do this? thank you guys",166,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"i was diagnosed with anxiety over 2 years ago, for around the past 3 or 4 years i have been creating an alternate reality that only exists in my bedroom. i lost my dad almost 5 years ago to illness which is what my anxiety is related to and stems from. this alternate reality is filled with people i look up to, mainly youtubers i admire and wish i was friends with. they have changed over the years but have been consistent for the past 2. they all have specific spots in my room that they 'sit' and i talk to them all out loud. in my daydream i am older and have a whole elaborate backstory for myself. this includes moving to canada and picking up the accent, so when i'm in my alternate reality i speak in a canadian accent. all the relationships i have created in my little world are long term (like 6-7 years), and it makes me wonder if part of the reason i do this is to fill the emptiness i felt after losing my dad. being in this daydream feels so good, i am more confident, i still have anxiety but i talk about it a lot more freely in my own world, and whenever i feel anxious or any other intense emotion, thats where i go. more recently i've started to feel ashamed in the middle of my daydream or when i come out of it, because i take a step back and realize how crazy i must look since i'm literally having a conversation with different patches of air. its not as though i actually see the people i want to see sat in front of me, i just imagine them and talk to them as if they were actually in the room. i am very strict with myself about where i do this, as i said it only really exists in my room. sometimes if i'm home alone i'll use the accent around the house just to talk to myself, and during long car journeys i fantasize about it but thats as far as it goes. i realize how insane i must sound, but its bothered me for a while and i'm too embarrassed to talk about it, so as always i'm turning to the internet for some reassurance and some answers. does anybody else do this or something similar? does anybody know why i do this? thanks",168,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"i have done this since childhood. i think for me it was escapism from bullying due to developmental delays (since birth). for me it took many forms. as a young child i'd create characters/persona's based on popular kids who didn't get bullied. as a teen it would include favourite celebrities/pop stars and i'd be their hero. (by saving their lives or doing something heroic). up to this point it stayed exclusively in my bedroom. in my late teens was when my first 'persona' became a full blown alter and existed in the real world, based on a deaf kid i met on a visit to a deaf school who signed who i got obsessed with. i had a phobia of public speaking due to a speech defect and being bullied for it and was already an elective mute in some situations so this 'becoming deaf so no-one expected me to speak' seemed like the perfect solution to me. (i'd explain here i also have autism and dissociation was my 'coping strategy, though i did not understand this at that age). in my 'imaginings' as i used to call them i was also deaf and signed fluently by learning to sign songs. again my tv heroes would be in my fantasies and of course they'd think i was amazing and learn to sign to communicate with me etc! this continued to my thirties when a sudden 'shut down' causing (at the time) temporary mobility issues triggered an obsession with wheelchair users after being treated like a celebrity in hospital when i couldn't walk. my fantasies then included me being in a wheelchair after risking my life to save favourite tv celebrities. my mobility did eventually partly-recover (irl). i still need wheelchair/scooter for distance but can now walk round the house most days.

"anxiety and medication - any thoughts? hi all, since 2012 i've been experiencing cyclic changes in my mental health - usually for periods of around 2 months of positive experiences and 1 month negative. almost clockwork. negative symptoms include such things as insomnia, suicidal ideation, reduced productivity, impulse spending, distancing from friends and family, weight gain and irrational thoughts. my concern is, what would generally last around a month, is now approaching 5. this resulted in me seeing the crisis team on thursday and a subsequent trip to the gp to collect my first lot of medication since 2012! the crisis team feel as though my initial diagnosis (2012) of eupd is no longer appropriate and that i need further intervention from the complex care team to further ascertain a new or revised diagnosis. they are leaning towards a suggestion of severe anxiety, however they have stated that the cyclic nature of my problem is throwing a spanner in the works so to speak. anyway, moving on. the gp has given me a short supply of 5mg diazepam to help with the initial hit of anxiety and insomnia. running parallel to this i've been given the usual dose of 50mg sertraline ssri so that by the time i get to see the complex care team, i'll have a level of meds in my system. i only started the diazepam last night, took 5mg in the afternoon and 10mg before bed. i'm quite disappointed, although it has certainly taken the edge of the anxiety initially and gave me a general level of clarity - it has not helped with my insomnia. i am also mindful that it is a short term fix due to the tolerance and dependancy levels. so, my question is, after this rant, long term, what medication are people having fortune with in terms of severe anxiety, depression and insomnia? i'm hoping they will allow me to keep the diazepam 5mg as a prn alongside a proven ssri but i know gps can be hesitant to script the benzos. anyone have experience with this also?",182,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"fear of my children getting sick hi everyone, i'm 40 years old and have two boys, 18 and 12. i had a pretty miserable life post marriage. i was married at 21, had my first born at 22. i was exceptionally good academically and had a very happy childhood and very supportive, loving parents. however, my in laws are from hell. my husband was a total mama's boy and simply never stood up for me. he was raised as a total slave to their whims and commands. his father is clearly a narcissist and his mother a manipulative emotional wreck. i got sucked into this whirlpool mess of a family. his brother and spouse are extremely selfish, greedy people who have used us and betrayed our trust. yeah, lovely family right? i don't know when exactly it started but i developed severe anxious thoughts, fears and health issues. i had witnessed as a teen my older cousin's erratic behaviour as he had schizophrenia but it didn't bother me then. i was pretty strong emotionally and could handle such expeeiences. or so i thought. after marriage and two kids, i moved to another country and i started feeling lonely. i actively avoid close friendships although i used to be a social butterfly in college. i started becoming fearful every time my kids fell sick. it didn't help that successive vacations to my in laws' place were miserable, filled with conflicts and my kids witnessed it all. now i'm wrecked with an unimaginable amount of guilt, it eats me day and night, that i screwed up my kids. i yell at them one minute, am loving and repentant the next. it's a rollercoaster ride and as they're growing older, they are feeling the effect. i always worry that my confusing and unpredictable behaviour and parenting, coupled with my personality and family history (although not direct) will cause my kids to get some mental illness. i'm particularly scared out of my mind about schizophrenia. i don't know so many intrusive thoughts full my head from the time i wake to when i crash at night that some horrible mental illness is lurking around my family. on top of that, i read these new agey stuff that what you think manifests as the energy is attracted to you. now i'm double scared that i'm responsible for all these possible scenarios. on the outside people think i'm smart, articulate, capable, strongand a great mom, on the inside i'm an absolute wreck. i keep looking at my older son watching for any abnormal ""signs"". once i caught him saying something in the bathroom and i froze. it turned out he was just speaking to someone on the phone. but this suspicious way of thinking and living is definitely something they'll pick up on as its getting too obvious. i hate feeling this way. i know i'm lonely, far away from my family and can't talk about these years even to my sister or husband as they sound really irrational. i have cut away my social circle, lost my motivation in my career and multiple talents, and just worry all the time. it used to be sporadic when the kids were younger but now it's getting worse as my older son approaches his adulthood and i'm anxious that i may have screwed him up. i feel he can sense my anxiety and i know it's really unhealthy for him. he also gets agitated and thinks i'm nagging him, when all i'm doing is making sure he's ""ok"" and all ""normal"". this is a horrible way to live and i can't even enjoy my children or their lives as i'm monitoring every behaviour of theirs, to satisfy my fears. please help with some perspective on what i should do.",183,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"weird mental associations making me feel very uneasy hello everyone, i have a very strange problem and i have had no luck so far trying to find out what it could be because it's very difficult to describe it, but i will try. let me first tell you that i have always had a thing for mental associations. i can look at something or listen to a song and experience strong feelings towards it or have vivid associations, be it with real-life things or fantasy places in my head. it's never been a problem for me, i've had it all my life, and it actually helps me with my creative work and i think i am able to paint abstract pictures because of my abilities to ""feel"". however, recently i started experiencing very bizarre associations. it al began about 4 years ago when i was on the internet and saw a particular artwork on an artist's website. it was an interesting, comic-like protrait of someone and i felt intrigued by it. it had many details and i started looking into them, and then suddenly i started feeling very uneasy. it was as if the picture was emitting bad vibes, so i closed the website didn't look at it again. since then, i've started getting these exact same ""bad vibes"" that the picture had from other things as well (but not always): street lights throwing light at snow, graffitti on brick walls, some of the 80s synth-pop music (bizarrely) and so on. every time it sends chills down my spine. from what i could find on the internet, it kind of fits the description of ptsd when certain things can trigger traumatic memories. the problem is: i don’t have any traumatic memories that could fit into this! i have no idea why these random things keep triggering me, even though it does feel like i have a personal connection with them. a friend jokingly suggested that i could be experiencing memories from my past life. well, i’m not really buying this theory, and i want to find the psychological explanation behind this. oh, and the most bizarre thing about this is that i experience these ""bad vibes"" only in late autumn and winter , when it is already dark outside. in summer, i almost forget about these experiences and struggle to remember what the fuss was all about. however, today i had my first confrontation with this feeling again, so i guess the season is opened again. i was listening to some 80s music and suddenly had a strong the feeling of dread. these attacks usually last for a few seconds but can leave me anxious for minutes or hours, depending on how much i focus on it. does anyone have any clue what it could be and how i could cope with it?",184,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"hello, i'm new. hello, this is my first time posting here, i have a question relating to something that happened to me recently, the question: is it rude to not speak first? my reason for asking: a few days ago, my mom asked me if i ""couldn't speak"" i'm assuming her boyfriend was upset that i went three days without saying anything to him, so he told her about it (i dont see him often since my room is in its own little area, i speak to him if he says something to me, but apparently me not speaking first is a problem for him, even though he is aware of my anxiety; we have had issues in the past with him being sensitive when it comes to these things.) my thing is, i do this with everyone, because speaking is such a weird thing for me, most of the talking i do is through text, i avoid people at all costs and this is one of the reasons why; people tend to misunderstand me, or just not hear me (which is what started this, he said something and i replied, and he didnt hear me, so he stopped talking to me for those three days, which if you ask me comes across as ""just leave me be and i'll speak to you when im ready"" so that's what i did, a big mess ended up happeneing from this and i spent 3 hours having a crying fit trying to calm myself down, and i just cant stop thinking about it now) we currently aren't speaking, which i'm okay with, my mom made some comments that made me feel weird because she has never spoken to me the way she has started doing since being with him. sorry for the long-ish all over the place rant-post, but it just seems so odd; for me when i speak to someone and they dont reply i dont get upset and say they're selfish or whatever else, i just automatically think they either: have a lot going on, just don't want to speak, are as shy/awkward as i am, or just didn't hear me; i dont get upset, then sic my friends on them making a big fuss about it all, i just go about my day being worried about if my tone was rude or weird or if i made a mean face or if my body language was wrong, not if they're stuck up and rude, etc. now, to me i feel like this would all be justified if he spoke to me and i ignored him, but i didn't do that, and my mom is saying that i ""walk around as if i expect everyone to just talk to me"" but that's what he does, he has a little fit when someone doesn't speak to him, but he can do it to other people whenever he wants. lastnight, i said goodnight to everyone and he was the only one that didn't respond. so at this point, i don't want to waste any of my energy trying to hold a conversation with him to make him happy, this year hasn't been the best when it comes to the two of us, so i feel like it's just downhill from here.",187,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"anyone have any luck coming of ssri’s? so maybe i wouldn't give up on medication just yet. there are different classes of antidepressants and afaik they also work on anxiety. so far you have tried one class, ssris. there are also snris, saris, tricyclic, tetracyclic, atypical, etc. not all will be right for you but i want you to know there are more options out there. also if you don't have depression buspirone is an anxiety only medication that may work for you. zombiez wrote: with all my ranting aside, what sort of side effects can i expect from coming off, will my anxiety be worse that it was before? i’d like to hear your experience with quitting medication. ok, so i am not exactly med compliant and will routinely go off of my antidepressant if i think my depressive symptoms will stay away for a while. when i go off of it two things usually happen; i always get rebound anxiety during the withdrawal and i usually get headaches. i've discovered if i taper slow enough i can mostly avoid the headaches but the rebound anxiety is still there. my anxiety does seem worse initially, but that feeling eventually fades. oh and a second argument for a slow taper is you increase your risk for brain zaps if you go too fast. they aren't harmful but they aren't fun either. when i'm off my antidepressant my anxiety rarely gets as bad as it was several years ago in college. this is because i have worked on it with my therapist and also because i removed certain things/people from my life that were making my anxiety worse. my guess is that even if you haven't done anything besides take an ssri to help with your anxiety there is no reason to think it would be any worse than before you started it unless you have environmental triggers that have become worse over time. so yes you should be able to get off your ssri without too much trouble but your anxiety could go back to where it was at before. dx: recurrent major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder",190,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"anxiety reared its head for me at 31 before late december 2016, i didn't really experience anxiety that was out of the norm. i had an unusually high heart rate the day if starting a new job. i went in to get checked because heart issues run in my family. everything checked out so they insisted i was on drugs. i have never done drugs. things got better quick. then october 21 rolls around. i get a call at work that my 4 year old daughter had an accident at home and was seriously burned. she spent 3 weeks in the hospital, my wife stayed with her, and i stayed with my son, and newborn. i would make trips back and forth every over day (150 miles one way) to see her and pick up breat milk for the little one. i started getting this heavy weight feeling on my chest, my breathing would change, and i'd get this awful tingle feeling over my entire body. once she was home and doing well it subsided some. three weeks after she came home, my bestfriend and his daughter died in a house fire. i would get these episodes off and on all day, heart rate at times would be well over 150. i went in and was diagnosed and giving some medication that seems to have helped a lot. earlier this month i lost my mom, i held her hand as she passed away.. and the episode started, but it only lasted 5 minutes. i haven't really felt much after that, and we where very close.. either the meds and kind of teaching myself to calm down is working or something is brewing?? seeing as this came on how it did, can it also ""go away""?",191,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"worst i've felt in years, any help would be major appriciatd so, i'd like to start this with a synopsis of my past and why this situation is so extremely stressful to my already bad anxiety. sorry for the rant, but i really don't know what to do any more.. when i was a kid i had such major anxiety that my mom took me out of school, and home schooled me. the only problem was that she was an in denial opiate addict who had no place doing so. i ended moving constantly due to her not being able to hold out a house or job and ended up teaching my self using the internet when it became an option. she has apparent mental health problems and threatened suicide multiple times to me as a child, barely came out of her room to make food so i very early developed the habit of poor eating, or not eating at all at times. later, during my teenage years, i had basically raised my self and lived in a drug fueled haze, lots of opiates i had stolen from my mom, prescription stimulants i had convinced doctors to give me strong doses of, tons of weed, was on probation, constantly anxious, wondering where my next meal would come from or if i would have a roof over my head because of the constant fighting in my house and lack of care in that aspect. when i was 20 after lots of pain and self abuse and ignorance to a lot of it, i met a women who changed my life for ever. she taught me how to eat properly, how to cook for my self, the difference in local and organic foods, and many other small life skills i never even knew i was missing. she was a semi recovering opiate addict, we got along great and found love in each other i don't think either of us really knew existed. eventually we both got into psychedelics, they really changed my perspective and opened up my eyes to a lot of things in my life that i had not previously seen before, and helped me to make many drastic changes that i needed to start moving forward in my own life. she got off the opiates and got into college, i moved forward in a career path i had recently chosen, but picked up a extremely dependent hidden opiate addiction to mask the pain i had shoved away in fear of hurting my new found relationship that was going great in for the most part. skip forward 3.5 years. we move from her/our/her dads/ condo to a bigger house, we get a dog, plan goes to $#%^ about 2 weeks after moving, move back to the condo with the dog, dogs crazy and doesn't do well in a small apt, all the stress of all of that and the stress is causes my relationship causes me to dive deep into the opiates which i had been trying to fight off for years unsuccessfully at this point, which in turn ruins my relationship....my anxiety if off the chain, i'm having panic attacks multiple times a day, can't eat for $#%^, can't sleep..it's awful. . along with on and off opiate withdrawals and mood swing from the drug caused chemical imbalances which do not help at all either.. so around november of last year i move back in with my mom who is now remarried as a last resort hoping that i might be able to use it as an opportunity to get my $#%^ together. because of how desolate the area where she lived was i was able to get away from the opiates and only have went back twice since then but never actually relapsed which i'm insanely proud of my self for. my life perspective is so different now, i don't even feel like the same person i was back then. i am much more thoughtful, and have made lots of progress in many ways and greatly respect my self for that. during this time, the emotional abuse from her has been extremely taxing though and as a now much more conscious adult i really see the extent to which it is/was... constantly i am reminded of times during my childhood that were extremely difficult for me, am belittled for not having previously made good choices that would have ended up with me not having to stay with her, calling me names, being told that no wonder my ex left me, etc, etc, etc, even though i am trying to be an adult and talk our problems out, but am met with hand gestures, lots of what evers, yelling, passive aggressiveness and narcissistic abuse, and am left feeling so hurt disgusted, and angry that often i will end up yelling at her, and even at other people sometimes if they catch me in a bad moment, and this has caused major problems for me at work and in my once flourishing social life recently....i would just leave and be homeless and go figure it out of my own, but i need to think about my dogs well being as well as my own now... during of the emotional struggle from all of this, i have lost a lot of weight that i had gained after quitting the drugs, can't sleep for $#%^, am worn down emotionally and physically, smoking way too many cigarettes, angry, emotional, depressed, and overly tired during the day, and keep thinking it's almost a better idea to just start doing the opiates again and then i'll at least be able to put on that mask to avoid how i'm feeling right now... i really don't want to do that though, and am getting very afraid that i'm not going to get out of this situation in a healthy way... any kind advice would be very helpful. or just a empathic reply of some sort.. please help. thank you for taking the time to read this long, unorganized, $#%^ show that my life is :/.",193,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"anxiety & depression from sibling sexual experimentation hey everyone, so i've come across some posts on here as well as other sites about sexual experimenting between siblings and cousins. i wanted to share my own experience and what i’m about to write is the worst regret of my life and i’m starting to feel really anxious, suicidal and depressed as a result. i'm 27 years old now so this happened 10 + years ago i myself had my own embarrassing and shameful experience when i was a very young teen with my younger brother too (both males, approx. 5 yrs apart). as kids we would play with each other all the time like we were attached at the hip. despite the fighting, we’d love each other’s company. long story short we were wrestling or playing around one day and somehow i ended up starting this game where i dry humped/rubbed my body against his in somewhat of a sexual way, plus a little touching/groping. what worries me is that i was the one who initiated it. he did consent but was probably too young to understand what was going on. it only happened once or twice and then the urges went away and only after it happened is when i started to realize it was awkward. we're both straight and never been attracted to the same sex but for some reason this happened. the last time it happened he got a little bothered by it so that made me realize that i should stop. ever since then i've been regretting it so much and feel really depressed about the situation. over the years its been coming back slowly to haunt me more and more. nothing but shame, regret and disgust. sometimes suicidal thoughts come to me as well. i hate myself so much for it and for while i convinced myself that i was some sort of monster that sexually abused his brother. i’ve been a good person my whole life to everyone i know and i always treat people with the most empathy and sympathy. this once incident is the one thing where i wish i had done different. i honestly don't know what prompted me to do this but at that age i probably wanted to know what being sexual/having sex felt like due to puberty and hormones, yet i was never sexually attracted to my brother. i wasn't even watching porn or masturbating at that age yet and i didn't even know what masturbating was (very socially underdeveloped and sheltered at that age). i'm guessing serious urges through puberty, experimentation, curiosity and lack of control of hormones. my brother and i were very close, and always around each other playing physically so that might have also led to doing it with him rather then anyone else. now, i don't remember physically forcing him or threatening him in any way and there was no malicious intent behind it but i get these “what if” thoughts that i maybe might persuaded him in a playful way but even that is a very vague fuzzy memory which worries me. looking back at it i wish i never did it but at the time i guess wasn’t able to fully understand the “rights” and “wrongs” of sexuality and the potential consequences. now i've heard this kind of stuff is somewhat common amongst siblings at a very young age but i'm a little concerned and worried because technically i was not a 'child' anymore. i could have technically been considered a young 'teenager' at the age (can't remember due to how long ago it was). i think i was maybe 14-15yrs of age. my therapist said that this stuff is somewhat common and that although i wasn't a child, mentally and cognitively i was still acting as a kid. also, because my parents were extremely overprotective, sheltering and neglecting that that could have been another factor in my delayed development. i also rarely had friends and i was very attached to my brother which could have brought us closer to age in terms of development. the regret is absolutely terrible and it feels like a completely different person that has done this when i was that age. i’ve never molested, sexually abused, harassed or touched any child or even had the thought of doing such things for that manner. my questions a1) is this considered abuse or experimentation ? 2) should i bring it up with my brother to apologize and to see if i can help him if he is negatively affected by it ? or will that do more harm then good ? thanks in advance for any insight you guys might have. i appreciate it !",196,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"i think my anxiety is eating away at me hello, i’m new to this forum and don’t know if this is the proper place for this, but i feel that i need to talk to someone about this. i have lived with depression for as long as i can remember but it was only a few years ago that i started going to therapy. i tried group therapy and one-on-one therapy, but none seemed to really help. i switched therapists but they didn’t help either. now i have a new therapist and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. however, i feel like these don’t begin to tackle the things i’ve been experiencing. i don’t know if i’m doing the right thing or if i even have a problem to begin with. i worry all the time that i’m just making things up. maybe my problems aren’t as big as they seem. i feel empty most of the time. i can’t bring myself to feel good things or even bad things sometimes, it just feels like nothing’s there. if it’s not emptiness, it’s sadness..i go through life detached and feel as if though i’m looking at everything through a tv screen or as if though i’m in a “first-person” [point of view] game. recently though...i’ve been feeling a little different. there are days where my hands start shaking and i can’t sit still. my throat starts to close up and when i feel that i’m choking i start to panic. my therapist has now diagnosed me with a panic disorder along with the depression and anxiety. along with that my anxiety has been getting worse. at times i feel so unstable. i feel like i can’t take it, like if everything’s too much and my head starts racing. during these times, i start hyper-focusing on sounds and feelings. they become so overwhelming that they trigger panic attacks. i’ve lived with depression and anxiety for so long that i learned to work around it. i thought that if i could just keep folowing the routine of life (wake up, shower, work/study, eat, sleep) that i could be ok and continue to “live” (not be a burden to others and not turn to worse coping methods). i was wrong though. i find that the more time i live like this the more unstable i get. lately i have started seeing things. i see spiders crawling on the floor, on other furniture, and on me. i even feel them sometimes. all of this makes my anxiety and instability get worse, i don’t know what to do about it. my therapist strongly feels that i need medication but a part of me can’t go through with it. i feel like my problems aren’t big enough to take medication. i was always yelled at and scolded for being sad. i was always told that there was nothing wrong with me and that others have it far worse, that i simply need will power to feel better.. i know i have problems, but i can’t help but feel that they aren’t worth enough to go as far as medication. they are nothing compared to others and maybe i’m just putting too much attention to small matters. i don’t know how to measure the weight of my problems and don’t know how to convince myself that going through with medication is a good thing that can help me..i feel very lost. sorry for writing a lot and thank you for reading. please feel free to share your opinions, thoughts, and experiences.",197,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder hi all, i'm a young woman in her early 20s. i like to think of drugs as a way to expand my consciousness. i consider myself intelligent and i am very curious about our world, especially regarding how we perceive our realities and what reality actually is. we only live once, you know? i have never used drugs as an escape, just out of curiosity, and i don't drink or smoke cigarettes, at all. i'm not depressed, i don't cry, or have anger issues. my mind is always questioning, processing, and trying to see every single angle of things. i'm just this way- i'm a calm analyzer who likes to figure out how, and most importantly- why? however, this curiosity got the best of me last year when i had the chance to try lsd for the first time with my boyfriend. i have dabbled in mdma and cocaine, and smoked marijuana regularly, so i was absolutely no stranger to drugs and the effects. i am not sure that it was actually lsd though- because of how horrifyingly long it lasted. the trip also felt ""dirty""- a lot of how the trip felt did not sound or feel ""right"". i can go deeper into this if you wish, but i'm pretty positive that it was not actual lsd. we took way too much due to the time it took to set in, and boy do i regret it. the trip was so intense that i suffered ego death. i'm sure that this is why i have such severe anxiety now- i thought i was going to die during the trip, which is ridiculous, because i've done cocaine which is much more dangerous than lsd and suffered no anxiety and kept a rational mind. tripping will do that to you. at the most intense point of climbing up, i kept screaming in my mind all of these things... imagine a spinning galaxy, this is what i saw through my mind's eye. i literally could not keep my eyes open due to how intense it was. my body was in tremors for hours due to a very intense anxiety attack that would not end but my mind was so far gone that it turned into pure fear. being the trooper i am, i just soldiered through it. spinning and spinning and darkness, just my voice screaming and echoing, inside my own head. it was so vast and amazing and full but full of terror. at the point i last remember (before the trip started to decrease in intensity) i made peace with my deceased mother and was screaming in my head that i love everybody and forgive them for everything. i'm glad that this happened, because i don't hurt over her anymore. i began to let myself go at that point, accepting my death, but not fully before the trip started to decrease. i think that if it kept going a bit longer at that intensity, i would have fully allowed myself to let go and the fear would have been conquered. it didn't work that way though. even typing this is making my hands and face tingle with anxiety... even though i logically and rationally know it's over, and i should get over this already. now, i have anxiety and derealization. i don't have depersonalization- my personality and bodily sensatations have remained pretty much intact. functioning has become a task, though. i have anxiety about dying!!! if my heart palpitates, which is out of anxiety, my mind immediately snaps to the thought that i'm dying, time to panic! i logically accept that we will all die someday, there is no god (sorry- belief in god won't help me... i'm way too hippie to ever believe anything like that) and we're all a part of the natural way of things. however, the fear still grips me. this is my main issue. i'm becoming a bit depressed because of how my reality feels now and the thought that it will always be this way. normal life seems so much harder because it feels like my external world has been turned inside out, and now i'm living from inside my head to the outside... if that makes sense. it's very frustrating. i also have very paranoid ideations- that my boyfriend is cheating on me- i.e., he's at work, or when he doesn't text me back right away, my mind immediately jumps to thinking horrible things and it begins the cycle of obsessive paranoid thoughts. i can psyche myself out of these, but that sinking feeling usually remains until i completely distract myself. i've never been like this before, and i know he is not doing anything to hurt me- he does not have the capacity to. it's all in my head and it all began after the trip. on the other hand, i have a lot of childhood trauma that i thought i had dealt with- with the years of therapy and all. i don't remember much of my childhood. i'm sure it's all buried in there and i have no interest to dig it up... really. i feel scared and see no point to it, what is the past is the past. i saw this today: ""as far as the cause of your distress; at worst it may have unlocked some buried emotional/psychological crap that has to percolate out"" and it really comforted me- and for 5 seconds, the first time in nearly a year, i felt a break into reality. however, it's gone now. i can't afford therapy quite yet- but have any of you had a similar experience? any advice, or coping skills? thanks for reading and i'm excited to read your replies.",201,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder hey there waterlilies, i totally understand you. i've experimented in my time too. but mine is due to lots of stress and past issues of when i was a child. so going to a therapist has also helped me. however there are other things you can do: there are lots of positive things you can do: a nurse practioner has told me and i researched my self online that when you do aerobic type excercise like walking fast or a jog or joining a aerobic type class at a gym or some sort of dance form for 15-30 minutes will lower your cortisol levels which will then allow you to have more seratonin to your brain. it gives you the same calming effect as taking a benzo type medication minus all the negative side effects that those evil meds can give you. and it lasts for about 6 hours. and if you continusly do excercise at least 4-5 times a week. you will build steady cortisol levels and be able to be free and live again and be unstoppable you have to be brave, courageous- use positive affirmation daily, post them around your home in your car. positive talk your self that you are well, healthy, calm at peace, trusting and everything will be ok. i do aerobic excercise 4-5 times a week and do yoga twice a week. yoga also helps alot. it helps you stop thinking about worrys and fears and just have that hour to think of nothing but your breathing and being at peace. so anytime i'm feeling anxious i go for a run for 10-25min then come back home and put on a relaxing yoga song that plays for 7 minutes and do deep breathing (breathing in all positive thoughts and exhaling and letting go of all negative thoughts.) also take magnesium its suppose to be caliming and a b complex vitamin with folic acid (b3, b6, inositol, folic acid.) i also hear passion flower ( natural herb)tincture drops - 3 drops- 20 drops- everyone's body is different so i would take 3 drops with water and see how you feel and take 5 more drops if that isnt doing anything. chammomile is soothing also. also try aromatherapy. cinnamon candles, lavender bath etc. massages are great. try accupuncture too. and stay away from weed- that will just make you even more anxious. once in awhile having a glass or 2 of wine at night is relaxing and soothing. not sure from what part of the area your from but in the us there are qualified therapists that can help you if you are low income. i think its like any where from 10-30 per session. also read the book, ""the secret"". it has a lot of positive type thinking and how to manifest more positive to you. and lastly but definitely not the least its actually number one for me is i have god in my life and he guides me and is always there for me helping me through this.",202,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder hey waterlilies, you might find it interesting to type 'serotonin lsd' into google. lsd mimics serotonin and links into the same pathways in the brain. my own experiances were much like yours. they lasted way too long, were not enjoyable and changed my perception. after much reading and inner searching i realized that my experimenting was my quiet way of trying to 'fix' myself. that wasn't the solution. i recall that feeling of disassociation for months after. i felt as if i'd been re-wired and spent a lot of time over-analyzing everything. i felt like i was missing some basic, all encomposing answer to everything. the best way for me to describe the feeling was 'i ghosted' through that time. i had lost substance. thankfully, time, knowledge, a good doctor, friends and family have given me substance again. oh ya, there's nothing like long walks in nature to help 'ground' yourself. i've begun waking up early to watch the sunrise. i find it inspiring and soothing. then i go back to bed. hgt",203,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder hey man, im kind of with you on that level except my anxiety started after years of drinking one time i went through alcohol withdrawal and had a bad panic attack ever since that i had crazy anxiety that lasted for months i used cannabis as a way to relax and relieve anxiety until i smoked the bowl from hell. i was the highest i have ever been off weed in my life except i was left alone in my house for about 6 hours and i totally lost it and started questioning reality and my own sanity. anyway the next day when i woke up i still felt out of this world like i have been given new eyes or some $#%^ like that. soooo after that my anxiety kicked in more i started to think i was totally loosing my mind i went back to alcohol and then i started to use oxycodone. after drinking and feeling more depressed and detached i was looking for anything besides ssri to help me so i turned to opiates. now 6 months down the road i have a drug addiction to opiates but everytime i use one unless i use it real heavy i feel so much relief from dp that i almost feel normal again. so yea i would have to say your anxiety is caused from the drugs. but not trying to be a bad influence if you can get your hands on some oc let me know how it works for ya any adivice for me would be great!",205,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder just an aside for anybody that stumbles onto this thread: it is really difficult to find real lsd in the united states, and even if you manage to find it, it is usually low grade and full of impurities. most lsd you find on the street now are european research chemicals being sold as lsd, and often times those that are selling it use imprecise dosing. this, combined with the lack of information on the effects of these research chemicals, can lead to all sorts of bad trips and disasters. if you want to be safe, don't even try to use lsd in the us, at least until there is a revival somehow of pure lsd. when you buy lsd on the street you are inviting all sorts of dangers.

"i don't know what to do about this. i have been thinking of reaching out for help online and writing this post for over a month, and i feel like i've hit rock bottom now and i should do it. i am a new member (not a native english speaker, hopefully this won't be a problem) and i've never resorted to mental health forums or support groups before. i find myself in a situation that i am now unable to deal with and for which i am not able to find a name yet, which is what brings me here today. i need to gain understanding about my problem if i want to fix it, and i think i should start understanding whether this is an actual issue at all and acquire tools to describe it properly. i am not sure if this is the correct section but i do believe my problems are anxiety-related and i am open to further clarifications. i will try to explain what i'm dealing with as clearly as possible and eventually add background information if necessary. i am a 27 year old woman and during the last few months i have been experiencing unpleasant and almost unbearable physical sensations, accompanied by a great deal of related anxiety. these symptoms have been profoundly affecting my lifestyle, my productivity and my peace of mind. i haven't found a clear definition for my combination of symptoms so i will try and list them as carefully as possible: - troubles with sleeping (this started around 4 years ago and has been worsening in time). examples of this could be: at first i would prefer to arrange my sheets/duvet/pillows in a certain manner. i would sometimes remove my sheets to avoid crinkles. i would spend a significant amount of time moving the bed/adjusting bedding in order to feel more ""comfortable"". this would happen with virtually any combination of sheets, pillows, mattresses etc. (so i wasn't using anything that was actually uncomfortable). i would sometimes question hosts and friends about how comfortable they found my bed to be and would always receive positive comments, such as that the mattress was soft and comfy. then i would experience discomfort while sleeping in beds different from my own (such as when going on vacation, sleeping at friend's house...) to the point that i would complain about not being able to get some good sleep in other people's beds. this has eventually led to an anticipatory fear of going on vacation, etc., due to being uncomfortable in bed, and in a feeling of shame in showing other people how i arrange my bed, how much time i spend adjusting it, and how much i toss and turn at night. i have noticed a ritualistical fashion in those behaviors. - fidgeting in clothes: this has been worsening during the very last few months, and seems to have build up in time. at first i would find myself avoiding particular garments that weren't particulary comfortable; i am now in a place where i can only wear the same thing all the time, clothes have to fit certain standards for me to even consider buying them. i have given up on wearing garments that i never had problems with and that i didn't want to give up on, such bras and tights, which causes a lot of embarassment and discomfort. in winter i tend to be too cold because i cannot wear thick thights; in summer i have to wear oversized clothing to conceal the fact that i'm not wearing a bra. i don't attempt to buy underwear anymore because i have spent a lot of money on it and nothing would fit comfortably. i found some comfortable underwear a couple of years ago and have managed to keep that till now, but that will soon wear out and i don't know what i'll wear after that. i have come to the point of only having 2 night shirts that i could sleep on, i even have to try on socks before deciding if i can wear them, and i feel a lot of discomfort and find myself fidgeting in clothes when i am outside. virtually nothing seems to fit comfortably. - related anxiety: i do have anxiety both unrelated to these issues and anticipatory/subsequential anxiety. when i am supposed to go out, i experience anticipatory anxiety because i know my clothes might not fit comfortably and i spend a lot of time and energy planning what to wear so that that doesn't happen, or at least to alleviate those feelings. i sometimes avoid going out or have breakdowns after going out because of those unpleasant sensations. i find myself struggling to do things that other people can do naturally - such as sleeping, running errands, going on vacation. i find myself clenching my teeth and developing exhausting headaches in results of these activities, or having breakdowns when i've got to perform such activities. i strongly believe this is a psychological issue because i haven't always had it (it seems to build up and worsen in time) and because when i am in a very good place mentally, my symptoms improve dramatically. i want to become a better person and be a functional part of this society. i used to work in cancer research in university and would love to keep my work up but the burden of everyday life seems to weigh me down. i am certain this is anxiety driven and i would love to get a job so that i can afford therapy and learn more about myself and this ""condition"".",220,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"paranoia or anxiety? i am very new, in fact i just registered. the reason i registered is because i saw a post from someone else that really reminded me of an issue i am currently dealing with but with a different reason. i've always been the kind of person that would ask ""what if"" at an extremely early age to now because of fear of the unknown. i never realized it as an issue until my fourth grade year when my anxiety started to show itself in the ugliest way. no one knew what was wrong with me and i didn't know what was wrong with me. i never knew mental illness was a thing. through the years, i've developed irrational fears stemming from the anxiety. i was professionally diagnosed in november of 2013. nothing was done to help. the whole goal of everyone around me was to keep me off of medication but now i think it's ruining my life. the constant fear, paranoia, and high vigilance i have throughout the day being alone is exhausting and every sound of situation in my mind feeds it all. i can't stop looking over my shoulder, feeling like someone or something is always there. i cannot think back to any trauma and neither can my family. i've just always been scared. scared of people and things i don't understand. the intrusive thoughts about absolutely terrifying things that can and will happen to me in my lifetime playing over and over and over again in my mind before bed strains my sleep thin and i dread going to sleep at night.and they're not thoughts like my day time thoughts which are to lock all the doors and windows and draw my blinds and board up my bedroom door to sit in here all day - they're thoughts about my life and what is to come and what i'll be dealing with until the day i pass. i have panic attack after panic attack and it exhausts me to sleep and that's no way to live for me. i constantly go to the doctor to get help where no help is given. recently, i've had to go in because of my heart fluttering randomly and near-fainting and i know for a fact it's because of the anxiety. it's slowly eating away at my life and my doctor wants to keep me off of anti-anxiety medications for fear i'll gain more weight. i've exhausted all other ways to cope with it that are healthy and wont damage my life or well-being and i'm left with the only option being medication. but all of this has left me with the question... how? how do i cope with this? how can i sleep? how can i calm my mind? how can i stop looking over my shoulder? i fear that i'm asking too much of my doctor asking for him to see me for symptoms because he cannot fix what i have. he can't take away the anxiety or the depression but the symptoms are becoming too much. should i just go and be honest? i feel like our meetings are so strained and like i'm being timed every single second i am there. i'm far too poor to keep going or to get a therapist.",223,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"this made me really anxious i am sometimes the anxious type who over-worries, overthinks things way too much, and i'm also oversensitive when i feel i have been wronged... but depending on the toughness or sensibilities of the other person, i also find myself unwilling to stick up for myself too much. especially since i have found that i react way too badly sometimes when i'm upset, and when i know that i'm to blame partially for the situation, i know that anything i say might just dig me deeper than i was in the first place. so basically, back in may, i got super-excited about something... as i do sometimes. i have always been the type who gets way too excited about fandoms, particularly when i want to use them as an escape from reality (which probably is not healthy to begin with...) so i went searching for someone to commission to write a story i didn't have the motivation or energy to write myself. in my own way, i think i was also looking for new chat buddies, because all of my friends who i used to talk about fandoms with previously have become busy and less available, or they're not that interested in fandoms anymore. so i found someone who was taking commissions due to a family emergency, and i paid her forty dollars. she was clear upfront that when she could get to it would depend upon her muse, but that i wouldn't have to wait too long. in the end, she ended up refunding me after a week or two with a heartfelt apology, and i said i understood. and i did, especially since she was so polite about it. then i turned to a friend of hers (with her blessing), and that's where the trouble started. to be fair, i do have to say that a lot of this probably is my fault. when i get really excited about something, i sometimes start to develop certain expectations of a new person, especially since... as i indicated above, i have been pretty bored and lonely lately in the fandom departments, and i don't have much exciting going on in my life at times. so basically, i ran an idea by the new person, and she said she loved it. she also said she was going to be really busy, because she was working on a manuscript for professional publishing in july. so, just to be clear here, i paid her in may, and she said that it would take ""two weeks"", or possibly sometime in late june before she could really do anything on my commission. (i paid her seventy-five dollars; the previous person had been offering discounts due to the family emergency in the hopes of attracting more business more quickly.) now... to be fair here, i had never commissioned anyone to do any kind of writing before, so it is possible that i'm just not sure of the proper/standard etiquette, plus... i have seen independent individuals in the commission/crafting world tell others sometimes that 1: you can't rush art, and 2: that coming to them isn't the same as coming to a place in retail where everybody has a product available in two seconds. plus... i think there were maybe some minor areas i got a little too friendly too fast, because i have sometimes felt (especially on the internet) that if someone seems nice, and we seem to be hitting it off, we're potential bff material even if we're not. also, it probably doesn't help matters any that i changed my mind four times, (i wanna go with this idea, no maybe i want to cancel now, no maybe i want to do this instead... no i'd like to go back to the original idea we started off with...) and i can definitely see how that would drive someone nuts, because sometimes i can be incredibly long-winded in my emails, and i've been told by other people before that sometimes i don't articulate very well when i get over-excited or anxious, leaving others to wonder what i am trying to say, since a lot of my meaning sometimes gets lost in a lot of rambling. i have also driven others nuts sometimes due to my wishy-washyness, even my own family. and i'd have to say i acted wishy-washy in this case. in the end, (again, bear in mind that i paid her in may, i was assured she would probably start the project in june, and i waited until mid-july to follow up much, when i heard nothing) so i finally demanded a couple of days ago for some kind of response, saying i either needed some kind of reply, since i did pay her, or i needed a refund. she then got kinda brash about it, saying that yes i did pay her, but i had broken every rule of etiquette and i did not respect personal space because i had sent her multiple emails, notes on deviantart, and even posted on her profile wall once. and she also said that she had been upfront with me that she was busy, and simply said she wouldn't suffer any more pestering and that i should expect a refund by next sunday, minus five dollars due to the pestering. now... the thing is, i have pretty much decided to let the whole thing drop, because i pretty much consider it resolved now and if anything... i consider the entire matter to be a blessing in disguise, because it has shown me where i really do need to start working on some of my own behavior. i even deactivated my deviantart account and i backed off considerably from social media and fandom outlets, realizing that they are toxic to me and they make me very anxious... not to mention it's a bit too easy for me to get caught up in fandoms like a very unhealthy drug. but... i guess i have a bit too much of my mother in me, because there are still a few things that bug me about the entire matter. 1: on the person's own page, they said that they have a policy of trying to respond to any messages they receive within two business days, and if that is there policy, i didn't appreciate being ignored, especially since there were times when i was good at keeping my distance, and i didn't pester her at all during the month of july until i finally demanded a response, to which i got that catty response. 2: since she had originally assured me that she would begin my commission sometime in june, she could've at least done me the courtesy of keeping me up to date, on her own, if there were going to be any delays. i got absolutely nothing but silence out of her until i got more aggressive and demanded an answer in mid-july. honestly... i also feel that i should just let the entire matter slide and i probably did deserve her saying she would dock five dollars in a way, because i did dump a lot of text on her in at least three emails in a row in may, and i did send her a few notes on da and post on her profile wall once, and the poor woman probably felt bombarded, especially since she indicated she has mental issues and she has been very busy with a manuscript. to be fair, she might be anxious about pleasing her publisher, or maybe something even went wrong in the deal that disappointed her or she had to do rewrites, i don't know. i have a feeling i pressed the wrong buttons at the wrong time, which i am pretty good at doing since i can be a pest and sometimes i am not very tactful or considerate of other people's time. :/ i think in some ways... maybe i've also been getting a little too hyped up on my mom's attitude lately, and she's been adding to my ire in general, because she works in retail and it seems like any time we have any problems with people or them not acting fast enough or responding readily, she gets very, very angry and impatient, saying that if she responded so slowly or so badly in her line of work she'd be fired on the spot, and she's used to the idea that you are supposed to treat customers like royalty and she, in turn, excepts to be treated well whenever she's dealing with anyone in any kind of business venture. i can also hear her in my mind saying that if you commission someone, then that person should be treated like they are both the employee and manager/boss of their own little business and should be treating/responding to ""customers"" accordingly... although i'm not entirely sure if it really works quite like retail when you are dealing with an independent writer on deviantart who just does some writing on the side of a regular-based life/job or whatever.... so... i think i applied this mentality to this woman i commissioned, where i expected her to be my buddy, and maybe i expected her to be my friend and be willing to go over any text i sent her at the drop of a hat just because i had paid her, i don't know. when... i should have realized from the start that it was gonna be strictly professional, and i probably should have been more organized and decided what i was gonna do and what i wanted before i contacted her, and before i started bombarding her and changing my mind a lot. in the end, the entire episode left me anxious, left me overthinking and nitpicking to death about what i did wrong and what i feel she did wrong, and what everybody did wrong, and i even got upset over it a few times and even cried about it once or twice. i also feel like i've had some bratty entitlement issues over the entire thing, because... maybe i feel like i deserved her to be like my buddy and speak to me well, just because i paid her seventy-five dollars, even though she ""owed"" me nothing of the sort really. :/ in the end, i want to just forget that it happened. i pretty much cut ties with her and i'm just awaiting the refund, (money has always been a really sensitive issue for me anyway, particularly since i don't have that much to spare), and i have a feeling that if i say or do anything else at this point, it will probably just make everything worse, particularly since i think i expected too much too fast (insta-buddy!), not to mention i did bombard her a bit and i changed my mind about what i wanted or didn't want at least four times over the span of a month, which probably stressed her out and confused her on top of everything else she has to deal with right now. just... i don't know. >.< if nothing else, it felt good just to organize my feelings on the matter and vent a little, i'm not sure what i'm looking for here or if this is even the appropriate forum/area to do this. i just know i learned one thing. i am never gonna do this again, since i've found i just really can't handle it and i come across as more of a disorganized pest than anything, and... i'm just not really gonna get involved in fandoms as much anymore, because i seem to develop very high expectations and it's almost like i want the writing equivalent of burger king, have it done your way and have it done fast. :/ not to mention i shouldn't be using fandoms as a substitute/escape from reality anyway, at least not religiously.",224,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"please help, my days are ruined hej, i'm 24 years old an posted a similar thread in the sexual category. i've had a couple of very nice responses there, but my mind is still going in circles...so i came here to see if this might be more anxiety driven obsessive behavior. a bit about myself: i am still a virgin, but had sexual encounters with the opposite sex on quite a few occasions and really enjoyed them when i did. i'm very indecisive and need a lot of approval from the outside world and do let my (mainly female friends) make decisions for me (also in terms of who i should/shouldn't date/ have sex with). they don't actively say that, but i always contemplate what would they think of me if i had sex with this guy... about a month and a half ago i visited a friend and was in quite a rut, i was unhappy for no real reasons (that only happend to me throughout this last year of my masters it was mainly due to my looks that i was very in confident in and my inability to make friends easily) and wondered why. also meeting new people at her erasmus made me nervous as i have social anxiety. when we came into the kitchen i got struck by the beauty of her female flatmates (long her, feminine dressing and bodies) and i though 'oh my god, i must be gay'. from there on i panicked and started checking whether or not i am actually attracted to women or men (everyone i saw). i started going over my past encounters with men, questioning why i never went further with them and if that i didn't indicated i'm gay. i got stuck in my mind, encapsuled myself and went back home to my family where i cried myself to sleep every night. i have never felt so uncertain and i took every test that i could find on the internet googleing how do i know if i'm gay? of course when the answer was straight i felt relieve for some time, but then got back at it again. when the answer was gay or bi i lost it and started getting air shortage/ heart racing and panic attacks. it just doesn't feel right to me. (no offense here, i grew up in a very accepting surrounding, i have lesbian/gay friends and my parents are also okay with that) ever since i am more aware of womens bodies when i am around them, always questioning am i attracted to that? it gives me a lot of anxiety and pain as i am by now not really able to tell what actually is attraction and what is just appreciation of a beautiful human or 'normal attention' given to the same sex. when i dream i usually dream about being with males, actually never a woman. when masturbating i think of a man being turned on by me and how i could turn him on best. (is that weird in itself?) when i try to imagine being with a woman i feel either nothing or need to start burping which is usually my sign for 'nah not for me'. thinking of men makes me happy, but nevertheless i am questioning the reality of my feelings as i was never good at pinpointing them down. when i'm with my friends i feel like of 'course your straight, no attraction whatsoever' again until anxiety hits me and i try to look for tension when we touch. but it's not a sexual 'zing', more an awareness of the other body that i feel and it is not nice. romantically i definitley had crushes on boys, butterflies, heart racing, stomach drop, everything. when it comes to girls i head one really deep friendship whit a girl i admired i found her so cool (the way she dresse, was confident) and i am now questioning whether that was a crush or just me seeking a role-model? it was never sexual with her although we got changed in front of eachother and had a lot of sleep-overs/went on holiday togehter. of course i thought 'oh she looks really good in that bra' but more in a sense of 'i wish my boobs were not as wonky and more like hers'. now i'm questioning whether that was all or if my wanting to be like her/admiration ment more. it gives me anxiety spikes talking to her and i just want to be able to return to our normal friendship! with men i always dream about finding the man that make me laugh and i a am happy with and i had a couple of good friendships that turned into more, which is the point i backed out for various reasons (mostly me having lied about being a virgin, friends saying 'you really like him?' and me then questioning it) although i want to be liked/ dress up for men i am shy when it comes to speaking to them and i can't seem to find the right words to make myself interesting to them which make me angry at myself. i can easily talk to girls and i used to think it's because there's 'nothing at stake' sexually. i am so confused! after spending most of my time on formus like this reading around coming out and anxiety stories, it's just enough...why can't i know what i feel? yesterday i took a flexuality test that was recommended in this for mum, once i answered what i hope/believe to be true which came out with mostly straight and a tat of ambisexual. then i took the test again answering all the questions with uncetain or the middle scale as i really don't know how i feel/can't determine what i feel and it popped up with mostly ambisexual, but still quite a lot of straight. (almost same) which made me feels super anxious and i went back to the forum to reassure myself that i am not lesbian. in the test it also indicated some sort of change in my sexuality which gave me another hit and i thought no that's not true, but started questioning it afterwards. it is true i don't feel as feminine at the moment, but that is due to a way to short haircut that gives me a lot of insecurities as i just want to be back to my normal girly seductive self. i am now constantly afraid someon ecould assume that i was a lesbian due to my haircut and i try to dress purposely female. that mostly females complimented me on my hair doesn't make it any better. i a pretty certain that i don't want to have a penis so i'm trying not to give too much attention to that part of the test. but does my not-so-feminie-feeling mean that i have to be attracted to girls? am i aware of girls more because they radiate what i want back for myself? this morning i woke up still dreaming about being with a boy, i thought oh there it is you're straight and fell back asleep. when i woke up again my mind went 'are you really'' and i started checking again, not knowing what the true answer is. i am so tired of this. please help.",226,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"cure anxiety picture of my situation with parents, and then solution, i am very curious if anyone tried and whether it helped them. my father is mentally ill, abused me until i left when i was 18, physically and mentally. he has himself mental issues but was trying to persuade me it is me who need help. during 28 years of marriage, he had a part time job for 4 years, living from the social support and my mother´s money. my mother was neglecting me, later she told me it was because of my father´s breakdown and the fact that my brother was born ill (he is ok now). my brother is 5 years younger, 4 years after school living at my parent´s house, earns 250 dollars per month that he spends on expensive clothing and mobile phones. so all 3 of them are living mostly from my mother´s money. i do not live at home for 10 years now. i used to go home once in 6 weeks for a weekend, my mother pays for the ticket - like 50 dollars or so. they never forget to mention how much money it is and how much money do they have to spend on me during those 2 days at home. i feel my parents do not take me as their chid. everytime i have a little argue with a family member (casual, nothing extreme), my father run towards me, calling me names, kicking me out of the house - without knowing what we are arguing about (like i needed computer for 30 minutes to write an e-mail but my brother wanted to watch a movie on it despite the fact he has a tv and another computer in his room...). my father calls me a bitch, @@@@@@@, frigid slut - that only declares that he very easily loses his nerves. after that incident, i decided to leave right away and do not contact them. my father told my mother not to talk to me, so it was my birthday and she only sended me a message on the phone. when i asked her why she did not respond, she replied she had healthy issues. i have finished one university and now i am attending another, thanks to my husband who is very supportive. i have traveled a lot, without help of my parents, without their money (no regular money from them since i was 19). but they still prefere my brother who was for 4 years lying in the bed in our parent´s house. they treat him like a god, giving him money and me like a stupid naive girl, like i am not able to take care of myself. i have anxiety because of that because i believe i am a stupid cow, i do not believe myself, i am trembling everytime i have a task in the school even i am doing very well and was never kicked out of any exam. i always expect failure in my life. no matter how many times i have won. i love my parents so much, i love them with all my heart and i am desperate i have no contact with them. i need their support so much but they are just not willing/capable to give it to me.... maybe it will be better not to contact them for a period of time, not to be treated like a dumb person, make me feel guilty they do not have money because of me despite the fact i am not living with them for 10 years.... this is pushing me down, because i believe them, i believe every word they say about how incompetent i am. is it ok to cut them off for some period of time? i am trying and feel horrible about it like i cannot stand this situation. is there anyone else who tried to cope with it the same way? i am asking because i do not want to cause myself depression or worsen my anxiety.",233,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"successful resolution of anxiety induced delusions for years my wife have been diagnosed with depression, bipolar 2 and anxiety. in the last few years she had also developed mild alcohol use disorder, which of course made things worse. after shequit drinking in january, she started experiencing a number of paranoid delusions, including a pedophile ring closing in on our kids, the community hacking her account to paint her as a racist and run her out of town, and me taking our kids and flying away. there were no hallucinations or bizarre delusions, just believing a bunch of things that there was no factual basis of. initially the doctor put her on lithium, which did no good. further discussions with the therapist resulted in treating her illness as primarily anxiety-driven with obsessive traits. i had no idea that delusions could be anxiety driven, but they can be. they switched her to a low dose of olanzapine and prozac. she's 45 and perimenopausal, so she needed also a supplement of progesterone. she also takes xanax as needed during the day, which is usually a couple of times. i don't think we're done fine-tuning the medication, but it is made an unbelievable difference in our lives. she has also done an amazing job with her therapy and dealing with her childhood emotional issues that have been unresolved for so long. she still has work to do on that, but is making great progress. i just wanted to pass along this success story in hopes that it might help someone else",235,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"second hand stress and anxiety i believe that my anxiety level is moderate and i can manage. but this becomes high due to my surroundings (my parents, hubby and my brother). my dad is constantly stress, cannot relax and in situation where he is not familiar, he become panicky. he is always rushing after time as if there is an emergency. his whole body gesture, his tone of voice etc ... just make one more stressed out. he is a friendly guy. when he needs me to do things for him, he would just pester me, pressurized me ... until i do things the way he wants. otherwise, he is ok. my mum is a narcissistic and she knows how to pull my emotionally cord. she needs me to fulfilled her needs and if i don't, i feel kind of guilty. i now avoid spending too much time with her or else i feel drained out. my husband just scared the hell out of me when i tell him things like i nearly twisted my ankle on a trail. he would dramatized, make a fuss about it even over small things sometimes he makes me so scrared that i cannot think by myself, all my common sense disappeared. all i can think of is ""do as he said"" even if i don't want to. hidding things from him makes me more peaceful. i met him when i was 13 years and i am now 49. it is like he has brainwashed me. when i see my parents no. on the phone, i become stressed ! there are times when i don't answer because either it is to hear my mum on going lamentation or i need to do things for them. my brother does not work, lives on dad's money and spend his time travelling. he is so lazy and does not want to take care of anything. my parents keep asking me to ""compensate"" for his shortcomimgs as i am a very capable person when he isn't. my brother is 47 years old. i am a highly intuitive sensitive person, an empath, kind, considerate, enjoy the simple things of life. ii have also ocd and may be a little border line personality. i usually take good care of my parents. but this year, i become fed with people in general as i find they are too complicated, everyone just thinking about their own ""convenience"". i started to change, not giving a damn about anyone. but this is creating havoc because i don't do as my parents said. i listened to my hubby recently as he made me scared and as result i was the only one paying for the consequences. where i am, i just want to be on my own.",263,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"intense anxiety in school, fear of fainting/collapsing there i know that the anxiety comes on in school because i hate school and feel very uncomfortable there, but i've got to find some ways to cope with it. even on a good day i will still feel some anxiety. i have this fear of fainting/collapsing in school even though i've never fainted before and i know that i probably never will even during my worst panic attacks. once i start to get nervous, i begin feeling lightheaded and then i just worry and panic that i might pass out. this is much scarier if i've had coffee (obviously), but i refuse to give up coffee.i have given up coffee for weeks at a time when it's gotten really bad, but the anxiety is still there and i always go back to coffee. how do i just convince myself that nothing is going to happen and avoid the panic/anxiety attacks in school?",264,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"issue regarding my attempts with desensitizing so, when i was at therapy a few months ago (we haven't touched upon it since, since we're working on other things) my therapist mentioned desensitization... specifically with fire, since i've been working on other issues (like my fear of crowds) without therapy's help. she mentioned how it usually is done with just photos and the like. idk why but my mind usually rationalizes things until it's physically near me. i think it has to do with how a lot of things died around me when i was 3 years old in fire. but... being 21 now, it's really frustrating it still affects me. i was panicking at the grill w/ my boyfriend. and photos don't bother me, but if i'm so much as 3-4 feet near a fire - even a camp fire, my mind goes into panic mode. i feel really dumb. ><",265,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"i'm new ... hi everyone. i'm new to psychforum i'm in the uk and i'm studying a master's degree at university. i was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder in 2010, and will the lots of intervention i did manage to get a lot better, despite it being very severe for me. in 2013, i was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder instead ; i still had issues when it came to socialising, but they were less severe than they'd been, but i now had problems day to day, more generally. i struggled through my undergraduate degree, and i got great grades but at times i was just not leaving the house at all for weeks, i had no friends whatsoever and i was having frequent panic attacks. after graduating, i became a bit better, managed to work in a shop, though i was using some serious coping mechanisms for this and it was a very unique setup in that i only worked with 2 other people, who i knew from primary school. i applied for a master's degree, because i thought that i was making so much progress, it was a good time to do so, but unfortunately my health has taken a huge dip. i began to get symptoms i'd not experienced before; flashbacks of abuse from my father during childhood, long dissociative periods where i couldn't remember doing important things like paying bills or walking half a mile to the shops. in 2016 i was diagnosed with complex post traumatic stress disorder (c-ptsd), and i am now under a community mental health team (cmht), taking sertraline 100mg/d and propranolol, in a new city (i relocated for my master's), and i am again just about managing to do the bare minimum in terms of my course. getting great grades but doing all of it from home due to being so anxious and panicky that i will have a flashback or dissociative period when i am at uni. i also suffer from systemic lupus erythematous (sle) which, for me, causes fatigue, rashes (incl a 'butterfly' rash across my face), joint inflammation and pain. it also causes me to have attacks of scintillating scomata, which essentially means that i randomly lose my vision without warning sometimes, and this can last anywhere between 15 minutes to 3 hours. i am currently really super depressed because in the past, i have had to deal with one of these issues at once, but now i am suffering from all of them at the same time and i just feel like there is so little that i can do at the moment, and i don't have much fun, considering i am only 24! i am wondering if anyone has any advice at all on how to become more active, slowly. i have been close to incapacitated by social anxiety before, and i made incredible amounts of progress with the help of meds, cbt and other therapies. when i was 15 i genuinely thought my life was over and i'd never be able to do anything, because i could hardly leave the house, and simply couldn't do things like catch a bus at all. but the fact that i came out of the other side of that once before gives me the strength to know that i can do it again, in time (maybe a lot of time). i really am hoping to start getting better and feel like i have a better quality of life, and i'm not afraid of putting in the hard work that i know it'll take, but i'm just absolutely at a loss as to where to start right now :/. i've been considering paying for a private support worker - someone who can come with me the first few times to things that i want to be doing in the longer term, like going to the gym, or an art class, or new places in this city i've recently moved to, as i don't have the ability to make friends i can do with with right now, but i'm not sure if this would be totally sad and pathetic and i don't want to make someone feel uncomfortable, like i'm paying them for companionship. any advice is much appreciated, and i'd love to hear all about other people's experiences too.",267,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"i cry. a lot. hi, i am new to this forum. i am a 17 year old female. this problem has been around for a long time now, maybe 9 years now. every time something slightly troublesome comes up, i have an overwhelming urge to cry. this can be as minor as confronting a teacher about a grade, talking to a friend about my grades, or asking my parents something related to my mental health without trying to give away too many details that i am not doing well mentally. i know this is linked to stress and anxiety. but it has come to a point where i am in a full-blown cry after my parents talk to me in a slightly hostile voice. i just don't know what to do. i cry a lot in public too, and i have to try my best to hide it with my glasses and sleeves. when a teacher calls on me to answer something, and i get it wrong, i break down. i know it sounds like this is some teenager hormone issue, but none of my other friends go through this to the degree i do. i also feel like this may have some attachment to having slight (undiagnosed) depression, but again i cry in situations that have no relation to being depressed. i know diagnosis is not allowed on this website, but i am curious to see if crying way too much is a symptom of anything else. thanks.",268,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"chronic over worrying and self blaming to say that i worry a lot would be a massive understatement. i worry to the point that it is debilitating. recently, i have actually lost some weight due to not being able to eat because of worry. while i could stand to drop a few pounds, it's bad that it is happening this way. i also have an extreme fear of abandonment. that is due to the fact that i have been abandoned in the past by people who i thought were my friends. people that i loved dearly. there is someone in my life now who i absolutely love with all of my heart. this person and i share a very special bond. i know that nothing is forever, but i want this person in my life for as long as they can possibly be. for the remainder of our lives if possible. recently, when this person failed to reply to messages, i got worried to the point that i could not function. i mean, i could not eat or sleep. i thought for certain that i had done something to make them no longer want to have anything to do with me, even though i could not think of anything that i may have done. i just knew that i had to have done something. someone told me that i was worried over nothing. that this person not replying probably had nothing to do with me personally. i could see their point. however, what bothered me was, it just was not like this person to just flat out not respond like this. even if they were otherwise occupied, they would always tell me that. plus, they would even say something like ""hit me up tomorrow when i will have more time to talk"". but, this time, there was nothing. i got a really bad vibe from it. i went into such a state of worry. i broke down emotionally. then, i tried again the next day. i figured i had nothing to lose. also, as someone pointed out to me, if she truly wanted nothing more to do with me, then she would just unfriend and/or block me, and in fact, would have already done it by now. so, i try again the next day, and she replies and everything seems okay. i was greatly relieved, and i asked if everything was alright, because she had me worried when she did not reply the day before. she said that that had absolutely nothing to do with me. i was glad to hear that, but i still worried a little. i took that to mean that she was not replying to anyone else either. i wasn't sure, because she did not elaborate on it. i have this issue where i worry. i worry to a point that i can not think straight. it interferes with my daily life when i am in such a state of worry. i forget to do things. i walk around in a perpetual daze. i hate that i get like this. but, it seems like it is out of my control. plus, there is the self blame. i immediately assume that something is all my fault. if someone acts strange, or out of character, then i automatically think that it is because of me personally. and even when i can't think of anything that i may have done, i convince myself that i most certainly have done something and it was completely and totally unforgivable. should i seek professional help for this? perhaps get on some sort of medication? i need to do something because it is to a point where i am afraid that i am going to worry myself physically sick. or, if it gets too out of control, i may harm myself. any thoughts?",271,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"*tw* im getting obsessed over someone and its not helping *** trigger warning *** hi, im david. this is quite a long one so please bare with me. for quite a long time now, i cant get this guy out of my head. there's not a moment where i dont think about him. whenever i receive messages, i always hope he's the sender. i get very happy and excited when i do get messages from him (most of the time its about schoolwork). i think about wanting to spend more time with him, and also the possible moments i'd be spending with him in the future. i wont say we're friends, more like acquaintances. he's really nice and most of the time seeing him instantly brightens my day. i really like him. there's times where he'd walk around near to my seat and observe what i'm doing, he'd go to me when he needs help understanding our lessons, and at times i see him stealing glances at me and i just pretend i dont notice. now you could say that its just me being hopeful or im just being desperate, whatever it is, he makes me feel special. lately, ive been very depressed, a lot of stuff just builds up and form into this one big monster of a downer. there was a time back then when i thought perhaps i have mental/emotional issues. i'm anxious about everything and for maybe the past 2 years and im gloomy more often than not, but back then i somehow managed to stay and feel ""normal"". it's not until lately that things got really worse and unbearable. i feel useless and insignificant, everything about school just makes it worse, a lot of deadlines, everyone is better than me at everything, i fear what future is there for a failure like me and on top of that, i'm lonely. i have friends but not ones i could open up to and ask help with my depressive thoughts. i have no one to ask for help, i dont have the balls to ask even my family, so i walked the darkness alone and everything just accumulated. i feel bound and isolated. if im not thinking about a particular problem, another one rears its ugly head and takes the spotlight. day in, day out, the problems eats me up non-stop. it's like a huge truck running over me again and again. all the problems from way back, came back and stacked up with the rest. there were moments where id just cease to function. i feel like theres no future for me, or if there is, i fear its not worth living if all i will ever experience is the same pain and suffering and loneliness i am feeling right now. i felt like there was no way out. the other night, i was contemplating suicide. amidst the cold darkness, there was that guy, the one i talked about earlier. he's my ray of sunshine. that night i was so ready to say goodbye to this world, to meet my end and be free from all the $#%^. i was laying there in my bed thinking how i'm going to kick the bucket. ive never felt so low and utterly helpless. i breathed in and out fully accepting that day as my last, then i heard a ding! from my phone. it was him. now he didnt say anything miraculous or holy that blessed me with the will to throw away that blade and live another day, well in a way he did. he just said 'i need help chapter 1-3'. i laughed silly at how this tiny message did all the wonders that got me up my bed, take my book, check what sorcery lies in chapter 1-3 and toss that blade away. i thought of the many great moments i have and i could spend with this guy in the future, we could even be close friends. that, im not willing to throw away. now here's my problem. i'm afraid to lose him. in a year, we'd be graduating college. he'd be gone and we'd be going our separate ways. i'm afraid what future there wont be without him. whats going to be my sunshine then? how am i going to find hope during dark times if he aint around? its seems im getting obsessed with him. thinking of losing him just adds to the still fresh wounds of depression. i know a lot can happen in a year, but right now, i need help dealing with this obsession, how do i stop relying on him as my sole saviour? how am i gonna accept the slowly but surely approaching end? should i just forget him? how should i deal with all this? take it how you will, for you it may seem petty or trivial, but for me, right now at this moment, it means a lot. it may hold my future of either sinking back to depression or finally moving on. thanks. last edited by shock_the_monkey on thu mar 29, 2018 1:01 pm, edited 2 times in total. reason: added trigger warnings.",273,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"weed + anxiety + medication hello guys. i am a 22 year old girl with social & general anxiety, bpd, and depression. i started smoking weed recreationally when i was around 16. i was on medication, but found that most of the time i had a good high. i was carefree and laughing nonstop. i stopped smoking for a bit and when i started again, i was probably on different medications, but for the same thing-- just normal anti depressants. i've always noticed that i get significantly higher than the people i smoke with. it makes me a bit self conscious but i figured it wasn't anything serious aside from maybe a bit of an annoyance to the people who chose to smoke with me. i honestly never even considered it could be my medications mixing until i was about 18 and took one hit from a bowl and got so high that i was hallucinating. my friend that was with me at the time didn't express any concern and actually seemed quite annoyed with how panicked i was. i ended up just laying there twitching and afraid until i fell asleep. i wasn't sure why it happened but it scared the crap out of me, so i did some research, chalked it up to the weed not mixing well with my medications, and i didn't smoke for a while after that. i've hallucinated 2 other times after smoking and was terrified but at least i knew what to do when i came across that situation. in the past year or so i have been smoking weed often, usually multiple times a week. i am still on antidepressants and benzos. i still find that i get higher than the people i smoke with. when i am high, i like to be alone or with my boyfriend. if i'm around people, i get extremely anxious and paranoid and worry that i might start hallucinating or something. i also get extremely nervous that everyone around me thinks i'm high, or even if they know i'm high, that they'll think i'm acting too weird. even after my high dissipates, lately, like in the past few weeks i've noticed pretty significant paranoia, disassociation, and just a general weird, uneasy feeling. despite all of this, i don't really want to stop smoking weed because, when the circumstances are right, i do have a really good high. it makes everything more enjoyable (especially sex lol), but only if i'm alone, or with my boyfriend, who is pretty much the only person i would allow to see me high anymore. is this normal? has this ever happened to anyone else? if so, could you describe what happened, i'm really curious about this. i'm wondering should i just stop smoking altogether? if i don't, could anything serious happen because of the medications not interacting well with the weed? could i go insane or something? also wondering if it could be beneficial to come off my medications and smoke weed medically? would the weed actually be helpful for my anxiety if i were to go off my medication? i don't want to be stupid and go off my medication, but it really isn't working for me. i'm not sure what to do. it's so confusing to me that weed actually helps some people with their anxiety when it makes me so paranoid. *****************also, i have only smoked medical marijuana in the past year and have hallucinated once during that time. i also wasn't sure which board to post this in, so i'm sorry is it doesn't belong here!! >.< thanks for your help guys. <3",278,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"weed + anxiety + medication hmmmm, so my experience: when i started smoking weed, i really enjoyed it. i was a lightweight and definitely had hallucinations -- i think it's possible that the weed hit me so hard *because* i had anxiety, so i was very attuned to what my body was feeling so i paid much closer attention to the differences in my body than other people. or maybe i'm just a lightweight i wasn't taking any medications at this time, so it's just definitely the way i am naturally. i kept smoking, occasionally hallucinating but usually not, and always getting much higher than everyone else. however, i started having panic attacks more and more often (incredibly anxious during and afterwards to the point where i'd feel sick) and i think they got worse because i had more and more bad experiences of being high built up. one day (maybe 9 months after i started smoking weed), i got high with my boyfriend (nothing different then usual), and he drove us to get fast food. and i got sick. i was disassociating and had severe nausea and i thought i was going to die. i made him park the car because i was so afraid that if it moved, i'd get so sick that i'd actually die. we sat in the parking lot for four hours (i kept waiting for the high to wear off so i could calm down, but the feeling never lessened or went away) until i finally told him to take me home. when i got home, i couldn't sit up in bed for a week straight -- each time i did, i thought the nausea was too bad and i thought i'd die. i was disassociating and i felt like i couldn't see anything and nothing was real. i had to always have an apple and glass of water on my bedstand because i was convinced that if that happened to me again and i didn't have an apple or water, i'd die. my mom took me to every urgent care and the doctors kept telling me they had no idea what was wrong with me -- we thought it was something physical. turns out the weed had triggered a severe panic attack, which in turn triggered anxiety, severe ocd, and agoraphobia. i didn't leave my house for two months because i was so afraid that i'd have another attack and be isolated and not be able to get to a place where i could save myself from being sick like that again and dying. the disassociation was constant for those two months. for the following six months or so, i was physically able to go outside, but i still got nausea and dizziness and general panic/anxiety (so still agoraphobia) and i would have periods where disassociation would roll over me. it was terrifying. i wasn't able to ride in cars because i had severe panic attacks and disassociation for over two years, and i stopped being able to eat food because i was so afraid that it could have lsd or cannabis in it (getting high again was my worst fear and i was convinced i'd die if i had a second experience like that). i'm finally, three years later, somewhat close to as stable as where i used to be, but i feel like i lost a couple years of my life in that breakdown. i really don't think your reaction is because of your medication. over the span of eight months, my body's reaction to weed morphed significantly, and i think it's just part of the chemicals in your body changing in your teens and twenties. my best friend, who has anxiety, ocd, and bipolar disorder, is on medications and uses weed medically. it's been incredibly helpful to her and none of my friends on medications have found a negative correspondence between weed and meds. everyone's bodies are different and some people are helped by weed, but it's not abnormal to have paranoid and anxious reactions to weed. recently, a few of my other friends, who have been smoking for years and didn't have much anxiety before have both gone to the er for panic attacks that ended up turning into anxiety disorders. weed can do that to people! it's really such a varied response. weed can definitely be fun, but if you're already having paranoid reactions to it, i would say that's likely how your body processes weed and you shouldn't use it as your primary medication, because there's a chance it won't have anti-anxiety effects. so to answer your questions: what you experience when you get high is normal. my experience, i think, is a pretty worst case scenario, but it is something that happens. (my dad worked in a psychiatric hospital in the 80's and a lot of the people he saw had schizophrenia induced by cannabis & lsd overusage in the 60's). i'd say that if weed so far hasn't been very helpful for your anxiety, i wouldn't use it as a primary medication -- i'd suggest finding an anxiety medication that works well for you and then choosing to smoke weed or not on top of that. in my own experience, i wish i had stopped smoking when i first noticed the panic attacks and disassociation, but so it goes. i don't think you could go insane from the medications interacting with weed, but weed by itself, especially combined with a predisposition for mental disorders can have negative physical and mental effects. (i'm still salty that it helps so many people and not me). continue to smoke weed if you'd like -- it can be fun and it could be a large part of your lifestyle -- but make sure to seek other help for your anxiety and be aware that it can affect you negatively!",279,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"weed + anxiety + medication you sound a bit like the constant battle between my parents and me over weed in one person. haha, a real conflicting answer here, because, i really support weed smoking, i do it daily myself, and have been for over 6 years. now i was on antidepressants and stimulants for 4 years and i smoked weed regularly for maybe 2 of those years in total and went mad, got sectioned and switched to meds for bipolar disorder along with a new diagnosis. the new meds do help, and i now know that i was bipolar, and that the antidepressants and stimulants were keeping me in a hypomanic state, and i literally always felt buzzed/anxious or on edge. weed also does this, medical or otherwise. weed can increase or decrease anxiety, it's a bit of a stimulant and depressant, and hallucinogen, so yes all the effects you are feeling are normal. since i came off the antidepressants, and only take stimulants recreationally or at raves, i haven't ""gone mad"", and i have been smoking weed every day though, so this proves to me that the combination of weed and meds, or just the meds on their own were causing an increase in my anxiety, which is understandable as the antidepressants have a mania-inducing/stimulating effect on bipolar patients and stimulants are stimulants, and weeds a bit of one so, self explanitory. all you need to do now is ask yourself do you want to continue taking it, is it helping you enough to keep on taking the risk getting a hold of, and smoking , ? at least you know you wont die or anything on it!",280,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"anhedonia and racing thoughts hi, i'm a 24 years old former university student and i have a generalized anxiety disorder developed after a depression followed by a burnout. my depression stopped about 2 years ago shortly before my burnout, in a silent bang where i went from crying 5 times a day to feeling absolutely nothing but numbness. my depression used to give me a very high libido somehow, my emotions were all over the place then i lost it all with my libido in the matter of a day. i went on with my life hoping that my problems would go away in due time, anti-depressant didn't help as they just numbed my emotions even further. then, i suffered a burnout at university after a really difficult schoolwork and 5 days without sleeping. i thought i was becoming psychotic or dying, these possibility have been ruled out since, but my everyday anxiety has been somewhat recurring ever since that day. after my extensive preventive checkup with my psychiatrist, i was prescribed some clonazepam for my anxiety to use about once a week when needed (i'm very scared of benzo addiction so i only take them once a month) the only thing that seems to make me happy is drinking alcohol just enough to be tipsy, it doesn't make me aggressive or much dumber than i usually am, but it makes me so much more outgoing and happy, despite the numbness in my head that never leaves me like a football player slowly crushing my skull with his elbow. so i drank some coffee today and while i usually feel empty and nonchalant, which doesn't bother me usually because of how sedated from the anhedonia, a single cup of coffee was enough to give me the worst racing thoughts and i almost immediately started overanalysing everything so promptly, logically and pragmatically like a supercomputer and answering meaningless metaphysical and philosophical questions leading nowhere, coming from nowhere, i couldn't breath for a moment. the torture never ended until i hit the hay. does anyone have a clue what's wrong with me? is there a way i could stop these racing thoughts from torturing me and keeping me awake? sometimes i get these episodes for no reason, but the coffee always seems to trigger it, it's frightening and i feel like i'll lose my mind (there it is, another racing thought that keeps coming back: ""am i losing my mind?"")",282,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"unable to laugh after a panic attack? i haven't posted on this forum in years but i browse relatively frequently. while i have dealt with diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety for eight years i have never received long term treatment, though i have made an appointment to see someone later this month. my reason for posting here today has to do with a particularly bad bout of anxiety and depression the likes of which i have not faced since the onset eight years ago. to put it simply, my closest friend inadvertently did and said the very things that triggered the original reaction all those years ago and i was immediately reliving every detail in that moment. all of the progress i had made was vaporized and i suffered a total breakdown that night, which the worst of lasted for a few days. this is day six. while i am feeling quite a bit better i have not 100% recovered and become my old self again. while i am now at least able to function at work, eat again, and not feel nauseated all day i have run into a new problem. after the panic attack i had on the 13th of february i have found it extremely difficult to smile or laugh at things even if i find them hysterical. i have not gotten any more attacks and this is the first i've had in eight years. i am just wondering if anyone else has experience with this sort of thing? there is a slightly numb and empty feeling inside of me that was never there before despite the lingering anxiety and depression over the years. before i was able to cope. i was able to smile and laugh hysterically and life was pretty alright i suppose. after this attack though all of that seems broken? will this go away on its own after a couple of weeks or months or is medication / therapy the only option now?",283,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"not having anxiety makes me feel anxiety hi everybody! so i am 23 years old, and i dealt with anxiety starting at 5 years old, got on zoloft at age 10 for extreme ocd and anxiety and wanting to die because it was so bad. it helped. i started smoking weed when i was 17. tried mushrooms 3 times when i was 19, the first time i had an extreme realization of being alive and just how amazing everything is. i started to try to ween myself off of zoloft, which i did over the course of about 6 months. during that time a lot of anxiety came back. i then tried a mild form of a hallucinogen called 5-meo-dmt, which is that first time i experienced a sense of depersonalization or derealizarion. it was a feeling of hyper-awareness of how your body is commanded by your brain without you actually having to make yourself move, and also a feeling of lagging in mental response time. any way, after i did that, i couldn’t smoke weed anymore because it caused me to have a lot of anxiety. the hallucinogens i have tried have caused feelings in me i had never felt before, most of them were unpleasant, and i still feel them sometimes. after i tried dmt (at age 20), i ended up taking effexor for about 5 months, in combination with abilify for about the first 2 months, but now i don’t take anything and i honestly have moments that i’ve never felt better than ever. i also felt pretty great my first 2-4 years of taking zoloft. i tried smoking weed again for a while but had to stop due to it causing me to have paranoid thoughts, mostly dissociative feelings, or derealization. i honestly cannot explain how it made me feel. i guess you can say it was depersonalization but not really. i just felt or maybe had the thought even that nothing around me is real, it just feels like a dream that doesn’t feel real in a way. but during those moments i can also have extreme realizations about reality. ..... so the point of this post is that sometimes, my anxiety gets so low in a way (i say this because it seems as though sometimes my anxiety levels get so low, that i start to have anxiety in a different way because i’m not used to not having anxiety, so feeling different scares me). it’s like everything starts to feel so real that it starts to feel unreal. it’s like i’m having a new perspective that i don’t know how to interpret. i start to literally feel like this isn’t real, everything is not actually existing just a projection, or something like that. it’s weird because in a way i feel like i almost always have some for of dissociation, but just from general stress or anxiety. it’s like when you’re stressing out in your head, you’re not totally emotionally or mentally engaged in what’s going on around you, and you don’t feel as connected as you want to. but it’s not that things feel unreal in a sense as they do when you’re having a derealization attack. i really need help, advice, maybe something to help myself or say to myself. i tell myself, “everything is real. it’s okay. relax. you’ll be okay.” and i pray a lot. it ends up going away. but can anyone explain this? or help me to feel better about it or have any tips to cure that? i honestly do not want to take artificial medication. thank you so much.",291,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"gad with paranoia and impulsiveness with emotions? i see this post is a few weeks old, but i just wanted to say that i have very similar feelings. as of now, i have not seen a psychologist and i am not on any medications, so i guess it's not related to those. these ""paranoid"" thoughts began for me a few years ago (i am now 30). i don't remember what triggered them, but at one point i was travelling constantly for work and i read something online about people getting spied on in hotel rooms. that made me start feeling paranoid that i was being watched in rooms, that people were out to get me. those feelings made me worried that i was developing some form of clinical paranoia and that threw me into severe panic attacks. i realize that it's unreasonable, and i know that people aren't really out to get me, but the panic associated with those feelings is absolutely real. sometimes i get the idea that people know my secrets and that they want to use them against me. like you, it makes me want to just come out and say them. it's absolutely relieving to know that someone else feels the same way, and it makes me feel like i'm not going crazy. i haven't quite figured out how to deal with these thoughts outside of riding them out, but i'm going to try and schedule a meeting with a doc sooner than later because these thoughts and feelings are getting old.",299,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"can’t stop quitting work hey guys this is my first post. i’m new to the forum. a quick background about me is i have suffered from debilitating anxiety since i was middle school. even as a child i was extremely shy and anti social so unsure if it goes back that far but middle school is when i really noticed it affecting my life. fast forward to november of last year when i had a nervous breakdown and because of it lost my job. i was absent a lot or left early. i just couldn’t keep focusing on work. i wasn’t happy, i got divorced in 2015 and ever since i’ve dealt with a very vindictive narcissistic ex who would do anything it seems to hurt me and take my money. we have a 3 year old little girl between us. i’m a very loving father and i wanted the family she didn’t. well anyway at the time my ex was dating someone who’s been in and out of jail and was just a bad guy and i didn’t want him around my daughter. the stress of untreated anxiety and panic disorder toppled with that just drove me to a nervous breakdown. i was in and out of the hospital 3 times in one month. since i have been put on an anti depressant for the first time as i have refused ever since and it has worked wonders. my anxiety is almost entirely under control however i do not understand and this brings me to the point of this post....ever since my nervous breakdown i can’t stick with any jobs. i have quit 2-3 at this point this year. i don’t seem to stay longer then 2-3 months. i currently work from home and believe it or not i’m still feeling like i can’t stay. i’m already so close to quitting and it’s only been 2 months since i started. don’t get me wrong i really like my job but i still somehow can’t make myself take calls all day. it’s like i can’t take being stuck behind the desk all day taking customer calls when i could spend the day doing what i want like spending time with my daughter basically just being happy doing what i want. i’m not sure if it’s anxiety or work aversion which of course is related to being burned out. i want a job i can drive around and be free not stuck behind a desk taking call after call. i think i’m burned out possibly but to better explain how i feel it’s like this.... all of a sudden last week i was hit with the impulsive feeling that's been with me since i was 15. i wanted to quit my job and just go, run. it's a feeling i've had so many times i can't remember. i don't want this to sound like i'm lazy or have a bad work ethic because i don't but schedules and the responsibility of life have always made me filled with anxiety, extreme depression, and impulsive behaviors. it drives me crazy that i feel this way. i'm 25 and i've quit every single job i've had within the first 6 months (sometimes the first week) and the longest job i've ever had was 2 years, although i was miserable and somehow made myself do it. as i'm typing this i've called into work for the 2nd day in a row because i couldn't even bring myself to go (i've surprised myself that i called in and didn't just quit). it fills me with complete dread just thinking about going. i've tried to explain this to people in the past but when i feel this way it's almost like there's an invisible wall that's blocking me from going. maybe like an invisible wall in my head that just won't let me do what i have to do because i'll put it through the anguish of dealing with it. honestly i don't know....i guess i'm so upset because i thought things were actually going better and than this impulsiveness comes right back and seems to ruin everything as usual. i can't even talk myself through it anymore. it completely overtakes my mind and i just want to run. i even ruin good opportunities and jobs because normally 3 months into it i become so depressed, bored, and anxious that quitting is the only time i feel relief. but than it's a never ending cycle and at this moment i feel more lost than i ever have. i don't know if i'm looking for advice or just needing a community to vent to but i do know i need help.",308,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"can't find help anywhere. hi, i'm new around here. i was diagnosed with panic syndrome earlier this year, and i had to take antidepressants for about 2 months, but i stopped for fearing becoming addicted. since then the panic attacks are no longer so intense, but the ""anxiety"" persists. my symptoms are as follows: - light chest pain during the crisis - muscle tension, especially near the veins - tiredness and body pains - pressure around the head, as if they were squeezing my skull - lack of appetite and stomach pain this symptom is more recent, but i also can sense a strange smell every time i get a little nervous. it's not necessarily a bad smell, it's just weird, and it gets much worse when i'm preparing food. thanks to this, and the pains in the stomach, i lost a lot of weight in the last few months. my blood pressure is always great, and i've had blood tests, but no problem at all. all the doctors (i've seen many) have come to the conclusion that it's anxiety, but still, i can not convince my brain of that. nowadays i'm better because i've been forcing myself to leave the house and being surrounded by people makes me feel safer (if something bad happens, someone can take me to the hospital) but when i'm alone for too long, it's terrible. i would really appreciate your help. i'm moving out of my mom's house in 2018 and i'm gonna have to live on my own because i'm going to college, so i can't go on like this. i didn't want to depend entirely on medicine either, but what do you guys suggest? i really can't find help anywhere else.",309,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

(26 now) it went from a day nap after school to now i can spend all day and night in and out of sleep without feeling much better. i could get a full 8- 12 hours sleep then a few hours later be so tired i can't keep my eyes open and have to go back to bed. over the last 8 months things have taken a complete nose dive though. i've been back and fourth the doctors for blood tests and a chest xray but they are all coming back fine and there last option is to lower my antidepressants as they think it could be them causing the worsening issues but i'm not so convinced. i've been waking up every 4 hour without fail, then a few hours later falling back asleep. almost every time i sleep i have vivid dreams/ sometimes nightmares/ sometimes nothing but the most troubling thing is i'm wake up drenched in sweat, feeling weak and unable to move. i feel almost like i'm stuck between wake and sleep, unable to pull myself out of bad dreams properly, mentally i feel terrible, groggy, disorientated with brain fog which lasts up to 30 minutes. my limbs are heavy and limp and take all my energy to move, i feel woozy and loose my balance and feel not myself and almost euphoric. i wake up craving sugar too. recently i've started waking up with my feet and hands all contourted but interlocking so it's even harder to move which doesn't help the horrible feeling of waking up drenched in sweat. sweating from my neck, chest and all down my legs. i've tried changing loads of things to see if anything helps but it hasn't, i tried eating very healthy for 6 months straight, i changed what time i eat so not to eat several hours before sleeping, tried eating before bed, reducing sugar, eating more sugar incase it was hypoglycaemia, quit smoking. i don't do drugs, occasionally drink alcohol, don't drink tea, coffee or energy drinks, only water. i have light bedding designed to be cooling, silk pillow, light cotton pjs and shorts even with no clothes on, windows open in winter, even at different houses and i still have the same issues almost constantly. i'm more exhausted since not being able to sleep longer that 4 hours and with all the sweating it's draining and getting my mental health down. i have thought maybe i have narcolepsy for the last few years due to all the day time sleepiness but the doctors haven't looked into it or anything else sleep disorder related. as a kid i always struggled getting to sleep and suffered nightterrors which i still occasionally get. i used to be a very active kid who would function off 4 hours sleep but since my teenage and 20s things just keep getting worse and i don't know what's causing what and if i'll ever sleep properly again. any help or advice is greatly appreciated!",319,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

(honestly, i'm not that good at self-discipline but am getting desperate.) the only other approach i've read about is just to give in to it & lead a nocturnal existence. i don't want to give up on this though, as it's seriously curtailing my opportunities for a fulfilling life. i have several co-morbid conditions, the worst of which being chronic fatigue syndrome (m.e), sleep apnoea (now well-controlled by cpap) and emotionally unstable (borderline) personality disorder, which manifests itself as anxiety and depression. i have been on anti-depressants for years and my gp is being very helpful re meds at the moment and we are trying other meds to try to control anxiety & mood swings. (the community mental health team are useless.) i have finally found a good, long-term counsellor/therapist who i see every week & she really is brilliant. i think i have achieved more recovery in the 9 months i've been seeing her than i have for years, so i have hope there. anyway - please forgive the length of this post but i wanted to give as much relevant background info as possible. i am prepared to do pretty much anything to sort this but i'm really not sure how to proceed. thank you for reading this and many thanks in advance for any help you can give. best wishes wayne.",337,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"help concerning abnormal sleep test readings hello, my question - in reference to the machine(s) used to monitor an individual's sleep in a hospital setting - is this: is it possible for the machine to register someone as being asleep when, in fact, they are very much awake? the motivation for my wanting - or, rather needing - to know this information can be understood by reading the following description of my experience of just such an event occurring: i have had problems with sleep for most of my life and, as a result, was hooked up to a machine to monitor my sleep while in a hospital several years ago. after laying in bed, waiting to fall asleep for around an hour or so, the study was interrupted by someone accidentally entering the room, directly after which i was informed that i had been awakened by the intrusion. i, however, contested this notion, because i had been awake the entire time - entirely aware of every little noise in and outside of the room; i had simply been in the same meditative-like state that i always put myself into when attempting to sleep. i have a lifetime of experience with being in this state, which i can stay in for hours without ever actually falling asleep at any time. while in this state, i am always completely aware of my surroundings, and i always appear to be asleep - to the degree that everyone who witnesses me in this state claims that i am mistaken about being asleep - as they are invariably ""positive"" that i had been asleep. the test-giver told me that there was no possible way the machine would read as if i was asleep if i had not been, and, upon giving a detailed and accurate account to them of all of the little noises that had occurred while i was registered as being asleep (i.e., i knew exactly how many pages she had flipped in her book, how many times she had coughed, and the entire content of each of the individual conversations that were going on down the hall from my room's closed door between nurses and patients - verbatim), she became quite frustrated with me, quickly escalating to a level of anger that included her acting rather childish, accusing me of lying, stopping the test entirely, and, much to my chagrin, completely refusing to finish the test. i had been admitted to the hospital due to symptoms that were related to sleep deprivation, so it was – at the very least - disheartening, when i was told that i should simply take extra sleep medication, as i was already prescribed a rather excessive nightly dose of two high-powered medications that target sleep disorders. i was given a prescription in accordance with the recommended increase in dosages and discharged without myself or my doctors having come any closer to finding an appropriate treatment for the my perpetual sleeplessness, or any indication as to what the underlying problem causing the disorder might have been.",344,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

"unable to sleep in one cycle? hi everyone. i’ve had quite a battle with sleep over the years that started during childhood. to keep this from being a novel, i’ll attempt to simplify how i have been in recent times and what appears to be my issue today. i worked an 8 am to 5 pm shift as a night owl for over 12 years until recently. when working that schedule, i would function the best when taking a nap right after work at 5 pm – anywhere from 2-3 hours. i would then get back up and function well all the way through the end until going to bed. i was typically slow to rise, but would often be able to shake it off and was extremely productive this way. why not just 8 hours in a row? well, it seemed as if the longer time i slept in one setting, the worse i felt. the occasions when i would “crash” and go to bed in the early evening are the nights when i would wake up sore, dazed, confused, etc. these nights i could often recall dozen(s) of dreams over the course of the day. i realized that it seems the longer i sleep, the more i dream. the more i dream, to which many i remember, the more tired i am when i wake up – and i frequently wake up. i heard the argument for years that i needed to adjust my “sleep hygiene”, but it always failed me. finally, i started another job in february of this year. i had to do different shifts at first, but now find myself on the shift i wanted – noon to 8:30 pm. i can now stay up as late as i want and sleep in. i never don’t get at least 6 hours of sleep; typically at least 8 hours of sleep. so now i’ve put the theory to the test. the crazy thing is i’ve been doing this since july, and i feel awful – and i believe it’s the same reason as before. i am getting too much sleep in one setting. i’ve never heard of this being an exact problem for anyone. i wake up with blood shot eyes, like i’ve been up all night or just finished doing drugs. it’s embarrassing. i am slow to rise, as i always am, but typically am able to shake it off as i get up and alert. within a few hours, i’m in desperate need of caffeine to continue the day – now after getting adequate rest in one setting, which is how you are “supposed to do it”. i recorded myself sleeping last year, and i’ve found that i frequently swing my legs back and forth (i bend the knees, then swing my legs most often). i often talk, but i do not sleep walk. as i mentioned, i wake up often. i was in the middle of seeing a sleep doctor right before i left my old job, and i’m going to have to start the process all over as insurance kept denying a sleep study (that’s blue cross blue shield for you). has anyone ever experienced this “deep sleep” phenomanon? i can recall so many dreams over the course of a day, particularly when i get a lot of sleep, that sometimes they are disturbing, sad, etc.",352,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"always tired hi there scarynorwegian! i have been where you are. let me first assure you that despite how difficult feeling tired can make things, with a little effort you can make a change. so try to stay calm during this period of difficulty in your life which will change. i have made a huge amount of effort to help myself when i was going through what you have (and believe me it was incredibly close to what you described - including nightmares). i did it basically because life is short and i want to enjoy it and live it at least at 50%, but not feeling at 2% every day. so the bad news is there is no magic pill for this (besides moving house if you believe you might be allergic to something in the house perhaps?). but the good news is that through consistent, focussed effort, you will narrow down and determine what works for you and what doesn't, to even get to the point where you are even sleepoing better than your friends and family! what have you tried? who else do you feel comfortable asking for help? have you had blood tests from the dr / sleep study? is your room cleaned regularly, and aerated at least twice a day? does it have a funny smell? have you visited a good acupuncturist? (might be a spleen energy deficiency - common cause of constant tiredness). what self-help books have you read? now is the time to push, marshall your friends and family for help, don't feel bad to ask because at the very least once you've improved your sleep you can inspire other sufferers. get it? you must get the ball rolling, the sooner the better. the change might not occur immediately, but it will, i promise. one thing in life to keep in mind is that ""all things shall pass"". so please, don't let it stresss you, look it in the face and tackle it!!",359,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"i have night eating syndrome. i need your help. since last year i've been taking a shower before going to bed which used to put me to sleep almost instantly when my head hit the pillow. eventually i found a delay before falling asleep which inturn caused me to resort to eating before going to bed. this used to put me to sleep instantly, however howadays i realize that it's putting a damper on my ability to sleep. night eating syndrome. as a result i find myself getting up multiple times throughout the night. until recently, when i got up, my brain was on auto polit to get something to eat. in the last couple of days i've been taking lurasidone. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lurasidone an anti anxiety medication that does help prevent me from eating, but sadly i have reason to believe it prevents me from sleeping. the first day i took it, i was unable to sleep the night before. despite this it took several hours to for me to fall asleep, despite it surpressing my hunger. the second night i was unable to fall asleep until 6 am. the third night produced the same result as the first mainly because i couldn't sleep the previous night. i'm worried that i'm going to be facing a new pattern where i can't sleep the first night, but eventually sleep the second and that this pattern may get worse. i have reason to believe that while the lurasidone curbs my apitite, it does not curb my need to eat in order to sleep. in addition to lurasidone, i also take trazodone(aka asenapine) at 1 and a half tablets, saphris at 5mg, and one or two pills of serenity formula. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trazodone https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asenapine i've heard that sleeping pills can worsen night eating syndrome and starting yesterday, i stopped taking them. http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonlin ... e=fulltext i've ordered a bottle of serotonin brainn food since i've heard that lack of serotonin causes night eating syndrome. i don't know how this could effect my meds however. i take my lurasidone at 7:00. 3 and half hours before going to bed. i also take trazodone at 9:30 and saphris at 10:30. i used to take a shower before going to bed, but as time went on i stopped as i'm worried that it's been causing me problems. i'm worried that my sleeping is going to get worse as time goes on as it always has since last year. i'm hoping that there is surgery or a brain implant that i could buy to help me out or if i could get a surgery operation to further examine my head, but i need more information. one of the problems i'm facing is that no one is telling me anything useful. my mother, despite knowing my plight, doesn't understand the weight of what i'm going through. it may help to know if there are support groups i could join. any advice? please help. i'm worried that my sleeping issues are going to get worse and without help i may eventually lose my ability to sleep. notes: 1.i for some reason have an obsession with going to the bathroom at night even when there's only a few drops of urine in my body. 2.i believe that my nose my need surgery to breath properly as i've dug too far into my nose. 3.i'm unsure about the effects of my combined medicine and the side effects they come with. 4.since taking my lurasidone, i've had 2 pieces of bread before bed to help stave off my hunger. 5.songs get stuck in my head at night every two or three nights. last edited by tyler on mon jan 16, 2017 3:07 pm, edited 1 time in total. reason: please do not post links to commercial sites.",369,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"murky&aggitated final stage (last hour) of sleep hi everyone, i am posting this hoping that others who are having similar sleep disorders will maybe want to share their experience. i apologise for what seems to've become a very long thread - i tried to stick to the most relevant details. for about a year and a half i've been suffering from a specific type of sleep problem. the last part of my sleep, towards the morning (perhaps the final hour or so; hard to tell exactly) is very agitated; feels like a dizziness, as if i had mud in my head, and where i am half-awake (almost conscious/obsessive dream-like thoughts reoccur) yet find it difficult to wake up. this means that, after a struggle to break away from a confusing, exhausting last hour of sleep, not only will i have spent longer in bed than i'd have wished (say, 9 hours) but ""in exchange"" i get a day during which i am often tired, and sometimes find it hard to stay awake longer than 10pm. ""tricking"" myself out of sleep before the critical stage starts (e.g. after 7 hours of sleep) doesn't work, as then i just feel under-slept. other (even more upsetting) side-effects of this long-standing sleep disorder include irritablility and apathy to exercise and to sex. in addition, i seem to've acquired a form of tinitus (high-pitched buzz in both ears), the severity (loudness) of which varies from day to day, though hard to tell if correlated with sleep quality. several medical tests (including ear-nose-throat, endocrinology and head mr-imaging) revealed no obvious cause underlying my symptoms, however a sleep study (polysomnography) revealed two presumtive (tentatively-given) diagnoses: 1) rem sleep disorder (although i don't have the intense dreams characteristic of this diagnostic) 2) borderline sleep apnea (several episodes of irregular breathing per night). after this test, my somnologist prescribed circadin 2mg (melatonin), which i've been taking for a month now without any noticeable improvements even after being told to double the dosage; the medic recommended, if the circadin treatment remains ineffective till the end, that i next try to sleep with an anti-apneic mask (cpap). if that will fail also, she said the only remaining cause remains stress; i haven't been particularly stressed times, however i *do* tend to take things to heart. some further details: - taking natural sleep supplements (camomile tea, pills with lavander, etc) before bedtime helps sometimes but not reliably (probably not beyond placebo) - my sleep is abnormally dependent upon bed-time, in that if i go to bed late (a lot later than, say, midnight) i am guaranteed a tormented sleep. however, even going to bed early (11pm) hardly helps with the final-hour-restlessness that i describe. - i'm keeping careful sleep logs, however none of the factors i suspected - including amount of exercise (which i don't do enough of) and stress during the previous day, bed/pillow conditions, bed time, anything to do with meals (including coffee), etc - don't seem to obviously (and single-handedly) lead to this final-hour-syndrome - soon after falling asleep, i am told i often fidget/twitch and snore, although i never have trouble *falling* asleep (only at the waking-up end) - since 1.5 years ago when my problems started, the frequency with which my sleep ends with such a restless hour varies: i've had a few good months/weeks, but otherwise it's rare (maybe one night out of 10) that i *don't* get the symptom, i.e. when i wake up easily and rested. - my sleep hours are normally regular (midnight to 8am) i am male, mid 30s, no other major health problems. if anyone has encountered similar symptoms and can share any advice of what they tried that worked, i'd be really grateful! many thanks in advance!",370,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"long-term sleep problems hi, this is my first post on the forum. i'm not quite sure what i'm looking for in making this post, or even whether it's the correct forum for what i describe, but i hope it doesn't cause any problems! for many years - longer than i can remember - i haven't slept the full 8 hours. also, perhaps coincidentally, for the last 20 years, i have been working shifts at work intermittently. i started off 20 years ago working mornings (6 - 2) and afternoons (2 - 10) and did that for about 7 years. but for the last 8 years i have worked a 3-shift system that has included mornings, afternoons and nights (10pm - 6am) on a rotating 3-week cycle. i find that when i'm on morning shift, i only sleep for a few hours and wake up very early - a lot earlier than i need to, even though i have an alarm clock. when i'm on afternoons, i can go to bed after midnight, and still wake up any time between 5 and 7am, and only sleep intermittently from then onwards. on nights, i get to bed about 6:30am, and it's unheard of for me to sleep past 11:30, often waking a lot earlier. even when i'm not working, i can go to bed just after midnight and wake up early, only sleeping fitfully after. as you can imagine, this often leaves me feeling sleepy during the day. sometimes i can be watching tv in the afternoon and go to sleep. i have often felt sleepy when driving home after a night shift, but that's not really surprising as i've had a night without sleep. i mentioned it in passing to a medical professional and, perhaps partly because i'm also overweight, i'm being referred to check for sleep apnea. so it is being investigated. does anybody else have similar problems sleeping? my own feeling about this is that it could just as easily be due to shift work rather than any other medical cause, but it's best to exclude something more serious.",377,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming hybrid? weird experiences hi all, new here. i found this place while trying to find any information about my experiences. i'll try and keep it pretty short but i'm afraid it could be a long read. anyway; i started having sleep paralysis experiences about 7 years ago. at first i was scared of it, like everybody - until i read about it and it calmed me. but then it started to happen on a regular basis. i had it 3-4 times a week the next few years, but i learned to control it. controlling it by not opening my eyes (in fear of hallucinations) and doing my best to wake up. but - as i met a few friends who had the same experiences, they also started talking about lucid dreams. i thought it sounded cool and wanted to try it. but now i understand that what i have been experiencing a few times the last year or so isn't lucid dreaming. more like a mix between sleep paralysis, lucid dreaming and obe. most often, i just try to wake up from the paralysis (still get them a few times a week) but sometimes, when i'm feeling adventurous, i take it step further: i use all the energy in my body to try and raise myself from bed. mostly i can't do it, but a few times i've been able to get up and walk around in my apartment for 20-30 seconds up to a minute before i wake up. i can't really do anything. i'm trying to fly or go to other places and such but without any results. but today i managed to do more than that. it felt like i stayed in this for an hour. i was having a sleep paralysis, managed to get up, walk around my apartment (noticing an extra lamp and a chair which reminded me of it not being real), and i tried to go piss, watch porn and other stuff to see how it was like. it was very intense and i controlled everything. i can't do anything else than i would be able to do with ""physical"" me. that is, i can´t hover, fly, do backflips or anything. and i can't take myself to another place unless i walk there. so i'm trapped in my apartment. but i am in total control of what i'm doing. - which is the interesting part here when i talk to friends who has lucid dreams. not a basic dream. this is something completely else and always origins from the sleep paralysis. eventually i started freaking out so i decided to wake up. and now i'm sitting here with a pool of sweat in my bed, having a little trouble talking (like i was drunk or something) and i feel physically drained. what is happening? what is this all about? i have google this before but i've never actually seen somebody having the same experiences as me. anyone here perhaps?",386,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"i have a delayed sleep-phase disorder thank goodness i'm not the only one! i'd like to ask the people on here, though-- is this a problem that's been haunting you most your life? because for me, it has been- though of course, not to the same extremes as recently. my mom says that even when i was a baby i wouldn't sleep- they took me to doctors and labeled it as dspd, the more accurate technical term being an ""altered cicadian rhythm."" it just sort of means that your biological clock is different from most people's. not just a night-owl. i physically have trouble trying to sleep before a minimum of two am (usually three or four). i've tried everything- skipping days of sleeping in order to make myself more tired and hopefully sleep sooner- which always manages to backfire somehow. getting on a very strict diet where you eat specific things at specific times. lying in the dark, waiting to fall asleep. doing something to tire me in order to sleep (gym is kind of helpful there, but it's never enough, because only my body tires). it's absolutely ridiculous, and it keeps me from doing a lot of things. family doesn't understand it at all. there's actually two types of altered cicadian rhythms which are the basics of dspd. the first is just sort of a traditional, shifted sleep schedule. you still need the same amount of sleep as any normal person might, but your hours of functionality are vastly different. up late, sleep late. the other one is not merely a shifted rhythm but it is a lengthened one as well. typically described as operating on the schedule of a 25-hour day, it means that you don't just go to bed late, but you go to bed late-r, and you need more sleep. because you have this weird extra hour, your schedule constantly shifts between needing more time at night and in the mornings. i've recently read though that this can be affected with light therapy (sounds hokey, but stay with me here). i don't remember precisely what the light is called, but having a certain type of light on in the mornings can help slowly adjust your schedule, perhaps not to normal, but operable times. just try google searching light therapy in relation to dspd or cicadian rhythms- you should get something. anyways, i'm willing to try it, and figured it might be worth something to somebody to share.",398,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"i can't wake up in the morning. i am struggling with this as well. i usually go to sleep after midnight (somewhere around 2 or 3am) and have to wake up every morning at 6am to get ready for school. i have many alarms set on my phone, each one 5 minutes after the other, since one alarm never wakes me up anymore. turns out that this actually is a terrible mistake, since my brain knows that even if i turn off the first alarm, i can go back to sleep and maybe the following alarm would wake me up. but it doesn't, since i just open my eyes to turn off the next alarm and go back to sleep. my parents bought me a vintage alarm clock, which is right abore my head and whenever the alarm rings, it's just so loud that even the heaviest sleeper would wake up. the good thing is that once it starts ringing, it can't be turned off. but lately, i've gotten used to that as well and it doesn't seem to wake me up anymore. instead, i have to have my mother struggle to wake me up, as i am often abusive and violent in the waking process, which strangely i cannot control, nor remember after fully waking up. this also has to do with my did as well, which makes it really difficult for my mother. she has said many times that she's quite stressed and scared of me in the mornings, not knowing how i'll react, as most times i end up injuring her. this morning i left bruises on her arms, while i was in the stage between sleep and waking. i don't remember much of it, besides the part where i felt i was in dream land, dreaming about myself being a kung fu master or some sort. it may seem funny, but it's really not. i never wanted to injure my mother like that, but i can't really help it. however, there is one method of waking up that most of the time works on me. and that is when my mother turns on the tv and sets the volume high. now, since i don't use my tv for anything, other than to connect it to my laptop and watch movies on the big screen, hearing a cooking show or something i don't ever watch is just really bugging me in a way, so i'd have to get up to turn the tv off. i've come to the conclusion that sounds that really annoy you and, of course, sounds that are loud enough for you to hear them through your dream, could wake you up easily. but as the person above me has said, these sounds should be on the other end of your room, in order for you to get up and walk that distance to turn it off. i've realized that i wake up faster when i'm sleeping on places where the windows are right next to my bed. it's difficult for me to wake up when i'm sleeping in my own room, since my bed is away from the windows, but if your bed is close to them, you can try to sleep with the windows opened, so the sun light and the possible car or bird sounds or any morning sounds coming from your window could wake you up easily. ❝if bjd dolls can be perfect, then so can i.❞ - personal. ☽♡☾",401,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

(unfortunately i have this problem with two kids, some times i can't sleep when i need it, longest time i could use this pattern was for 2 weeks and finally my wife asks my to do something in the evening or midnight so i can't get that 20 min sleep and ...) please note i work at night, that's why i sleep 6 am.",404,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"what is happening? ok so first off, i have really bad anxiety and i am very fearful of anything happening to my body that i'm unaware of (passing out, blacking out, fainting, seizures, anything like that). it also makes me very aware of my surroundings, and usually ends up preventing me from sleeping. but i usually get tired of sitting at my computer desk around like 8pm, and decide to go lay in bed and watch youtube/netflix. so i'll watch that for about 15 mins or so, and then my eyes get heavy so i lay down and close them, but still try listening to whatever i was watching. and then whenever the noise starts annoying me, i'll pause it. then i'll just try to rest my eyes so i can get back up, so i try to be aware of the sounds and stuff in my room. but then i feel a rush of the feeling ""get up"" and i'll get up really quick, and confused, and scared. because i don't know if i passed out or not. which i couldn't have been long, maybe a minute, but i feel like i need to get up really quick and start panicking. and usually get more of the derealization feeling. like i said, i have a really big fear of passing out and stuff, but i feel good when i lay down when i feel like that. does this sound like i have something wrong with me, or just my anxiety trying to play tricks on me? i really hate it.",408,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"sleep groping/fondling *tw* yes definitely talk to her. if you can, really listen to her and let her say everything she needs, without taking it personally. she has the right to feel how she feels about the situation, up to and including feeling like she was raped . this doesn't mean you're a bad person, it just means we don't get to say what the other person's experience was, even if we're unintentional about it. this includes yourself by the way - if you feel sick and angry then that's how you feel, so stay with that and explore those feelings, figure out why you feel that way, and any other things you feel too, like other commentors have suggested i think exploring your sexual desires and being really honest about that is key here too. make sure you figure out which parts are appropriate to share with her and which parts might hurt her when she's already feeling really vulnerable. i'd like to challenge you on something too - i'm actually going through a similar situation myself. my boyfriend masturbates in his sleep, once even to the point of ejaculating without waking up, and for multiple reasons of things in my past, that is really triggering for me. i'm working through a lot of stuff around that, but when it comes to him, i feel really betrayed for him not telling me before we moved in together. (yes, we'd slept together multiple times before, but always to have sex, which basically made it not happen or have him involve me the moment i was even stirring, and he was awake which made it ok, not to mention i was usually having to leave sometime in the night before it would start happening anyway) we unfortunately live in a society where most people have some kind of trauma around sexuality, especially women. to not mention this kind of thing and ask ""are you going to be ok with that if it happens?"" is highly irresponsible, especially if you're aware you might actually touch her body without being able to ask for consent. because subconscious or not, intention or not, you touched her without her consent. that's a big deal, and it's going to take some work to unravel. i'd definitely suggest sleeping separately for now until you get this figured out. it sounds like you and this girl are pretty sweet on each other, and you sound like an emotionally mature guy, so you should be able to at least work through this and remain friends if that's what needs to happen. do be aware that it may take her months of sorting through this in her own head to fully process it, and she may need to come back to this conversation multiple times. please always take her very seriously (remember, this isn't about you, it doesn't make you a bad person, but she does need to be acknowledged for her own experiences) always respect her, and give her space for the option to change her mind - women live in this ""rape culture"" where the victim is either blamed or denied, so she may not even be able to articulate that something's wrong yet. it may take you coming up to her and saying ""i feel sick about this... how are you feeling?"" for her to even be able to admit that something wrong happened. i'm sure you're up for the challenge, and if this can be a learning experience for the both of you, i believe it will actually help our society a lot in the long run. one more thing, it might be helpful to ask her what her boundaries on the matter are. like ""what are you ok with and not ok with sleeping next to someone in the future?"" she may also have repressed memories of when she felt similar things before that she might now be having to face, complicating things. i know i do from my experiences! best of luck.",413,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"night owl problem hi, this forum isn't very lively i'm afraid. sorry you didn't get many responses. one thing that comes to my mind is melatonin. it's a hormone that regulates your circadian rhythm -- normally it should be at its highest level between midnight and 8am. you can buy otc melatonin supplements and try that for a while. they sell really high dosages but 1-2 mg will be plenty. there is also a possibility you have a disorder the name of which handily escapes me which basically means that your sleeping rhythm is different from that of general population. (if you look through other people's posts it's been mentioned.) and finally, you might go to your doctor and request a *short term* sleeping aid. take it for a week or two (not more, ideally) around 11 and go to bed. i have used a few, and can recommend (es)zopiclone or diazepam/valium. ambien is very popular but since it made me sleep-e-mail, sleep-purchase-things-from-amazon and finally sleep-walk-into-a-metal-chair, injure myself and ruin the chair, i personally wouldn't recommend that one. however, of course, your mileage may vary. you don't mention what sort of anti-psychotics you used. seroquel (quetiapine) in very low doses, like 25mg, can also serve as a sleeping aid. if you've used that for a long time during daytime, your circadian rhythm might be out of whack indeed. so if melatonin doesn't do the trick i'd recommend you see a doctor about your sleep problem. hugs -- i hope you catch some zzzs soon! currently working on my upcoming signature.",427,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"new problem, confused and scared hi there, about me - i'm 21y/o female, pretty healthy, very physically active (hiking, climbing, etc). my whole life i've described myself as a 'morning person' and generally wake up around 8 am on my own. i'm in a new dorm room at college and my side of the room gets zero natural light - what comes through shines on the door, not on my living space. mostly my roommate keeps the blinds halfway down and the divider between our sides shut, though. since i moved in, i've been having more and more trouble with my sleeping patterns. i can't fall asleep until 2-4 am, no matter what i do - total darkness and for hours, but no sleep. then i can't wake up until 11am-1pm, no matter how many alarms i set. one morning, i set 10 separate alarms and slept through them all (my roommate told me). ocassionally, i wake up for a minute to hit snooze, but then i fall asleep sitting up. i read about delayed sleep phase disorder, and it's the only thing i've found that fits, but is it possible to experience this, or something like it, temporarily due to light deprivation? i feel so helpless, like it doesn't matter what i try, and i've never been like this before. i'm failing classes for the first time in my life because i can't wake up. more importantly, if i can start sleeping next to a window again (for normal light cycles), will i go back to normal? p.s i know that i need to seek professional help as well, but as i understand it, diagnosis can take a while and there aren't any specialists near me - i need help now, please",436,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"did i experience sleep paralysis? let me say that lately i have been having loads of anxiety issues and panic attacks, and it seems to be infiltrating my dreams now. last night something horrible happened, and i'm going to try my best to describe it. after a day of drunkenness (about six beers) i fell asleep at maybe 10 or so. i remember having some problems getting to sleep and staying asleep, but i was eventually able to. i remember it was probably 2 am or so, when i ""woke up"" to find things not quite right. there was a weird feeling in my chest and head, kind of like waves going through me, or a pressure. i had fallen asleep with a movie on my laptop (spirited away) but i remember specifically seeing "" the ring "" playing on my laptop when i ""woke up"" (i never watched the ring at all last night) but it appeared that it was the little creepy girl from the ring on my screen, in a scene that is really in the movie. i don't remember much else besides a feeling of wanting and needing to wake my boyfriend up. i wanted to shake him and wake him up, because i was sure i was dying and i wanted him to call an ambulance. but i couldn't. it was like a hundred pound weight was on me, and i was terrified. finally (i can't remember how much time had passed) i was able to get myself out of bed slowly (this really happened, i think i was able to pull myself out of whatever was happening) and i quickly went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. my eyes were bloodshot red, very red. and i got a washcloth and put hot water on it and put it on my face. i just remember being terrified ever since i woke up and for about the next 2 hours. so terrified i could not get back to sleep. i didn't want it to happen again. so i stayed up until about 4 and was finally able to get to sleep. i can't really describe how horrible i felt, it was just a feeling of dread the entire time. i don't really know what to think. i know that i kept waking up constantly after that, i couldn't sleep for very long. i've also been having bad nightmares as well. my boyfriend basically doesn't believe me and thinks i'm just crazy - which is insulting to me because it dismisses everything that i felt last night as something that i'm making up. am i really crazy? does this sound similar to anyone's experiences with sleep paralysis?",437,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"being communicated to hi, i'm new to this forum so have quite a few questions i want to ask. when i had just started at university i had an episode of sleep paralysis which was nothing unusual. my student accommodation was in a victorian terrace house. in this episode i was paralysised in bed and i was looking over toward the wall. i got the usual fear of foreboding doom and sure enough a white ghostly figure appeared and floated toward me. as it got closer the noise in my head got louder (not sure if increased heart beat through fear causes this). the ""ghost"" stood at the side of the bed and pointed towards my alarm clock. for some reason i didn't want it to get to the alarm clock. i think i knew the alarm would soon be going off and would wake me out of the sleep paralysis. i managed to wriggle my little finger and this brought me out. i looked at the alarm clock to find out it had stopped! it was only battery operated, but even when i replaced the batteries the clock wouldn't work. was that co-incidence or something a bit weird? my grandma who i was very close to had died in the months before i went to uni.",438,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"severe reoccuring sleep paralysis i'm hoping this is the right area to post this in. i feel like it's a sleep disorder because it has gotten to the point where it is a problem and affecting my life. when i was younger, i would experience sleep paralysis once every couple of months, and over the last few years it has gotten worse, and now i experience it multiple times a night. i've read that it usually happens when people are waking up, but with me it's always before i even fall asleep. i will lay down in my bed, and close my eyes, and try to sleep, and usually after a few minutes of laying there with my eyes closed,still awake and aware of my surroundings, i will get that feeling like i'm falling, and then i will just be stuck there in sleep paralysis, still aware of my surroundings, but unable to move. i do all the tricks to try and wake up, like wiggling my toes, or fingers, and just going with it and trying to relax, but it never works. honestly it's confusing because it doesn't feel like i've fallen asleep at all in the first place. if i manage to relax, or move a limb, instead of waking up, i just experience falling and the paralysis all over again. the falling part usually lasts what feels like a few minutes, and causes a loud rushing sound, and makes it hard to concentrate on anything else, and once it stops, i become aware again of the fact that i can't move. this happens on a cycle over and over until i don't even know how much time has passed, and i'm just so exhausted that i can't even fight it anymore, i just lay there and let myself be paralysed and let myself feel like i'm falling. it's gotten to the point where trying to go to sleep has become very stressful. and because i go through the cycle of my paralysis and trying to wake up repeatedly so many times a night, by the time i do fall asleep, it's so hard to get up. if i don't have an alarm set in the morning, i will sleep for 12 hours, minimum, and nothing wakes me up. i don't understand whats happening. or what to do about it. but i'm tired of going through how terrifying the sleep paralysis is, and then being totally exhausted and confused about life when it's over.",439,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"hallucinations and sleepwalking hey everyone, i've had a weird type of parasomnia for as long as i can remember, and i am unable to find a name for it. it usually happens when i had an emotional day, and usually after 3 or 4 hours of sleep (in the middle of the night, so to speak). to be as clear as possible, i am going to give you last night's example: i work as a camera operator, and yesterday we had quite a difficult shoot, where i made a few mistakes. nevertheless, i didn't feel too worried, as i know these things can happen. but then, when i wen't to sleep, i ""woke up"" at about 2:30 am with this feeling that i was right in the middle of a shoot. i was aware that there was nobody in my room, but i had this feeling that people could see me and hear me, like they were just behind my door. i wasn't scared - the main feeling really was embarrassment. when i woke up, i was dressed up (i felt like my coworkers could see me in my pijamas, and so i got dressed!), and some items around my bed had moved, like i had tried to make the place look more tidy. although i can't say that i was awake, i have very clear memories of what i was going through. i remember thinking at some point ""no way, they can't be in my room, it makes no sense"", but then the sensation took over again. that being said, i have no idea of how long it lasted, and i can't remember dressing up, although i can recall moving stuff around. i must also say that there were no actual hallucinations: i couldn't see no hear anybody. the best way i can describe it is this: it's like being in a room and knowing that behind the close door there are people, even though you can't hear them. once again, it's not a scary feeling, it's just really stressful. so... does anyone have experienced something similar? does it have a name? i must say i can easily live with this parasomnia, because it's not really giving me a hard time, but most of all i am quite curious, cause i've never met someone who has something similar. well, thanx for reading me!",466,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"why snoring can ruin a relationship i do not want this to seem like a pity party, but i do want to get it off my chest because it is really bothering me. i snore very loudly, to the point where it may wake me up at night and i do not wake up feeling refreshed in the slightest (i wake up very tired). when i got married, i figured that she would be ok with this issue or at least understand. whereas we would spend most nights together before we got married (we did have two apartments back then), nowadays i have been sent to the couch more times than i care to remember. it just makes me feel bad because i feel as though i am upsetting her sleep, but at the same time it annoys me because i am not actively doing anything to make her tired – it just happens. is there anyone who might have some advice on what i should do? maybe how to approach the subject? thank you. *mod edit* last edited by oliveira on mon may 12, 2014 4:26 pm, edited 1 time in total. reason: link removed",467,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"tired then wide awake and so on throughout day? hi, i've got a problem where every single day i wake up feeling either energized, or like i got no sleep at all. and whichever one i woke feeling like, will switch to the other and vis versa throughout the day. these periods don't happen at all during specific times of the day, but i just switch between tired and energized randomly. and it's not just a normal tired- i feel foggy, and it's difficult to talk or focus, i'm very irritable and hard to make conversation with. then, an hour later i'll be super alert and focused and talking non stop and jumping around! during my tired periods i can barely hold my head up. it's impacted my life because i can't go to outings or parties with my friends, or even dinner, without getting super tired and irritable and falling half asleep. although i'm tired during these periods, i usually just fall half asleep but never go into any sort of deep rem. i've been diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia, and a mild form of anxiety. i'm currently perscribed modafinil 100mg and lexapro 20mg but neither seem to help my sleepy/awakeness. the switches throughout the day happen with or without medicine. i'm sick and tired of my body being unreliable, and not being to consistently stay alert! even if i get 9 hours of sleep (which i do on a normal night) i never feel fully rested throughout the day. my eating schedule is normal, and i'm very active in working out. medium stress level. does anyone else have this problem or know what it is?? thank you so much!",470,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"polyphasic sleep as a solution? i've just been reading about delayed sleep phase disorder (dspd), which is a disorder that makes you a night owl. you feel like you perform best during the night feeling alert and awake whereas during the day you would just sleep, sleep and sleep. i could say that i have dspd, but that's not the point, because i'm aware that this disorder, at least in my case, has it's origin in my social anxiety. i'd rather sleep, instead of having to deal with people, and then when everyone is asleep during the night time i'd reach my energy peak. during the day time i have moments when i'm feeling like i'm about to fall asleep while standing. sometimes i just feel so tired. and i know it's a sort of vicious circle, because if i don't get a proper sleep during the night, then i will be dead tired during the day. but in the end, it's my choice not to sleep like everyone else, because it's an easy way out for me. ok, so that was me and my messed up sleeping routine. now, here comes the part related to my question. today when i woke up around 11 am i was feeling very low and wasn't feeling like getting up at all. i was waiting for my roommates to leave for their classes, before i finally got up. i absolutely hate having to see anyone in the mornings when i wake up. it's one of the worst things ever. i remember back home, i couldn't stand the idea of seeing my own parents in the morning so i was just waiting them out, getting up just after they left home even though i knew i would be late for my classes because of that. back to the point, today i went to sleep around 5 am and woke up at 11 am feeling like $#%^. then around 7 pm, i started feeling very sleepy. (now that i think back to it, coincidentally[?] it was around the same time when my roommates started coming back home.) anyway, at 7 pm i took a 1 hour nap. the thing is that when i woke up i felt just amazing and what's important had no symptoms of social anxiety. i woke up, went to the kitchen to make myself some tea or something and actually felt very comfortable around people. normally i'm so self-conscious, it's basically impossible to truly enjoy anyone's companionship (unless i'm very drunk.) this time i actually talked to people, not out of a painful neceessity, but simply because i felt like being friendly. it's actually not the first time, that after taking a nap i feel so good i'm able to storm into the kitchen without giving two sh*ts about people around me. no comparison between how i felt after my today's attempt at getting a night's sleep and after this nap. and i started thinking. if naps as opposed to full time sleep can make me feel so good, why not give up on full time sleeping altogether and substitute it with naps. i googled „no sleep only naps” and what i got is polyphasic sleep. does anyone have any experience with it? i'm willing to give it a try, since my sleeping routine is already pretty messed up. any ideas on how this works? or why today i felt so much better after the nap than the 6 hours “night” sleep? did anyone have similar experiences? i know that there may be no strict correlation between napping and feeling good, it all may have been accidental, i may not be able to repeat this, and it may not work in the long run but i guess i will never find out, unless i give it a try.",471,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"sleeping problem - help needed i'm not a doctor, psych or professional. so these are just a random person's thoughts, not formal advice. i would usually suggest talking to a doctor. just to rule out various problems and to get further support. but, i think perhaps it would be good to look at what you could change first. and then if it doesn't help, that's a good time to get a professional opinion. so, here's a list of things you could try. ideally, all of them! but whatever you can manage is helpful. either it'll improve things. or it's something that you can rule out as having an effect. first, set yourself a bedtime and stick to it. you're in a routine already, but it's not working for you. i'd suggest starting to wind down at 10pm. get away from all screens, make sure the lights are dim. a bath if that's possible may help to relax you. some reading [not homework, textbooks, horror novels or anything electronic] might be good. then head to bed about 11pm and do relaxation exercises, meditation, breathing exercises. whatever slows your brain down enough to rest. not necessarily sleep, although hopefully that will happen with time. second, set yourself a wake-up time. if you're under 25, 8am is a good starting point. [8 hours probably isn't enough sleep for you. people vary, some need 10+ to be functional. listening to your body over time should help to fine-tune this for you.] make yourself get out of bed at that time. all the evil techniques you can think of! the alarm on the other side of the room. family members asked to throw wet flannels at you if you aren't out of bed in time. whatever you can think of that will work. a glass of water before sleeping might be enough to make your bladder persuade you out of bed when the alarm goes. third, stop the caffeine. taper it down during the week, then stop completely over a weekend. yes, it will be very very hard work. but it's good as an occasional boost. bad on a daily basis. you're essentially self-medicating with caffeine. if it was working, that'd be ok. since it isn't, it's good to get it out of your system for the moment. fourth, you don't mention exercise. that's a really helpful part of good sleep patterns. even half an hour of walking daily will do the trick. if you can do more, that's better. best to do it before the evening, in case you get an endorphin rush from it. [this has rarely happened to me. but some people go on about it. and it seems like it'd prevent sleep.] fifth, you don't mention diet. if you eat lots of sugar, that's something else to try and cut down on. it means you'll be having huge energy swings depending on what you've eaten. which could be contributing to difficulty sleeping. i'm not suggesting going to an all-lentil diet. just, aim for healthy if you can. sixth, do what you can to improve your sleeping environment. if it's noisy, maybe a white noise generator [fan, or do a youtube search for 9+ hour long white noise videos.] or earplugs. if it's stuffy, is it possible to have a window open? if it's messy, does this affect your mood? [some people are fine, others rest better in an organised room.] is your bed comfortable? is it neither too cold or too warm? some of these are major changes. and most of them will be difficult to stick to. but a doctor is likely to suggest similar stuff. or, worse, prescribe sleeping pills. then you have those to sleep, caffeine to wake up, and that's not a fun way to live. if you do all these, and your sleep doesn't start to improve, then do get checked out. there are other things that can cause broken sleep, such as snoring, serious breathing issues, and so on. if you live somewhere with access to a sleep clinic, they can do a more detailed study. but i'd cover the basics first in case it's something simple. let us know how you get on! lots of people come here with similar issues. it's always good to read what works or doesn't. “ we think too much and feel too little. more than machinery, we need humanity. more than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. ” charlie chaplain in the great dictator",477,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"sleep has been destroyed! pain: sub conscious? anxiety? for the past 6 months my sleep routine has been destroyed. the only thing that i can think of is when i started having back pain only while sleeping. i have no back pain when walking around doing stuff but only in the morning when i wake up. once every few days or weeks it seems like a can get a full night sleep in i am lucky but lately it has been where i wake up at 2:00 then 4:00 then 6:00 and then finally 8:00 or 9:00. seems like i sleep a little better right at the end because i am probably exhausted from all the stress of trying to go to sleep. history: a year and a half ago a played around with some gnc products like pro-hormones and stuff and worked out a lot. been off of that for a while now. i worked out pretty hard. after coming off of that i use to jerk when falling asleep and freaked out. thought i had something major but probably my muscles where just coming off of exhaustion. went to the doctors and had blood work done and he check me out and gave me a physical and said everything was fine. about nine months ago i needed a club to play golf so i went to golf pro shop and swung a club for 4 hours straight and i believe hurt my back. i swung pretty hard for a while. and believe it or not i did it the next day as well; to the point where i had a hard time breathing for a second. i know i am an idiot. i stopped everything and chilled. maybe only driving range stuff after that. relaxed for a while then played disc golf and threw the disc as hard as i possible could about six months ago. played for about 4 hours throwing the disc incredibly hard. idiot again. penalties: well low and behold now i am having back problems only when i sleep and in the morning. but it seems more than that. i do not know if i created a mental loop in my mind but i cannot get a decent nights rest. i have gone to the doctor again and have had multiple x-rays done and bloods tests taken. everything came back fine. the pain is only in the morning and there is zero pain during the day. here is an excerpt of a back pain post that i created to fill you in. morning back pain – should i spend money? hello everyone, i know there is so much out there on back pain; but i have a tough money question. i am a returning college student with not a whole lot of money. i am 33 year old male is i would say good shape. i work out decently and have a nice physique. my problem is that one time i went to a golf pro shop and spent 4 hours smacking the golf ball as hard as i could almost too where i had a small pain in my chest and it was hard to breathe for a split second. and if i couldn’t get more stupid i went the next day and did it again. i had to choose a golf club for a class so that is why i pushed myself. i know that was kind of stupid. after like a month i thought i healed up and then went and played disc golf and threw the disc as hard as i possibly could for like 3 hours. i would throw it farther than anyone else. i guess i could have been showing off like an idiot. well i was working out moderately hard for a while in the gym during all this and never felt any burst of pain really. the only thing that i noticed was a small pinch like pain when i would be watching tv. so then i decided to go to a chiropractor and he solved that but he noticed that my spine was just slight to the right and my shoulders were a little uneven; but absolutely nothing major going on. this was the first time i ever went to a chiropractor and it was literally insane. i thought he was going to kill me because i never heard my bones crack like that before and my neck. i think it might have been a littler before the chiropractor that only in the morning when i wake up i would notice a pain right in the middle of my upper back between my shoulder blades; one time the pain moved to the right of my shoulder blade but that went away. now all that is left is this ongoing pain in the middle of my back that i cannot for the life of me locate. it’s like it’s the long muscle in my back that go from top to bottom of your back and very close to my spine. i would say mid shoulder to mid back but not upper shoulder or lower back. it is so weird because during the day i feel absolutely great with no back pain at all; even playing disc golf or exercising; it is only right after i wake up and while i am still laying down. pretty much as soon as i wake up everything is fantastic. only other weird thing is i feel like my ear is ringing on my right ear when i sleep on my right side. this also goes away completely when i get up or move around. doctor’s office: i have been to my doctor several times with this. i have had several x-rays; nothing bruised on my skin or anything obvious; blood work done for immune system and anything out of the ordinary. i have taken muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory’s but they are all temporary relief. seems like the pain comes back. my doctor is just saying it is like a pulled or sore muscle or something but just seems strange that something so small could cause so much discomfort in the morning. solutions: my dad has celiac disease but i do not but i read an article about how maybe you could not have the disease but a precursor of it somehow. i do have a lot of joint pain right now like in my big toe; wrist; neck and sometimes elbow. i have had all these x-rayed and blood work done to see any causes and nothing major is going on. here is the article excerpt: remove gluten from your diet. recent studies have shown that some people may have non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity and if so, that may trigger a systemic immune response which can keep joints irritated. this wasn’t too challenging for me since i already didn’t eat breads, pastas, refined grains in general but gluten, as you may know, is in a lot of foods – like beef jerky for one. remove gluten for thirty days and pay attention to how you feel. for me, it helped. if after thirty days you feel better then you can always titrate some back into your diet to find your threshold if you want to. i am lost at this point: my main question is that do i put spend money i really do not have on a new bed and pillow with a mattress topper or am i just getting old and have to deal with an aching back and joint pain. or could i possibly change my diet to a gluten free diet which will be like darn like impossible. i have heard from people’s reviews that they have had much success in changing out the mattress. and i am not even sure where the one that i am sleeping on came from. it’s a cali-king and seems nice but a little old. i have great health insurance. it just doesn’t seem like the doctors have the answers except med up or go to a pt. i wish there was more information out there on this. solutions: 1. change mattress 2. change pillow 3. change mattress topper 4. gluten free diet 5. deal with it because you are getting older … its life … anything help would be greatly appreciated. please leave your comments below. thank you! best, astrongtower update: now after reading all of this what do you propose? i have been to the doctors and they do not have the answers. do i just chalk it up to getting old? i am only 33. i use to play pretty hard but i do not think i destroyed my body or did i? i am going back to school and i do know school and no job is stressing me out. but can it be creating this much havoc? all i know is that i am kind of afraid to go to sleep and it’s a real problem. i have some pain relievers and muscles relaxers but i do not really care for them. i just know that my sleep is absolutely horrible and it is not like it used to be where i could fall asleep like a baby and get 9 to 10 hours a sleep and nothing could wake me up. what in the world happened? i feel like i was just sleeping like this not too long ago. please help me any way you can! please leave comments below! best, astrongtower",492,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"sleep has been destroyed! pain: sub conscious? anxiety? update: last night i was able to get 9 hours of sleep somehow. i did wake up at exactly 2:30 a.m. which happens a lot because i think my body clock is off with all of this going on but i was able to go back to bed and i woke up at 9:00 a.m. after going to bed at 12:00 a.m. the difference this time was that we actually found a full body pillow that was in a bag somewhere from a long time ago. the one that literally wraps all around you. i used that last night and i think the difference was i did not sleep on my stomach and i did not toss and turn. only around 9:00 did my back start to ache a little bit and force me out of bed and i began to toss and turn around the same time as well. i wanted to know exactly where the pain is coming from because it feels like sometimes it could be coming from my spine or right rib or muscles near my spine. it is so hard to find exactly where. i have a foam roller which i get on sometimes to gauge where the pain is coming from. i did it a little differently this time. i put the edge of the foam roller in the middle of my back where the pain is and let my butt down and my chest arch up. i would definitely say this helped me isolated the pain to about 4 to 7 inches right along my spine. i could definitely feel the pain in the morning when i do this. i will move like an inch up or down and see if the pain is focused in that area. i would say when i get to my upper shoulders and neck there is zero pain and when i get to my lower back there is zero pain. it only seems to originate like to the top half of my back; like my back is too heavy for itself or something. or it seems like a computer sitting down problem like i am arched or something over something for a long period and my back is just fed up with all of this. also the sports injuries probably put it over the top i think. all i know is that the pain seems to be coming from the spine or the muscles directly around the spine; but i think it’s the spine. i am almost thinking that whatever the chiropractor did actually made things worse but i could be wrong. i never heard that kind of cracking before. it’s about a 4 – 7 inch radio directly up and down when i get on the foam roller and it does hurt; but only in the morning or if i get on the foam roller in that exact position. as i am typing this there is no pain in my back. just wanted to update everyone. i hope someone knows what this is. i will be going to an orthopedic doctor soon but i am guessing that he will not be able to conclude anything either. just seems sad. please comment with any help or guidance. best, astrongtower",493,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"parasomnia? hello everyone, i am new to the forums and am just reading through different stories in an effort to find something that might 'click' and help us to figure out what challenges my son is experiencing. i am the extremely lucky mother of a fantastic 14yo boy. he's bright, funny, and has a great heart. he also has been experiencing some strange episodes over the past year. it started in december 2012, while he was at the computer playing a video game. it was a bit later than usual, but not incredibly late. i was in my bedroom reading when i heard a crash in the dining room. i came in to find my son flat on his back, in a dining room chair. his eyes were wide open and he was 'frozen' in place. i panicked, screamed, yelled, shook him until he came out of it (about 1 minute) and helped him to his feet. he was a little upset about me causing such a fuss, but assured me he was okay. i checked his pulse, respirations, his pupil size and called my best friend (who is a doctor). all signs seemed to point to him being okay. my husband took him to the pediatrician the next day, and we were told he may have nodded off in the dining room and just 'knocked himself out'. we were told to bring him back if it happened again. there were no episodes until september 2013. he had an episode again where he fell, this time out of bed about an hour after going to bed for the night. i heard a crash and walked into his room. he had opened his closet door at some point, only a few feet from his bed. he was laying on the floor between the closet on his back, eyes wide open again and again it took about a minute for him to come to. after this episode, we were able to see a neurologist/pediatric sleep medicine doctor. first eeg came back normal, so we did a 3-day ambulatory eeg. that came back normal as well. the neurologist could not find any signs of epilepsy, and felt it might be more of a sleep disorder. however, she couldn't rule it out since no one knows what causes the fall since it is at night and he's in his room alone. she said to 'live life' and call her if it happened again.she thinks it is more of a parasomnia, but this doesn't sound like what i've read of parasomnias. since then, we have moved and we are in a newer/larger townhouse. so, here we are with episode 3. it happened last thursday, and again i heard a crash. i went into his room and saw his empty bed. i looked again and could make him out on the floor of his room, again with the closet door open. he was on his back, eyes wide open, body rigid/muscles tight. in fact, he was holding something so tight in his hands that i had to pry it out. i was able to notice that he was breathing, at least, so that was reassuring (other times i was too panicked to notice). it took about a minute to get him to come out of it. afterwards, he just wanted to get a drink and go back to sleep. i called the neurologist, and she said ""wellll, if it happens again, give me a call. just monitor him"". at this point, i am panicked. i can't get sleep or rest, especially since my room is on the opposite side of the house. i have been sleeping on the couch so i can hear any sounds. i jump at every sound and i don't know what to do next. i don't know how to help him and it terrifies me and breaks my heart. i am fearful that he will fall and really injure himself, or that he will fall down the flight of stairs that we have here at the house (technically, our unit is the 2nd and 3rd unit of the building and we have a set of stairs immediately when you enter). i just feel so helpless, so i am trying to see if there may be someone who has experienced something similar or might know what more i can do. has anyone else experienced something like this?",501,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"parasomnia? hello, i am also new to the forums and by coincidence i happen to see your post. my 15-year old daughter has experienced something similar since she was 13 years old. but what happens is that she just blanks out. she will be sitting and talking and then all of a sudden she has a blank stair and it sometimes last as long as 10 minutes. it happens at school alot and then they call 911 and transport her to emergency but she comes out of it usually in about 10 minutes or less. we did the ambulatory eeg also and nothing happened. it seems to occur if she stayed up too late the night before and/or if she gets really upset or stressed. she has not fallen though. it usually happens when she is sitting down and if she focuses on something or is daydreaming or something and she just blanks out. at one point she had an episode almost like two times a week for about a month. they ruled out siezures and suggested that she see a therapist. young teens sometimes act out this way subconciously to receive attention, but they are not doing this purposely. when the episodes started she was arguing with her younger sister who is 11 now but was 8 or 9 at the time. the therapy seemed to work and the episodes stopped immediately, but they came back after about a year and a half. she had two last month. but none recently. its still a mystery. about a year before these episodes began she hit her head in the snow while sliding down a hill. we took her to the doctor and they checked her out and said there was know concussion. i know exactly what you are going through. her attitude is great though, it has not presented any challenges, but she wants to start driving soon so my wife and i are faced with some decisions soon. i don't know if therapy worked or if it was just a coincidence that the episodes stopped for a while (it was no medication, only talking). but maybe you want to give therapy a try to see if it is psychological. its worth a try. don't panic, just manage it the best you can while working with the neurologists to find the cause. stay positive and keep your child's attitude healthy and positive. sorry i could not give you any more helpful info, but you helped me because i don't know anyone else going through these type of symptoms. good luck and god bless.",502,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"weird sensations making me afraid to lie down/try and sleep hi there, before you go ""woah, i'm not reading all that."", please, at least skim over what i've written, because this is getting difficult for me and i really have no idea what to do. i often have these weird sensations as i'm trying to sleep; i get this bizarre falling sensation. i know it's not a hypnagogic jerk, because i don't have to be falling sleep or even feel sleepy for it to happen; it can happen whenever i'm really comfortable and relaxed, so that's why it's usually when i'm trying to sleep, but it can even happen when i'm just really relaxed while sitting down. it's pretty hard to describe, but it usually starts pretty slow, i'll feel like a part of me in my stomach and chest is slowly falling a little bit through my body, but then i feel like i'm falling further and it gets really scary so i change positions and shake myself to get rid of the sensation. sometimes before it happens i'll feel like my body is gently swaying up and down, or swinging from side to side. i've never allowed the sensation to continue for very long because of how scary it feels and because i'm scared what will happen if i let myself continue falling. as stupid as this sounds, i'm scared if i allow myself to fall too far i'll actually fall through my own body or something. this all started a few months back, when i just spent some time lying in the sun and relaxing, and i started breathing slowly in and out and imagining myself swaying up and down until i could actually feel it, and swaying side to side, or zooming forward and backwards. it was pretty fun, but then all of a sudden i got the falling sensation i described and quickly jumped up. it felt really scary. that night, i had trouble falling asleep, because even though i was really tired, whenever i got even close to falling asleep i'd get the falling sensation and have to sit up or shake myself or something to get rid of it, and then i'd try and fall asleep again but it would just happen again; i also kept getting the weird swaying sensations that i was making happen before it happened for the first time. eventually, i fell asleep somehow. i don't get it anywhere near as much as that night any more, sometimes i don't get it at all. it often just happens because i'm thinking about it, all i need to do is relax my body and think about it and it'll happen. if i think about the swaying sensations they'll happen too; they're not unpleasant but if i have them too long they lead to the falling sensation, so i don't want the swaying sensations to happen either. i hate it when i end up thinking about either of those things because it makes it hard to get to sleep or relax, because something similar like what happened that night will happen, although not as bad as it was then. usually the falling sensation happens only occasionally now though and i can often get to sleep with no problems by just not thinking too much about it. but just now, something else weird happened. i was trying to have a nap, but then i felt like my body was rising up a little bit and part of me was being pulled towards my feet. it disturbed and scared me so i kept shaking myself and changing positions to try and make it go away because i was scared i'd end up being pulled out of my body or something. but every time i got comfortable the sensation returned. so i've given up on trying to sleep for now; i really hope this doesn't happen again in the evening because then i'm sure i'll be getting little, if any, sleep. i'm a teenager, female, have never done drugs and have not been diagnosed with any mental health issues, if that helps. and sorry if any of this didn't make sense or i started rambling; i'm a little tired. any suggestions?",503,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"auditory hallucination ""attack"" i was tired this morning and decided to try and take a nap. i hit my bed around 10:30 am and got up just now, around 12:30 pm. i don't think i ever completely fell asleep for whole time frame i was sleeping. sometimes i'd shift and be conscious of my self and feel like the bed is moving or that my body is elongating for a brief period until i drifted back into sleep. sometimes i'd become consciously confused between whether what i just messaged someone in my dream was actually sent in real life too. and at last, before deciding to wake up, and what instigated me to wake up, i auditory hallucinated really bad, and it's the most terrifying thing ever. i feel i should also mention that i'm normally capable of lucid dreaming and i do it very regularly, but what i had now isn't really a dream. i think, though, that it's why i was able to wake myself from it on my own will. just now this is the most i've had it in one session of napping: quietly i would hear a cellphone ring or a door shutting or people picking up ""hello?"" or different phrases from various random conversations, like one between a male and his female friend, ""yeah i'm gonna go on a date"" ""what're you gonna do"" ""i just don't want to"", different female voices, male voices, and just normal hustle/bustle and commotion that one would typically probably hear in cities or whatever, and each thing i ""heard"" while ""sleeping"" would be isolated and separate from the next, there was no overlapping sounds.. i feel as though the things i hear are probably things my subconscious picked up during visits to cities, which makes sense, but i'm just curious as to why i'd even be having auditory hallucinations of them. there was this one thing that set me off and it was just like... a creepy whisper going ""hi there nathan"". an aggresive voice ""hey nathan"" ""what are you doing there nathan"" and it just kept like getting deeper and deeper into my head, like, maybe the perpetrator in my mind was antagonizing this nathan kid and at the same time antagonizing me by being in my brain? i felt my head hurt. i made myself wake up because it really whacked me out and i didn't want the acquired headache to get any worse. i've had something like that happen before a couple months ago, where i'd heard a beeping noise in my sleep/""dream"" that gradually got louder and louder until it stressed my head and i had to force myself to wake up because i literally didn't think i'd be able to take anymore or else my brain would actually explode. that's about the only other time it's happened so vividly. i used to just hear phantom sounds when i was younger, ages 7-12, but it never really gave me headaches like that our disrupted my state, and the noises would be so slight and small and few that it would be like they never even happened. anyway, auditory hallucinations are terrifying for me. i don't take any meds for anything, despite the fact i've been diagnosed with social anxiety, anxiety, and depression. also, last night i had some anxiety episode (i'm not one to show physical symptoms of anxiety but i do experience it all just as bad in my head), what with thinking about school and interacting with 'friends' on facebook and feeling like i've overeaten and stuff, so that may also play a part in the reason why i had the auditory attack today? my question is, is this normal? and what's the explanation for why it happened?

""do you want huge spankings?"" same thing, except her facial expression says a big no. her pediatrician (who i believe to be a nut, we're switching), suggested that the only thing we can do is to leave her alone and let her go. when we've done so, it's lasted hours until she has a burning fever, drenched in sweat, starts vomiting until the point of dry-heaving, and complains of a headache after the fact. when we talked about it later, she's said that it felt like something in her throat closed and wouldn't let her talk even though she wanted to and the more scared she was of that situation, the tighter it got until she puts herself into a panic attack. obviously she doesn't want to be in this state, so negative re-inforcement like a spanking wouldn't do anything. and once she's in this state, no amount of hugs or talking gets through because she's so hysterical. again... her pediatrician says it's ""just a fit"" and not to worry about it. the reason i'm posting this in the sleep section is that i believe it has something to do with her sleep... as she's only ever done this when she's very tired and gets upset about taking a nap. it isn't always this bad... but no matter what else she may get upset about... it's only this bad when she obviously needs a nap and has it set in her mind that there's no reason to take one. once asleep, she also sleeps like an absolute rock. at 5 years old, she still has accidents almost every night and doesn't even notice. she was solidly potty trained while awake at 3, but no progress at night (we've talked to drs and tried a lot of things for this). she can also sleep through very loud noises, and if she falls asleep in my arms, i can toss her over my shoulders in a fireman carry and walk around a store for quite a while and she'll sleep right through it. i think whatever it is must have something to do with genetics, her baby brother started sleeping through the night at maybe 2-3 months (also sleeps through smoke alarms... although he's not a grump... if you wake him up early, he's the happiest thing in the world). her mother still sleeps like a rock and had bed-wetting issues through her teens, as did my wife's father. not sure about my wife's mother. some i've asked have suggested that my daughter may be somewhere on the autistic spectrum due to the severity of her fits (also her maternal grandfather is suspected to have aspergers, although never diagnosed)... but she's highly social, highly empathetic, has no attachment to any kind of routine or any fixations on any particular subject, will hug any stranger i let her, has far above average speech/vocabulary... .... yea... so... any ideas for things it might be so i can keep an eye out for the right things for when she does start seeing a professional? i have a small background, minored in psychology and have always been interested because i'm a weirdo and my side of the family are all bat-(blank) crazy.",535,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"completely reliant on an application to sleep. is there something i can do about this ridiculous rut i'm stuck in? in 2010 something traumatic happened to me. to zone out, i put on an application on my ipod of rain sounds that completely blocks out external noise. from that day onward i continued to use it to help block out external noise. without that application, i can't sleep. i have gone days without it and i'm an absolute wreck.i can't sleep at all without it. it is the only thing that gets me to a peaceful state and blocks out external noise. it does not work properly on my phone because my phone does not allow the volume to go loud enough, so it's useless. i am extremely sensitive to any external sounds, like the birds in the morning, light, dogs barking.. etc. i need it if my parents are fighting or talking about me negatively. it's the only thing that puts me at pace. any single noise will disrupt me trying to sleep. my mind won't calm down without it. lately, my ipod earphone jack has broken down. it's broken so that sound only comes out of one ear, despite having new earphones. i spend a lot of time twisting, prodding and moving them throughout the night every night so the sound comes out properly. but any slight touch can stuff it up again. this makes for a very exhausting time for me. the first weeks when this happened i was taking it really hard. i still had sleep, but i was depressed and couldn't see properly as i was tired.. that has stopped and i can cope with it better now, but i'm still tired. tired because i'm not getting the sleep i used to when it was better you have no idea the ridiculous things that i have done involving my ipod and sleep. one time i left my earphones at my mother's place and ran there in the middle of the night to pick them up as she had no petrol. i was that desperate for sleep and that's how much i need them. when i moved back in with my parents, my step father accidentally removed the app on my ipod. they had no modem that could connect to my ipod, so i was in a state of panic for about a month. i begged them daily because i was going through utter hell. eventually they got it (angry of course) and i was better again. i lived alone for several months, all what keep me sane till i couldn't stand it living there no longer was that ipod solely. i can easily go through 5-6 pairs of earphones a year (or more). when they stop working, i usually go a week till my next pay and suffer during those days of no sleep till i get a new pair. it's so mentally challenging and all i want to do is shut everything out of my head. i don't know what to do about my ipod now, because i can't afford to get it fixed and i don't even know if it's fixable. i hate being reliable on that to keep me 'stable' with my mental state. without it i can't function and i'm angry and moody and constantly in a daze. is there something else i can use to block out all noise with natural rain sounds that i can plug into my ears comfortably? i have thought about a stereo, but that won't work because i will rip it out of the hole when i toss and turn at night and probably break the earphones. my room plug hole is too far away from my bed too. i am happy about buying a rain sounds cd, as long as it doesn't contain thunder or birds in the music and keeps playing the same thing for about 8-10 hours. but i don't know how i could use that so i blocks out the neighbours dog or my parents.",540,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"completely reliant on an application to sleep. that's a tough situation, weirdone. so, a couple of thoughts. you could get a rain sounds cd and rip mp3s [or you might find some online for free. youtube might have long-playing videos of rain that could work. and use something like http://savevid.com to make an mp3.] then use a cheap mp3 player to hook yourself up at night. but that isn't an long-term solution. you need to wean yourself off this somehow. i don't usually tell people what to do. and you are completely welcome to ignore me. i am just a random person on the internet. only, this seems like it would make it difficult to share a bed with someone in future. and it's not usual for sleep to be so dependent on an external factor. perhaps you could try dropping the volume a very small amount each night. so that the change is imperceptible. over time, it will add up. you'll be getting yourself used to hearing little sounds while you sleep. and ignoring them, like you used to do. or, you said that you're beginning to cope with the broken ipod so perhaps it's better not to look for an alternative at all. but continue to push through, waiting for your sleep to get back to normal. also, with the traumatic event, have you spoken to anyone about that? if it's still causing you issues, that could be appearing as this sleep disorder. in which case, relieving your dependence on the app might cause a different anxiety issue to appear. and perhaps working through the trauma more might ease your sleep anxiety. just another thought. “ we think too much and feel too little. more than machinery, we need humanity. more than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. ” charlie chaplain in the great dictator",541,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"levitation hi, i'm very new to the forums here, so i'm unsure if i even posted this at the right place. i also don't know where else to post this, because i would like input from from a psychological and spiritual viewpoint both (if the latter applies). anyway just a little bit about me, though you may skip this paragraph if you wish. i'm currently in college working for my bachelor of arts in psychology, because the subject interests me, and i'm hoping to go somewhere in the future with this field. however there are many things i wonder about, which, as a future psychologist, i would like to understand so that i can explain to future patients. like with many people, i tend to forget my dreams. sometimes i will remember some pieces here and there, but everything else is lost in my memory. i've had a moderate amount of dreams in which i could remember a lot, if not, all of it. but never have i ever sleep walked before (at least to my knowledge). except this one time... i was staying at some apartment/hotel (cannot remember which) with my parents, and i want to say i was in my mid-teens or so, maybe 16 or a bit older. my parents went to sleep, and i went to my room to lay on my bed. now before i mention anything else, you guys know that tingly feeling you get when your foot is asleep? i believe it's possible that i may have slept in a funny position, but instead of it affecting my foot, it was somewhere in the back of my head, perhaps between the neck and head (medulla? i could be wrong). anyway, i do remember a tingling sensation of some sort, especially after i woke up, but i will get to that later. during my sleep, i got out of bed, and i was aware that i was doing so. i walked over to the kitchen, and i was doing something at the counter, but i cannot remember what. then i instinctively peer down at the ground, and notice that: 1) i cannot feel the ground beneath me, yet i felt it when i was walking to the kitchen 2) i felt light 3) i was floating, possibly several inches above the kitchen floor my reaction was surprise, and even though i was aware that i had been lying in bed moments before, i could not tell if i was sleepwalking, or if i was dreaming that i was doing this. everything else that happened after that was very blurry in my memory, but i was somehow back in my bed (cannot remember how i got to it), and i found myself desperately trying to wake myself up. after being seemingly paralyzed for a minute, i finally ""woke"" up. i could feel the back of my head tingling with that sensation of 'your foot having fallen asleep' but on the head instead. scared, i darted over to my parents bedroom and woke them up. i described to my mom what had happened, but she was too sleepy to decipher the meaning, and told me to go back to sleep. i never told her about it again, until recently, and she said that i should do some research on this, because it is unusual. it can't be that unusual, because i've been reading about people expriencing some similar things. does anyone have some kind of explanation for this? was it really related to how my body was positioned when i fell asleep, or something else? thanks",544,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"years of sleeping problems hello, for five or six years now i've had massive issues with my sleeping off and on. i've been diagnosed with circadian rhythm sleep disorder, meaning that my internal clock isn't what it should be. treatment is melatonin and/or light treatment, none of which worked. i've tried every single sleep hygiene tip that's out there, and now given up. i'm tired of not having functioning sleep, and i was hoping you could have any ideas. the problem has been different, sometimes extremely little sleep (1-4 hours a night for six months) where i was simply unable to fall asleep at the correct time. i always started waking up in the evening, making it impossible to sleep. since i had to get up at 5 in the morning for school at that time, sleep was scarce. i completely collapsed and flunked out of school after that, and i feel i haven't really recovered since. some months i can't sleep more than four hours at the time, sleeping several times during a day. some months i seem to have a normal sleep, where i feel i can function pretty well. now, for quite a few months, i've been unable to function during the day unless i have 10-16 hours sleep. if i have any less, or more, i'm tired and drowsy all day and my mind just doesn't function. needless to say that any attempt on a normal life with this sort of sleep pattern is rather difficult. it doesn't help that i'm awake most of the night, and sleep most of the day. i'm lucky if i get to the store. i also get extremely tired very easilly, and if i have an early appointment that only lets me sleep for about 5-6 hours (which should be sufficient for a normal person) i'm knackered for days. i don't drink caffeine anymore, i gave it up in hope of improvements. there hasn't been any so far. i don't smoke, drink or do any drugs, except for prescribed medicine. i've been on and off on sleep medication (i'm afraid of getting hooked). i'm thinking that it might have somthing to do with my recent asperger diagnosis. sorry for the long post. i really hope someone out there could have any ideas.",548,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
"can't wake up on my own, always sleeping but still tired i figured i'd post here and get some perspective. first i'll explain what i've been going through best i can. (important note: i work the graveyard shift, from midnight-8:30am usually. generally i like to get home from work, do a couple things, then go to sleep before noon. then, sleep for a while, wake up around 7pm or so, and have my time to do things then, after sleeping and before work.) it all started about 4 months ago, give or take (bad memory). one night, out of no where, i slept until 11 pm (i try to leave the house to go to work around 11:40 pm). there was no gradation between waking up at a normal hour and waking up at a late hour like that. it just suddenly happened one night. ever since then, most nights, i wake up right around 11 pm no matter what i do (usually about 11:15 pm. i call it 'amityville horror curse' since it feels like it anyways). it can vary, sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little later. once in a blue moon i will sleep even later (to the point that i'm ate for work, but still sleeping) or even rarer, i'll wake up earlier (and by earlier i mean about 10 pm). now, it's not like usual, where someone wakes up, hits the snooze, goes back to sleep. aka, making a conscious decision to go back to sleep. i literally hear nothing, and don't wake up, and have no ability to wake myself up. my body just wakes up when it wants to, and there's nothing i can do about it. so i'm nearly terrified to sleep, since i don't know if, when i wake up, i will already be late for work, or what. i've tried several different things to wake up. i already have 3-4 alarms, and have tried setting them earlier, later, etc. nothing works, and usually i never hear them. i've tried sleeping with the tv on and off. i've tried sleeping earlier and later. nothing changes anything. i, on average over these months, sleep about 12 hours a day (sometimes i go through periods, like now, where i'm saying screw it and going to sleep around 4 pm, and getting about 7 hours of sleep). now, another thing is that no matter how long i sleep, i wake up completely exhausted (one day on my day off, i slept 24 hours, not waking up once in between. i woke up, and still felt tired later), to the point that about an hour after waking up, i am nodding off and falling asleep (not good for work). i at least have been prescribed some medication recently (used for a mental illness, but can double to work on lethargy), which at least keeps me from dozing off when i'm awake. on a rare occasion i will wake up to the alarms, a phone call, or just for no reason. but i literally can't get up/make it out of bed before falling back asleep. now, i've gotten blood tests and nothing is abnormal. i don't have anemia, or thyroid problems. i can pretty much already rule out sleep apnea. i had a suspicion that it could maybe be chronic fatigue syndrome, but i don't know. i'm trying to apply to do a sleep study. i know it's not just simply 'being depressed'. i've had depression my whole life, and have dealt with it. it wouldn't just suddenly effect me. besides, it doesn't explain being exhausted after sleeping plenty, or not ever waking up during sleep for any reason, until my body wakes up on it's own. it's not because of my work shift, since it still doesn't explain not having energy, and i've been at this job over a year and am fine with it. i didn't change any prescriptions (or anything else for that matter) around the time it started. i'm completely stumped, and annoyed. i literally don't have a minute of the day to myself. i have no time to clean, walk my dog or do anything with him, to relax, to do anything. i know people say all they do is sleep and work, but that's *literally* all i do most of the week. it's horrible, and i really can't have it effect my job anymore, because it's been effecting that to a degree. in summary: - i sleep long hours (against my will) but never gain any energy, and am so exhausted when i'm awake that i need to take prescription medication to keep me awake. nearly positive it is not: - depression/emotions -medication/diet/etc. change -laziness -thyroid issues -anemia -sleep apnea if anyone could give me any insight or suggestions or anything else, it would be appreciated. in the meantime, i hope to find a sleep study as soon as possible, and hopefully that can shine some light on the issue. [edit: just an added note, don't think it has much to do with the issue but figured i'd add it. since around that time i've noticed that i must bite/grind teeth in my sleep because i often wake up with the insides of my cheeks and lips shredded. not bleeding usually, but the outer layer of skin is shredded to bits.] ☥fiat justitia ruat coelum☥ rex - 22 - male - host duke - 31? - male - alter non-diagnosed",549,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"meladaptive daydreaming disorder so, i have meladaptive daydreaming disorder, and most days i cope with it alright, trying hard to keep myself focused. it's like my mind gets so wrapped up in deep thoughts or daydreams that i can hardly do anything quickly. i often find myself staring into nothing once i realize i'm daydreaming again. it's like i can't really control it. when i take showers, i always find myself staring at the faucet for 10 minutes or so before i realize i'm supposed to be taking a shower. when i go to the bathroom to do something like brush my hair or teeth i find myself staring into space, simply letting my mind go wherever it wants. it hasn't usually caused me much trouble other than people complaining about me taking way too much time to do things. of course, what am i supposed to tell them? ""oh well i was staring for 10 of the 15 minutes i was in there."" of course not. my family would think i've lost it if they knew this was an every day thing. the days that i can cope with it and keep myself occupied are unfurtunately the days that i have the worst anxiety issues. it's like i need to have my head in the clouds in order to escape unnecessary panic all day long. i feel like it drags me down completely. i can't just be alert and calm at the same time. i would much prefer a life without these disorders, but i have to learn to cope with such things. most of my daydreams are about situations in my life or daydreams about what would happen if i acted a certain way. it's like a whole scene plays in my head and i can't help it. also, a lot of them are about storylines, mainly a character in the book i've been writing, and anime (yes, i am a total nerd). some nights i just lay in bed for hours consciously dreaming about things like that. so much so that i often lose a lot of real sleep. however, i've been working on that book for over 4 years now and i've only gotten the footnotes and chapter one written. i start writing and then i begin to daydream. most people call me lazy, but i can't control it very well. i'm not a lazy person. i simply can't help the fact that i get caught up in thoughts and daydreams. it really makes me lose all motivation. i end up wasting too much time on things and they never get finished. i don't even know what career field i want to go into! i've been in college for two years now for advertising and business, and after daydreaming about medical things, i've now decided i want to study in the medical field. oh and apparently i'd like to open a cafe, and be a mortician, and start a charity, and become an artist, and be a writer, teacher, musician, music producer, and a vetinarian. it's like all these fantasies influence my personal choices and i have a hard time figuring out what i really want in life. i feel as if this disorder completely gets in the way of my everyday life, and i fear deeply that it's going to leave me with an empty future as well. any insight on this would be greatly appreciated.

"meladaptive daydreaming disorder yes! yes! and the worst is, it's not a diagnosable disorder. so you might find a therapist or psych willing to work with you on it. but you might also find them trying to label you schizophrenic, delusional, depersonalised or a number of other variations. insights. i've done it for 25 years, so in my case it hasn't worn off by itself. there's a recent discussion depersonalization/topic94387.html which might be relevant. it's hard to separate it from ""normal"" issues. i think not knowing ""what you want to do with your life"" is quite common only made worse by mdd. it's not [i am not a psych, this is only opinion] a result of mdd. yes, it may well mess up the future. i haven't done nothing with my life. but i wonder what would have been different if i hadn't been spending 6-14 hours a day daydreaming. i haven't unpicked the relationship between mdd and anxiety. i suspect that i might have been so anxious in the past because of the effects of mdd. but at the time, it very much felt like mdd was, as you say, an escape from it all. i also wonder if it's linked to ocd because of the compulsive and intrusive nature of the thoughts. it's stressful to try to choose not to daydream. i've stopped at the moment by taking n-acetyl cysteine [an amino acid] which i started to try and lift mood. had no effect on that but it was like an off-button for my daydreaming. it doesn't work consistently! but my advice is to research as much as you can and experiment safely. i had bad side effects from inositol which is helpful for ocd [which is why i tried it out]. just because it's from a health food shop, or is labelled a supplement, doesn't make it right for your body chemistry. seeing a psych may help, it's worth printing out an mdd info sheet to take with you. if they're willing to listen, they can be really helpful in tackling the anxiety which may be a trigger for you. and perhaps with the mdd too. just be really sceptical about taking prescribed meds. research them first. and let us know how it goes. “ we think too much and feel too little. more than machinery, we need humanity. more than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. ” charlie chaplain in the great dictator",553,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"strange sleep paralysis last night. so last night i had another bout of sleep paralysis, but this one was a lot different from the usual. usually i cant move period when it happens, and i don't really feel much of anything. occasionally i see the random hallucination of a figure made of shadow doing a whole lot of nothing but standing on the other side of the room until the paralysis wears off. this time was completely different though. rather than gradually waking up like usual it felt like i was just jerked awake like someone had just hit me or something. after waking up i immediately became aware of the sensation of being electrocuted, and it hurt. i wasn't paralyzed though, i could still move but it just made it worse and hurt more when i did. i also hallucinated something completely different than usual, but i don't think it's all that important(it involved one really freakin' tall alien) and it only lasted about a minute or so until everything felt like it just fast forwarded a good few hours to the point where it just started get light outside and i'm completely covered in sweat and it feels like i'm on fire. i had to get up and jump in an ice cold shower to cool off. i'd somewhat gotten used to my sleep paralysis for the most part despite it not being all that common, and then this comes out of left field. i've felt shook up all day and i even had a minor panic attack over it earlier. even the first time i ever had sleep paralysis didn't shake me up this bad.

"delayed rem, but not full on dsps? i've always had trouble waking up in the mornings, and in the last two years it's gotten exponentially worse, but the doctors can't figure out what's wrong. this is a long, detailed story so bear with me: background: from elementary to high school, i had to wake up at 6am, and according to my parents i was always hard to wake up, and it was always hard for me to fall asleep. i don't recall any of this (or much of my childhood period), and i'm still having extreme difficulty waking up. but here's the kicker: i don't have any problems going to sleep and i don't wake up in the night . usually, i go to bed anywhere between 11:30 and 12:30. i have no problems going to sleep, and i fall asleep within 20 minutes. i don't wake up in the middle of the night (that i can recall). when my alarm clock, which is situated across the room, goes off anytime before 10am, i get up out of bed in a foggy, drunken-like stupor, hit the snooze button, carry the alarm with me back to bed, and go back to sleep. as the alarm keeps going off every five minutes for the next hour or two, it is constantly interrupting my dreams and i continually wake up in a foggy stupor and hit the snooze button. my wife will try to wake me up and i will talk to her in my sleep, and then never remember any of it. by the time i wake up, it's 10-11am and my body feels horrible (almost aching all over) and i'm fatigued for the entire day. occasionally i will have ""excessive daytime drowsiness"" in addition to the fatigue. my wife also mentioned that she has dreams in the middle of the night , while i notice that i only have them in the late morning , which is what tipped me off that something isn't quite right. environment i've lived in the same house for 22 years. 11 years i slept in a downstairs bedroom, 11 years i slept in an upstairs bedroom. suffered from the same symptoms, though not as bad as recently. moved to a new place 8 months ago, and the fatigue and sleepiness hit me really hard the last 3-4 months. two years ago i spent most of march in japan, where i walked all over the place and was passed out asleep by 10pm and woke up at the crack of dawn, completely alert and awake, with no fatigue and no drowsiness during the day. come back home, suffer from jet lag for a month and a half, then i'm back into the same old painful cycle. spent a week this spring in hawaii, still slept late, had mild fatigue and no drowsiness. spent 8 months this past summer in california at an intensive language program where breakfast was at 7am, classes at 8am. the first 5 weeks i went to bed around 12-1am and struggled to wake up in time for 8am class. last 3 weeks i went to bed at around 11-11:30pm and was barely able to wake up by 7am, but was able to get breakfast and get to class on time. did not suffer from any fatigue or drowsiness at all. came home, i started sleeping even later, and feeling even worse. the only two environments where i did not suffer from this problem were california and japan, japan being the better of the two. doctor visits i went to my physician. he tested me for vitamin d, hiv, and some other run-of-the-mill stuff. couldn't find anything. i went to an endocrinologist. he checked thyroid, liver functions, testosterone, quartisol, vitamin d, bone density. didn't find anything wrong with me other than osteoporosis (at the age of 23 no less) and completely ignored my other symptoms and focused on the osteoporosis. went back to my physician, said the endocrinologist wasn't helping and things were getting worse. he said that i have a ""narcoleptic feel"" and referred me to a sleep study. went to a sleep study. went to sleep at 10:30pm, they woke me up at 5am. i woke up completely awake and alert, rested and refreshed. which never, ever happens at home. sleep doctor said my sleep study was normal. after i explained to him that i did not experience any problems at the sleep study, he thought that my problem could be environmental. then i told him that i've had the problem at 3 different locations, excluding hawaii, hotels, etc. then i mentioned that the alarm clock keeps interrupting my dreams. he said that that would make sense if my rem phase is delayed, and that the alarms are interrupting my rem sleep and i'm not getting any rest. so he suggested i push my sleeping schedule back an hour. currently i'm going to bed around 11-11:30pm, trying to wake up between 6:30 and 8:30. i still can't do it. if my rem sleep doesn't start until 5am, and doesn't end until 10am, how am i supposed to wake up and have a normal life? i've already had to drop a 10:20am class because i couldn't make it in time, and my cognitive functions are going down the toilet and i can't concentrate because i'm not getting any rest. and to make things worse, i have a 9:10am class next semester that i have to take. is there anything i can do to get my butt out of bed in the mornings?",619,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"rls and pain severe rls runs in my family. it is a mild form of parkinson's and, like parkinson's, the cause is neurological not muscular, so muscle relaxers, exercise of the muscles to exhaustion, stretching, and the like will not have a significant effect on your symptoms. rls gets worse as you get older and way worse if you are a pregnant woman. no treatment or drug ever works long term, so you will have to develop a good relationship with a neurologist that is an expert in the disorder so you can keep tweeking your medication routine as needed and even take ""medication holiday"" to bring your tolerance back down to the point where meds can help. fibromyalgia is highly correllated with rls. the pain that you are experiencing could be due to fibromyalgia symptoms and may be controlled by anti-depressent meds that focus on dopamine and/or seretonin receptors. on line support groups are a great help. there is one through usc that is monitored by a leading expert in the subject and he gives excellent advice. good luck.",623,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"please help with advice on sleep disorder/chronic fatigue hi everyone, i am really hoping that someone on here has some information/advice/help for me on a long-term issue that i am suffering. it seems to be getting worse, it's driving me crazy and i want to get a life now that i am a mum! ever since my late teens i have always needed heaps of sleep and have always felt extremely tired. i have never had any energy or stamina and i always feel generally 'achy' and sometimes 'spaced out'. it is not unusual for me to sleep for 12+ hours and still wake-up feeling exhausted and in need of more sleep. i never, ever wake feeling refreshed and require several very loud alarms going off repeatedly to actually rouse me. i never wake, not even to use the toilet. i have visited the gp at least 4/5 times and had tests for anaemia, thyroid disfunction, diabetes, glandular fever, white cell count, kidney/liver function and endless other things all of which have come back negative. [i almost wanted 'something to be wrong so that at least i know what it is and can be treated] other than doing the tests, the gp's have never taken me seriously and once the results have come back negative, they have almost 'dismissed' me as being depressed or made me feel like i was making it up. i have almost felt embarrased or akward as if i had an illness to be ashamed of. i have more or less resigned myself to having to live with it and just get as much sleep as possible but i have never really had any sort of 'normal' life. i don't really achieve much, [if anything] some days and most importantly of all i now have a gorgeous, wonderful son and i can't be the mother i want to be. i want to be able to care for him properly, to play with him properly but i can't because im always so worn out, all i want to do is sleep, or at least rest. in addition, obviously my 15 month old wears me out more because he is constantly on the go and into everything and i cant keep up with him. i get so tired i want to drop and then i get moody and irritable. in addition, i also suffer from severe back pain [and general stiffness in the joints, particularly the knees] i have been diagnosed with oesteo arthritis of the spine. i regularly take diclofenac or other strong painkillers to alleviate the pain.... prior to having the baby, although i did not like having to live with the constant exhaustion, it was 'manageable' - i simply slept for very long periods [sometimes 18+ hours, all day and night constant sleep] i iterally had 'no life'. i merely slept and worked and that was it. now i have the baby, its difficult to sleep for very long periods and even if i did not have my stunning little boy i don't know how much longer i could go on feeling c**p all the time. i want to have energy and i want a life. my mum helps with the baby and has him for me [work permitting] if i am having a really bad day but i want to be there for my son and not rely on her. more inportantly, it frightens the hell out of me that i am not alert and 'on the ball' or that i wont wake up if there is something wrong with him [i am a single parent - the baby's cot is in my room] or i will 'miss something' if he is ill and will fail to spot it. i am reluctant to go back to the gp because of the way they made me feel previously. i tried to purchase modafinil/provigil online but its not available without prescription and its very expensive. i would like to ask the gp to prescribe it, but i have a feeling that they wont without a diagnosis and will be reluctant to do so anyway because it costs a lot. please, please does anyone have any advice, tips or anything would be so useful - i am desperate. thank you for reading, sorry the post is so long.",630,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"apnea sleepwalking enuresis tenant this is about a 30 year old who is my tenant and lives above me. i would guess he was a bed wetter sleep walker child and it was not handled well at the time. i am a former licensed psychologist with ms now, so i no longer practice, and i have no experience with sleep disorders anyway. i do have empathy for my tenant, however. i've been renting to him for 3 years. there are a number of facts and symptoms which point to trouble, which i really don’t want to be responsible for any more. i do remember seeing odd welts on his forehead when he first moved in. he asked to replace his carpets one time, as he claims they smelled (carpets were new). later i found pet stain & smell remover spray under his sink (during repair). i had inquired as to his snoring like a freight train before his 1st renewal, and he moved his bed to another room. about at this time i became aware that noises at night were in reality his sleep walking, and they have been very loud and shocking from time to time when he falls or knocks something over (perhaps once a month). thud wham bamb at midnight! he drinks alcohol heavily when he gets home from work and until bed, (i see his trash). i would guess he believes it helps him sleep. he apparently does not realize it contributes to sleep walking plus urinating. finally, he has a compulsive water usage problem also, sometimes flushing the toilet 6 times in a row. (i pay the water bill.) he fills 30 1/2 gal. jugs of water at a time (what for?) i have asked him if there is anything wrong with the toilet (he says no). because he lives on the 2nd floor with a stairway leading down from the living room with no door or gate, i would have to guess this to be very dangerous in his situation. renewal of the lease is coming in a couple months. i would like to treat him like an adult and do not want him to be vindictive. i’m sure he faced a lot of ridicule and discrimination as a child at camp and sleep-over time. he does not have a partner and spends almost all of his free time on internet games. currently i am thinking about giving him the option to seek ongoing (provable) treatment in order to remain. any hint of failed treatment that is not ongoing will violate terms of the new lease and he will be asked to leave.

"is a sleep disorder ruining my marriage? first off i want to start this by saying some of the thing i am going to put here is totally embarrassing, so please understand how hard this is. i am 30, i have 3 kids, and recently married their father (in feb of this year).for as long as i can remember i have fallen asleep easily. watching tv, movies...in class...even in the middle of band in high school i would fall asleep sitting in the chair, instrument in hand. it’s not that i *want* to i just can’t help it. in the last year or so i have been dealing with chronic feelings of being tired, no amount of sleep helps. i can go to bed as early as 8:30-9:00 sleep until 7am and still be tired. i don’t toss and turn, i don’t dream i just never feel rested. it has gotten to the point that i can be sitting at a table with friends playing a board game and drinking coffee...one moment i am awake and talking the next thing i know someone is waking me up. i fight all day to stay awake at work. i fall asleep eating..smoking...anything. while this may sound strange it has started to take a huge toll on my marriage. my husband will come to bed at night and try to wake me up (he works 2nd shift) and i wont even roll over. i may on occasion push him away but never anything more. he has even go so far as to wake me up with sex and even with that i wont wake up. so he thinks i am not turned on or please by him..and doesn’t understand i have no control over what is happening. it hurts his feelings and is to the point we fight about me falling sleep on the couch or anywhere else so much that we don’t even talk anymore. i have tried everything. if i am not standing up physically moving or working on something that requires my total attention at work 9 times out of 10 i will be asleep in less than an hour. my doctor has been no help and i don’t know what to do. i am looking at loosing my job, my husband..and if i fall asleep driving again maybe my life. is this some type of sleep disorder?",658,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"not sure there is a name for it... hi f.i.t.h, i have been looking on lots of websites trying to figure why i am sleepy all day, and one that has come up a lot is circadian rhythm disorder, which seems to involve difficulty maintaining a sleep routine - worth googling that and seeing if anything rings true. i also watched a tv programme about sleep - think it was one of the bbc channels - they showed dominik diamond, a journalist and tv presenter trying to overcome his insomnia. he ended up sleeping at erratic times and then had enough sleep that day so couldn't sleep when he wanted to and then was exhausted the next day and so on... he did a video diary of sleep deprivation therapy, where he was only allowed 6 hours, and needed to get up after time was up, even if he hadn't slept the whole time. gradually he was allowed to go to bed earlier (no daytime naps no matter how tired he was) but the getting up time stayed constant. i think it worked although i fell asleep through the programme myself so not sure how much i missed! i would guess something like that would need to be done under medical supervision as lack of sleep carries its own risks, and would not be a bad idea to see a doctor anyway. i have also seen a lot about disturbed sleep patterns and depression, or depression treatments being used to cure sleep disorders, so the gp would be the first port of call for that. hope it helps, mairi",666,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"any advice? i have had problems keeping a steady sleep schedule for about three years, but recently i have had some new stuff pop up. i have a hard time explaining it to my t and nurse, because it changes often. i've had some med changes recently, quite a few of them actually, so maybe that is it? i was originally on trazodone, then it changed to ambien but insurance didn't cover it (ambien worked very well for me, it was amazing, but we couldn't afford it) and then i took temazepam but it didn't really help at all so about two weeks ago i stopped taking it and never refilled my script. even though i wasn't taking a lot, only 12.5mg (sometiems 2 of them) of the temazepam each night, i think it might have something to do with this crap that's been happening. it has been reoccuring nightmares, usually 4-5 times each week for about the past 3 weeks, that has been driving me crazy lately, along with other things. on the nights that i don't have them, i won't have them at all, but the nights that i do, i usually wake up multiple times and fall right back into where it left off unless i get up and distract myself for a bit. also i have been getting really itchy at night and i'll start burning up. usually during the day i am exhausted, when i first lay down, i truely feel very tired. i'll usually lay there for about a half an hour, which is a big improvement compared to when it was 3-4 hours before. but now, i'll usually fall asleep fairly quickly and then after anywhere betweek ten minutes and a few hours i'll wake up suddenly, usually from what sounds like screaming in my head if it's been only a few minutes, or if it's been longer, usually a nightmare. it's not always bad dreams though, sometimes i just wake up. immediately after i wake, i'll have, not really a burst of enerydy per se, but i usually sit up right away, and if i try to fall back asleep i can't and i usually will get up like i said earlier and find something to do. i just can't go back to sleep. then i will do this over and over again all night. this is mixed in with me not being able to sit still. i feel like i have to move, i go from one side of the bed to the other, moving into different positions constantly. it feels like while doing this, i am half sleeping, half awake. i don't always know what is real. i hear people screaming and see patterns in the lights. i get twitches and start talking aloud to myself to try to calm myself down, i think i am going crazy. i seriously question my sanity at night. i am so afraid that i am going to fall into a bad dream and never get out. i don't know. maybe this is just stress, my life has been kind of messed up lately. for me in the past, sleep and marijuana were the only two things that i really enjoyed, i loved both of them, it was where i could escape from the daily bs i put up with and could relax and just feel good. just laying there. i had to stop smoking first because of the meds, and then because of a job, and i stopped for months. i had no problem doing this even after smoking on a daily basis for quite some time. so now the only good thing i had has been taken from me. so because i no longer am on any meds and won't be drug tested , i am thinking about smoking again. i think it might help. my t reccommended a sleep study, so that should happen in the next few weeks hopefully. but til then i don't know what to do. i think i might refill the temazepam and see if that might help. anybody have any thoughts on this? any suggestions?",717,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"rem and dream symbols what is rem? if you said it’s a southern rock band then you are correct. but this article is about rapid eye movement, rem. much of our memorable dreaming takes place during what is known as rem sleep. rem is a sleep stage that is marked by movements of the eye behind the closed eyelids. accompanied by the appearance of characteristic rhythms in the brain’s electrical activity. there are 4 stages of rem sleep. the first stage takes place about 90 minutes after you fall asleep and last for approximately 5 minutes. three of four further periods of rem sleep occur during the night at intervals of about 90 minutes, each lasting longer than the previous one. the last period of rem sleep usually occurs one hour before you awake. rem sleep is where you dream……… do you ever wake up in the morning and say, “ i had a strange dream or a bad dream ”. or maybe you had some prophetic dreams or a digital dream. scientific research indicates we can remember about 80 percent of each dream episode if we are awaked immediately after its completion. but this drops to about 30 percent with in the next eight minutes or so and then rapidly declines to about five percent. next time you have a dog dream, a hair dream, a vista dream or maybe even a green dream grab a piece of paper and pen when you wake up from the dream. make notes of the dream and any type of dream symbols that occurred. while scientists generally agree that the process of dreaming is important, many of them believe that the content is valueless. however, the coherence of much dream material and the existence of recurring dreams, which repeat themselves over many years, would suggest otherwise. the appearance in dreams of memories from long ago and the proven therapeutic value of dream interpretation, confirm that the dreaming mind can give us valuable guidance. http://www.dream2see.com",728,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

nighttime behaviors i have a problem and i don’t really know if there is a reason or even an actual name for it. i do some odd behaviors in my sleep. the first thing is hitting. for some reason while i’m sleeping i reach out and punch my wife in the back. if she isn’t there or i’m on my other side i usually hit the wall several times and very hard. sometimes i have dreams of hitting someone but most of the time i have no memory of anything. the next thing is masturbation. my wife says that on a few occasions she has been woken up by me masturbating quite heavily and very fast. my wife said that she tied to stop me and that i got violent when she tried to hold me or move my hands. she has said that i don’t speak coherently it is really more moaning and mumbling. the other thing is talking. my wife is not the first to mention this i was told by my comrades in the army and my mother. the talking ranges from yelling and screaming to very quite mumbling and weeping. people have said sometimes it’s a word here and there other times i carry on conversations. nothing seems to increase or decrease it. i don’t know if i have a disorder or not what do you think?,731,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"intervention or not? my mother's committing suicide w/food i desperately need advice. my mother is over age 60 and obese. like many american women, she struggled with her weight through life, but nothing like this before. she has given up on herself, she is depressed, she can barely walk, her health is crumbling rapidly, and any attempt our family makes to ask her about it ends in her crying and acting like we're abusing her. she fully admits that she is an addict and runs to food to fill every void. but that's as far as she goes. she is unwilling to fix herself and comes up with elaborate excuses for why she can't work at losing weight. she and my father have been happily married for 40+ years, but i think he's nearly had it with her. as have the rest of us. having to watch her fist down a dozen pastries after dinner feels like i'm watching her slowly commit suicide. i've never been ashamed of her having some extra weight on her but now i'm deeply ashamed of her obesity. i cringe when we're together in public because people actually stare at me like, ""a good daughter would get her mother some help"". last year i offered to bring she and my dad on a family vacation and she said no because she can't walk. i told her she had a year to lose some weight before the trip and she looked at me like i asked her to model down a catwalk. so this is my dilemma... should i remove myself from her life? or should i have an intervention? i've removed less toxic people from my life in the past, but this is my mother! i want to travel with her and watch her play with my children, not watch her die of an addiction. it's so bad i can't even look at her when she's in the room. even my little kids ask ""why is grandma so fat? teacher says that's unhealthy."" one of the problems with intervention is that she's convinced herself i have no credibility because i've always been thin and have no addictions. whenever it has come up before she always starts with ""you don't understand because you're skinny."" - or so strong willed, etc etc. when i try to show her obese recovery stories she always has an excuse like, ""i'm older than her"", or ""shorter than him"", or ""she has a different body type"", or ""he has a fighting personality and i don't""... then the excuses expand - ""i can't afford to eat healthy"", or ""your father won't eat diet food"", or ""i 'd feel silly going to a therapist"", etc, etc... the thought of telling her i'm removing myself from her life makes me cry just thinking about it. but i'm spending far too much time miserable and frustrated because of her and it's starting to take its toll on *my* marriage and children now. any advice you can give me on this would be most appreciated.",752,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"addicted to fast food /takeaways i have a problem with fast food / restaurants. however my problem tends to be that it's way easier to eat out then it is to cook at home. i'm a single guy living in an ""apartment"" on zoo property. i love the atmosphere and everything but i have no bathroom / running water in my apartment. i have to walk / drive to the visitors center to take a shower / use the bathroom. i have however turned one part of my apartment into a kitchen with a hot plate, microwave, toaster oven, etc.. so i do have the ability to cook, it's just a pain in the butt cleaning the dishes afterwards lol. having to haul them with me to the visitors center. i have one of those 5 gallon water dispensers and i can refill it for $2.00 so drinking water is no problem. i would move out, but i can't justify it when i'm living rent / utility free, without having to lift a finger around the zoo unless i want to. of course with my love for animals i help out almost every day. so eating out is a convenience for me, and of course i love it too!",766,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"addicted to fast food /takeaways to caz and the others who have replied. i've only recently become convinced that the flavour enhancers that are used in our popular fast food places are addictive. i don't just mean 'tasty', as we all agree they are, but actually addictive! i've already submitted a post on that, a few days ago. i have to keep away from them, and i can actually walk past them, (thank goodness). when i'm out shopping, if i go in and have one, i'll be just like some of you and will think about the taste all day and every day, until i can't stand it anymore and go back. as has been said in other posts, it's almost as bad (if not worse) than alcoholism. the items we crave? we have to somehow not touch them. that, my friends, is the million dollar question. as someone else said, when you have a family and run a household, you cant punish everyone for your own problem, by never buying any of the items that set you off. why cant i have a craving for something simple like lettuce? as for the cost? i'm now trying to apply the same approach that i used (with success) when i gave up smoking. i think of the health aspect and the money aspect. i wish you all well, and will try to keep the forum posted.",769,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"help me my name is kamryn, i'm 16, and i have a crippling addiction to food. it started when i was probably about 8 years old, when i would sneak into my family's kitchen, early in the morning every day, and steal hershey kisses from a giant jar my parents had. from there, my food addiction arose. i suspect it's because i've not lived in the best conditions in my life and my family has been torn apart in the past year and a half that it has escalated. my parents started realizing it was a problem when, on several occasions,, they had discovered i had eaten food that was intended to be used for dinners (tortillas, cheese, chips, etc.). i started getting in trouble over it shortly afterwards and since then the intensity of my binging as well as my punishments that come as consequences have incteased radically. i write this now after being caught at 10:30 at night trying to sneak into the freezer and get an ice cream sandwich, my second one of the night. this is worse than usual, as it followed the discovery of the extent of my bringing from my dad, resulting in my grounding, as well as a disappointed talking to from my mother. i do not predict this will end well for me but i realize that it is my fault for trying to sneak food. i don't necessarily blame my parents either for over punishment for me, as it isn't just a health issue, but also a financial issue, as we don't have the money to be buying tons of food. i'm hoping that the people of this forum can help provide some support as well as advice for breaking my addiction. i don't know what to do. help me.",779,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"realization about my binge issue. granted my parents were those that told me to clean my plate and tempted me to finish things by giving food as a reward, but today i dawned on something i hadn't fully realized before. long story short, i had to change my diet because of an intestinal issue that would lead to me being hooked up to medical equipment for the rest of my life if i didn't take a step back now. i'm not overweight or in bad (looking) shape, but my digestive system seems to be held together by duct tape. over the course of a little over a week, i've noticed i haven't missed the food or caffeine which i also can't have at all. thing is i'm still binge eating from time to time, but only with healthy foods (i'm not allowed red meat, bread, pasta, artificial sugar, fried foods etc). the thing i do miss is the random energy spikes i would get. now granted i'm sure this also has to do with me being bipolar, but it seems i'm not so much a food junkie as much as an adrenaline junkie. one thing i've found is eating certain foods increase manic episodes with bipolar giving me a manic high with energy spikes. not sure where i'm going with this. i suppose i'll have to find a balance with foods that give me energy without going too over the top with it. i guess i'm also curious if anyone else had gone through withdrawals like that and how they handled the energy levels.",782,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"i think i have a food addiction... ever since i was a young girl i have been struggling to lose weight. my mom always felt i was overweight and so did my doctors. i am now 24 and 270 ibs and going up. i've always had disordered eating. i would lie about my food habits and hide food in my room to snack on. i have always prided myself on being someone who never did drugs or got into alcohol. i still don't drink and have only ever done drugs (weed) a few times. i always thought i was fairly strong to never get into these habits, because with my depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, i always really felt like i was exactly the type of person who might end up like that. the only problem i realize is now, is that i actually do have an addiction, only to food. i wish i had a clue where to start, but nobody really talks about food addiction and nobody can tell because i hide it, and eating is a normal activity. i know i am unhealthy and this is only making me feel worse. i recently went almost 3 weeks without eating any sweets (which are my main comfort food), and i fell right off the wagon during thanksgiving. i hate myself for this. i want help. eventually i would be willing to go to real life meetings or something to get help, and i already signed up for therapy, but this is all really scary and i would like to start here. hopefully i can find some helpful support from people who understand what i am going through.",797,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"depression, stress, and food addiction *tw* trigger warnings: overeating, binge eating, depression, anxiety and stress, criticisms from others, cultural ideas of fitness and beauty hello everyone. this is my first post on this forum. i decided to post here under addiction rather than binge eating because, well, the latter is the symptom of the former, and i don't binge so much as find myself desiring a food so much i can't avoid it. so, yeah, i'm addicted to food. i don't know why i am. it probably has everything to do with chronic low-grade depression that i've apparently had since about age 9, and it gets especially bad when i'm stressed out (which is always for the last oh 10 years). my parent's have no addictions at all, and i don't know anyone in my family that is addicted to anything. me, i'm addicted to food and anything else that ignites the pleasure center of my brain (movies, tv, hobbies...) and it has on occasion affected my life, but not drastically. my food addiction became obvious to me when i admitted to myself that i hid food, planned access to the hidden food, and ate food in secret basically all my life but increasingly so the last few years. everyone else i know loves food as much as i do, but they don't cave in to the slightest pang of hunger and run to the fridge. none of them are big people. so naturally i become ashamed and don't want to be seen when i secret-eat. even normal eating sometimes brings fears of ridicule. i'm nearly fainting from hunger not long after a meal (which is another problem), but i'm hesitant to even go and eat an apple lest i hear about it. ""you shouldn't snack,"" ""don't eat between meals"", ""you just ate"". sometimes these comments never come, but sometimes they do, from people who do not have the same stomach-schedule as i do, are not weak to their addiction. hints to the addiction were also seen in cravings. i will crave a food, a specific food so strong that it will put pregnant women to shame. if i don't eat that food, i will remain hungry. this can't be physical, because entire meals aren't satisfactory if i want something else. today, i had a wonderful, big lunch out. an hour later i felt hungry. yes, i am pmsing right now, and stressed and depressed because of reasons, but there was not one chance that i was actually hungry after eating a meal i could barely finish! i put off eating a snack until a couple hours later, but still. that doesn't make any sense. in any case, i'm addicted to food, all food really, but of course none of the healthy stuff. the depression tells me that nothing matters and that i should eat whatever i want because in the end i'm going to die anyway, might as well enjoy what i love most (and of course that happens to be food). the stress i have in my life is just worsened by the knowledge that i gained weight, because people aren't ""supposed"" to be fat, and of course most people will not find me attractive. even my long-term partner (who is living in another country at the moment) i worry will leave me once he sees the weight i gained, because he's french, and the french are morbidly terrified of fat. my issues with him is a whole other can of spam.... it's a vicious cycle of eating to de-stress and stressing because i'm eating. the thing i want most i guess is to stop not caring that i'm eating myself towards a heart attack, but i really need to stop being so addicted to the types of foods that are destroying my body.",828,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"is anyone else addicted to sugar? hi wise monkey good for you for having the self awareness to note this is a problem for you. i have been addicted to sugar for years so i totally get what you are going through. sugar is so insidious as part of our western culture and you are right it is in everything. i have recently gained a bunch of weight due to feeding into my sugar addiction. when i am under stress i can't seem to control my need to gorge on sugary and starchy things (coca cola; licorice black or red; jube jubes, bagels etc). i too have had yeast infections from over consuming over a period of time. and i am also obese as well. i've tried repeatedly to kick the habit and repeatedly failed. i'm posting 2 brief articles my husband wrote on the topic...at the very least it will help you know that this is a problem of epidemic proportions: article #1 a world without sugar? by marc tardif in november 2011, a substance known as stevia has been approved by the european food safety authority for use as a natural sweetener in drinks and food products. the united states granted stevia the “generally regarded as safe” (gras) status in december 2008. in canada, stevia extracts are not currently approved for use in foods, but health canada has approved the use of stevia and its extracts as a sweetener in natural health products. stevia can be purchased as dried leaves and in liquid format at most health food stores. so what is stevia? it is a liquid extract from the stevia rebaudiana plant, commonly known as “sweet leaf” or “sugar leaf”. this plant grows naturally in subtropical and tropical regions of the world. it is said to have up to 300 times the sweetness of sugar, but what is especially sweet about stevia is the fact that it has 0 calories. stevia is fast becoming an attractive option in a world where obesity epidemics are breaking out in most technologically advanced countries due to the overconsumption of refined sugar. this is no doubt a major motivator for western food and drug regulation agencies to fast-track their approval. stevia is also attractive as a replacement for aspartame and other artificial sweeteners due to the fact that it is natural and is not linked to cancer and other diseases in the way that chemically-based artificial sweeteners are. and for people with diabetes, stevia is a welcomed alternative as it has a negligible effect on blood sugar levels due to its low glycemic index and avoids the risks associated with artificial sweeteners. as one would expect, coke and pepsi are in a race to be the first to bring a stevia-sweetened soft drink to the north american market, as soft drinks have been identified as major contributors to the growing obesity epidemic. we could soon start to see new versions of stevia-sweetened soft drinks come onto the market, which has already happened in many asian markets such as japan. in fact, health food stores are now selling soft drinks sweetened with stevia, such as the zevia product line. the amount of new stevia-based products coming onto the market is increasing, but currently in canada you would only be able to find such items at your local health food store. eventually though, it is likely that stevia-based products will be available everywhere. article #2: hooked on sugar by marc tardif a minority of people have classified the growing obesity epidemic as a drug addiction issue. let’s examine the concept of sugar addiction a little more closely for it is one that causes much controversy. refined sugar is traditionally classified as a food “used to improve the palatability of many foods.” 1 a drug is defined as “any absorbed substance that changes or enhances any physical or psychological function in the body.”1 at first glance, it would appear that the words “sugar” and “drug” are diametrically opposed. but when you consider the effect of refined sugar on physiology and mood, the chain reaction of events is not entirely dissimilar to what happens with other drugs. when refined sugar is consumed, a chemical imbalance follows and the body reacts by pumping out insulin to bring blood sugar levels down to a normal level. for most people, mood tends to become more jovial after consuming foods containing refined sugar. and everyone can relate to the feeling of a “sugar high” and the “sugar crash” that follows. while the physiological and mental effects are different with each drug, the high- low cycle and dependence/addiction are hallmarks of drug-like substances. it has always been said that people feel more jovial after eating sugary foods because eating good-tasting food is more pleasurable than eating plain or bad-tasting food. while this is true, recent studies have shown there is more to it than that because refined sugar “is a depressant and, consumed in large amounts, it affects the opiate receptor sites in the central nervous system.” 1 these are the same receptor sites affected by opiates like heroin and morphine. but unlike other drugs, refined sugar is a tough habit to kick because it is added to most everything and is readily available everywhere. and because it is labelled as a food and not as a drug, the overconsumption of refined sugar is described as an obesity epidemic rather than a substance abuse issue. to find out if you are hooked on sugar, try removing foods containing refined sugar and flour and see what happens. you will probably experience withdrawal symptoms as your blood chemistry reacts to the reduction of glucose and the absence of the periodic surge of insulin into your bloodstream. studies have shown that withdrawal from sugar can be as painful as withdrawal from alcohol. it has been described by those who have undergone both as ‘worse'. 1 symptoms include mercurial mood swings, irritability, light-headedness and feeling clammy and sweaty. but in a few days you should eventually notice that you feel more stable and clear-minded now that you have gotten off the roller-coaster insulin ride and your opiate receptor sites are no longer being affected. to be clear, naturally-occurring sugars like those found in fruit are not the problem, it is refined sugars that are. thankfully, stevia is emerging as a better sweetener alternative which can go a long way to helping in the fight against obesity and addiction to refined sugar. look for it at your local health food store and use it in place of refined sugar. be careful though, it takes a lot less stevia than the amount of refined sugar that would be required to achieve the same sweetness.

"could i have a food addiction? new here and wondering if food addiction could be my problem. if you don't mind reading this i'd appreciate any insight. since i'm new to this so i'm just going to put it out there **this might contain triggers**. i'm a 36 year old female,and am significantly overweight. i've been increasingly overweight since my 20's. i've tried diets and exercise programs but i always manage to put back on everything i've lost and then some. food feels like my only happiness in life, and i've admitted as much out loud. in the morning the only reason i ever want to get out of bed is mostly because i can't wait to eat something. i'll lay in bed and think about what we have in the fridge/pantry and my excitement for whatever we has is what gets me going. if it's a lean week and we don't have anything good (ie; chips, candy, string cheese, soda, ice cream) i become so depressed that i don't want to get up. once i'm up all i do is think about what i can eat next. all day long. i wear a path in the floor from the couch to the kitchen. when i'm in front of other people i'll eat a normal amount, at a normal pace, and leave a normal amount on my plate all hoping to avoid judgement (can't be the fat girl who cleans her plate), but i'll go home and stuff my face. i rarely ever leave the house. i dread it. i feel so fat, so unattractive, that i don't want people to look at me. i don't even own any decent clothes that fit me anymore and i refuse to buy clothes for my fat self. she doesn't deserve it. she shouldn't even try. i live in fear of being invited to anything. i ended up quitting my full time job because i always had so much anxiety about going out in public and being judged. and i struggled with trying to look nice and professional while i hated myself so much. i would never eat lunch in front of anyone, i rarely ate anything in front of anyone. which is lame, i'll admit, because obviously i love eating...no one becomes this overweight suddenly or by accident. so now my husband and i are struggling to live off his income alone which means no vacations, no fun outings, no fun purchases. thankfully we can afford pizza. i don't have facebook or any kind of social media account because i used to be really pretty and i don't want anyone from my past to see what i've done to myself. i'm basically hiding from the world. i don't feel like i deserve to go out anyway. i go to great lengths to hide from friends and family because i worry there will be cameras and pictures of fat me will end up on facebook, and i worry about how my friends and family might judge me. in fact my sister asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding and initially i said yes but now i'm trying to think of a good reason to back out. i can't imagine standing up in front of 150 people and be judged, never mind that she'll plaster pics all over facebook (as is her right as the happy bride) and people will see what i've become, how far i've fallen. i'm just hoping to avoid all the anxiety and depression that i know will come with trying to ""pretty up"" myself and, naturally, fall short. with all of the ways that my eating habits have ruined my life (more than i've mentioned here) it occurs to me that i've allowed it to happen. and continue to allow it. but most of the time i feel powerless to eat less or more healthfully. junk food feels like my only happiness. even if it's just a moment of happy here and there. going to the grocery store almost feels like (what i imagine) going to buy drugs feels like. i'm wondering if i could have a food addiction. if i do i definitely came by it naturally...before she passed, my mother was a (recovering) drug addict and alcoholic. somehow i seem to have sidestepped those issues but i'm so fat. i'd almost rather be an alcoholic or drug addict because at least those people don't wear their addictions, not all of them anyway. anyone who looks at me, instead of through me, will assume i'm weak, suffering, lazy, unhappy, etc etc... it's so embarrassing to be overweight. do i have a food addiction do you think? last edited by salted lipstick on thu dec 04, 2014 4:18 am, edited 1 time in total. reason: no discussing of numbers please",855,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"how do i tell my mom i binge eat? i'm 16 years old & i'm a female. i tell my mom everything. she's my best friend. we tell each other absolutely everything. i'm just not sure how to tell her about this. there's a huge back story to this, but i think it's mostly due to stress. one year i lost 6 people who were very close to me within 5 months. i don't talk to one of my brothers anymore because he uses/makes crystal meth (he doesn't live with us anymore). my aunt can go to prison for 10+ years because of meth charges she has, my parents fight a lot, money is a big problem, my therapist doesn't help, my grandma is dying, my dad is dying, & it's making a huge impact on me. i was vegetarian for over a year, but my binge eating has gotten so out of control that i started eating meat again. (i became vegetarian for personal reasons, not health problems.) i spent 15 minute typing the whole story earlier, but it didn't save. i attempted suicide in february, i've dealt with self-harm for about two years, i've suffered with depression even longer. i was always a bit overweight throughout my life, but it's never been to this point. when i was on my vegetarian diet i was very happy and confident in myself, but a lot of family problems started going on and my school work was getting ridiculous. i would spend 3-4 hours after school working on school work & i would give my all in every class, but i would still just barely pass them. (i'm in 10th grade.) but recently my binging is beyond out of control and i've gotten to the point that i started eating meat again. the last thing i ever wanted to do is start eating meat again. one night it was so out of control i didn't even realize i was eating meat. my body soon got use to it and that's when i started gaining a lot of my weight back. i started going on late night drives to mcdoanlds, only a mile away, & i started hiding food in my room & car. i would eat secretly & constantly eat when everyone was sleeping. i would eat an entire cheese pizza at least 3 times a week. i would drink over 2 liters of coke a day. i would eat multiple ham & cheese sandwiches throughout the day & still snack in between. one night i ordered five double cheeseburgers from mcdonalds & hid them in my room. i baked & ate an entire cheese pizza in one sitting, ate two bowls of ramen noodles, ate a ham & cheese sandwich, & drank a gallon of sweet tea. after that i went & ate two of the five cheeseburgers then threw up because i was so full, then continued to eat the rest of the burgers, & made a grilled cheese sandwich and drank 32oz of coke. my food addiction is out of control. i feel disgusting and hate myself after binging, but i continue to do it and i don't know why. i current go to therapy for severe depression and anxiety. i'm on lexapro for my depression now, and it does help my mood a bit, but my therapist doesn't really help me. all she says is ""oh, tell me more. okay. i see. when would you like to schedule your next appointment?"" we don't really have a conversation, she just seems to pretend to act interested. my dad frequently makes comments on my weight like ""damn, you're getting fat!"" ""i can't find the tv remote. did you eat it?"" & things like that. i understand i'm overweight, but his comments still really hurt. i tend to wear over sized, baggy clothes to hide my body. i'm so tired of it. i know i need help and i really want to tell my mom, i just don't know how. how do i bring it up? what do i say? how do i tell her i binge to the point that i hate myself? my mom & i can talk about anything from drugs & sex to depression & suicide.

"hoarding + food? i am wondering if its possible to have a food an hoarding problem. this ironically is not being asked for myself it is actually being asked for my mother. i live with my mom...and even though she does not care to admit that she has issues of her own..like i do. she does seem to be a hoarder. the cubards in our kitchen are completly full all the time! if you were to take all the stuff out of them you would probably find dates on them that go all the way back to the 80's and i know that i have found things in the freezer before. that have freezer burn...she even has a huge outdoor freezer that literally things from when i was in elementary school. and she claims that she is saving it for special occasions and the words ""that was mine"" are heard quite a lot also. in fact the key to the outdoor freezer i have frankly not seen it in several months. what hurts even more is she knows i have an eating disorder. i do not always eat as often as i am supposed to or when i am supposed to. and i don't really always consider oh is this mine or is someone else's my mind set has almost always been if its in the house and its in the kitchen then anyone there can have it. but this is not how things work. i just heard her step into the kitchen and she is already complaining about the milk nearly being gone. my boyfriend and i drink milk....but he is getting paid tomorrow and has completely no issue what so ever in going out and getting new milk for the household. i get that she just got it a day ago...but honestly food is not a decoration its there to be in fact eaten this behavior drives me nuts and is one of the main reasons why i am working so hard at putting in extra hours and looking for a second job. so we can get out of this house. my mom refuses to see her faults will not try to get help or admit maybe she just like me has mental health issues. and i can not possibly move forward in my life dealing with my mental illness around someone that does not take care of theirs them selves.",859,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
"not sure if i'm a sufferer maybe others can relate, i'm not sure if i'm really suffering from a food addiction. my parents in law are suffering an addiction problem at the moment. my fiance's dad was diagnosed with lung cancer earlier this year but is finding it extremely difficult to stop smoking as is his wife. speaking to the pair of them i've noticed similarities between my own attempts to lose weight. i've struggled with my weight as long as i can really remember, i was always a bit podgy and was bullied in school due to this. i had a rather ""hearty"" appetite and sunday lunch was always two largeish bowls of pasta, tomato sauce topped with cheese at my grans house. as you can probably imagine high school was pretty hellish even though i wasn't hugely overweight. my parents made attempts to address my problem as i'd always opt for baggy clothes. unfortunately i think that only made matters worse and i started scoffing in private instead. my mother and grandmother always seemed to be at some weight loss class or another. both enjoyed some short-lived success at times but i just kept quiet regarding my weight. as an adult i've tried a few classes and like my mother and grandmother found it too difficult to stick to any plan. over the last couple of years my habits have gotten worse, i find myself constantly craving fast food, crisps and sweets. i reckon i must spend around £100 on fast food each month (which i can't afford to do). i shudder to think of the number of times i've opted to use £20 our weekly food budget on a take away rather than buying raw ingredients (which would give us far more meals). as a result we've then ended up having very little to buy proper food and ended up eating the same couple of cheap meals for a week. i frequently eat until i feel extremely sick, often think about food, have many many foul moods where i can only really focus on how weak a person i must be and this is pretty much ruling my life right now. over pretty much my whole life i've gotten bigger and bigger and am able to pack away a disgusting amount of food. i'm well into the obese numbers on the bmi chart and avoid going to my doctor in case he says anything about my weight. my poor fiance is at a loss so i'm hoping that maybe this is indeed what i'm suffering and i can perhaps find ways to help myself. my first step is to change my daily eating habits to ensure i have three nutritious meals a day with small snacks in between. at the moment i often don't eat until i get home from work at night then end up eating far more than i need. second step is to start making meals from scratch again. i always enjoyed making curry and pasta sauces but have gotten very lazy about this recently and have been buying jars from the shop (which are generally full of rubbish). i'll have a look at other threads for more ideas.",860,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
"just sharing my way of dealing with an eating disorder growing up, i was forced to take a lot of antipsychotics. as a lot of you may know, theh cause extreme weight gain mainly due to the appetite increase. i became a tyoe 2 diabetic at age 19 because of it, and my appetite was never the same even after stopping to take the drugs. i've managed to lose about 220lbs since 2009, and im still overweight and battle food obsession daily. taking lithium now, which increases appetite a little bit too. i've found a few techniques that seem to work, though some of you might find them silly or extreme. number one: dont count calories. or plan meals. or get a strict diet. im serious. we all worry so much about the food we eat that we end up thinking about food way more than we should. dont take note of what you ate, dont count calories, do t beat yourself up to keep it under control. the mere stress from doing this is enough to open an appetite. it obviously keeps reminding you of food. and really, spend 5 minutes telling yourself ""i will not eat my favorite item on burger king's menu, i will not eat my favorite item on burger king's menu"". what do you feel like doing now? number two: medication. if your appetite is too extreme, consider taking medication. or stopping. dopamine antagonists, antihistamines and serotonin increasers are usually the main culprits in appetite increasing. if you take antipsychotics, antidepressants, allergy medication or sleep aids, you might be getting your appetite from them. and honestly, its unlikely it will subside as long as you take the meds. rry switching around medications until you find one that impacts your appetite too much. dopamine agonists (aka stimulants) and other dopamine increasing drugs are in my opinion the best appetite supressants. number three: now, this is not healthy at all and outright gross, but.... ever considered not swallowing? lets be rational... any kind of food above your necessary daily calorie intake will become fat. on the other hand, your unconsiderate brain doesnt stop begging for more and more food. why dont you give it what it wants and buy a huge ammount of food? go all out on a favorite food shoppjng spree. get that delicious, ever so desired piece of delicious heaven on your mouth, chew it, savor it, chew it some more.... and spit it out. do it. i do it. i chew it and spit it on a plastic cup. i chew an entire pizza by myself and spit it all out. ebentually i get tired, satisfied ans grossed out. buys me more time without eating or thinking about food, and my brain gets what it wants without screwing up my body. number 4: try reducing simple carbs. i know i contradicted tactic number 1 here, but honestly, sugar is bad. it is addicting, it is very caloric, it is very easy to digest, it messes up appetite by itself and it is delicious. going cold turkey on sugary foods, pasta, bread and so on works best for me. you cant really stop a cocaine binging habit by reducing a few grams per day, i believe... the cocaine itself will make you want more from it. so will sugar make you want more and more sugar. *mod edit* anyways, this is what i do. i still battle a never ending appetite and food obsession daily and have trouble losing weight, but this is what worked best for me. last edited by oliveira on wed may 07, 2014 1:36 pm, edited 1 time in total. reason: pm to follow",861,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"what are your stories how did this all start? dear macdoublethefat, since my last post to you, i've had my share of ups and downs, as we all do on this forum. i'd like to say i don't think of food every day, from the moment i get up, to the moment i go to bed, but i'm afraid i still do that. some 'ordinary' eaters would say i must be bored then. i should find something else to do that would excite and stimulate me. i've always been a simple person. i enjoy my family, walking, shopping, reading, watching tv, gardening etc. when i'm doing these things, i'm feeling content, so why am i still thinking of food? crazy, isn't it? however, there is always hope. never forget that. i gave up smoking around 12 years ago, and although i regularly pat myself on the back for that success......i still have a sneaky feeling that my eating probably increased round about the same time, as they say smoking is an appetite suppressant. one of the reasons people don't give up smoking, as they are worried about putting on weight sadly. however, i overate a lot then, even while smoking, but i was a lot younger then and a lot more active, so i was burning off the calories. now, i've got lazy too. i have recognized the food items that i crave, and try not to buy them. i walk past the fast food places (who shall be nameless, but you know who i mean), as, just like an alcoholic, if i go in and eat one?.....i'll crave one the next day and the next. i am convinced that the flavour enhancers are addictive, just like other drugs. i also believe they are intentionally so. i also believe that if you stop.....and it will take about a week to hopefully get over the addiction....your taste buds will get used to unadulterated food items, especially if you can hang on until you are really hungry before eating. please re-visit, to tell how you are doing.",865,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
"one meal a day walking hi there, i wanted to share what i have been doing to lose weight and get some feedback. i eat one meal a day in the evening, something healthy and i walk a lot. i did my research and this is healthy according to my sources. the articles said no one has time to prepare six small meals much less eat them and it's too costly. they said if you exercise i.e. aerobics, it makes you eat more and move less than you would have throughout the day. they said people can lose weight the hard way (lots of exercise, frequent small meals, lots of fruits and veggies) but because it's so hard, people have a hard time keeping the weight off. i feel like i can eat this way for life. i have lost 14 pounds so far. malcolm x ate one meal a day for 12 years. the people who did the autopsy and he had the cleanest insides they had ever seen. thoughts?",866,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"one meal a day walking i think it's unhealthy, and here's why. eating one meal per day or restricting in general might cause the insides to look clean, it will have an impact at the cellular level. your body needs a constant source of energy to draw from and eating only one meal per day is going to cause it to go in and out of survival mode. gradually this will mean that your body's metabolism slows down. there are some bulimics who don't throw up and use laxatives. we restrict food until a binge happens, then exercise as much as possible or avoid eating altogether. most bulimics are average or above average weight, and part of that is because of a messed up metabolism. muscle burns more calories. of the times i've been healthy and tried to lose weight in a good way, building up muscles was the way to go. after i got stronger it seemed like the weight came off quicker and the inches came off fast. walking is good but your heart is going to need a little more than that to keep strong for the rest of your life. blame it on me, but know that i won't regret one iota.",867,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"late night munching hi elizzy, sorry for taking so long to reply. i'm recovering from bulimia as well (i always say recovering because it's easy to slip into relapse) and find myself in a pattern of eating too much at night as well. eating food at night usually leads to an uncomfortable sleep. if you eat salty foods before bed, you'll get thirsty at night. sugary foods will cause a sugar drop during sleep and will cause you to wake up in a panic. you've likely already noticed this. if you're anything like me, eating to calm down an emotion is like an automatic reflex, so when that panic or disturbed feeling sets in, i want to stuff it down with food. it can be a taste, a texture, or just the action or chewing... i want something else to focus on. you've likely already tried all the obvious solutions like keeping binge foods out of the home and eating a larger meal. one thing that's helped for me is to drink strong herbal teas. the sweet taste curbs my appetite a bit and it seems like a treat too. hang in there. blame it on me, but know that i won't regret one iota.",876,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"finding coping mechanisms i have been told by my gp that i have an addiction to food (mostly sugary foods) as well as a binge eating disorder. i was put on an anti depressant to help dampen the obsessive food thoughts which has helped a little bit. there didnt seem to be much open to me without spending money i do not have so i started researching the crud out of it. i googled and podcast searched my little heart out and found some really helpful stuff. i found that trying to completely cut it out sugar increased my want for it, but eating a lot of it also increased my want for it. i had to find a safe medium where my urges for sugar are more controllable. this is a very fine line, if i accidently go over i basically start again. i am not sure if this is food addiction, binge eating or both. but it is a start. i have all the knowledge for weightloss, but putting it into practice is proving extremely difficult. i keep making terrible food choices though. i gained 10kg last year...now 127.8kg which i think is about 280.8 pounds.",877,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
"finding coping mechanisms hey dgirl i understand how difficult it can be to have a food addiction. it feels really good to binge eat after sticking to a healthy diet. i have studied nutrition and sugar is the worst thing you can eat. eating foods with fat and carbs is actually very good for your body because they make us feel full when sugar makes us want more and more. sugars serve no dietary purpose for our body and gives us no energy unlike protein, fat and carbs. so my first tip of advice would to see if you can go a day without sugar. you can still eat whatever you like to eat to make yourself feel full. now see if you can go three days without sugar. if you can great and give yourself a pat on the back. then why not go three weeks without sugar? and eventually it will be easier to go three months (90 days) without sugar. if you relapse don't feel bad and go on a binge. you have conditioned your mind to resist impulses and have made mental progress. the magic number is 90 days and that's usually where your mind reconfigures itself. after that point your sugar eating is no longer a habit and you may choose to stop eating completely or eat in moderation. but at that point i doubt you'll ever want to eat sugar again because you know that it just harms you. you may have to eat sugar around friends and family but you'll be able to prevent yourself from going on binges. my second tip of advice is to create a realistic nutrition plan which you can implement using the method above. use an online body mass ratio (bmr) calculator like this one: http://exrx.net/calculators/calrequire.html i am assuming that you are a age 25 female with a body fat ratio of 30% (slightly overweight) who spends 23 hours resting and spends 1 hour everyday walking and running. your estimated number of calories you need a day is 2605. 2205 is the number of calories you need everyday to lose weight without exercise. you can eat more if you exercise and the heavier you exercise the more calories you will lose per day. it is intimidating to start exercising if you haven't done so in a while. if you feel too self conscious to go to a gym try going to a park and doing light jogging. if you feel too self conscious for this go during the evening or night time, given that your area is safe. i was a chubby kid and did this for 1 year until i got confident enough to exercise in the morning and eventually sign up for a gym. remember that you will always have time to exercise and use getting healthy as your motivation. the fastest way to lose weight is to build muscle. if you are overweight this body will consume your natural reserves to build muscle. if you are a woman others will not notice this muscle due to the lack of testosterone which makes muscles bulge. it will be only when you flex really hard that the muscle will be slightly visible. your body stores fat in your hips and butt making these areas stand out when you exercise. for a person high in fat, adopt a ""keto diet"" high in fat and protein and low in carbs. you can eat as much chicken, peanut butter, eggs, avacados and olive oil as you like. your body will go into ketosis and use up your body's fat reserves very quickly.",878,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"wow! i'm not the only one??? hello all, i am shocked, and relieved, that i'm not the only person in the world that is hooked on food. right now i'm seeing a psychologist, and she's helping me figure out the reasons why i eat so much. number one reason: i grew up with an alcoholic mother (also an undiagnosed bipolar), and i never ever knew what to expect from one day to the next. really the only thing ever constant in my life was food. food was my friend. it was available when my mother was smashing things against the wall or screaming at me in a rage. food made me feel better. the only time when i was ever ""slender"" was when i smoked, which i quit years ago. so i grew up relying on food to soothe emotions. when i'm happy, i eat. when i'm stressed, i eat. when i'm sad, i eat. my therapist is trying to help me with replacement behaviors for eating all the time. go for a walk. (really? when grabbing a cookie takes 5 seconds?....lol) yes it's an uphill battle. yes i like food, and good food too. anyone else battle this? btw.... today i had to go for my annual exam at the doctor's office. i stepped on the scale, and i got so pissed off that the nurse couldn't get my blood pressure reading correctly. then i bought a bathroom scale for the first time in 6 years.",902,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"i wanna stop. hi devaney, is it possible that you're feeding emotional hunger instead of physical hunger? it's really easy to get the two of those mixed up and equally hard to figure out what to do about it, which i'm sure you already know. focusing on what you're feeling and thinking when the urge to binge happens can help you figure out what is causing you to crave it so much. i still sometimes can't figure out where the trigger came from, but that moment of reflection will often stop the binge from happening. it takes a lot of practice but is worth it. you've learned to binge from two generations of family members before you so healthy eating is going to feel foreign and uncomfortable for a while. i went through something similar and there are methods of learning how to eat normally that do work. eating by rote is one of them, but that comes after catching the binge before it happens and figuring out the triggers. keeping your binge foods around will mean having to deal with constant temptation. sugar is my crutch as well, and i try to keep none of that around. if i do, it's a small amount. anything more than that is setting myself up for failing. for instance, i bought some halloween candy that was meant for trick or treaters, but i knew it was there and ate it. i'll have to buy more but will have to make sure i do that the day of halloween. anyhow, i hope this message helps a little. let us know how you're doing. blame it on me, but know that i won't regret one iota.",912,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"i wanna stop. hi there, i've battled food addiction for years while working as a substance abuse therapist. i have three things that have allowed me to take some control back. 1. if we let ourselves get to the point where we are so stressed that immediate relief is our top priority, then we will do whatever brings that relief in the fastest, most efficient way possible, and the reality is that food, especially sugar, brings it a lot faster than going for a walk. the key is to find ways to reduce stress before it gets to a crisis point. once we are in crisis, adrenaline robs our brain of the ability to maintain a healthy list of priorities and the need for relief overpowers every other consideration. 2. the brain is always trying to communicate things to us, dragging them up from unconsciousness to consciousness. because these messages are longstanding, the brain has lost the ability to communicate them in a direct way. this means that our unconscious communicates with our conscious brain in ways that can be confusing. we are left to infer from our feelings and behavior just what it is that our brain is trying to tell us. ask yourself, what is it that my brain is trying to tell me by triggering this urge to eat? what is the source of the stress? 3. don't waste time after you eat beating yourself up. you have not been in control. it was not a wilful decision. it was an automatic reflex. instead of berating yourself with an accusatory ""why would i do that to myself?"", insert the words ""i wonder"" in front and you now have an actual question to answer, posed out of curiosity instead of condemnation. what was the sequence of events and feelings that led up to the act? start to keep track of these sequences and see if any patterns emerge. your life is a goldmine of data. start using it to your advantage. anyway, i have applied these insights and have recently turned the corner not just on my eating, but on my overall health. i hope this is of benefit to you.",913,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

"addycted to macdonalds: screaming for mercy i will start by making an important observation: that i am regarded by mental health professionals as being ""hyper-vigilant"" - that means i am very alert and watchful all the time. the problem is i am addicted to macdonalds. it's not that the food is unhealthy in small amounts, but the quality of the sugar and the salt and the oil in their fishburgers and so forth, has permanently warped my mind. i think about it all of the time. i even have the discipline not to go there again, but i still think about it. it's because the pleasure of it is so intense. i thought about it, and i would rate macdonalds to be as pleasurable as anything but holy communion and desire itself. now holy communion, for those of you that don't know, is the highest point of the faith, there aint nothing that beats it - if anything beats it, it is because god lets it and he doesn't do that often. desire, you would know, is constant pleasure. so how does something become that pleasurable and not be illegal? the thing is, being hypervigilant, and realizing that macd was addictive, i actually started to take steps to see if i could ignore it. for example, i bought the burgers and walked away from the store, looking down at the ground and when i was at home, then... i ate them. only this did not erase the memory of the store from my mind. then i shrugged it off, and just ate them normally. then i let those two memories conflict... and you know what? my memory couldn't tell me there was a time when i was not at the store! that's when i knew i had a problem: the pleasure of ... had redefined my memory - i do not take that lightly. so i am left with two weapons: holy communion and desi and i have one enemy: macdonalds. somehow they have manufactured their food to be completely exciting, like obscenely exciting and no one thinks they are doing the wrong thing!!! i have started to rule out eating foods that even look like macdonalds! i'm not sure if you know a secret to the mind, that lets you override pleasure or something, but it would really help. undoubtedly, a lot of you would have had macd. if you see nothing wrong with it: ask yourself ""do i make my choices, or does my food make my choices?"" i am not even trying to be confrontational there. of course, i know its not the end of the world, and for those of you who don't have the self control to even stop anything, i have prayed for you. it may be that prayer is the only answer.",918,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

"food addict/binger diabetic thank you ladyswan, i know it is serious which is why i decided to find a message board. part of my problem is that i have not been able to find a doctor who will really listen to me. i move a lot and you'd think one of the docs i've been to would do something other than prescribe protontix for acid reflux but that's all they do. i hav'nt found a shrink with any suggestions either. i pay out of pocket for medical. can't find an insurance that will accept pre-existing conditions. because i have no insurance perhaps the doctors just don't take me seriously. i don't know. they can see that my blood sugar is high but just want to throw pills at me instead of help me with the problems that cause me to overeat in the first place. i am at the point of needing insulin but i am scared to use a needle. you'd think my fear of needles would override my other probs but it does'nt. i have recently moved again...am hoping this is the last time. i'm 48 and have moved 78 times in my life. i looked for a local doctor but nobody will take me due to the insurance issue so it's back to the clinic...the nearest clinic is 40 miles away and i don't drive so that should be amusing. it will be weeks before i can get in. i can find a shrink closer but it will also be awhile before i can get in. in the meantime, i thought i'd post here and maybe it will help me in some way. i did fairly well last night...for me. i had a bacon cheeseburger, sweet potato fries ( baked ) and asparagus and 3 sugar free ice cream bars. i actually stopped there. usually i would have eaten another full meal on top of it. unfortunately i seem to do better with low glycemic foods that are fatty...it gives satisfaction...but then i have spankingly high cholesterol too...ugh. about the only things it's safe for me to eat with all of my conditions are turkey and lettuce/spinach. that gets old very fast.",927,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"food addict/binger diabetic hey there, that's an awfully complicated situation to be in regarding insurance & trying to find help. the only thing i can suggest with that is to keep trying. does your state offer some kind of program for people with expensive medical conditions? nobody here will be able to offer you professional advice. the usual suggestions i'd give to someone with binge/fasting patterns doesn't apply to you because of the diabetes. it's possible anything i suggest could do more harm. if you're looking for generalized tips on how to stop binging though, you could always check out the binge eating disorder forum. i'm not sure what kind of help you've sought out aside from regular doctors, but here are a few suggestions that may or may not be feasible for you. i hope one of them is able to open a door to getting the treatment you need. -diabetes clinics & education centres -naturopathic doctors -licensed nutritionists/dieticians -college/universities (sometimes their students need patients) -call social services and see if there's something nearby you haven't thought of -support groups -websites for diabetics blame it on me, but know that i won't regret one iota.",928,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"in the grips of bulimia my name is juliette and i guess, in a nutshell, i am addicted to food. i have always been overly aware of food, from an early age. slowly, this obsession became worse and worse until i would already start thinking of when my next 'fix' would be, before i had even finished my current meal! my days are now ruled by food; if i'm not eating, i'm counting down the hours to be able to eat. i hate that my life has turned into something that revolves around food. i even have particular obsessive compulsions regarding my food... if it doesn't fall into the following criteria, i will excuse myself from whatever social situation i'm in and go and find the next fix. 1) i simply cannot bring myself to eat without some form of movie/show on in the background. i don't think i've eaten a meal without watching something for years and the thought of trying to wean myself off this habit scares me to death. 2) i need to have huge amounts of salad with my meals. i don't know why... it developed when i started trying to lose weight a few years ago and switched from sandwiches to salads. at first my salads would comprise of cold meats and some lettuce/spinach (say 200g). now, i currently eat 800g of salad (lettuce, cabbage, carrot) with every savoury meal, no matter what it is. i buy bags of salad by the boatload from my local grocery store, and am known as the 'salad girl'. i heard one guy behind the deli even placing bets with his friend one day as to how many bags i would buy . i know it's not the worst habit to have, but try eating 800g of salad out at a restaurant and looking normal. it literally takes up 4 huge bowls. so basically, i eat by myself, or with my partner (who still looks at me in shock when he sees how much salad i eat). these two things aren't very condusive to a normal social life, and many of my friends have fallen by the wayside (which is my fault, because i'm too 'scared' to eat out with them). is there anyone else out there that has stupid quirks like mine that go with their eating disorder? please tell me i'm not the only one... the lone 'salad girl' . i developed bulimic tendencies about 2-3 years ago. it never got out of control though... i made myself throw up (most times, rather unsuccessfully) maybe once every month. fast forward to today... i have 2 marathon purging sessions a day about 6 days a week. it has gotten to a point where i almost like it :s. my weight is slowly creeping up, as the amount of calories i am putting through my mouth is so huge, even the vomiting won't stop all the damage. and there is realy only one thing that i keep bingeing on... it used to be anything and everything (mostly junk), but over the last couple of months it has been one particular thing: yoplait le rice (vanilla flavour) puddings. i don't even know why! but i can't get enough of them!! i eat about 22 a day . i try to throw it all up, but i'm never sure it all comes out as rice is tricky . it has gotten to a point where i weigh my damn vomit to see if it matches what i just ate. then i will keep on eating, and then purging, and then weighing... and the cycle continues. i am at my wits end . the amount of times i have promised myself that this is 'the last time' and 'tomorrow is a new day - you can beat this!' are just ridiculous. i know now that there is no such thing as 'one last time'. i just want to stop thinking about food! i have written this after a day of 22 rice puddings (along with a few bowls of ice-cream and some normal meals such as lasagne (with the requisite 800g salad)). that is not a normal day of food. none of it is normal. i just wish i was normal . thank-you to whoever takes the time to read my sad little tale. i would love to hear about your experiences/weird obsessive quirks/recovery... anything! instead of making some grand plan of attack (complete with meal plans and times etc etc), i am simply going to take tomorrow very slowly. hour by hour... i can't think beyond that or the thought of no more damn rice puddings will drive me insane. i can't truly say, as i have never been addictedto cocaine or heroin, and don't want to undermine people who actually are addicted to these substances, but i feel as if i am truly in the throes of an awful addiction that is spiralling out of control. food is my drug!",931,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"in the grips of bulimia hi juliedee, sorry to hear you're having trouble with your food compulsions. for a while during my eating disorder all i would eat were bags of popcorn and veggie soup. they were my ""safe"" foods. do you feel as though the salad & rice puddings have somehow been marked as safe in your mind? people did notice the amount of popcorn & soup i was buying as well and it was embarassing. eventually my friends began to ask questions but my denial was so entrenched that i denied having a problem. at least you've already admitted that this is a problem. if you haven't done so already, i suggest you see a doctor about this. what you're describing sounds ritualistic beyond what most people with ed experience. you may have an anxiety disorder, such as ocd, that is manifesting itself in food rituals. binge/purge cycles are really hard on the body too, so you'll want to get the doctor to check and make sure there aren't any urgent issues which need attention. are you able to identify what is going through your mind if you aren't able to eat the rice pudding or salad? recovery is always possible, so keep trying every day even though you feel it is ridiculous. one step at a time. sometimes it seems like you're moving backward, but it's a process that does that before moving forward again. take care, keep writing. blame it on me, but know that i won't regret one iota.",932,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"in the grips of bulimia oh juliette, i so pleased you’ve written about it, and, i can definitely identify with your behaviours and “addiction”. you said you were overly aware of food from a young age. i too found that i took solace in food, eating to mute emotions that i wanted to hide and it was personal...not being confident in who i was; food was quiet, did not judge me and it seemed to comfort. have you had any help with your relationship with food... it’s obviously distressing as you know that it is controlling you and impinging on your quality of living...? i find myself, like you needing something to watch, or read when i’m eating. the more i think about not doing it; thinking of it as bad the scarier it is not to. i basically live on fruit and vegetables and the odd bit of gestural carbohydrate and protein in between b/p-ing, anyway...if i can’t get, or don’t have access to fruit i go a bit mentally unstable...the overwhelming need to ‘correct’ it or i cannot do anything else. conditioning, as it could be described. food must fill about 80% of my thoughts which really could be filled with better things, particularly as that 80% is a repeat of a repeat of a repeat of a repeat... it is frankly insane. living for merely brief moments of satisfaction with desperation and loneliness in between. is the mind that tries to control what you eat and how you eat ever sorry for taking you away from the party or concerned about how you are experiencing life or say kind things about you... does it give you the support that you’d give to a friend... or the respect? great that you’re going to approach your day hour by hour, remember this can be broken down further and you can restart your day whenever you want...the clock is only a guide for a bit of structure i suppose. i hope you can get some support, someone that can help you see the rational; your successes when you can’t, and help you keep yourself motivated when times feel sore. big reassuring hug.",933,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"its so quiet in here warning: this is a very long (and probably somewhat confusing post). i completely understand that most people won't take the time to read the novel i just typed up, and i don't blame them one bit lol but if you do i sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart. i'm surprised at the lack of activity in this particular forum. i got on the internet today to find a sort of support group when it comes to food addiction. this is the closest thing i could find, to my surprise. i just hope this forum is still active enough to provide what i'm looking for. i just recently discovered that i have a food addiction or binge eating or whatever you want to call it. it seems every site and specialist classifies it as something else. basically i think about food 100% of the time. when i'm eating i think about what i'm, going to eat next. i binge eat in private; i.e. i eat a lot more when there's no one around. i never really feel full and i'm never hungry. i just obsess over food all the time. i can sit for hours debating on what to eat. when i finally, impulsively, choose something to eat i often times don't feel satisfied with my choice and eat whatever the other option was after finishing what i chose. i am on a fast track to death really, in the past 7 months i've gained 50 pounds. i've been on every diet you can think of. i do well on some of them for a short period of time but then i talk myself into a short of break (i.e. i can eat what i want on my birthday because hey, it's my birthday!) then i never get back on my diet. i'm weary about visiting a psychologist because they all want to classify and analyze me the same as everyone else. i mean maybe there is some underlying reason for why i am obsessed with food, maybe there is some traumatic thing that happened to me in my childhood that causes me to find comfort in food, but i just don't feel that that's the case. i do have some resentment towards my parents for certain things involving food or my weight but i don't feel like i eat when i'm sad or depressed or whatever feeling you want to insert. i just eat because i love eating. but i feel absolutely terrible about myself after i do eat. until about 2 days ago i didn't know such a thing as a food addiction existed. when people hear the term eating disorder automatically what comes to mind is a super skinny girl that either doesn't eat at all or eats then purges. which obviously isn't me. funny enough what got me thinking about food addiction is watching the show intervention (people addicted to drugs/alcohol or with an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia) i started paying attention to the basic principals they were teaching the individuals on the show and started applying them to myself and much to my surprise, they all fit! i had the same sort of behaviors as these meth addicts and alcoholics! (you know what i mean). but i felt crazy bringing this up to anyone. trying to explain to someone that i needed the same sort of help as a heroin addict? yea right. so i tried bringing this up to my mom (i'm 20 years old so she's still a big part of my support circle), not that i'm addicted to food, but that i needed some kind of help; that there's something that's just not right. but it was the same song and dance ""you just need to have some self control"" she said. of course she didn't really know the extent of my binging seeing as i do most of it in private. so maybe, just maybe, she would help me if she knew. (or at least i try to convince myself of that for my own emotional well being). that being said, i do have spurts of depression. being a binge eater/food addict and not a bulimic makes me over weight, as you could have guessed. but i have been over weight me entire life. i think the last time i was at an average weight was when i was 5 yrs old. every picture and memory i have after that age is of this over weight girl sticking out like a sore thumb. i try to blame my parents, asking myself why they let this happen (i mean i'm not cooking myself huge portions of food when i'm 6 years old ya know). but it's not their fault, they weren't forcing me to eat the amount that i have been since i was able to voice how much food i want. anyways, back to my point, i have pretty low self esteem. i say pretty low because i am 100% confident in myself when it comes to brains and the like but i am so self conscious of my weight. i avoid people a lot these days because i'm afraid for people to see me, even my friends. which only makes things worse because if i was out with people i wouldn't be eating! it seems like everyday i feel lower and lower. i'm at my largest right now so i don't have many clothes that fit anymore. which makes me feel worse but i won't go shopping because that just results in me standing in the mall sobbing because nothing fits. i'm sorry if i'm getting off topic here i've just never talked about this before, it has all just been random thoughts inside my head. i just wish i knew why i'm obsessed with food. i don't want to be. it's like a switch in my head, as soon as the thought of eating enters my head i'm on a mission to get food as fast as i possibly can. then after i'm finished i feel absolutely terrible. i mean i can be on my way to eat lunch and i will tell myself ""you are only going to get this, you aren't going to get more than you need. you are not going to over eat anymore"" but then as soon as i get there its like a different person enters me and i have to eat as much food as i can. its almost like i'm trying to fill myself with things i wont have in front of people. i will eat before i go eat with friends or family because i know i can't eat that much in front of people. i feel so ashamed about it. there's so much more i feel like i could add to this but i know this post is insanely long as it is and all over the place so i'll leave it as it is and hope someone will a) be willing to take the time to read it [if you do i thank you dearly] and b) understand the jumbled mess i've typed up lol",953,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
"its so quiet in here firstly, brittcan, it's nice to meet you i am a fellow sufferer of bed and have an overwhelming food addiction. i know how you feel when you say that food is on your mind basically all the time. sometimes i can stand there for a good 10 minutes deciding what to eat, and have the other thing afterwards anyway, because i wasn't satisfied with my choice. i can spend hours in a food shop. being indecisive, telling my brain to say no. but it doesn't work. i read somewhere that food addiction is pretty much like another addiction like smoking. and it's a hard to kick! suffice to say - you are not alone and we can all fight this together. the fact that you have come on here, and searched for this means that you are one step closer it's good that you've typed up a lot of things whirling around in your head.. have you thought about seeing your gp maybe for a referral? hope you're doing ok x",954,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"hi, my name is sara, and i am a food addict. well, i am finally going to admit this to myself, and the world. i am a food addict. it all started as a child. i was not fat, but somehow, everyone starting acting as if i was. i started skating around the same time and perhaps, was a little chunkier than the other kids (10 lbs more) and people went crazy. suddenly i was on a diet. this of course, just made me look for any opportunity to eat more. but still i skated so much.. i wasn't that fat. i was about 20 lbs more than the other kids. at the same time i had a very self esteem trying thing, a backbrace. it is amazing i am not a serial killer given what i went though with that... but, still it made food.. the easiest and most normalizing things. when i was 18 i stopped skating, went to college, and got the brace off. i went wild. doing exactly what i wanted, and i would have kept doing that too but i realized i had streach marks. i put the breaks on and started dieting but i was never able to lose the weight all the way. thus began a 20 year up and down and obsession with food. dieting, not dieting, thin, not thin. finally recently i got down to the closest point yet... 48 lbs gone. until i just couldn't get down there, not to the point i wanted to be. and i boomeranged back up 40 lbs. the slide began long before this, but recently i lost both my parents and now... literally my life revolves around work and food. and there is some part of me that doesn't want to be denied anymore, denied anything, eating until i am sick, eating when i feel like what i feel like. - when i can't go to lunch on time at work i get insane. - i hired someone to run my errands because i didn't have the food i wanted in the house - i spend my weekend thinking of what else i can eat - every monday i start a diet and that lasts until 12 noon - i don't do any exercise i work the drug and alcoholics and now, i really am starting to see that i don't have control over my life... food does. food tells me when to get up, allows me to survive work, is on my mind 50% of the day. it is, my life. i haven't had a life in 20 years.. it has been on hold due to my battle with food. at least the first step is accepting you don't have control.. that is something i have never admitted until now.",960,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"could use some friendly advice hi all, this is my first time posting on this forum, but i am a little torn, and only fellow food addicts could understand or give me practical solutions to this problem. i have been a food addict since i was 14 when my mother committed suicide. i have had some really hard years including a few short (luckily) bouts with bulimia. for the last month i have actually been doing really well. i am feeling more mentally healthy than ever before, and since my mind has been so clear i have been able to eat healthier and stick to a workout routine. though i am moving slow in weight loss progress i am finally starting to feel like i have control again. enter my problem. my husband wants to go up to visit his family this holiday weekend (its about a 6 hour drive). we will already be visiting them next weekend for his sister's wedding, but since a whole bunch of family from alaska is in town he (and i) really want to see them as much as possible and go both weekends. because of this i have started to have severe anxiety. his family are big social eaters (and drinkers) and at this early stage in my recent mental health i don't feel mentally strong enough to attend a big event without bingeing and ruining all my progress. we are already committed to the wedding, but two events, two weeks in a row is giving me anxiety attacks. luckily my husband is the most wonderful man on the planet, and i told him how i was feeling and he totally understood and said it would be fine if we stayed home and went to the wedding only. now i am having major guilt because he was willing to give up something so important to him so i could continue with my healing ... which makes me want to go to see his family even more because he deserves so much to be with them. i have told him to go without me, but he doesn't want to. it's almost like i am an alcoholic and i've been sober for only a month, and all of a sudden something really important to my husband is taking place in a bar. do you guys have any suggestions? as for the moment we aren't going. i have came up with many ways that i could practically prepare myself so i don't run into any sticky situations (packing my own snacks and fruit for the trip, making sure to walk every day, excusing myself when drinking is present, etc.) however, i don't feel that i have any practical ways to prepare emotionally, which is why i am so scared. i know exactly how to eat healthy ... that has never been the problem ... my emotions and social pressures are the problem. what do you think? do i stay at home with my supportive husband ... or be the supportive one and go with him? if i go with him how do i make sure i don't ruin all my great progress and physically and emotionally binge? do i stay home and play it safe or go and test my willpower?",966,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"could use some friendly advice thanks for your reply! my husband's family is the typical southern ""eating"" family. they are big eaters and all functions are centered around food, which is part of the reason why i am so indecisive. for me, all food is a trigger, so it is a constant battle. i have found in the past that when everyone is eating i will let myself binge because i am disguised and it doesn't look out of place. i think about food all day, everyday, so it is an ongoing battle for me to moderate myself and eat healthy. fortunately, i have been doing so well lately, better than ever, which is why i am so nervous to possibly set myself up for failure and have to pick up the pieces all over again. i have trouble with support from my side of the family because it doesn't look like i have a food addiction, so when i try to talk to them about it they don't really take me seriously. i am not horribly overweight (only about 20 pounds or so) and i actually am pretty healthy, but my mind is sick. my mind has the disorder. i have used food as a drug since i was 14 ... but many people just don't believe me because i am not 90 pounds or 300 pounds. my husband is so wonderful and supportive, but as much as i would like not to admit it, this issue seriously affects our relationship. i would love for him to see me one day as a woman ""untormented"" by food. he thinks about me in every food decision he makes, which is so thoughtful, but i don't want him to have to. logically i know it's just food, he knows it's just food ... but even the thought of bringing a trigger food within 100 feet of me can make me panic that i might lose my progress. (when i refer to progress, i mean mentally) i am also going through therapist withdrawals because my husband and i just moved to a new state so i had to leave my amazing shrink behind. i am looking for a new one now, but i think this adds to the reason as to why i am so jumpy and nervous about going. i think the problem is that i have failed so many times. i usually had a short-lived success before each failure, but this time is different. i feel so good, and i am actually backing up my words and living life like i want to, and i have been reaping the rewards like i never have before. i know that at some point i will have to venture out and test the water to see if my resolve is as good as it feels, but i am nervous that it is too soon. i hope this wasn't too ""ranty"" and gives you enough extra info. as of right now we decided not to go to his family's for the 4th (although we will still be going up there next weekend for the wedding) so though the immediate threat is gone, we will still see them very soon. how do i emotionally prepare and keep my mind in a healthy state?",967,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"difference between bed and addiction? out of curiousity, i wanted to ask this question. what is the difference between food addiction and binge eating disorder? technically speaking both could be viewed to mean the same thing. or maybe the distinction is that one is a constant and emotion based and the other can come and go and is based on chemical triggers...? i find that i don't think about food all the time, i've slowly learnt not to 'obsess' over it. however, even if i eat a piece of lettuce out of place it could 'set me off' to enter a trance of eating, eating, eating and not being able to stop even when i can't physically move anymore because i'm so bloated. i know i have a direct addiction to sugar and white processed carbohydrates (think freshly baked white bread...) - so i've learned to accept that i just can't have these things ever again because with them my life is harder and actually does become 'tunnel visioned' on food. without these i can control myself a little better - instead bingeing on lettuce and vegetables - i find i eat when i'm stressed, bored, depressed, happy or as a coping mechanism when i'm severely distressed. so for me it's all - chemical and emotion based. ... would i then have both? o.o i dunno, i would like to hear some opinions on the difference between addition and bed. ...be patient... ...i must keep reminding myself of this... ~tool.",979,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"sub-types of npd. hey paul that's a really interesting viewpoint and i'm sure it must have some validity - human beings are so complex aren't they and of course everyone's defences and motivations are different. username feels there is also a genetic predisposition towards pd's and that must have some influence too? perhaps it is like an individual who has a problem with food:- they may become anorexic, bulimic, binge eat or go through a variety of all three positions during their life. they may even exercise manically. at the root of the problem though is the food? that being the case - what do you think is at the root of the cluster b disorders? any ideas? last edited by normal? on sat jul 31, 2010 7:29 pm, edited 1 time in total. this should have been a noble creatua goodly frame of glorious elements, had they been wisely mingled; as it is, it is an awful chaos—light and darkness, and mind and dust, and passions and pure thoughts, mix’d, and contending without end or order, all dormant or destructive.",1005,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"questions about family situations from nons hi all, i'm new here and still learning- please feel free to move this to the 'family page' if this is needed. just thought i might get some good info here. i believe my dad has got narcissistic tendencies, and undoubtedly other mental health disorders too. we walk on egg shells around him as any perceived slight could trigger his full wrath. this can be anything from being abusive, to his favourite punishment, “the silent treatment.” he can also be highly sarcastic and nasty, and if he know you have a sensitive spot will really go for it. the silent treatment really does not work on me anymore, as i moved out ten years ago and can really take him or leave him. i think that because he does not have any control over me he basically is on his better behaviour around me. this year, he was angry because early on christmas eve, my mum decided to go to the shops early, around 8am and believed he was still asleep. later, when they discussed this, dad went totally mental when mum said, “you were still asleep when i went to the shops.” this made dad very angry, because in fact, he was “dozing.” (not asleep, just ‘dozing.’) because of this, dad hasn’t spoken to mum for days. when the rest of our (oblivious) family arrived for christmas lunch, dad said hello but didn’t look up from his book. he didn’t sit at the table with us, instead reading at the couch. during christmas lunch, he interrupted us all to come and get a breadroll from the table, making a big performance about putting butter on it before taking it and returning to the couch to eat alone. the rest of the family was obviously very uncomfortable but didn’t know what to do. he hadn’t bought anyone gifts, but accepted many gifts off multiple family members without even saying thank you. this behaviour is all basically because my mother dared to use what he perceived to be the wrong term to describe the correct level of his wakefulness. i am not an expert in any mental disorders, and i am sure that he is eligible for many!! i don’t think he would meet all of the characteristics for narcissism, and please feel free to correct me if i’m wrong but i feel he meets some. i am quite sure he has depression, and probably ptsd. he is ex-military, and was in a horrific motor bike accident when i was very young. he has extensive health issues as a result. he has a gambling addiction too. while these things are not easy, i believe his personality theres really nothing anyone can do, as i don’t think he is open to any sort of support. my concern is more for my mum, as she is stuck with this crazy irrational tyrant. when he is not in his bizarre bad moods, he can actually be very pleasant and helpful. these bad moods strike suddenly, without warning and for no logical reason. he has lots of issues at work, and is always complaining about how stupid this or that co-worker is and what he has to deal with. my younger brother is properly psychologically messed up too, and obviously this sort of upbringing has had an impact. he is making really silly life choices and has zero interpersonal skills. it’s so sad, seeing this all play out and being reasonably helpless. thanks for reading, if you made it this far  if you have any input i’m happy to hear it!",1011,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"questions about family situations from nons hi im new on the forum & wondered if anyone can advise... we have a 17y/o daughter who for several years now we have noticed she doesn't show empathy or express concern or interest for others in the family. she is totally self focused and does not appear to consider how her wants / demands might affect others be it plans or inconvenience. ive noticed other make reference to walking on egg shells and this is now the saddening norm in our home. most conversations somehow turn onto how she 'needs' something or how we her parents have 'failed' to deliver on passing suggestions. what is also extremely concerning is how her recall of situations frequently differs hugely from what really happened -thankfully im not a single parent as if i was i would be questioning my sanity. she appears not to have the ability to reflect on situations and offer an apology which worries me and has done for some time as she truly believes she is always the one in the right. she refuses to do anything at all from walk the dog, washing up, clean her room or lies that she has done things which blatantly has not been done eg feeding the dog whilst we went away. occasionally she has thrown cushions or small items like pens when the blind anger strikes but today it has escalated to smashing a plate and saying at least it wasn't aimed at you! (we have never thrown anything in anger) there is no chance she would consider counselling (we offered this a number of years ago and as she doesn't have an issued its who we have made her? it was blankly refused) at the age of 17 what else can we do. any help or advice would be hugely appreciated as we are worried what will happen next - as far as we know in college shes progressing well but does seem to rotate around different groups of friends which we are wondering if this may be linked to similar self focused/importance behaviour. look forward to hearing from you",1014,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"definition, causes, symptoms & treatment definition an individual with narcissistic personality disorder exhibits extreme self-importance, inability to empathize with others and heightened sensitivity to criticism. self-involvement and lack of empathy characterize this personality disorder. people with narcissistic personality disorder are frequently perfectionists and need to be the center of attention, receiving affection and admiration, and controlling the situation. to get the attention he craves, he may try to create crises that return the focus to him. like patients with antisocial personality disorder, this person places entitlement issues at the fore. he feels that the world owes him, regardless of whether he makes a contribution. alcohol and other drugs (aod) can induce states that mimic a personality disorder, but if an aod-using person with a personality disorder abstains, only the symptoms of the personality disorder will still be evident. aod use may trigger or aggravate a personality disorder. the course and severity of personality disorders can also be made worse if other psychiatric problems, such as mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders are present. a patient with a personality disorder frequently uses aods to relieve her symptoms: to raise self-esteem, decrease feelings of guilt and amplify feelings of diminished individuality. narcissistic personality disorder often leads to use of drugs, particularly stimulants. as a disinhibitor, alcohol may help lower anxiety and alleviate depression. a shy person with narcissistic personality disorder may depend on marijuana to relieve her social anxiety, while others use steroids to boost confidence in physical perfection. without aods, a person with narcissistic personality disorder may believe that others are overly critical or do not adequately appreciate her good qualities. in a crisis, she may become severely depressed. symptoms overreacts to criticism, becoming angry or humiliated uses others to reach goals exaggerates own importance entertains unrealistic fantasies about achievements, power, beauty, intelligence or romance has unreasonable expectation of favorable treatment needs constant attention and positive reinforcement from others is easily jealous causes the exact cause is not known. although onset of the disorder is usually early adulthood, it is likely to be in response to childhood experiences. a psychological evaluation may be performed. treatment psychotherapy may be useful in getting the individual with narcissistic personality disorder to relate to others in a less maladaptive manner. the following guidelines may help therapists working with these patients, especially those who are also aod-dependant. engagement therapists can actually use the narcissistic features of their patients to engage and assess them. to avoid angering the patient, it's important to work with, rather than belittle, the narcissistic ego. a therapist should, for example, address a patient's heightened self-importance and desire for control by saying such things as ""because you are obviously such an intelligent and sensitive person, i'm sure that, working together, we can get you past your current difficulties."" narcissistic personality traits can also be used to provide motivation for therapy. the patient may be induced to change negative behaviors: a better appearance, improved career prospects, or romantic and sexual conquests can been viewed as a reward for recovery. therapists will need to address thinking errors—which may reflect inflated self-esteem (""i'm the star of the office"") or hypersensitivity (""my coworkers are trying to get me fired"")—that interfere with the patient's ability to work. while empathizing with the patient, the therapist should offer reality testing. if a patient complains that, ""things are really going wrong"" or ""everyone is against me,"" the therapist might sympathize, but tactfully point out the reality of the situation and how it could be improved by behavior changes the patient could make. crisis stabilization in a crisis situation, the therapist should assess the patient's defenses, and to put them to therapeutic use. for example, when a patient blames his wife for ""calling the police on me,"" the therapist can mention that the best way to avoid being arrested is to stop getting drunk and hitting her. patients with narcissistic personality disorder are often perfectionists. for them, the best way to approach their problems is from a ""no-fault"" disease perspective. this removes blame from the patient and allows her to perceive her illness as a biochemical disorder, reducing the sense of failure that can make treatment more difficult. a patient with narcissistic personality disorder tends to become depressed when his feelings are badly hurt, when his defenses have let him down and when he believes his world is collapsing. when wounded, he is at the greatest risk of acting out, either against himself or others. a patient experiencing a narcissistic rage may become homicidal, particularly if he has a need to seek revenge. because of the intensity of the narcissist's emotions, the counselor needs to deal very carefully with this anger and avoid a power struggle. patients believed to be suicidal should be asked to sign a safety contract. to stabilize the patient, a brief, goal-oriented hospitalization may be necessary. because hiv-positive patients with narcissistic personality disorder are likely to view themselves as expert lovers, therapists should establish contracts with them to practice safe sex. otherwise, the wide-ranging sexual encounters that often accompany the narcissistic ego, puts them at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases. longer-term care individual counseling ongoing therapy is needed to manage not only the self-aggrandizement, hypersensitivity, and need for control and attention found in narcissistic patients, but also their anger and depression. individual and group treatments for patients with antisocial personality disorder, including 12-step programs, are often helpful for patients with narcissistic personality disorder. in fact, therapists may want to approach an individual with narcissistic personality disorder as a hypersensitive version of an antisocial personality disorder patient. group therapy group therapy may be helpful for patients with narcissistic personality disorder, but the therapist should, tactfully but firmly, place limits on their speaking time so that they cannot control the discussion or focus all the attention on themselves. explaining that members of the group need to share the time, therapists may want to make a contract with patients with narcissistic personality disorder before each session to encourage pro-social behaviors. some of these behaviors include: limiting speaking time not interrupting other speakers respecting the feelings of others responding to other group members listening objectively to responses and feedback from others it is important to continue to use the patient's behavior traits rather than to attack the narcissistic ego. it's best to be empathic while confronting the narcissist: ""i can see that you are hurt to hear that not everyone in the group believes you."" continuum of care for patients with narcissistic personality disorder, the least restrictive treatment environment is preferable. it permits patients to feel that they are in control. these patients are normally moved quickly from inpatient to outpatient levels of care. if they do not like the treatment, they will stop participating. thus, it is critical not to over-pathologize the patient's disorder with constant criticism. however, acute hospitalization for psychiatric emergencies (such as homicidal or suicidal plans) may be necessary. narcissistic patients generally enjoy the attention they receive through involvement in outpatient treatment. long-term outpatient involvement is critical to maintain a narcissistic patient's pro-social behavior and sobriety. therapists who strive to build narcissistic patients' strengths and who pay close attention to them in therapy will find them active participants in the recovery process. in addition to their personality disorder and aod use disorder, some patients may engage in compulsive sexual or spending behaviors that should be addressed therapeutically.",1023,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"definition, causes, symptoms & treatment it's good to keep in mind that there are concepts like 'healthy narcissism' as introduced by freud, even a wikipedia article for it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/healthy_narcissism where it goes bad is when one is unable to conceive other's emotions, or when one is unable to see some of the benefits of acting in the interests of others or for a more stable society in regard to their own long-term benefits. i really think this is something easily overdiagnosed, it's obviously used often by laymen as a pejorative. in many cases, i believe people who accuse others of narcissism are also experiencing cognitive distortions. the stereotype of a narcissist is that they ""can't empathize"" or that they ""think they are omnipotent"". to me, descriptions like this imply that someone is engaging in exaggeration, describing (and perhaps thinking) in an all-or-nothing manner. it is more realistic that these people simply have elevated ideas of their potency, and have difficulty empathizing (or perhaps just apathy towards it, or they choose to disregard their empathic instincts for fear of misinterpreting them). people are so blinded with anger at people who think highly of themselves (so ingrained are we in cultural habits of humility that we absurdly believe the non-humble to be predominantly inferior beings) that i believe they think of them in black and white terms. in this way, treating so-called narcissists in a hostile manner, i ponder if perhaps the attempt to diagnose this condition is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. consider this: when someone perceives someone as narcissistic and treats them in an impolite or condescending manner or is angry with them. a narcissist reflects this behaviour back at them (as persecuted defensive people tend to do when attacked) and this response is then classed as 'symptoms'. thus confirming the diagnosis which may have been made prematurely, but is then cemented by the response to other's prejudice. when observing how people come to such judgements, the ""narcissist"" looks down upon their evaluatory skills and feels misjudged. he then thinks ""i would not misjudge myself like this"" and thus feels superior in that sense. many people are vulnerable to falling prey to cognitive distortions such as ""falsum in uno, falsum in omnibus"". in a more reserved sense of what a subconcious thought like that would represent, a person may think ""if this person misjudges here, why should i have confidence in their other advice?"" at that point, it seems unfair to diagnose resistance and hostile defensiveness to criticism as a symptom of illness when it may simply be a symptom of an unsatisfactory analysis. this is something i'm very concerned about when you consider that these episodes of 'narcissistic rage' are described as temporary. when it comes to temporary situational episodes, i think much attention should be paid to the situation and the history of interactions between all parties involved, lest we risk generalizing specific kinds of disputes as 'how they always react to any kind of x'",1028,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"can vulnerable narcissists be charismatic? it really depends on who is talking about this and what theory they are operating off. ellinor greenberg has a bunch of really good writing on quora about this. in the system she uses they believe that there are essentially 3 distinct types of a narcissist. a grandiose type, a vulnerable type (covert), and a malignant type. the grandiose type seeks to be the center of attention attempts to drown out other people so they are the only ones anyone sees and is generally more likely to address confrontations head on and in person. a vulnerable type is more likely to attach themselves to things or organizations to appear like great people, to get adulation by proxie of the causes they attach themselves to. think a lot of social justice warriors, church karen’s that think they can do no wrong because they are doing gods work, these people don’t actually care about the issues they just care about how it makes them look but they don’t know this because they don’t really understand why other people do these things. we are living in a phony superficial narcissistic echo chamber as a society. these types will usually avoid direct spotlight as they don’t have the grandiosity and believe they are defective and will be exposed as a fraud (as they usually are). this kind of a person usually attacks people indirectly, spreading rumors behind people’s backs atttempting to smear them and discredit them etc. i’m sure you know the type. then you have the malignant type i believe my grandfather was this type, they are always trying to destroy other peoples self esteem. casting doubt in their minds, nothing is ever good enough for them. you do them a favor and they try to belittle you. i remember my father buying him some brand new slippers for around the house my father was very particular about which ones he bought him but he said he hated them and he would probably fall and break his neck in them to take them back and bring him something he could wear. it was a game he played, it kept my father coming back to visit him and he kept criticizing him over anything he tried to do.",1032,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"do i have npd? i (34m) was married since 2014. no kids. i fell in love again in february 2022. i told my wife (38f) pretty early about the affair, understandably she was upset and angry. i could not stay in our co-owned flat because of the tension. i impulsively decided to leave our flat and my wife was alone. she moved to a different flat in august and i helped her move. i asked if i could stay for a few day at my girlfriend's (39f) flat. these days turned to weeks and weeks to months. i am a peaceful guy normally, but there were times when my girlfriend (now ex) had provoked me multiple times accusing me of things that are not true. i had this habit of bursting out and saying hurtful, condescending things to the other person when i feel cornered. i have done this to my brother, parents, to my wife even. my wife has forgiven me multiple times. and she has seen a nice side of me. me and my ex-gf had actually a few fights in the span of 7 months. additionally, there were times where due to my own insecurity i used to write stupid messages to her while at work. she was burdened by this. when she gets pissed at me, she has yelled at me, multiple times in front of her son and people too. so, my coping mechanism was whatsapp messages and hers was yelling and getting out of her system. she was a difficult person to be with, in the beginning i was patient, but it grew thin pretty fast. beginning august we moved into a bigger flat (it was her choice, i had almost no say in this decision), and there were tensions in the next weeks. but there were super nice moments too. she told me she's pregnant in 2nd week of august. since, i wish the best for my kid, i suggested things like private school etc. i know it's far fetched but i wanted to see if she respects my opinion or not. she disagreed. this was our biggest fight, i exploded said mean things and she was hurt. after a week, we mutually decided to end the relationship. i was a bit upset because the timing was not great since she was pregnant and instead of saving the relationship she chose to move to a smaller apartment with her son. a day later she was infected with coronavirus. she did not text me anymore. last week she sent me a mail that she was in the hospital and that she had a miscarriage and it's over. this was the 2nd miscarriage since we were together. first was in may. our relationship was very special. i never experienced things with anybody else the way i did with her. she has also told me that no one else has made her so happy like i did, which was the reason we both wanted kids. i feel she sees only the negative side of the coin and somehow refuses to see the sweet moments we both had. perhaps, we both needed more patience with one another. i still have not received closure because it seems like she has made up her mind. i am seeking therapy because my temper and impulsiveness costed me 2 relationships. i cannot sleep, i dream about my ex-gf and wake up at 2, 3 am. i regret my actions deeply, i wish i went to therapy more than a month ago. i still miss her a lot and regret my behavior towards her. i informed her about therapy, but she doesn't acknowledge it. and i feel this burden of guilt for running everything to the ground. right now i stay in our co-owned flat which has almost nothing. my wife allowed me to stay there, this flat was supposed to be sold by now, according to plan. i feel more terrible because i do not deserve my wife's generosity. is there any way in the future to revive this relationship?",1033,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"thought i was hpd... now realizing i'm a covert narcissist hi. so, as stated in the title. for years i thought myself to be histrionic because of my attention-seeking behavior. but i didn't realize until the last few weeks that i am in fact more likely a covert/vulnerable narcissist. i realize that my motivations and behaviors might be more in line with that. i've been in denial for years about the severity of my behaviors, desires, lies, half-truths, fantasies. but certain things lead me to believe that i'm npd. for example, two of the three times i was hospitalized for mental health reasons i was panicking and unsure of how to handle certain situations and i think more than anything i was looking for a way out. i've thrown people under the bus in an instant to save my skin or my reputation, including a sibling. i haven't been great to my family. actually, i've been quite mean. i used to have pets but i feel i did the bare minimum for them. like yes i fed them and everything and made sure they were alright but i never wanted to play with them giving them that connection they need. i feel i can be a bit neglectful. like wanting to be left alone and such. i notice more my emptiness and how i'm trying to be real but can't bring myself to be. i'd like to be someone who is capable of having normal relationships. i've lost friends. i've lost a lot actually. i read that this is god's punishment. i thought i had a moment of having a repentant and contrite heart but i'm not sure. today in private i threw a mini tantrum when something didn't go my way but i caught myself and tried to calm down. i took a nap and felt better after. but i'm not sure if i'm capable of being a legitimately good person and it hurts to feel that. i'll likely never be someone who is healthy and has healthy relationships. i'm questioning how much capacity for empathy i have and if i'll ever be able to be content with life. i got a good job but i'm already screwing it up and becoming lazy. self-sabotage i've always struggled with. i don't feel content. i don't know if i ever will. i feel i'm always playing or portraying myself as the victim and i know i crave that sympathy that comes with that. i don't know why. i want to be cared for. rescued. things like that. i have a lot of rage that was dormant for many years but has been coming out for the last few years. i don't like who i am. i hope god can forgive me as i try to change.",1052,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"looks and personal identity recently i’ve seen a few photographs of myself that totally devastated me. one was a driver’s license photo and the other a candid photo of me crossing a finishing line at a local race. both were absolutely awful. it seemed i was in the full throws of geezerhood. since then i’ve been able to convince myself, as usual, that it was the lighting, the angle, and the general circumstances in which these were taken, and that my much better---or less awful---looking mirror images were more true to life, by reading some articles and watching several youtube videos. i suppose i cherry-picked all these to console myself. at some point, i felt better, as i usually do, and went back to a more positive facial self-image. everything was fine. i was grossly over-blowing it. hey! i could pass for 30! i was uniquely, almost disturbingly, youthful! (of course in the back of my mind, i knew this was probably just another fluctuation, reality would smack me in the face once again, and i’d be due for another round of despair.) the larger issue is---and there are plenty of people who sneeringly ask this question---“why do i care so much about how i look?” am i more obsessed about this than most people? most men? people sneer at “vanity”, yet it doesn’t take much searching to find how many products there are on the market to improve personal appearance, not just to stave off the signs of aging, but for younger people too. attracting a mate is surely part of this, but i think it’s much deeper and more nuanced than that. i also think blaming it on advertising, media and society is ultimately a copout. oprah winfrey once had luther vandross on her show after his radical weight loss. she declared in amazement that he looked like “a completely different person”. no, not the same person who’d just lost a lot of weight, but again, “a completely different person”. after a large weight loss at about 30, my brother made the same comment to me. it’s hard to explain, but there’s something very significant about this perception. i think it’s called “the halo effect”. it’s not just how you’re “seen” by others, but how you’re “felt”, and in some inexplicable way, who you are . a youtuber by the name of danny mabley did a video on his weight loss journey. he went from looking middle-aged to a youthful 20-something, and yes, it was like he had become a “completely different person”. to me, even his voice and mannerisms seemed younger. reality, or illusion? where does outer beauty end and inner beauty begin? i don’t see any easy answer that question. it’s ageless. luther vandross on oprah https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vozoip3pmqe luther after weight loss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snxayujtduc&t=64s my 140 lb weight loss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxoqogphvo8&t=70s the halo effect https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oczz6hvfhbk okay. so, what? this is what: most of us want to be seen as the inner self, the inner person, that our body matches. there’s a certain enjoyment, sense of well-being in that experience. if you’ve got looks, you can shrug at this. but you neither know, nor probably care, what it feels like to people who don’t and never have. or to those who had them but are losing them. when i was young, i scoffed at all these hair transplants and face lifts, but as they say, “you don’t know what you got ‘til it’s gone”. maybe some people don’t feel this at all. maybe some feel it only a little. but i think a lot more of us feel it much more, despite the tendency of most people to deny it out of the social conditioning that it’s vain and shallow. they are satisfied with the unreflective platitude that “beauty is only skin deep.” i am not . will i ever accept my aging face and body? will i ever be able to re-invent myself? will i ever be able to accept my new niche in society, as i drift ever further towards its margins? will i let go of all my old youthful fantasies? i’m working on it. but it won’t be easy. i’d be a fool to think it will be. the inner life of the secret schizoid is incommunicable.",1057,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"doubts on being a ""covert"" narcissist i apologize in advance for possible grammar mistakes. today one of my therapists (a psychologist) suggested that i could be a ""covert"" narcissist, or at least that i could have some traits of that disorder. honestly it was the first time i heard of this word, ""covert"", although i knew the word ""narcissist"", so i was a bit confused and after the meeting i started searching online for clarification. long story short, the two important things for me ai'm very competitive intellectually by nature and i was bullied at high school. also, it's important to mention that in high school i was very bad in maths but, when we started calculus, i became interested in it and started studying it, also for social ""revenge"" and ""glorification"". that led to me starting a maths degree like three years ago, of which i completed with average results a little more than one year of study before entering therapy for what i suppose was depression (i studied too much alone, did not follow lectures and tried to avoid social life in general). after that, i changed like three or four degrees because of confusion and anger for what i felt was not right. now i recovered, and i'm back into maths in some way. despite that, i'm still focused on what happened in that strange period and in high school, which i consider an unforgettable failure in my life both academically and socially. although i have few ""real"" friends (3,4), i'm now active socially in a group of people without any problems. after this data, i ask about what should i do about these words of being a ""covert"" narcissist: should i, for example, ask for clarifications directly to my therapist or should i simply ""trust"" him/her, work about it at therapy with the chosen path and forgetting the curiosity of the possible ""level"" of the disturb ?",1061,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"marijuana for self-regulation understanding marijuana and using it properly is important. years ago i used to smoke a lot of pot, but all i knew was that i was smoking pot. when i picked up my medicinal card earlier this year, i started to learn about this magical healing herb. the two dominant strains are the sativa and indica strains. everything else is a hybrid variation of these two strains. sativa's are best used during the daytime. different strains will have different effects, but in general, sativa's offer a more energetic effect. indica's are best used at night. again, different strains will have different effects, but indica's generally tend to provide a sleepier effect. i tend to buy sativa's that are 25% or more sativa dominant and indica's that are 25% or more indica dominant. i don't generally play in the middle ground, with a few exceptions. the best methods for consumption are either as edibles, or via vaporization. joints, pipes, etc are all fine, but they include much higher health risks. if you are already a smoker you may not care, but if weed is all that you are smoking, use a vaporizer. i love my pax (by ploom). vaporization is immediate and will provide a peak effect for up to an hour (depending on the strain and quality of your bud) and a residual effect that could last up to two or possibly even three hours. edibles take anywhere from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours to kick in, but when they do it happens all at once. edibles can provide a peak effect for 4 to 6 hours or so, again depending on the quality of the material that the edibles were infused with. it ramps down from there, but it's not unheard of for edibles to continue having an effect that last 8 hours or more. you must be careful with edibles - sometimes it's tempting to eat one quarter of a pot brownie and say 'i'm still not feeling anything', so you eat the whole thing. you may not get the effect you were looking for if you overdo it like this - plus, you're just wasting your weed! i prefer not to use edibles anymore. i will not drive under the influence. taking an edible means that i am stuck for pretty much the entire day - or i need someone to cart my ass around from place to place. if there's an emergency i may not be able to drive... i just don't like the limitations it imposes. edibles are good if you're going to be somewhere all day anyway though. i also avoid edibles late at night - it often gives me a hangover of sorts the next morning. there are also concentrates and a whole host of additional forms of consumption available, but for the purposes of getting some relief from cannabis, the above approach has worked wonderfully for me. favorite sativa: a really nice durban poison! favorite indica: doesn't matter - i'm going to sleep links: https://www.leafly.com/ (database of strains and dispensaries).",1070,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"idolize or accept reality? ^ it was more a comment on akuma's idea that idealizing idealizes yourself. i saw a lot of people idealizing, but it does not imply a personal perfection, and sometimes quite the opposite. it can be that you are so below the person idealized, that your imperfection is almost swept away because its for the cause, or for some altruism. let's take a few examples. sick children, they are usually idealized. so sports players will visit sick children, in order to show they are caring people, but it does not imply they are perfect, but when they do something wrong, like send another player in the hospital, then they can justify their existence by saying the visit sick children, so they aren't all that bad. who else will visit them? or plenty of people idealize jesus, who they think is perfection, so they are nothing in comparison, but then again, others are also nothing. so then they go on abusing children and tell them that jesus would be nice and would not defend himself. the person will admit readily being a sinner, but somehow they think they should get a pass, because they worship the right person. toxic is all the bad stuff you impose on people and in this case, it is made worst, because it is not owned, it is blamed on the idol. so the person feels justified, because it is seemingly altruistic, and the victim cannot fight back either, because it would mean fighting the idol, and if they do, things just escalate because the idol is sacred and cannot be touched. so it is toxic, there is no resolution ever possible and it is bad for at least one of the parties, usually both. people still fall for it though, they never learn. the whole schtick is pretty obvious though, but people only see it when they don't believe in the idol, but don't question the need and usefulness to have some in the first place. they just want it to be the right one, the one that their feelings want, the one they emote about. that one they will fall for it, and become toxic and allow other like minded worshippers around that are also toxic. so then the will fight each others through the idol. and if it is a person that is idealized, then they will simply abuse the authority, because it is beyond reproach, up to a point of course. politics is the same. people idealize their party, which gives them cover for whatever bad stuff they want to do. it does not make them perfect, just a conduit for their emotions to be carried through the idol. same with ideas, ""values"". climate change for example. people will use it to tell people what to do, what to eat, what to wear, what to consume, where to work, etc. not because they are perfect themselves, most aren't and are oftentimes worst than the people they accuse, but it gives them cover for every little emotion they have and want to impose on others. if it is someone you know, their perfection may be used to do all kinds of things in the same way. you are just following orders. that is the defense the nazis had. or it could play out in other different ways, but the idealized person is seen as a sacred object. it cannot be changed, so others have to change and be forced to change in the name of the idol. parents can be seen like that of course. if they are idealized, children will fight through them. if one does not worship the parent, it becomes the black sheep of the family, not part of the play. it's a bit of a natural human behavior and most parents probably want it that way, because it gives them more power, but it changes when children grow up, or should. then they start worshipping something else, or worst, someone else. it's why their is adolescent crisis, the children learn the parents are not all knowing, and all wise, and in fact are quite lacking. it creates narcissistic rage, because the reality is confronting the delusion. so there you have the answer to your question. reality always win, and whatever quiet you think you may get from idealizing, not only it will be confronted by reality, but you will use it to abuse people and be abused in that same way.",1098,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"question about delusions and some personality disorders it's common in most of them, if not all. but it plays out differently. like the antisocial thinks he can get away with things, that life is a competition and there is no rule, so everything is permissible. that people can't hurt him, because he does not feel guilt and can endure pain. so strictly speaking, it's a type of delusion, or different belief. i think it is central to narcissism. it's basically the delusion that your image is your self, what you project is truly who you are, and that you can control that image. people are there to mirror you as an example, and therefore they become an extension of yourself which can be exploited since you are also in control of the image. so you could go on and on with all the others, i am sure they all have their specific delusion. strictly speaking the societies we live in are also delusions, they are make believe things that don't necessarily mesh with reality. so they are delusions in that sense, but since it is a ""normal"" delusion, it is not called that. it might be called the ""current thing"" or the politically correct. or the faith, sometimes the customs. you need that to have a society, because the bondings are in themselves illusory, it's just habits, which can change, so in order to have ""something"", you have to create an illusion that it is. the only question is whether you can realize when it starts to be true, or stops being useful. but in the sense of different belief than the normal, all personality disorders are delusional, pretty much by definition. it's a different belief of the self and social relationships. in and of itself it means nothing, it's more useful if you look in the detail of what difference? but it is not the type that makes it problematic, it's that it is strongly held and inflexible.",1099,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"how borderlines differ from me i'm constantly filled with rage. i feel no other emotions besides anger and it's so intense it's dangerous. i love the fact i am dangerous. i always feel like i'm above people unless there's something special or unique about the person i'm comparing myself with and undoubtedly it's in relation to how much physical power the person wields. my criminal record says i've been arrested for assault but i never feel any remorse when i get mad in the moment or afterwards. i mean damn, i lost my dog of nearly 15 years and all i can feel is searing rage if someone crosses me irl (don't have enough care to deal with online threats) i will destroy them in any way i can and if i'm unable to do so i'm the most irritated and angry you can get. i'm aware i have npd or a facet of that disorder because i don't care about being alone and when i rage it's because someone either laughed at me or did some other thing that makes me think they think they are above me and my main motivation is to show them where they belong which is below me",1108,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"should i be checked recently i read about pds, when i had an existential crisis or whatever, and felt related. this confused me even more and now i want to figure out if i should be worried about something or not. so, my story: i had severe schizoid behavior when i was a child. i almost didn’t talk to anyone, only with my closest relatives, i was a closed child, i practically didn’t express emotions and maybe didn’t feel them much. jie, as a child, i began to feel as if detached from people: i did not have a special need to talk with my peers, i was more attracted to adults, i wanted to find out and listen to what kind of conversations they had, what was happening to them; i did not understand why the children around expressed such strong emotions, it seemed to me that they were doing it for purpose, but i never could understand why; i wasn't empathetic back then, i didn’t understand why others immediately began to calm someone who was crying, i didn’t understand why they had such a strong desire to communicate with someone that they did it right during class, why did they go everywhere together. along with this, i was kinda neglected child. mli parents may not appear at home for days, sometimes even a month. and as i learned they did it even when i was a baby, i was looked after by the aunt with whom we lived. but it seems to me that at the age when i began to realize myself, i didn’t care about their adventures outside the home. more importantly, i never felt love, attention, care, praise and so on. but i wasn't abandoned at all. my parents actually cared and still care for me. they tried to make me happy. i always knew that they loved me. but this knowledge wasn't helpful at all. my mom has always been easily irritable and impulsive. at the same time, she is distrustful of the new and therefore the first reaction to my hobbies was very unpleasant. she often yelled at me. now this is my trigger. i often provoked my mother into emotions, i think that was the only way to get attention from her. by middle school i realized how much i am addicted to attention and praise when my teachers did this to me. by the age of 14-15, i realized that this was not enough and that being a gray mouse was not effective, and i began to change. i became quite a socially active person. at first glance, very open and emotional, empathic, confident. probably the perfect person. the changes went unnoticed and quickly. later this caused a lot of problems. i no longer understand who i am. there was a feeling of emptiness inside. i realized how shallow my emotions were. i realized what a strong emotion of boredom haunted me all this time. i realized how much i satisfy my desires, nothing can stop me on the way to them. it started ruining my life because i had no control over myself and i still have no. i became disgusted with myself. and with that, i had a hard feeling that my whole personality is one big lie, like i never had it. like all my thoughts, action, emotions were because of boredom. i did not know and still do not know who i am, what i want in long-term and what i really like or love. also i realized i feel nothing for people. i never was attached to someone. tho once i was addicted because of the attention a person gave me at the start of the relationship. much earlier, i realized that i feel nothing for my parents, they are like strangers to me, but close simply because they know what i really am.and this is the only factor by which i determine how close a person is to me. i need people only to satisfy my needs of attention and entertainment. i often say strange or inappropriate things, twisted their words just to put them in awkward situation. tho i do not only negative thing (but actually i don't think my behaviour is wrong). but i don't like negative attention to myself. this hurts me a lot. recently i realized when i behave inappropriate i always blame otherns. like they made me so and i have the right to those feelings, they hurt me, so i will act like an asshole. i tried to feel myself bad person, but i never can. i know that in the first place for me is me. i don't think i ever be able to care someone as much as for myself. as a child i felt myself i was better than others. much better. then i had some contradictory feeling -- i was best, but sometimes i had feeling of low self-esteem. now i have no problems with low self-esteem, and i feel more superior that others again. even tho i know i am a grand loser and feeling self disgust sometimes. i always feel like i'm a normal person with some problems, now i feel like i'm one big wrong. but i still love myself. that just drives me mad. i doesn't ever feel myself alone even tho i never had someone close to me even a little bit. and i don't think i will ever had. i don't have trust issues just because i don't care about others thoughts or words. even tho i have superficial emotions, i am really an irritable person, and that is not superficial. i always have strong irritation inside and i'm always ready to show it. it's really intensive. i hardly can restrain myself from bad actions. often i want physically hurt someone or something. and now even myself. i have no past or future influence for my actions or feelings, only now exist for me. i am very gambling and addictive to things that bring pleasure. and even more i am addicted for atteion and praise, i think i don't even need care or love. it is good to have only for not doing something yourself. i never felt guilty, regretful or remorse. but i felt ashamed. one or two times i guess. i don't remember any of these situations. but i know i felt that because someone knew something i don't want anyone to know. i think that was not really a shame, but some kind of sad. also, i have tested on the internet. that was a test for person's character accentuations. not sure if that exists in the english language. but there was the first time i heard about haltlose behaviour. so, there was such a diagnosis like haltlose pd in past. that's just me with only one amendment. it's not easy to influence me. i have had this #######5 problem from my early childhood. i'm about to be diagnosed with depression. it makes me feel hatred towards myself, but the i like myself again. but (almost) all this stuff i write above was with me from my earliest memories, so i believe it's now because of depression. i think vice versa i have depression because of this. yeah... a very large text came out that i did not plan. anyway thanks for reading and

"narcissistic injury 1polarbear wrote: right. i am just trying to destroy the trope that rage would be immediate outbursts of anger, like starting to throw out cutleries and kicking pet animals. it can stay there for years, most of the time unconsciously. it's because it has to do with your own self image and self esteem, so it just comes back here and there and can literally change your life. that's a narc injury. it will stay there until you can deal with it somehow. you can even say that ""traumas"" are narc injuries most of the time. big and small. perhaps someone at some point stole your lunch money, so now you hate lunches. so you deprive yourself of an activity, it is strong and out of control. a good example right now is trudeau. he is acting out a narc injury, which makes him take irresponsible and irrational decisions the whole world can see and denounce. so his narcissism is biting him in the arse. thanks for clarifying it, i did imagine rage in my head as a strong and loud outburst of anger. what you're describing sounds like supressed anger. not sure how much of that do i have in my subconsciousness and whether it's better to somehow release it or not disturb it at all. i've unlocked some supressed emotions during meditation and it felt overwhelming at times. perhaps in a form of exercise, therapy etc, under safe and controlled conditions. perhaps it's better to focus anger on lunch/activity/place than on a person? or not. didn't think this through. it becomes a problem when you always do it and it's your main way of functioning. but yes, it is not always bad, i would even say it is necessary to make decisions. but it's bad for relationships you want to keep long term. it also affects how you interact with people. if you take on the person, then it is over, there is nothing they can do about who they are. it's especially the case if it is not true, or barely true. let's take trudeau again, he sees one confederate flag, so he portrays a whole group as racists, so the conversation is over, they are discarded, so there is no way to get a conflict resolution, which only leaves violence as a recourse, which is what happened. if he had done like others had done, just denounce the flag, then it is a totally different ballpark. it's a more mature way to address things, and was less likely to create conflict. and yes, i know there are always ways to justify it and rationalize it, and it's part of a syndrome. a lot of trudeau in this paragraph, in a constructive way though, to convey psychological ideas. i don't know too much about his work, but i got cca 70% of it (without knowing the context and details). a different type of personality comes to my mind when i imagine a narcissist or a dictator (trump, or putin). trudeau('s public persona) seems milder than that, mostly decent, fair and agreeable. i also admit i know very little about trudeau's politics and not enough about politics in general. i am also never sure if the politicians act/speak freely (in public) or are tied to their political party. relating to next paragraph - so if i want to stop a non-dictator acting like one, i only need to call them a dictator? doesn't say what might happen if they are a dictator. right. i mean it is not always a narcissist injury or a lack of arguments, but often is. i gave one example where it clearly is, but when people would call trudeau a dictator, it isn't, because it's a good argument against him. but anyway, the point is that it tends to take the whole person, so it's a type of black and white, and the discussion is over at that point. like in that case, it can work if your goal for the person is to stop acting like a dictator. name calling then becomes justified, but some other things might not work, like saying he is the son of castro. but yes, i think we carry many such injuries, and in many ways, they create who we are. oftentimes, when someone can overcome one, they become a better person. so it's a good thing to be able to recognize them and address them, especially since after that, you then can avoid the same type in the future. it festers like a virus too. so if your mommy called you lazy, you might get a narc injury, which is not treated, will be there in your unconscious, and you might end up calling everybody you don't like lazy, or use it as some argument in the wrong places, or accuse everybody of it, say the whole world is lazy and you are the only one that's not. you might end up writing books about how to overcome laziness and do talks. now, it might all be good and perhaps even true, but it does not solve your problem that eats you inside. you might wake up at night in sweat, having dreamt of someone calling you lazy, or perhaps a whole crowd of people in a party, they all turn suddenly towards you and point in your direction, and say ""there is a lazy person here!"". if it ends in writing a book (etc) and doing talks, it sounds like a mature way of dealing with the injury imo. i think creative activity might solve half of the problem, therapy maybe all or most of it. i am not sure what people were using before psychology was invented to deal with trauma. i also remember reading something about psychoanalysis and the term wounded healer, it's what this story's ending reminded me of, healing yourself as you are healing others. maybe it's also difficult to perceive progress in such a scenario, perhaps it can only be measured from a time-distance, or in terms of constructive things done, or in improved relationships with people, even though the issue lingers on to eat us inside (meaning to say perhaps the progress is externalized somewhere in the world around us). i'm not sure if we can at least partially choose what will define us, there are probably numerous things people called us throughout life, both good and bad, why focus only on some of it. or perhaps it needs to come from a parent, or at an early age. if parents have such a strong influence on their children, they could also positively influence them. i wouldn't say this story above on laziness has a sad epilogue, there seem to be ups and downs, and some struggle, which builds personality. from what i know of subconscious mind, it's not easy to make sense of these things as they are happening, but it becomes more clear with time/experience. yes, that's a good point. there might be some other reasons, so then it could be displaced anger, or just using whatever to create a drama. but i was thinking once, i had this thing. someone asks if we read a person, so i said ""yes"". but then in the convo, i ended up having a small criticism of the thing said, and the other totally lost it. we did not know each other at all, so it can't be some other issue. but i've seen what you talk about as well. i still think it is a narc injury, it's just that it is not about that thing, but some other thing. i did talk about grudges, no?

are there even people out there who've never experienced them? not trying to relativize, but i'm also wondering if psychologically/mentally/emotionally healthy person actually exists or whether it's just an abstract ideal we should strive towards. even if they do exist, i don't think they're as common. i caught myself subconsciously replaying the situations that happened to me with other people (e.g. someone humiliates me, or is rude, and i do or at least attempt to do the same/similar to another unrelated person). i think it can be prevented by expecting a chain-reaction after any such negative incident in my life and by having some coping mechanisms ready to use (instead of creating further conflict). i tend to replay other people's positive effect on me as well, not as often though. not sure how much effect do people generally have on each other, and what does it all depend on.",1123,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

not trying to relativize, but i'm also wondering if psychologically/mentally/emotionally healthy person actually exists or whether it's just an abstract ideal we should strive towards. no, which is why i said you probably had hundreds of examples in your own life if you look broadly enough, depending of course on your age. possibly the most important ones, you don't even know consciously. you probably only know the ones you can deal with consciously, and the others might come in flashes here and there in your memory. you don't know they are significant, or just how much. by digging, you will find more, that is guaranteed, but you have to have a broad enough understanding and not just look at rambo style stuff. as for what is healthy, it's just that there isn't a real universal definition, it's a thing you know when you don't have it, just like national identity. you can tell rambo has some issues, or the queen, and this and that. you could avoid their trap and still have other issues, and some people might have their issues and still do fine overall. just the same, you can tell chinese food is not american, even if you don't know what an american is and what it eats. iznahs wrote: even if they do exist, i don't think they're as common. i caught myself subconsciously replaying the situations that happened to me with other people (e.g. someone humiliates me, or is rude, and i do or at least attempt to do the same/similar to another unrelated person). i think it can be prevented by expecting a chain-reaction after any such negative incident in my life and by having some coping mechanisms ready to use (instead of creating further conflict). i tend to replay other people's positive effect on me as well, not as often though. not sure how much effect do people generally have on each other, and what does it all depend on. it's best to deal with problems as they happen and in a restricted way to the problem itself. this way your sense of self is not affected, because it's just one issue, not an existential threat. since it's on the spot, there is no need to brood over it, or having it go into the unconscious and fester there, and being restrained allows the possibility of a resolution, so if it does not happen, you did what you could. anyway, it's a long subject, and plenty of people talk about it, but overall, the bad defense of the narcissism is to attack the whole person, or the whole history of the relationship, and not the act itself, so it forces separation, or else you get into a very toxic relationship.",1124,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

pleasant feeling (speaking from experience). what i'm trying to say is - i'm questioning whether narcisisstic injury should always have such a negative connotation, injuries are to be treated and healed i guess. you should. yes, it is better to focus on acts than the person if possible. but at least it should be the bad act itself. like for example a thief. it's the act of stealing that is the problem. calling the person a thief might be legit. but if you don't like the thief and then call them a racist, it then makes no sense. or in the case of snow white, she did nothing, she just happens

real life, also possible i guess, though i think it's reasonable to take at least 20% of the fault even if i've done nothing wrong (consciously). not saying other people should do the same. the queen should probably look into the underlying motivation of her needing to be the fairest. yes, he is the good narcissist, but even then he can't fool all people all of the time. it causes him trouble, and in this case, a kind of trouble akin to a natural disaster like floods of famine. in his mind, it is the same, for a lot of people, it is an incompetent that is over his head and is grandiose. it also

extreme. just like the queen, she has to get rid of snow white, her existence threatens her own because all of her existence is invested in her image of being the fairer. if she is not the fairer, she ceases to exist. i am not sure how to understand the term good narcissist, something like covert/vulnerable narcissist i assume. i don't know where the difference lies between being human and making mistakes, and then being either a covert or overt narcissist. if i try, i can find some narcissistic traits in almost everyone i enounter, which sucks because i started doubting the dsm criteria and the psychology in general. if we're all narcissistic, then nobody is. yes. well someone that is in good faith and has principle, if they make a mistake, will recognize it. if they are in bad faith, they will know they got discovered and will lash out and will call the cops. it's a narc injury for an undercover agent. his real goal was to bust you all along, so talking about it just alerted the man. not completely sure how to understand the term in good/bad faith, but i think i got the core of it, what you wrote makes sense when i apply it to various situations i've experienced in my life, taking the responsibility is not what always happens in any kind of relationship with a non-narcissist, but it never happens with a narcissist. it takes a mature personality to take responsibility. depends. i was just watching a documentary on hitler's henchmen. goebbels was a bit of the typical fragile narcissist. they portray him as having that narc injury, which happens to be a real one, his leg that was not good. so it is a constant humiliation for him, and he seeks to overcompensate and attach himself to a more grandiose figure from which he seeks constant attention, plus he sends his rage on others, in that case mostly the jews but also other cripples at first, which he wanted to exterminate. i don't think you could call it mature, but as the minister of propaganda, he was doing movies, doing talks and so on. he also burned books that disagreed with his own. i was watching/reading a lot of interviews by putin these days, not sure how to understand his need to get rid of the ""nazis"". projection perhaps. or a conscious propaganda. or being severly misinformed. the question is more whether psychology does anything. i know for catholicism, there is the sacrament of penance that does the trick, because basically you end up forgiving yourself, and are forgiven by the world at large. so it is designed for that. otherwise i am not sure. shamans had kind of animal quests, which also does some of that, especially when it is communal in structure. mostly it happens in family structure and grooming more generally. it reinforces the good identity and allow the bad to be evacuated through sadness. i had a phase in which shamanism seemed like the way to follow, and religion/spirituality/mysticism in general, not sure what to make of it these days but it still helps with all kinds of fears i think. forgiving oneself as a form of therapy makes (a partial) sense. yes, there is that archetype going around, and i am sure it exists. but more often than not, i think it is a kind of living their narcissism, like goebbels. i am watching the sci-fi serie farscape right now, and the personality of zhaan is the wounded healer. she does not write books or do speeches though, she attends people individually no matter who they are, and i think it is the main difference here. she deals with real people, while the goebbels type deals in ideology and archetypes. i am wondering if this might have something to do with being an intuitive vs. sensing type (mbti). well, i was, i don't know about the other guy. i suppose he was not. the point is that it could not be about me, because he didn't know me at all. sometimes it is less clear, but the idea that some people invest in some ideas and take it personally when it is attacked is a sound one. it's especially the case in personality cults. if you criticize the dear leader, you can expect a lot of resistance, and it has nothing to do with you or the person resisting. they simply have invested their self in the other. but it can be about ideas too, and many other things, that was what i was pointing to. i had situations where a person reminded me of someone i've known for a long(-er) time and so my attitude towards this person was (either positively or negatively) influenced by the person they remind me of, not sure if that can also be the part of the answer here. well, i would say it is an ego injury at that point. whether it is a narc injury has to do with the lack of defense mechanism against it, plus seeing it as an existential threat. then it starts looking at a narcissist injury, and it is even more the case if it is about envy, then you know for sure. so goebbels was jealous of people that had good legs for example, or the queen was about one person being fairer. so that's the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptwhgknh5yu that and some ptsd thrown in, but for the viewer, it looks more like rage. the cops outside and the whole society are the existential threat, so the war never ends. example of rambo confused me as the existential threat seems real. i understood the definition of narcissistic rage in this paragraph as a reaction to perceived existential threat. and maybe slightly off-topic, but can't help wondering why trudeau would be jealous of trump or xi jinping. as for what is healthy, it's just that there isn't a real universal definition, it's a thing you know when you don't have it, just like national identity. you can tell rambo has some issues, or the queen, and this and that. you could avoid their trap and still have other issues, and some people might have their issues and still do fine overall. just the same, you can tell chinese food is not american, even if you don't know what an american is and what it eats. i think we can tell rambo and the queen had some issues because they've pushed it to extreme.. it's best to deal with problems as they happen and in a restricted way to the problem itself. this way your sense of self is not affected, because it's just one issue, not an existential threat. sounds like a wise tactic, but not sure if it's possible to always separate the two. depends on the issue i

pleasant feeling (speaking from experience). what i'm trying to say is - i'm questioning whether narcisisstic injury should always have such a negative connotation, injuries are to be treated and healed i guess. sure, it's a good question to ask yourself. it's not something special, but for some people it can get out of hand. iznahs wrote: in fairy tales, it's very much possible the archetypes did nothing wrong. in real life, also possible i guess, though i think it's reasonable to take at least 20% of the fault even if i've done nothing wrong (consciously). not saying other people should do the same. the queen should probably look into the underlying motivation of her needing to be the fairest. people get jealous for no reason except envy. people are targeted because they did good, not wrong. there is nothing to change here, except in the jealous person. iznahs wrote: i am not sure how to understand the term good narcissist, something like covert/vulnerable narcissist i assume. i don't know where the difference lies between being human and making mistakes, and then being either a covert or overt narcissist. if i try, i can find some narcissistic traits in almost everyone i enounter, which sucks because i started doubting the dsm criteria and the psychology in general. if we're all narcissistic, then nobody is. it refers to a thread someone made not too long ago. i guess it just means someone that is not hurting others. as far as i can tell, two third of people are highly narcissistic, it shows in all the surveys i see. of course they would not have a personality disorder, which is a difference in strength and scope, not in kind. that's the real criteria, not the type which is just flavor and is not the real reason for the troubles. but sure, you can doubt, in reality it is all myths. iznahs wrote: not completely sure how to understand the term in good/bad faith, but i think i got the core of it, what you wrote makes sense when i apply it to various situations i've experienced in my life, taking the responsibility is not what always happens in any kind of relationship with a non-narcissist, but it never happens with a narcissist. it takes a mature personality to take responsibility. someone that is not of good faith lie about things they believe. of course to be responsible in anything outwardly, you need to be of good faith. telling the truth is the basis of real relationships, all the rest is garbage. iznahs wrote: i was watching/reading a lot of interviews by putin these days, not sure how to understand his need to get rid of the

if this might have something to do with being an intuitive vs. sensing type (mbti). maybe. there was one episode, she decided she was ascending and being one with the universe, and loving everybody. then someone came and asked for help, and she didn't because she was in that loving phase, so the friend said he did not need that type of loving people, or something like that. it was pretty funny.

"what is a discard? is this a description of one? the narcissist concept is based on exploitation and idealization. it's like you get a new toy, it is all shiny so lots of attention is given to it, but then the toy eventually fails the idealization, it has flaws, or is used up a bit, so it is thrown away for a new toy. so it is all white one day, and all black the other. the problem is that things rarely are non white, so the idealization phase is unrealistic, and the future discard is just a matter of time. you can see it at play quite easily if you followed trump's doings when he was president. he would get someone working with him, and he would be all great, if not the greatest, and could do no wrong. that's the honeymoon period. then the person would show some independence, not act like a total appendage of trump, so it would create rage, a discard, and a lot of accusations of this and that to justify the discard. what you talk about is pretty different. it's more like an overly rigid ethical stance, or just rigid. i don't think it is narcissism at all, because narcissists have poor boundaries, while this would be the opposite, having strict boundaries. i would say it is more obsessive-compulsive type of personality if it is pathological. but no, it is not a discard, just the same as not allowing strangers in your house are not discard. of if someone comes in and mess things up and you kick them out, it is not discard, because there is no ""ownership"" to start with, it's simple justice. to have discard, you need a slave/master relationship, where the master ""owns"" the slave to some degree, and then he discards when the slave stops working. the opposite happens too. a narcissist slave might rebel and discard the master if said master does not act according to the ideal, if the image is not the right one. slave and masters are interdependent, and have porous boundaries, and the justice between them is on a different level than what you describe.",1136,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

it's both, just like any personality disorder. the naming says it. personality has to do with a construction of the self, and the disorder part is social. the discard is mostly social, or at least it is the easier to spot, and what people usually talk about. but it can happen with objects, jobs and so on as well, thus why i gave the toy comparison. the process of idealization and devaluation can happen in everything. it can also happen in the self image as well, political stances, etc. but if someone does it, nobody will see it, so it does not really bother anybody. so while personality disorders may create internal problems to the person, nobody cares until it affects them. so in that sense, the diagnosis are mostly interpersonal. user1357911 wrote: having re-read through the part of the book i was looking at, it does say ""need for admiration"". but i read pretty quickly and i previously thought that was only npd with, is it hpd traits(?) it's usually connected with narcissism. hpd is more about wanting to be the center of attention. of course they can go together. user1357911 wrote: i expected the discard to be something to do with false/true self or with disorder of self? it does. idealization is basically the false self. the feature of narcissism, is to identify with the idealization, it's what makes it different than most people if pathological. most people will idealize, but they keep a kind of secret sense of self. they know they are really different than their social image. so they play roles in public, and another one in private. the narcissist is always the same role at a conscious level. what it leads to in the long run is a denying of the self, the true motives, the true desires, etc. everything gets subordinate to the image, or the false self. it's also why there is a need for admiration. since the self image is idealized, then others are expected to see the same thing, otherwise the relationship breaks down. one common example, are people that want to be called ""doctor"" or ""professor"". this is an idealized self and is also a social role. a normal person knows it is just a job, and the status is not the total self, so when they deal with other people, family, friends and so on, or outside their field of expertise, they know they are not that role anymore, that they are equal. but some people think that image, that role, is their whole self, they are invested entirely in it, and they want everybody to acknowledge it as such, and with the same reverence they have towards it. that attitude transposes everywhere and they stop being able to interact simply as human beings on an equal level, so in other words, they seek admiration in all things, even if it does not relate to that status. it's delusional grandiosity. user1357911 wrote: what is rigid, i mean there are only absolutes, if someone steals something from you they take it, or if they are rude to you they have neglected your personal agency. however i wonder if i missed the meaning. i don't think it's an overly rigid ethical stance, but it might be a rigid pattern of behaviour. it's just that to have functioning relationships, you have to be able to give some and forget some. you have to allow for mistakes, or to some divergence of opinions. someone overly rigid would not accept mistakes or would not accept differences of opinions. it also depends on how close the person is. so yes, in theory the ""stance"" might be fine, but the real issue is whether it is a deal breaker type of thing. if it causes relationship breakdowns more than the normal. someone might cheat on you, and obviously it is not rigid to say it is bad, but the question is what are you going to do about it? to you denounce it and move on? do you think it is a deal breaker and have to close down all relationship with the other? that is where there is no absolute, it really depends on the individuals involved. some parents will reject their children if they do bad things, don't live up to their expectations, so they put their principles above everything, but some, probably most, will accept everything in the end. they may not like it, but they will accept it. so someone too rigid, would be the first type, and then again, it would be on small things. small details, when someone is a little imperfect, or make a mistake. i do think it can happen in narcissism, but the overall thing is broader, it is not primarily that, because if you say it like this, you miss the role of the image, that is quite crucial. there are plenty of people that are too rigid, and they aren't narcissists at all. but when a narcissist would do it, it would be for other reasons. not for moral reasons, but because the self-image is threatened. they will try an pass it as moral though for sure. they won't say straight up it is not like me, so i reject it, they will find more general reasons, moral reasons, but the reality is different. in the myth of narcissus, n. meets echo, and everything goes well, as long as she repeats what he says. she has to mirror him, and essentially be him, and reflect well on him. it's the image, the false self. when echo shows herself as an individual, as ""different"", once the delusion is broken, it is when n. discards her. and it is a discard like throwing away something bad. he does not try to talk or interact or anything. it is a brutal and immediate rejection, just based on the fact she is not him. the myth is the basis of the narcissist construct. it's delusional because he thinks he is essentially talking to himself, so he ends up being condemned in doing just that, and admire himself in a pond. user1357911 wrote: isn't that again, codependancy or narcissism where external supply to an idea is needed to help maintain a false self (vulnerable narcissism,) rather than primary narcissism, where the meaning of ego as ""fragile"" takes on a completely different psychological explanation?

""it's just simple justice"". but it is a discard because in the action the person is literally discarded - not meaning to say it has anything to do with the cycle you explained using trump. well yes, it is discard strictly speaking, just not the narcissist type. what happens a lot in those relationships, is that the person gets discarded, but they don't really know why. it just comes suddenly, and they are left to try and figure it out. like ""did i do something wrong?"", or ""what could i have done to fix thing?"". one day the person is nice, and the other a stranger. if you do something wrong, and there are good boundaries, you know what was wrong, because there was communication. but if the communication is lacking, because you are supposed to be the same as the other and read their mind, then it is a lot harder to tell if not impossible. it could be anything, but really it is just being different. showing some independence. sometimes people will say it is like walking on eggshells. so just the fact you exist, there is the risk of some sort of an outburst, and eventual discard. of course you won't know, because there is no clear boundary. the discard is not even sure to happen. it might or might not. there is also a game where the narcissist tries to ""reconquer"", so sometimes there is a discard, but then the mere fact the person is now independent will trigger the opposite effect, because the need to control that person is too strong, or there is some jealousy that someone might get the goods. now, if someone was truly doing it based on some boundaries and rule, that type of behavior does not happen. the rules are known and the discard is final. just like being condemned for a crime. the laws are known, and the punishment is final. so if there is a discard, you would expect it to be final, or last quite awhile at least. not some push and pull type of thing, or being threatened for existing. 1polarbear wrote: interesting comment on boundaries, again i thought poor boundaries was a subtype issue? (interpersonality again) poor boundaries were most commonly associated with codependancy? although what you have to say about strong interpersonal boundaries is true. there is no codependancy.. well, it is my opinion, maybe others see things differently. you have to realize that in today's society, people see masters are free people. i just don't see it that way, and lots of thinkers in the past didn't either. it just got lost. so i am not surprised, that they would think this way. i just don't think it is accurate. you would have to give me some links to see by myself what those people are saying. i do think that usually, what people talk about the vulnerable type usually have poorer boundaries, than the other, but the other isn't healthy either. maybe they confuse boundaries with sense of self too. of course someone with a poor sense of self will show really poor boundaries in an obvious manner, but it does not mean the reverse is true. you can have a strong sense of self and still have poor boundaries if you don't respect other people's boundaries. it's like a sociopath, they have poor boundaries, but their sense of self is usually just fine. if you steal from someone, it is poor boundaries in my mind, it's the whole point of having boundaries. now they might have personal good ones, meaning they like to steal, but don't like being stolen. that's what i mean by porous boundaries. and that is what usually happens in the primary narcissist, the one of the dsm. they exploit, so it is poor boundaries pretty much by definition in my opinion. now there is some other type of poor that is more like none. can't remember the name, but it's like someone with no identity. identity diffusion i think. that is closer to borderline pd, and also the vulnerable type of narcissist (some of them). very often people confuse the two, because they overlap a fair bit. i say that from the people here trying to autodiagnose. and really it is hard to tell from the outside too. so maybe it is what they meant. you have to remember narcissism is a common thing in everybody, it's just not pathological in everybody. so it's not a monster thing that only happen to a few. it's more a degree of adaptability and pervasiveness, which is quite subjective. 1polarbear wrote: i'm trying to look at the individual psychological processes. i've also written the explanation a bit as if in psychological shorthand due to some of the reading/thinking i have done recently. i did not mean the person is a stickler for the law i mean the person's right becomes ""the law."" its not the rigidity its not even the reaction to the stance, its the psychological process which occurs at that point. i'm trying to piece apart the psychology. you'd have to provide links or something. i am not saying it is wrong, just maybe not going to the essence of the process. i agree it is possible that it happens. it is common in academia these days. people get a value, they identify with it, it becomes their god of sort, then they try and apply it everywhere without even trying to do it themselves, or actually doing the opposite without realizing, or thinking it is not the same because they are good, while the others are bad. it's a common narcissistic projection. you can look at melanie klein, she attributes every stereotypes to some narcissistic projection and black and white thinking. the good object, the self-image, has to be expulsed out of the self, and this is done by blaming others for it. so you idealize others into bad. it's not a discard though in the sense i understand it, because usually there is no real relationship to start with. maybe that is where the difference is. what i understand by discard is basically the person is in a relationship, then suddenly they aren't. it is the silent treatment. it's how it is usually used here, or was when there was people in the forum. it's about suddenly being treated like trash after a love bombing. and it's the idealization/devaluation cycle.",1138,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"what is a discard? is this a description of one? user1357911 wrote: i thought idealizations of things were stable in npd and fluctuated in bpd? there is splitting in both constructs. bpd is rapid cycling. so yes, npd is stable. discard is not something that happens all the time, while if you are dealing with bpd it will happen pretty fast. if the image is not threatened, there won't be any, so you can end up with a stable relationship. think about guru relationships, they can be stable as long as the devotee remains a devotee. but if they stop, then there is devaluation and usually destruction. might be some attempts to regain the devotee too. one striking example of how it works is scientology. there is done willingly as part of the doctrine. the narcissist discard has been institutionalized. most organized religions have the overall same idea. like if you leave islam, you are on a death sentence. in christianity it is ostracism. it creates scapegoats too, which keeps others in line. but scientology stands out for its viciousness. user1357911 wrote: yes true... relationships seem to be most common posts. but there is also a trend for that sort of culture so its hard to tell whether the number of interpretations through pd would be the same without? i am not saying it is the only one, but i assumed it's what you meant. like i said, i think the phenomenon also applies to everything ""other"". there was a time when everything had some sort of value. if you had clothing, it was loved in a special way, so you would fix it if it broke. now it is just easier to discard and create some new shiny toy, which does not last long usually. it's how consumerism creates a bunch of narcissist behaviors. same goes with relationships in general. why fix one when you can find another more exciting one through an app? if you add a devaluation of the object over the top, or a desire for destruction, then you have narcissist discard, imo. user1357911 wrote: i was thinking subtypes but for some reason i wrote traits, could also have a completely different name,e.g. gregarious or something? i tried to look but for some reason i could only find millon. i wonder why all this stuff isn't on the boards as lists of relevant theories? millon isn't exactly mainstream. it is as an introduction, but if you want psychological process, etiology and causality, he is not the go to guy, and it is what people look for the most. categorization, not so much. some people might auto-identify with subtypes here and there. i mean, the whole subtype thing is mostly a millon thing and it's like taking ingredients and mixing them up. it might make different recipes, but not necessarily good ones. they lack practical usefulness. it's a good intro to the idea of spectrum and that type of thing, or to learn how to differentiate. it's mostly diagnosis focused, and people here can't diagnose. i don't know about gregariousness, i think most people with npd are extroverted, at least the primary type. so they will tend to be people person for that reason, but it could be a limited one, like a ""safe group"" that actually feeds the image. pathological narcissism can't really take criticism or even differing opinion. user1357911 wrote: yes, so its where the individual idealizes a certain idea and cannot accept that that is not how they are behaving; the idea is their true self, presumably assuming in some way the ideal is grandiose? (somehow the idealized traits make the person better for some reason rather than just viewing the traits on a neutral level - false self because the ego cannot cohese with the idea of true self? i'll try and rephrase it differently. usually in people there is a true self and a false self. that's the theory behind. you could say it is the private vs the social, or the superego vs the id. in a normally constituted person, both cohere in some way, but stay distinct. so there is a give and take between them. so people might have a social life up to a point, and keep a private part for themselves. relationships will be graduated along that line as well, so people don't treat strangers the same they treat a friend. in terms of morality, people might find some compromise between following the perfect rules, and following their own desires. that's the normal, healthy way of creating an identity. so you are not all social, or all private, all moral, or all free. it's a mix, and people draw lines and boundaries between those things. the true self is the id, and the private. it's what you would be with total freedom, if you were omnipotent. the false self, are the self imposed limitations that people put on themselves and that are usually also enforced by society. now the narcissist does not deal well with those compromises. it's an all or nothing thinking. black and white thinking. either you are this, or you are it's opposite. it's binary. so what happens is that the narcissist, being social, invests entirely in it's social image or in some morality stance: ""values"". now, this is fairly common in all people. they take responsibility and they ""loose themselves"" in a false self. it's so common that it creates existential crisis in life, one commonly know as the midlife crisis, where someone reclaims their true self that was neglected, and it looks like a regression into childhood. lot's of people's unhappiness comes from this, and it is what mostly freud and his followers were trying to address. by looking at dreams, they would free the true self, the genuine desires that were repressed, and try to integrate it to the false self, and that would create a more complete individual, an ""integrated"" individual. so psychotherapy is about integration, to integrate those part of the self that are neglected but still there. in a narcissist personality, the false self is idealized so much so that the true self is denied, so there is an integration, but in the wrong manner because it denies reality. reality being here the true desires, the true longings, but also the true capacity, the true morality, character, habits, etc. so everything is invested in the appearance of such, and this is what i mean by idealization. it's a kind of delusion. and because that false self is considered ""good"" absolutely, the goal is to play the part the most perfectly possible but not from some internal drive, but by some external drive. so you end up with moralities of the sort: ""you can do whatever you want, as long as it is not known"". but of course on the outside, everything has to be perfect, like a potemkin village. the words and actions you do have to be perfect and no mistake allowed. but the reality behind is usually a mess and the opposite. plus, the narcissist will denounce his own real flaws, his own true self, that he projects and assume in others, thus the splitting. cheaters see cheats everywhere, and denounce it, which gives them some moral altitude. so the person ends up thinking they are gods of some sort, or at least it is the image they are selling. so normal people, they see that, and think the person is delusional and grandiose, which is true objectively. not only what they pretend to be is impossible to attain, but claiming or suggesting they have reached it even worst. so the person acts like a god, perfect, and commanding. it's essentially arrogance, delusional pride. it's what the dsm more or less defines, or what people call primary narcissism. there is a pretty good interpretation of it in the movie ""american psycho"" if you haven't seen it. as for what people call the vulnerable narcissist, fight club is pretty much a good take on it. both are quite similar, but there are subtle differences. like in fight club the guy is not grandiose himself, but he creates an imaginary friend that is, which turns out to be himself. but those are stereotypes, you can go down further and there are many other forms possible with the same basic personality structure. delusional thinking is all part of them at base though. the narcissistic image is self-referential, so it cuts the person away from reality and others, and from themselves. and pathologically, the person is not self-aware, that's where it gets pretty bad. the person gets cut from their life force so to speak, and if the image crumbles due to reality, it can create a downward spin that is hard to fix. and it's usually more a question of time than if. user1357911 wrote: if people without narcissism put on an act socially, that isn't really idealization is it? isn't that just an act? yes, but the process is the same, it's just a matter of degree. some people can act, and they know reality still, so it's fine. might be a problem in the long run, but it's not pathological. they also are free not to act, which is important. it creates some balance. if you can only be your act, then it's pathological. that's why people say it is a spectrum. there is no clear cut categorization that can say this is good, and this is bad. it's got mostly to do with how it interferes with every day life and what the prospects are. but yes, it is idealization. the problem with idols is not that they are idols, it's when they take too much place and blind from reality. you can see it in normal day and political ""thought"". people will think in terms of ""left"" and ""right"", or some other binaries. those are idealizations that have become idols, and depending on the part of the fence you are in, everything good you will attribute to your side, and everything bad to the other side. so that is splitting in action. it blinds from reality because those words are meaningless, just placeholders, and they resist strong attempt to define them, plus they shift all the time. so it's whatever people feel they are, their own emotions, good or bad. so it's the same here. a narcissist might have an idol of looking good, so it is what they will focus on, and want to be the best looking. or the more logical, or the more this or that. there are plenty of idols, but here, look is subjective and vain, logic can is meaningless and can be garbage is badly used, etc. every idealization has flaws, which is why usually black and white thinking inevitably leads to a loss of reality, and in the end, pure emotional drivel, but unassumed. like its the best because i wear it, or it's logic because i thought it, and of course, all the others are inferior since they don't agree with it. it's idealization plus black and white thinking that is the problem, not just idealization itself, because everybody does it. any word is an idealization. but one word can't explain all of reality or encapsulate all possible human experience. user1357911 wrote: isn't it the underlying idealization, importance placed on the idea of the traits and the underlying schema which lead to denial of the self, (actual actions, true motives, true desires etc.?) so somehow the false self (idealized image you explained) ends up in the lead because intent is in the lead and intent is driven by comprehension? i think so yes. although when it comes an idol, comprehension takes a second seat. i mean, comprehension of reality. it stops happening because you know everything already. you have those handful of values and idols, and you can explain everything and justify all your intents. it's even better when those idols are self-contradictory, then you truly are a god. nobody can refute you ever, and you can justify every action. government are starting to figure this thing out, and they also figured out people won't be able to tell. it's not even sure if they can, so perhaps they just lucked on the concept. user1357911 wrote: i don't know about the need for admiration although i comprehend what you're explaining. outside of the criteria, an individual could have a completely false self in relation to their own behaviour and go on to rationalize people's reactions instead of needing others to see the same thing to support that ego perspective. (the support to the schema could be internal, denial, rationalization, etc.) yes. well the admiration is a byproduct, and it's mostly seen from the outside, but often there is an internal need for it as well. really i think it is at base a desire for validation. but if you follow something that is good absolutely, and try to appear to follow it as well, then it is logical that you would want admiration, or expect people to realize your greatness. i mean the admiration is in the narcissist first, so he will not see why anybody else would think different, and his image is perfect, he embodies that image perfectly. so if others don't admire him, then it means they simply are jealous and failures, and since nobody's perfect, it is easy to see the flaw in others, which distract from self-awareness. when you are busy finding flaws in others, you don't attend to your own. that's what i mean by being totally invested in the false self. like any personality disorder, it is self-reinforcing behavior, and there is no obvious way out. if the idol is good, and if you are the biggest believer, then there is no other way out. you have to keep promoting and ignoring flaws. why wouldn't you? everything else is inferior. user1357911 wrote: having said it sounds like you explained the false self or image as being a driving factor and not a rationalization, perhaps that is the difference between the two concepts? (not sure at the moment.) yes, it's the carrot that drives everything in terms of causality. i follow the old philosophical posture that people are driven by good things, not spending their whole life avoiding bad things. but yes, some people consider narcissism as defense mechanism. i think it's a bit too easy and does not explain anything. here, i am even going to go further, i will say it is a narcissistic theory. because how easy it is to accuse everybody of being ""defensive""? i could easily say to everything you say that i disagree with that you are being defensive, and if you defend yourself that you are being defensive, then you just proved my point in proving you are defensive. so there is no way out of that mind sexual intercourse. you are always right, and others are always inferior, and they have to agree with everything you say. and behind it of course, would be some idol, like being transparent, or genuine, or authentic, and so on. i am a free person, i don't ever defend myself, and i have no boundary, i am a person of the world, i am everything, i am one with the world in some symbiotic state and things that are different, are having defense mechanism, which is bad and needs to be condemned. you could have the same pattern with ""rationalization"". people that give reasons are defensive, and are hiding their true motives. they are unconscious of their true selves, while the perfect self is totally free and authentic, with no need for reason or morality. again, there is no need for boundaries which is what rationalization does, it creates division, and everybody that would rationalize them is different and therefore inferior to the true instinctual being that is one with the world and in harmony. all reason must be condemned because they fall short of the ideal. and of course, i am totally free of that flaw, i am a story in the making, totally in the flow, etc. those two scripts are all based on one ideal, basically the idea of being open and authentic. it's the idol, and it is used to deflect any attempt to correct it, and you could quite easily spend your own life believing this, because who would say otherwise? if they did, they would show they aren't part of the ideal, and therefore not worth considering. they have to be shown the errors of their ways at best, or discarded. they are two examples of what i would consider a narcissist personality. they have that one ideal that explains everything and can't be countered except through common sense of a sort, but logic by itself won't cut it. you can see how easy that carrot can drive everything. complete self-justification, perfect image worthy of admiration, etc. you can do whatever you want, and destroy anybody you want, so what's not to like? user1357911 wrote: because the individual genuinely believes ""dr"" has worth attached to it and therefore makes the person better or genuinely superior. therefore for example if there were cases of the opposite, if the person was not a doctor, they might try to rationalize that they could have been, or even go as far as to pretend to be one.? the two things seem different, that was what i wondered about the need for admiration. however isn't dr just a job if you are healthy? - and even someone who finds it superior would still not put on an act about their role as a doctor? let's see, a normal doctor are yes, doctors in the day, and sure enough, they get deference, which is quite normal because they care about people, or at least they should. people that are sick and go a doctor, they are genuinely grateful if they get well and cared for. but that's a gift of sort, it is not ""due"" to being a doctor, it's just a normal thing that happens. but for some people, it comes with the title, so you have to be grateful because the person is a doctor, because they lower themselves to even consider you. so here's the difference. the good one, his goal is to cure and care for people. they don't do it for the status or to get something back. they are usually the ones that are the good ones, that will actually cure you. the bad ones, they are simply doing their job as a doctor, because it's who they are. they might cure you, or not, but they expect gratefulness, because they see the good doctors are revered, so they want that too, and since both are doctors, there is of course no reason why the other one would get love and not you. in fact, you should get more, because you are a better doctor, since you are the pure ideal of a doctor, with the white coat and all, good salary and so on. you spent all your life, and made lots of sacrifice to be there, so you are owned the same reverence. and then of course you have the grifters that call themselves doctors but aren't. like a doctor in psychology that want to be treated like a medicine doctor. the word is the same, the merit is the same, so you want the same. of course it does not work that way. it's a kind of delusion of grandeur. user1357911 wrote: i think the idea i wrote: yes exactly; if the person is deluded into thinking they are moral when they are anything but, through all sorts of denial, rationalization and reversed calculations (information which literally disappears when it hits a conflicting schema) they may apply the same standard to others, so the idealized self is the operating schema or linked to the operating schema at least. - unless the moral self is a true self, (the person would be lucid enough to want to be that way but also not want to.) apologies, this part is going off on a tangent and is unclear. right, it could happen that way. the moral self is always part true, part false, it's a compromise. i mean, by it's essence, it is social. a man alone is never going to do things he does not want to do, out of some social consideration of good and evil. as soon as you start acting morally, there is some falsehood that creeps in. there is always the ideal, and the truth. most people keep both fairly close together, but not always, due either to circumstances, feebleness in resolve, or just that sometimes you have to make hard choices between two bads. well, i don't know if it is most people, but let's say healthy people. it's when you start thinking you are completely good that it gets deluded, and you become basically the false self, irrelevant of what you actually do. almost inevitably it is justified by saying you have good intentions. so the deluded person always has good intentions, because they are a good person with good ideals, then whatever bad happens, you can't be blamed for it, nor the ideal itself. it's the joker card everybody uses. yes, i may have bombed hiroshima, but i had good intentions, not like those other people that bombed pearl harbor. user1357911 wrote: cult leaders as an example?

""consent"" right? so you see the desire for control, but it's all based around his personality. he did not like psychiatry for obvious reasons, so everybody have to not like it. it is the enemy of the religion and he tries to replace it with his own stuff. so then, all drugs are bad, and so on. it goes from there, but it's all based on one person's desires, himself. and it's based on a few ideals he has, the marine, being ""clear"", and a few others. of course, he never was an admiral, was never clear and so on, but he presents himself that way, and people have to pretend, that not only he is an admiral, but the best of them, obviously. he is also the best writer, the best psychologist, savior of souls, etc. whatever he pretends to be is the best, and everybody has to pretend it is true if you want to stay around. if not, you get discarded, harassed, destroyed financially, professionally, etc. called a deviant. basically the guy was a tyrant. hitler i think was more of a perfectionist that wanted unity, he was not into building a personality cult. i haven't studied him much though, but it's the impression i get. stalin was a narcissist big time. he basically became the revolution, so whatever he did was the revolution. user1357911 wrote: so the idea i was thinking of sounds more like a trait similar to the obsessive compulsive plastered onto the top or interwoven with a disorder of ego/self with a different issue underneath, hence why the discard example does not look like npd perhaps, despite being a discard. it's what i think, or it's a possibility. it's more a question of what you can rule out or not. it can be many things, including narcissism. it could be normal too. i just did not see anything specifically based on narcissism in it. user1357911 wrote: that part of the definition slipped my mind. then if you would regard someone stealing or cheating on a partner as having poor boundaries, but this is presumably a different sort of boundary i.e. could be ""you are my property/an object/an extension of me"" in agency rather than codependency as i imagined it in an idealization and discard.? when i talked about boundaries before, i was thinking about things which were strictly codependency, stealing would mean a boundary is being breached but would not imply codependency? well, if you think someone is your property, it is poor boundaries, unless you are in a place where slavery is legal, and that person is actually your slave because you bought them, and you have papers to prove it. otherwise it is simply delusional. right, stealing is poor boundaries that don't imply codependency or a relationship, at least not in the common sense of the terms, but if you think about it longer, the thief is in a relationship with others. he does need other people to steal, so he is also dependent on people allowing him to steal, or on people not being good enough to stop him. so in order to be a thief, he needs a whole system that allows it. he needs property, and property laws, and a whole bunch of things. he isn't independent, he is playing in a bigger game with set rules he can cheat on. and those rules are the boundaries, so he has poor boundaries and is in a relationship with society in general and the people he steals, and he needs them to be as they are. keeping in the psychiatry realm, the antisocial construct has the notion of parasitic lifestyle. a parasite, in biology is an animal that needs others to survive, and it does not give anything of value in exchange. so it is dependent, and has poor boundaries, because it cannot give back, it is not independent and therefore cannot be just. now, narcissism is not antisocial so it is not parasitic, but exploitative. so it gives back a minimum, but takes more than it gave. just like hubbard, he takes your whole soul for a billion years, and give you some self-improvement courses. user1357911 wrote: yes i noticed the similarities to borderline pd in the quote above as well. i was pretty sure its possible to not have narcissism, to simply have an idea of theory of mind, other, and a knowledge of self? is it really normal as such rather than more common that it ought to seem to be? some people think it is part of normal development of the child, as language develop and experience is gained. it seems that way to me. younger people don't know much, don't have too many tools, so if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, and getting idols is quite normal. most people grow out of that phase, while some don't. what's not normal is not to grow out of it, to cling to omnipotent ideation or black and white thinking. there was a quote by churchill. ""if you are young and not a progressive, you have no heart, and if you are old and not a conservative, you have no brain."" it's because as you grow older, you acquire more tools, and more experience, so you can relate to others more readily, get a better theory of mind, and realized everybody before you were not such idiots after all, they simply knew things you didn't, or dealt with life situations you never had to deal with. so that's how people grow out of narcissism, by becoming independent, having to take decisions, taking responsibility, etc. user1357911 wrote: i am not surprised at people trying to autodiagnose though, psychiatry and psychology is very expensive and people here in the uk don't generally get a looking when it comes to psychology (or at least from what i've seen.) - and pd presumably requires a lot of psychology to diagnose. it seems the doctors go straight for axis 1 diagnoses unless its eupd at the moment. not necessarily, the tests are designed to be done in a session by a qualified psychiatrist. the reason people autodiagnose is mostly to find an identity, they aren't really interested in the pathological part, and since most of those personalities are vague and common, everybody can see whatever they want. so it either gives identity, justification or both. or it can be used, which is even more common, in justifying rejection or failure in relationships. so people diagnose their partners. user1357911 wrote: i've been reading personality, personality disorder and violence. (mary mcmurran, richard howard.) its not an online link its printed only as far as i know. some of it has sunk in and some of it has so far gone in one ear and out of the other. the example i gave is not from the book. ok, i see, it is in the context of violence. like how to explain violence out of personality disorders because there are some correlations. i usually resist that type of approach, especially since the biggest correlation is with antisocial personality, and it's a chicken and egg problem. people get diagnosed because they are violent, then turn around and say that they are violent because of the personality. and in that context, narcissism is mostly seen through the psychopath, so it's an added feature that may help predict future behavior. but in that case, it is fairly simple. the ideation is actually about violence, so the person sees herself as violent. it becomes the false self and the personality, anything else being weak. it's also self-reinforcing, because any act of violence will show the strength and independence of the person at least in the ideal self. doing violence therefore proves the others are weaker and that you are in control, which in turn justifies the violence, because it is what weak people are for, being victim. not only that but in some case, it can be seen as altruistic, as in being tough forces the victim into responding and making them less of a victim. it makes the victim into the image of the psychopath, or it is discarded and dies out. it's about culling the weak to keep the strong. the weak will of course be blamed for being weak, thus blaming the victim. there can often be some other factors and ideations, but that's a common one. i already talked about being an avenger. superheroes are pretty much psychopaths if you look at it objectively. but in this case, the weak is defended, or at least it is the justification. so there is some wrong going on, and someone needs to be saved, whether they like it or not, and it gives full justification to stop the evil and destroy it, beat them to a pulp with bare hands ideally, all that outside the confines of the law. sometimes it is some other thing, based on some moral value, like pretty much all activism does. animal rights activism especially, is full of very violent people who think it is fine to do violence on humans, because animals are the ideal here to be preserved. the nice little innocent animals. of course it proves good intentions, and justifies violence. now you could say it is after the fact justification. perhaps, or perhaps they truly believe this too. it sure fools a lot of people. user1357911 wrote: that sounds like some sort of syndrome in itself... sometimes you'd just wonder if they're not thinking when they act? expulsing something from the self, isn't that likely to be something particular that's been taken and applied from a disorder description? - but obviously not everyone would have that disorder. well, just take the animal activists. they reject being carnivorous animals, because it exploits animals, give them possibly pain, is bad for the environment and so on. so instead of accepting you have eaten meat, have participated in exploiting animals, are able to give pain and are dirty, then you find a cause, and you project those things on others, which gives you the justification to do the same thing they do. it's just easier to do violence on animal killers than on some innocent people. i don't know if it is a syndrome, but for some people it passes as morality. if you can convince yourself some people are bad, reciprocity will justify them in doing bad things to them. so you paint black and then attack what you just painted, because you are white. there was some experiment, they took a bunch of people, divided them in two, and gave each group a flag of a different color. it did not take long they were attacking each others. they were sworn enemies. user1357911 wrote: yes i've seen it used that way in relationship discussion, but when i saw the psychological mechanism it made more sense that way when i read it. i found it makes a massive difference trying to piece apart the colloquial from what the psychologist is meant to know sometimes helps understand pd properly. (psychological and psychiatric jargon uses words in completely different ways, so the descriptions written on the pages of clinical manuals are not meant to be read literally in plain english without psychiatric/psychological training. it makes them tricky to read without piecing apart what is actually meant. sure. i don't know if i ever saw narcissistic discard in an actual psychology text. just doing a google search though, it seems like something used exclusively in victim groups. devaluation is more typical. user1357911 wrote: yes its awfully quiet in here. i don't know if that is a bad thing though if perhaps no one needs the place? what the hell is a love bombing - there is probably a definition link somewhere. it's said of people acting in the beginning of a relationship. they idealize the other, and send a lot of love, and the other can do no wrong. so love bombing. some people with poor boundaries will do that. they are all in for awhile, then it stops and the devaluation comes, and it adds up, until everything you do is wrong and your existence itself is an irritant. so love bombing is the all white phase which usually attract people to the narcissist, or psychopath, or whatever. they can do that because they don't care about the real person, the other is an idea. so they will tell you who you are, in flattering term, with lots of intensity. it's what happens in self-help guru things, and cults. they all love bomb you, tell you how great you are. of course it's not true, they don't know you, but it works.",1139,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"what is a discard? is this a description of one? 1polarbear wrote: there is splitting in both constructs. bpd is rapid cycling. so yes, npd is stable. discard is not something that happens all the time, while if you are dealing with bpd it will happen pretty fast. if the image is not threatened, there won't be any, so you can end up with a stable relationship. i wonder if presumably most persons with personality disorder won't recognize splitting and for some reason it would be self-reported by persons with other personality disorders less frequently than in bpd?[/quote] presumably it could happen if a person contradicts any schema but the schema involved in each are unique to the person, unless a split or discard are specific to some modes of thinking. (though isn't it the case that in bpd, splitting does not necessarily impact the worth of the individual who has been split, and a loss of worth is more in keeping with a discard because the person is discarded? 1polarbear wrote: think about guru relationships, they can be stable as long as the devotee remains a devotee. but if they stop, then there is devaluation and usually destruction. might be some attempts to regain the devotee too. one striking example of how it works is scientology. there is done willingly as part of the doctrine. the narcissist discard has been institutionalized. most organized religions have the overall same idea. like if you leave islam, you are on a death sentence. in christianity it is ostracism. it creates scapegoats too, which keeps others in line. but scientology stands out for its viciousness. implying the discard is in fact deliberate not just the result of the schemas involved? the person finds their own decision to have the right to perform the discard? 1polarbear wrote: i am not saying it is the only one, but i assumed it's what you meant. like i said, i think the phenomenon also applies to everything ""other"". there was a time when everything had some sort of value. if you had clothing, it was loved in a special way, so you would fix it if it broke. now it is just easier to discard and create some new shiny toy, which does not last long usually. it's how consumerism creates a bunch of narcissist behaviors. same goes with relationships in general. why fix one when you can find another more exciting one through an app? if you add a devaluation of the object over the top, or a desire for destruction, then you have narcissist discard, imo. however for this to be a discard your theory of mind would have to extend to economic value in line with the lives of others because otherwise the items cannot have worth. 1polarbear wrote: millon isn't exactly mainstream. it is as an introduction, but if you want psychological process, etiology and causality, he is not the go to guy, and it is what people look for the most. categorization, not so much. some people might auto-identify with subtypes here and there. i mean, the whole subtype thing is mostly a millon thing and it's like taking ingredients and mixing them up. it might make different recipes, but not necessarily good ones. they lack practical usefulness. it's a good intro to the idea of spectrum and that type of thing, or to learn how to differentiate. it's mostly diagnosis focused, and people here can't diagnose. yes, diagnosis without causality through psychological process doesn't seem of much use other than for those working in those fields although perhaps traits being highlighted could point people in the right directions. 1polarbear wrote: i don't know about gregariousness, i think most people with npd are extroverted, at least the primary type. so they will tend to be people person for that reason, but it could be a limited one, like a ""safe group"" that actually feeds the image. pathological narcissism can't really take criticism or even differing opinion. 1polarbear wrote: i'll try and rephrase it differently. usually in people there is a true self and a false self. that's the theory behind. you could say it is the private vs the social, or the superego vs the id. in a normally constituted person, both cohere in some way, but stay distinct. so there is a give and take between them. so people might have a social life up to a point, and keep a private part for themselves. relationships will be graduated along that line as well, so people don't treat strangers the same they treat a friend. in terms of morality, people might find some compromise between following the perfect rules, and following their own desires. that's the normal, healthy way of creating an identity. so you are not all social, or all private, all moral, or all free. it's a mix, and people draw lines and boundaries between those things. yes, so the id ego and superego are ways of describing/categorizing functional personality aspects, but would surely not be false self? as i understood, in a healthy person the superego only conflicts with the id in internal debate (the superego is not a false self, it is more of the individual's social responsibility and conscience.) 1polarbear wrote: the true self is the id, and the private. it's what you would be with total freedom, if you were omnipotent. the false self, are the self imposed limitations that people put on themselves and that are usually also enforced by society. (or what you would be if you had no superego.) to need a false self, either society would need to be incorrect or the individual would need to feel or find them self constrained in some way. now the narcissist does not deal well with those compromises. it's an all or nothing thinking. black and white thinking. either you are this, or you are it's opposite. it's binary. so what happens is that the narcissist, being social, invests entirely in it's social image or in some morality stance: ""values"". 1polarbear wrote: now, this is fairly common in all people. they take responsibility and they ""loose themselves"" in a false self. it's so common that it creates existential crisis in life, one commonly know as the midlife crisis, where someone reclaims their true self that was neglected, and it looks like a regression into childhood. lot's of people's unhappiness comes from this, and it is what mostly freud and his followers were trying to address. by looking at dreams, they would free the true self, the genuine desires that were repressed, and try to integrate it to the false self, and that would create a more complete individual, an ""integrated"" individual. so psychotherapy is about integration, to integrate those part of the self that are neglected but still there. description of what mid life crisis is about reminds me of the comment on society and enforced ideas of self or functioning. society creating too much socialization seems to cause problems - i think there was more of this around in victorian times? self-crisis? due to very strong constraints and expectations. 1polarbear wrote: in a narcissist personality, the false self is idealized so much so that the true self is denied, so there is an integration, but in the wrong manner because it denies reality. reality being here the true desires, the true longings, but also the true capacity, the true morality, character, habits, etc. so everything is invested in the appearance of such, and this is what i mean by idealization. it's a kind of delusion. and because that false self is considered ""good"" absolutely, the goal is to play the part the most perfectly possible but not from some internal drive, but by some external drive. so you end up with moralities of the sort: ""you can do whatever you want, as long as it is not known"". idealization as delusion makes sense. 1polarbear wrote: but of course on the outside, everything has to be perfect, like a potemkin village. the words and actions you do have to be perfect and no mistake allowed. but the reality behind is usually a mess and the opposite. plus, the narcissist will denounce his own real flaws, his own true self, that he projects and assume in others, thus the splitting. cheaters see cheats everywhere, and denounce it, which gives them some moral altitude. so the person ends up thinking they are gods of some sort, or at least it is the image they are selling. so normal people, they see that, and think the person is delusional and grandiose, which is true objectively. not only what they pretend to be is impossible to attain, but claiming or suggesting they have reached it even worst. so the person acts like a god, perfect, and commanding. it's essentially arrogance, delusional pride. it's what the dsm more or less defines, or what people call primary narcissism. that makes sense particularly with some of the people you gave as examples later. 1polarbear wrote: there is a pretty good interpretation of it in the movie ""american psycho"" if you haven't seen it. as for what people call the vulnerable narcissist, fight club is pretty much a good take on it. both are quite similar, but there are subtle differences. like in fight club the guy is not grandiose himself, but he creates an imaginary friend that is, which turns out to be himself. i recently saw a film about a con artist with an analysis which also seemed to make sense with some of the explanation points, but was presumably more about the person maintaining their true self, rather than the primary example given above. 1polarbear wrote: yes, but the process is the same, it's just a matter of degree. some people can act, and they know reality still, so it's fine. might be a problem in the long run, but it's not pathological. they also are free not to act, which is important. it creates some balance. if you can only be your act, then it's pathological. that's why people say it is a spectrum. there is no clear cut categorization that can say this is good, and this is bad. it's got mostly to do with how it interferes with every day life and what the prospects are. presumably most people only act if they have a reason or requirement for it. 1polarbear wrote: but yes, it is idealization. the problem with idols is not that they are idols, it's when they take too much place and blind from reality. you can see it in normal day and political ""thought"". people will think in terms of ""left"" and ""right"", or some other binaries. those are idealizations that have become idols, and depending on the part of the fence you are in, everything good you will attribute to your side, and everything bad to the other side. so that is splitting in action. it blinds from reality because those words are meaningless, just placeholders, and they resist strong attempt to define them, plus they shift all the time. so it's whatever people feel they are, their own emotions, good or bad. not sure how idealization or the creation of an idol is not a ""problematic item"" in itself, if an idol by nature has weak or poorly defined boundaries because it is not the item itself which is focussed on, the item is a function of something else, be it guilt, ego, self-image etc. i'm not sure what causes the b&w other then e.g. the idea is right or that the person can use b&w in that way (self-justification of an idea) which is not generally going to be the correct explanation. the splitting /b&w depends on the idolizations? so the idolizations are control structures or mechanism through which the splitting operates. 1polarbear wrote: so it's the same here. a narcissist might have an idol of looking good, so it is what they will focus on, and want to be the best looking. or the more logical, or the more this or that. there are plenty of idols, but here, look is subjective and vain, logic can is meaningless and can be garbage is badly used, etc. every idealization has flaws, which is why usually black and white thinking inevitably leads to a loss of reality, and in the end, pure emotional drivel, but unassumed. like its the best because i wear it, or it's logic because i thought it, and of course, all the others are inferior since they don't agree with it. it's idealization plus black and white thinking that is the problem, not just idealization itself, because everybody does it. any word is an idealization. but one word can't explain all of reality or encapsulate all possible human experience. the actual idol is probably the narcissist's self image itself? b&w thinking leads to a loss of reality because reality has already been lost in the individual's operation of logic - is true, is not true, is operated rather than observed. (would normally seem to require contextual aphasia which i have heard of occuring in pd.) 1polarbear wrote: i think so yes. although when it comes an idol, comprehension takes a second seat. i mean, comprehension of reality. it stops happening because you know everything already. you have those handful of values and idols, and you can explain everything and justify all your intents. or if comprehension happens through those values the individual would have the idea they are open to comprehension when they are in fact doing what is described. 1polarbear wrote: it's even better when those idols are self-contradictory, then you truly are a god. nobody can refute you ever, and you can justify every action. particular schema underneath, i wonder? 1polarbear wrote: government are starting to figure this thing out, and they also figured out people won't be able to tell. it's not even sure if they can, so perhaps they just lucked on the concept. was that an analogy...? 1polarbear wrote: i mean the admiration is in the narcissist first, so he will not see why anybody else would think different, and his image is perfect, he embodies that image perfectly. so if others don't admire him, then it means they simply are jealous and failures, and since nobody's perfect, it is easy to see the flaw in others, which distract from self-awareness. when you are busy finding flaws in others, you don't attend to your own. that's what i mean by being totally invested in the false self. like any personality disorder, it is self-reinforcing behavior, and there is no obvious way out. that's what i thought about how narcissism/disorder of self worked - the person's ego is in control of the devaluation of the concepts the other person has and the person or value is judged on the first person's ego. the individual is totally invested in the false self. 1polarbear wrote: here, i am even going to go further, i will say it is a narcissistic theory. because how easy it is to accuse everybody of being ""defensive""? i could easily say to everything you say that i disagree with that you are being defensive, and if you defend yourself that you are being defensive, then you just proved my point in proving you are defensive. that would be the idea if an individual said other persons always reacted in a certain way (provided they do not actually do it for their own reasons rather than as a result of the first person's behaviour) 1polarbear wrote: and behind it of course, would be some idol, like being transparent, or genuine, or authentic, and so on. i am a free person, i don't ever defend myself, and i have no boundary, i am a person of the world, i am everything, i am one with the world in some symbiotic state and things that are different, are having defense mechanism, which is bad and needs to be condemned. so behind that ideal would be something else? for example the moral person example i gave would have a potential other motivation other than morality? 1polarbear wrote: you could have the same pattern with ""rationalization"". people that give reasons are defensive, and are hiding their true motives. surely the reasons would have to be different every time, and the reactions to each would have a subtle difference? 1polarbear wrote: again, there is no need for boundaries which is what rationalization does, it creates division, and everybody that would rationalize them is different and therefore inferior to the true instinctual being that is one with the world and in harmony. all reason must be condemned because they fall short of the ideal. and of course, i am totally free of that flaw, i am a story in the making, totally in the flow, etc. this reminds me of what i couldn't get my head around when i was thinking. i figured everyone would have to be disordered to rationalize deny etc. and i then realised this would actually mean people don't have id, ego, superego, it is just a description of what is built one on the other in comprehension; first understanding of personal desire, then comprehension of self, then comprehension of social responsibility, getting more complex piece by piece. contradictions to these only mean a person ""wants not to have to stay at work half an hour late due to a headache (id) but does so anyway (superego.) all very simple. no complex psychology. then i ask is rationalization inferior, but if i am loading an incorrect schema myself when i think that (the ability to edit data is not meant to be seen as an advantage) but its the way people edit data which makes me think they are not necessarily doing the same thing, for example as you get older your theory of mind gets better, perhaps so does a person's rationale. you don't have to evade concept if you do not really use it. - no that might be a bad argument. instead of imagining id ego superego as conflicting false and true selves? 1polarbear wrote: they are two examples of what i would consider a narcissist personality. they have that one ideal that explains everything and can't be countered except through common sense of a sort, but logic by itself won't cut it. you can see how easy that carrot can drive everything. complete self-justification, perfect image worthy of admiration, etc. you can do whatever you want, and destroy anybody you want, so what's not to like? i was going to go with logic won't cut it because it contests itself (and requires e.g. cbt as schema therapy to cut through it?) if there are any two conflicting issues and false self-true self is a conflicting issue. 1polarbear wrote: anger is totally normal though. people get angry when someone else does bad things. if you want the person to die, then it's hatred. again fairly normal reaction to badness, although hatred starts to come up in the idealization. because now it is not the act itself that is the cause of the anger, but the person in its entirety. so yes, a case could be made it has something to do with a kind of narcissistic response. i mean, ultimately, it is like playing god, deciding who lives and who dies. playing god deciding who lives who dies; ""you are my object, i am your object""? 1polarbear wrote: but also, it is again about porous boundaries. going from anger to hatred usually shows some boundary problems. lack of differentiation between the act, that can be changed, or the person, that cannot be changed. boundary problem as in i am alive-you are alive (you are an extension of me,) therefore i have the right to change data about you. but the person is right or wrong in the same way as the act, therefore the person could be changed or edited if you would also change the act.? 1polarbear wrote: so there was this guy that killed his wife because she kept putting the milk in front of the butter. the guy snapped and killed her. probably he took it personally every time she did that and he thought she was doing it on purpose to spite him. now i don't know if it is narcissism. could be, or could be something else. he could have been paranoid or a puritan. all that i could say for sure is that he did not deal well with boundaries, either too rigid or not enough, and lacked justice because of the disproportionality of the act. on top of being illegal of course. there is just not enough data to tell the reason. it could be the upbringing too, if he was punished in the past for doing the same by parental figures, or it could be the other way, the parents always did that too and the killing was a way to free himself. i don't think i would put hatred necessarily in the narcissism construct on the face of it. but it happens. the part above got me thinking. so boundaries between the act on the person and the person become blurred which seems semantically impossible if looked at scientifically, but semantic aphasias can occur across the pd spectrum (and psychologically, obviously.) - the blurred semantics would surely have to affect other things as well. exactly like the guy with the milk and the butter, but where it could have been something particular about what he did, not just it being done to spite him or being something which had been done to him before. something very particular in his thought process, but what would depend on what it was. 1polarbear wrote: right, it could happen that way. the moral self is always part true, part false, it's a compromise. i mean, by it's essence, it is social. a man alone is never going to do things he does not want to do, out of some social consideration of good and evil. as soon as you start acting morally, there is some falsehood that creeps in. there is always the ideal, and the truth. most people keep both fairly close together, but not always, due either to circumstances, feebleness in resolve, or just that sometimes you have to make hard choices between two bads. well, i don't know if it is most people, but let's say healthy people. it's when you start thinking you are completely good that it gets deluded, and you become basically the false self, irrelevant of what you actually do. almost inevitably it is justified by saying you have good intentions. so the deluded person always has good intentions, because they are a good person with good ideals, then whatever bad happens, you can't be blamed for it, nor the ideal itself. it's the joker card everybody uses. yes, i may have bombed hiroshima, but i had good intentions, not like those other people that bombed pearl harbor. yes that's exactly what i meant, but it also depends why hiroshima is bombed, if it is a wartime justification it can remain correct, moral etc, but if it is an illegal invasion/aggression surely the rationalization falls apart and the false self has to disintegrate in some way? or the person would end up feeling shame about their self-action?

""consent"" right? so presumably if this is an example, his values were that he was a sailor and an admiral, the values are pushed off onto those values rather than literally being about his self, he believed himself to be those things and for those things to be the right application to the situation (himself, everyone else, etc.) makes sense of the billion year contract, other than lifespan. (although the contract is probably seen differently by many persons in those settings?) 1polarbear wrote: so you see the desire for control, but it's all based around his personality. he did not like psychiatry for obvious reasons, so everybody have to not like it. it is the enemy of the religion and he tries to replace it with his own stuff. so then, all drugs are bad, and so on. it goes from there, but it's all based on one person's desires, himself. the argument would be if a person believes something to be correct they would support it? some people would argue against things they believe to be incorrect in logistic terms (and would outlaw them) - to the point of editing the people concerned? 1polarbear wrote: hitler i think was more of a perfectionist that wanted unity, he was not into building a personality cult. i haven't studied him much though, but it's the impression i get. stalin was a narcissist big time. he basically became the revolution, so whatever he did was the revolution. the personality cult because of the focus on self? whereas hitler's narcissistic ideal if he had one would probably be pushed off onto the ideal of the aryan race? 1polarbear wrote: it's what i think, or it's a possibility. it's more a question of what you can rule out or not. it can be many things, including narcissism. it could be normal too. i just did not see anything specifically based on narcissism in it. because the ideal is pushed off onto something else, not on attention/admiration toward the person's self or feedback to that self? the involvement of ""self"" is not about the person. if in narcissism the discard happens when you break the person's ego schema (false self) the discard happens when the person's agency is interrupted (the person sees their right as being the law,) then the person's false self is interrupted when the discard occurs - so the individual rationalizes (or diverts the idea to) the idea it is correct? the person is still in the right even if the discard results in an action which makes no sense? (i think i am oversimplifying the last part.) 1polarbear wrote: well, if you think someone is your property, it is poor boundaries, unless you are in a place where slavery is legal, and that person is actually your slave because you bought them, and you have papers to prove it. in which case it is no longer poor boundaries reminds me of the nhs criteria for diagnoses. (only a disorder if disruption is noticed.) 1polarbear wrote: otherwise it is simply delusional. right, stealing is poor boundaries that don't imply codependency or a relationship, at least not in the common sense of the terms, but if you think about it longer, the thief is in a relationship with others. he does need other people to steal, so he is also dependent on people allowing him to steal, or on people not being good enough to stop him. so in order to be a thief, he needs a whole system that allows it. he needs property, and property laws, and a whole bunch of things. he isn't independent, he is playing in a bigger game with set rules he can cheat on. and those rules are the boundaries, so he has poor boundaries and is in a relationship with society in general and the people he steals, and he needs them to be as they are. of course, but these are all practical dependencies. 1polarbear wrote: keeping in the psychiatry realm, the antisocial construct has the notion of parasitic lifestyle. a parasite, in biology is an animal that needs others to survive, and it does not give anything of value in exchange. so it is dependent, and has poor boundaries, because it cannot give back, it is not independent and therefore cannot be just. now, narcissism is not antisocial so it is not parasitic, but exploitative. so it gives back a minimum, but takes more than it gave. just like hubbard, he takes your whole soul for a billion years, and give you some self-improvement courses. i would have thought narcissism does not have a particular bearing on being parasitic or not, and in some cases exploitation is not central other than as a result of any function of narcissism? unless exploitation and the ability to do it are associated with positive ego. 1polarbear wrote: some people think it is part of normal development of the child, as language develop and experience is gained. it seems that way to me. younger people don't know much, don't have too many tools, so if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, and getting idols is quite normal. most people grow out of that phase, while some don't. what's not normal is not to grow out of it, to cling to omnipotent ideation or black and white thinking. there was a quote by churchill. ""if you are young and not a progressive, you have no heart, and if you are old and not a conservative, you have no brain."" it's because as you grow older, you acquire more tools, and more experience, so you can relate to others more readily, get a better theory of mind, and realized everybody before you were not such idiots after all, they simply knew things you didn't, or dealt with life situations you never had to deal with. so that's how people grow out of narcissism, by becoming independent, having to take decisions, taking responsibility, etc. sounds like a different sort of narcissism to the type which is built into a person's personality structure? perhaps less good theory of mind would allow a person to be more ""frivolous"" by doing things like putting on an act without it being pathological? (playing with ego as a mode of interrelation to have a 'good life'?) 1polarbear wrote: not necessarily, the tests are designed to be done in a session by a qualified psychiatrist. the reason people autodiagnose is mostly to find an identity, they aren't really interested in the pathological part, and since most of those personalities are vague and common, everybody can see whatever they want. so it either gives identity, justification or both. or it can be used, which is even more common, in justifying rejection or failure in relationships. so people diagnose their partners. the criteria are also a nightmare to work out and understand properly, but not all psychiatrists seem to apply an understanding of the criteria, some just ask the patient questions to see if the patient agrees with the question (with no clarification for the nature of each). i am surprised though because one of the criteria for pd is that it causes damage in the person's life in one way or another. so unless the person is recalcitrant about change/therapy, even if only information, it would surprise me that not many people seek assistance. 1polarbear wrote: ok, i see, it is in the context of violence. like how to explain violence out of personality disorders because there are some correlations. i usually resist that type of approach, especially since the biggest correlation is with antisocial personality, and it's a chicken and egg problem. people get diagnosed because they are violent, then turn around and say that they are violent because of the personality. and in that context, narcissism is mostly seen through the psychopath, so it's an added feature that may help predict future behavior but not so much so if you see it as a secondary feature perhaps, like the guy with the butter and the jam - perhaps the reaction is violent and could have been something else, but the trigger is specific and the trigger may not be antisocial. (but surely all pd has psychology.) 1polarbear wrote: but in that case, it is fairly simple. the ideation is actually about violence, so the person sees herself as violent. rather than seeing them self as correct and being violent or the disruption of another schema(butter and jam), regardless of whether the individual is rationalizing/valuing violence as strength? 1polarbear wrote: it becomes the false self and the personality, anything else being weak. it's also self-reinforcing, because any act of violence will show the strength and independence of the person at least in the ideal self. doing violence therefore proves the others are weaker and that you are in control, which in turn justifies the violence, because it is what weak people are for, being victim. not only that but in some case, it can be seen as altruistic, as in being tough forces the victim into responding and making them less of a victim. it makes the victim into the image of the psychopath, or it is discarded and dies out. it's about culling the weak to keep the strong. the weak will of course be blamed for being weak, thus blaming the victim. but the question would be what would make the strength and independance ideal a narcissistic or false self rather than a belief or value the individual has? like avoiding the concept of immorality, the individual would have to be avoiding something through making the individual a victim rather than simply reinforcing for there to be a false self? not suggesting the avoided issue has to be vulnerable, only that it has to be rationalized out for some reason to do with self. 1polarbear wrote: sometimes it is some other thing, based on some moral value, like pretty much all activism does. animal rights activism especially, is full of very violent people who think it is fine to do violence on humans, because animals are the ideal here to be preserved. the nice little innocent animals. of course it proves good intentions, and justifies violence. surely if the individuals involved believe in it there is all sorts of psychological error going on unless they are actually psychotic in some cases. 1polarbear wrote: well, just take the animal activists. they reject being carnivorous animals, because it exploits animals, give them possibly pain, is bad for the environment and so on. so instead of accepting you have eaten meat, have participated in exploiting animals, are able to give pain and are dirty, then you find a cause, and you project those things on others, which gives you the justification to do the same thing they do. it's just easier to do violence on animal killers than on some innocent people. i don't know if it is a syndrome, but for some people it passes as morality. if you can convince yourself some people are bad, reciprocity will justify them in doing bad things to them. so you paint black and then attack what you just painted, because you are white. (classic projection) 1polarbear wrote: there was some experiment, they took a bunch of people, divided them in two, and gave each group a flag of a different color. it did not take long they were attacking each others. they were sworn enemies. surely that doesn't happen every time... 1polarbear wrote: it's said of people acting in the beginning of a relationship. they idealize the other, and send a lot of love, and the other can do no wrong. so love bombing. some people with poor boundaries will do that. they are all in for awhile, then it stops and the devaluation comes, and it adds up, until everything you do is wrong and your existence itself is an irritant. so love bombing is the all white phase which usually attract people to the narcissist, or psychopath, or whatever. they can do that because they don't care about the real person, the other is an idea. so they will tell you who you are, in flattering term, with lots of intensity. it's what happens in self-help guru things, and cults. they all love bomb you, tell you how great you are. of course it's not true, they don't know you, but it works. i've actually noticed quite a few people doing that.",1140,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"what is a discard? is this a description of one? user1357911 wrote: i wonder if presumably most persons with personality disorder won't recognize splitting and for some reason it would be self-reported by persons with other personality disorders less frequently than in bpd? it's a fair assumption. the rapid cycling and direct contradiction makes it more obvious in bpd, so they know it is part of the problem. in narcissism, it can be hidden, because it may be always in the same direction, the direction of idol = good, others = bad. while in bpd it will be idol = good, idol = bad, and then again in cycles. so quite clearly in bpd, it will destroy relationships pretty fast, but not in narcissism. user1357911 wrote: presumably it could happen if a person contradicts any schema but the schema involved in each are unique to the person, unless a split or discard are specific to some modes of thinking. (though isn't it the case that in bpd, splitting does not necessarily impact the worth of the individual who has been split, and a loss of worth is more in keeping with a discard because the person is discarded? i am not an expert, but what i saw in bpd, is that the cycling is not clear. there is lots of doubt in it, so it is more ambivalence than total splitting. as soon as the other is split in a way, the contradictory idea comes to mind, and then another split, so making decisions and sticking to it becomes impossible. also it usually ends up tearing the person apart, and then they will do the same to themselves, which eventually leads to low self-esteem. i think in the end, they blame themselves for that ambivalence. so discards are not real discards, but the bpd mind ends up being afraid of itself and will flee the other, or others. but then there are some that use this in a predatory manner and a way to manipulate. user1357911 wrote: implying the discard is in fact deliberate not just the result of the schemas involved? the person finds their own decision to have the right to perform the discard? i don't think splitting is deliberate in the strong sense of the term. it happens, and the person may not know why at first. later on perhaps the blackening becomes deliberate, like it is indulged in. it's hard to tell really. i see people that clearly brings narcissistic injury for a long time and it becomes their poles of identity, and they will split the bad object forever. how much of it is deliberate and bad faith, i don't know. i think it varies, but if it is pathological, i would say it isn't. it can be both too. the initial blackening might be instinctive, but the details deliberate. you just add to the stuff. there was an example in ww2. basically, jews would be split for some reason, either because they were bankers, or not germans first, or not christian. so then there would be punishment, and then the result of that punishment, misery, would be used as further proof they were worthy of despise. so in that case, probably the first was not deliberate, but the second was. you see the same happening today with the covid superstition. at first there was a split. the vaccinated blamed the unvaccinated for being non altruists, not part of the group, not getting with the program, etc. then they were punished and excluded from those activities, so the vaccinated propagated infection through their licensing passes and getting back to normal. then some of the unvaccinated ended up in the hospital, which was further proof they were causing the problem, which means they needed more punishment and a final solution. again, i think the first split is not deliberate, but the second is for most people. user1357911 wrote: however for this to be a discard your theory of mind would have to extend to economic value in line with the lives of others because otherwise the items cannot have worth. not sure what you mean. the value of a thing is not primarily economic, it is simple usefulness. some object are useful, even if they are not perfect. what i meant here, is that the idea of ""caring"" in the ideologue is simply not there. like if you want to clothe yourself, you can figure out stuff that will do the work, but may not be the best looking, and won't be in fashion, but it works, and it is cared for for what it is. when it becomes an ideal, then it is not the thing itself, but it's representation that matters. so you don't buy a car because it gets you from point a to b, and it is useful for that. you buy it for the image it puts on you, so it might be the girl on the hood, or the freedom or whatever, but the car is secondary. if the car stops doing that, if it is now seen as for old people, or not as free as others, then the car is discarded like trash, even if it still can go from a to b. so the car was never cared for as a car, bur for an ideal. a used car is just as good as a new one if what you want is to go from a to b, but not if you have it from other purposes. in the same way, you can care about the care to make it last longer to go from a to b, but you are not likely to be able to improve it to get girls or to be more free. it's why the image is black and white, while the reality is more on a spectrum. but a lot of people also do extend the value of people in the economic realm. take the covid example again. after having excluded people from being useful economically by ostracism, the next logical step is a discard. to let them die basically, since they have no more value. so you see how the original split, which is only based on one difference and assertion of independence simply goes down in a spiral pretty fast. it works at individual level as well as the collective level. you idolize health, and then it goes down from there in a self-reinforcing pattern, until discard. user1357911 wrote: yes, diagnosis without causality through psychological process doesn't seem of much use other

user1357911 wrote: yes, so the id ego and superego are ways of describing/categorizing functional personality aspects, but would surely not be false self? as i understood, in a healthy person the superego only conflicts with the id in internal debate (the superego is not a false self, it is more of the individual's social responsibility and conscience.) i think they are pretty much the same practically. in a healthy person, the false self will be pretty close to the true self. but in some people, the social takes over and they loose themselves. it's not the exact same, but they relate quite strongly. just think about it as if someone would always loose the debate to the id. then practically, the ego becomes the superego, and the id is ""lost"", forgotten, repressed, whatever you want to call it. and that is what happens when you identify strongly with an idol. you start repressing your own agency and put it at the service of said idol, you become a worshipper. so now, the idol works for you as the superego, and your ego becomes the idol. so you become a false self proper, and all your interactions are through the idol, and admiration for the idol becomes your own, and vice versa. now usually in narcissism, it goes one step further, and the person becomes the idol, it's best avatar/prophet and so on, and then the idol itself is lost and the id takes over and becomes the idol. so the true self reaffirms itself, but has to stay hidden, because what people admire is the idol. so to the outside, the false self becomes a kind of role, but there is cheating, because there is the belief in the narcissist he is the idol ultimately. so it's different than let's say a zealot that would put themselves in the total service of the idol as you would a superior. it's why you often see the two together. the zealot will give narc supply to the narcissist through the idol. the zealot is blinded to the cheats because he has his eyes only for the idol. the narcissist can then exploit the believer by having eyes only on himself and projecting the good on the idol and the bad on the unbeliever. so by being the best exemplar of that thing that is being worshipped, the narcissist can have admiration and superiority, all the while being free themselves as long as the image can be sustained of course. the more cheats and the more delusion, the more likely it will fall down and be exposed. there is a similar thing happening in paranoid schizophrenics, like those that hear voices that command. now it is the superego taking over and asserting itself. it becomes an image personalized, and it plays the role of an aggressor, and some will identify with it and become it, following the voice. in this case, they play the zealot role in their mind, but from the outside, it's just the same as narcissism. charles manson was on that line. in part victim of society, in part being the whole society, and he switches between the two states rapidly in conversation. sometimes he sounds like a narcissist, sometimes like a helpless victim. user1357911 wrote: (or what you would be if you had no superego.) to need a false self, either society would need to be incorrect or the individual would need to feel or find them self constrained in some way. i don't think there is a ""correct"" here. any society will be correct in some ways for some, and less for others. it's the point of politics to be correct for all at minimum and the best for most, but there will always be a false self. it's actually part of the game, everybody has a role, everybody has a personality and a false self, and it actually adds value to life and gives meaning. so the false self is not bad, it is a good thing, as long as it aligns with what the true self truly wants. that's why i say in a healthy person, they cohere in some way and are close by. in unhealthy people, they don't, and it's not necessarily the fault of the person, it can be a bad social script. people get miserable if they play a bad script not for them. when both are the same, you get narcissism, when the boundary between the two is not conscious let's say. user1357911 wrote: description of what mid life crisis is about reminds me of the comment on society and enforced ideas of self or functioning. society creating too much socialization seems to cause problems - i think there was more of this around in victorian times? self-crisis? due to very strong constraints and expectations. probably yes, the social fabric was a lot stronger, and roles were a lot stronger, especially in england. i think it went overboard, which then led to a contrary backlash, first in the 20s, then the 60s. now it's the opposite, people don't have roles, so they have to create idols which is what marketing does. throwable idols as it were. so people fall into nihilism, so the problem is the opposite, which is also why you see more narcissism. people simply choose to be whatever idol, which may or may not be realistic. so if there is mid-life crisis, it is mostly self-imposed. it solves a problem and creates a new one. that's why i say there is no good and bad about the false self, it's not a moral thing. it's more in the realm of a relationship. user1357911 wrote: i recently saw a film about a con artist with an analysis which also seemed to make sense with some of the explanation points, but was presumably more about the person maintaining their true self, rather than the primary example given above. it's possible. there are different type of cons. some will be con artists like jesters. or the joker in the dark knight. he is true to himself, but he is also nobody. basically he is what he does, nothing more, nothing less. so when they try to know his identity or origin, there is none, or many. batman on the other hand is the narcissist, he plays another type of con which has to do with being a symbol and create fear and admiration. he wears a mask and has a true self and a false self. the joker simply wears make up. the joker is a bit like the total true self, that does not care about society's morals, which he sees as schemes. so he is an anti-narcissist, but also a complement to it. it's another good movie to see the concept. user1357911 wrote: not sure how idealization or the creation of an idol is not a ""problematic item"" in itself, if an idol by nature has weak or poorly defined boundaries because it is not the item itself which is focussed on, the item is a function of something else, be it guilt, ego, self-image etc. well, i make distinctions between ideas and idols. ideas are not necessarily bad, idols are bad, but only because they are worshipped. so even then, it is not the idol that is bad, it's what people make of it, plus, somethings you do need to be deceived, that is how any society works. you simply have to be deceived in a good way. the noble lie as plato was saying, it is necessary. but think about ideas in a more general way. every word you say or write, is an idealization of something. it's never the actual thing, it is a bad copy of it. but you need it to conceptualize and live, and communicate. so idealizing is part of life as human beings. it can't be bad in itself. but it regularly has to be corrected, so you have to keep your eyes open to reality and correct the image, or reject it if it is not working out. if it is too wrong. so an idea that is true is a good thing, or an idea that is good enough representation of reality is also a good thing. it's also good in the sense that it hides useless stuff from consciousness, all the imperfections of the world, they disappear once you idealize something, so it makes decision making possible, while if you took always all reality and all possibilities, you would be stranded and paralyzed. that is why caring and cultivating reality is important, it's about having better ideas, either in truth or usefulness. so it's a process and a good one, it's what humans do. now, when it is an idol, then it is the image itself that is worshipped, not the thing itself. that's the difference. it's the image that is cultivated, but images don't change, they are eternal. so there is no correction possible, since now you have no reference point, no reality. so it's called a delusion. it's an image that has a life of its own if you will, not based on anything true. it usually simply starts with an idea, but then things get added to it, or taken out, and it looses its meaning. like the examples i gave. left and right in politics. they used to be simple ideas, two groups of people in a parliament. but people forgot who those people were and they are long dead, and nobody cares who they were, the image itself, the idea is now disconnected from reality, but people still identify to them, and they just put whatever they want under them, and it changes all the time. that's what i mean by idols, and people worship those idols, group around them and give sacrifice, pray to them, etc. but it's just a word, just an idea, and since it is nothing and everything, people stop looking at reality, and try to find words that actually mean something. communication breaks down, lines are drawn, and people fight over nothing. and sometimes, you need ideals, even if they are not totally accurate. like social scripts, which give identity and meaning. it does not matter that much if they are true, as long as they fulfill a purpose. every strong nation has those. so in itself, those ideals are not bad, and you can also worship them, but that is where the danger line is. it still has to be close to reality, or the whole thing falls apart. then it becomes idols, the way i use the word. user1357911 wrote: i'm not sure what causes the b&w other then e.g. the idea is right or that the person can use b&w in that way (self-justification of an idea) which is not generally going to be the correct explanation. the splitting /b&w depends on the idolizations? so the idolizations are control structures or mechanism through which the splitting operates. it's because ideas are just words. so if i say ""left"", then anything ""right"" is the opposite. so if i say left is good, then logically, right is bad. also if i say pizza is good, therefore pizza is left, and hot dog is not pizza therefore hot dog is right and bad. you can see how fast things can get out of hand and totally outside reality. and i am not even talking about ketchup. now, someone actually in reality would actually taste the hot dog at least to know if it is good, they would not just logic their way through it. assuming all hot dogs are bad because they are not pizza, would be splitting and black and white thinking. user1357911 wrote: the actual idol is

i am not sure i understand the first part. id and superego will conflict at some point in life, very often in fact. like in the example you gave, the false self might take over, so the person self-sacrifices, but it's not what they truly want, they would rather go home and get well. so at some point they might break or keep living miserably. of course if they never have headaches, all is great, and there is no real conflict usually. the distinction is still there though, if not in act, in potential. you could have a headache. that's why the false self not necessarily bad. if it's in sync with your true self, it is a virtue. it still is if you make efforts, but it will cost you, so you'd better accept to be a martyr. user1357911 wrote: i was going to go with logic won't cut it because it contests itself (and requires e.g. cbt as schema therapy to cut through it?) if there are any two conflicting issues and false self-true self is a conflicting issue. depends on the issue. some people have bad script that are not coherent, so logic might work. most of the time though, you are dealing with desires that are not accepted, so in that case, it is more about talking and reimaging those desires, or reimaging the necessities. knowing what is truly important and what is not. so it deals with emotions more. i think the latter is more common than the former. like did you ever really choose to be an astronaut, or was it forced upon you when you were young? because if it was forced and you never chose it, you won't own it, and if you don't own it, you won't be good at it. you will self-sabotage, because it's not you. sometimes also people will make choices, but won't accept the consequences, and that's probably even more common, but they keep making the same choice, not realizing they are creating what they don't like, then they will project and blame something or someone else. society, or whatever. it's another way you get splitting. you get an idol that you chose, but it isn't a good one, or it has cost. so you keep the idol and reject the cost, you make others pay. user1357911 wrote: playing god deciding who lives who dies; ""you are my object, i am your object""?

(although the contract is probably seen differently by many persons in those settings?) right. well a normal person does not claim to be an admiral if they stop serving. but in that case, the image stays and gets a life of its own, so it becomes an empty word, and then it becomes whatever hubbard is or does. i don't know how people see those contracts. user1357911 wrote: 1polarbear wrote: so you see the desire for control, but it's all based around his personality. he did not like psychiatry for obvious reasons, so everybody have to not like it. it is the enemy of the religion and he tries to replace it with his own stuff. so then, all drugs are bad, and so on. it goes from there, but it's all based on one person's desires, himself. the argument would be if a person believes something to be correct they would support it? some people would argue against things they believe to be incorrect in logistic terms (and would outlaw them) - to the point of editing the people concerned? what i mean is that everything revolves around the person. correct does not matter anymore. correct is whatever hubbard says is correct. it's up to you to rationalize why. people that are stuck in a narcissist relationship will eventually try and rationalize their behavior for them, in part to defend them, in part to save the image. so it looks like a cult to people outside, and it is a cult. user1357911 wrote: the personality cult because of the focus on self? whereas hitler's narcissistic ideal if he had one would probably be pushed off onto the ideal of the aryan race? right. well stalin was the whole show, and there was a personality cult around him too. he even help create it. as far as i can tell hitler didn't do that. one of the ideal was the aryan race, yes, but it was something objective. people were going around measuring skulls or whatever, it was not whatever hitler was, because as people like to point out, he did not fit the ideal. i never saw pictures of him in people's houses and stuff you usually see in a personality cult. user1357911 wrote: because the ideal is pushed off onto something else, not on attention/admiration toward the person's self or feedback to that self? the involvement of ""self"" is not about the person. if in narcissism the discard happens when you break the person's ego schema (false self) the discard happens when the person's agency is interrupted (the person sees their right as being the law,) then the person's false self is interrupted when the discard occurs - so the individual rationalizes (or diverts the idea to) the idea it is correct? the person is still in the right even if the discard results in an action which makes no sense? (i think i am oversimplifying the last part.) basically, anything ""different"" is subject to discard. just like an arm that would not be good enough, you just cut it. if it acts on its own, you cut it, because it is not part of the ideal anymore. the ideal of course is the self, ultimately. pathological self-love ultimately, but if you say it like that, you kind of loose the process, and how normal it is up to there. user1357911 wrote: in which case it is no longer poor boundaries reminds me of the nhs criteria for diagnoses.

""relationship"" is a broad term, it's any interaction you have with others, so it includes jobs and any interaction you have with others. psychiatry is based on the medical model. you go there because you have some issue. in proper medicine, it's about your body, but in psychiatry, it is about being social in the broad sense, which includes stuff like anxiety, learning problems and just about anything. the diagnosis is based on those things first, to see the is an actual actionable problem. the personality is mostly causal, like if you would do a test and find a virus. user1357911 wrote: you mean the splitting is uncertain because it is ego dystonic and unsettling to the individual concerned? whereas if the person believes they are right (in bpd or npd or any other) the b&w (fact cancelling) reaction can be absolute? i would have thought multiple splits would be confusing not just lead to low self esteem because the person does not know whether they are coming or going? yes. well i was specifically talking about npd. in that case, it has for goal to save and protect the self-image, or reinforce it, so it is ego syntonic. it's just that for most people, they can deal with people that are different, and some even enjoy it. all differences are not an existential threat. but yes, it is confusing if it is not ego syntonic. i mean, it is always absolute, it's the point of it, it's the definition of it. it's all this or all that. normally, reality is not like that, so there will be back and forth, unless all you see is yourself or some idol. so in ideological groups, it will be ego syntonic as well, because it protects the image of the group. but if the group is not homogenous, of is facing something that is not part of the group image, then there will be some back and forth, some will split one way, others the other way, some will try and integrate. it's what we see in nations with strong immigration. some split one way or the other towards foreigners, others try and find a compromise between identity and openness to others. and yes, it's confusing. it tears societies apart. in something like bpd, the person tears itself apart in that same way. user1357911 wrote: the mechanism occurs (involved with the individual's own ego or splitting?) then after that there is reinforcement - even if the person is aware of it, would imply the person has given them self license to edit fact?

the idea is, is there some sort of mechanism going on where the person genuinely psychologically believes what is going on (or is invested in it) or is it ""casual attitude to data"" where the person has no sense of responsibility to reality - the two seem different. yes, they are different. one is superstition, the other irreligion. i see both, and they usually come together even in the same people. some believe, then some others just don't care about finding out, as long as it goes their way. it's like any virtue, if you lack it, you will go to the extremes and go back and forth, one extreme replacing the other. so people that lack courage, they won't always coward, they will also be reckless. they might viciously attack someone when they think it is safe, and then retreat once they see it isn't, which might be too late for them. so it's the same here. care too much about pineapples, or not care that much, as long as the plantations are destroyed, which is now the true enemy. i see this a lot in the environmentalists. some care a lot about carbon dioxide and warmth. others don't but care about destroying oil or just messing up the system. so there you have the superstitious and the irreligious. or take the covid, some people believe in the measures and want them whether they work or not, because it's about doing something, anything. so that's the superstitious, then you have people like boris j. that will impose the measures, but does not really believe in them, so in private, he will not follow them, which creates a scandal once known. it's also a good example of the false self as i use it. boris was presenting the image of a faithful, but really all those measures was him and what he needed to manage things around, so it's the classic narcissist trickery. people get blinded by the idol, so whatever he does is attributed to it, while in reality he isn't really doing anything except his own agenda. user1357911 wrote: i tell you what i miss my car like hell for going from a to b, its really inconvenient not having a working vehicle. i suppose in the social use of fascia or trend things are discarded quickly, yes you have a point, surely a narcissist would consider them self in a slightly desperate hole if needing to discard things that constantly for the sake of image - surely it would be like having an addiction? the people involved in that sort of behaviour seem overpriveleged in attitude, shallow, unable to connect reality and the importance of ordinary objects? not meaning those who do it without thinking properly, (out of carelessness). right, well it's vanity. and yes, again it is the opposite of carelessness, it is caring about the wrong things, things that are not real and can't be improved through cultivating. it's the same in relationships, they need cultivating if you are dealing with a real person. if you are dealing with an idea of a person though, it might be great until it reflects that ideal, so the idealization phase, but once it stops being that, it needs a discard, and you find the next ""true love"". careless people don't discard, they neglect, which isn't the same. user1357911 wrote: i meant theory of mind would extend conscience to the value of the economy as argued in old fashioned communism etc. (due to the people in it). oh, ok i see. there is some similarities in the concepts of capitalism in the marxist sense and the narcissism i describe, yes. in fact it's the same, you are correct. both are exploitation of the other, with the small difference than the capitalist only uses the other person's work, not the whole thing. it may have come from there originally. it's a bit more subtle than that though, it's a bit of a gross approximation. like in the myth, echo essentially validates everything narcissus says, but it would of course extends oftentimes into the physical in practice. but take a corporation, the people have to reflect well on the company, or they are discarded. it's probably even more important than the actual work value. user1357911 wrote: i always find it easier to think ""schema x schema y"" if i want to understand something instead of ""so and so said this then that happened"", because if you choose the second you stay in the dark about what is actually going on instead being involved only in the occurrences. yes, but then you idealize a behavior and therefore runs the risk of having it disconnected from reality over time. but yes, it's easier, which is why narcissism is a common thing. it has a natural evolution. there were whole discussions about this in the medieval ages, turning around literalism and metaphors. usually the consensus was metaphors are fine as long as they don't contradict the literal. but of course you have to remember the literal or have a way to refer to it. if you just forget about it, then the idea gets a life of its own, which is where things start getting delusional. user1357911 wrote: the relationship language seems to appear everywhere at the moment but is less easy to follow because it often ties in with ""chasing the rabbit"" on the disordered thinking the individuals are engaged in - obviously not always but there is less distinction if i am correct probably because of the way it developed? i am not sure what you mean exactly. i usually like staying close to the original data. you can have the best map in the world, if you can't link it to the territory, it is useless. if i show you the territory, you can make your own map. to take your analogy, it's easy to dig rabbit holes, but if you can't tell a rabbit when you see one, and can't tell how it runs, the holes will be pretty pointless unless lucky and some rabbit falls into it. but even then, you may assume it is a rabbit because it fell into a rabbit hole, while in fact it was a snake. it's the whole problem with idealization. user1357911 wrote: so the ego becomes the superego (superego functions are egotised.) but what gives the id license? (why) in narcissism what gives license to the id? good question. it's because you go up, and become one, then you go down and apply the one. so there is a moving up process from the individual to the one, from material to the idea. then both become one, the distinction disappears, then after that, everything move from the one to the individual is a matter of finding imperfection in the individual. now reality becomes an imperfect copy of the ideal, which must be rejected ultimately as false. since there cannot be any correction from the world, there is license for everything because inferior to the truth. basically, in the process of doing the map, the territory becomes obsolete and the cartographer king. you can look at fauci in the us. it's the typical process. first he looks at scientific papers and experts, and creates a map, then he becomes science. like he says himself, contradicting him is contradicting science itself, so his ego had become the superego. he has become his idol, and the best exemplar of that idol, so he goes everywhere and gives himself the right to lie to people and take whatever measure he deems necessary or better. then people have to obey. people see through his game, but the delusion is so strong, he keeps going, never correcting, because who can correct him? he is science, and everything else is fringe. so in the end, whatever he wants is law, as long as it keeps the image he projects. lots of people see through those games, but not everybody. he will get defenders that give him the admiration he seeks. user1357911 wrote: you mean agency of the individual as a living person is suppressed in favour of agency of ego?

(to defend against guilt/shame in tom or is that a double negative?) ego, e.g. false displayed self, fascia etc. or whatever is a rationalization. its not an ego function, the person in the example just sees it as an ego function. why the id takes license would surely have to determine the subtype of narcissism??? yeah, that's your map, i can't really say. but like in the example above with the royal family, for them, the superego is everything, they are born and raised into it, which is why harris calls it a prison they are unaware of. but william says that he does not feel like in a prison, but that is normal because he is unaware. but one thing for sure, they have to deal with narcissism at some level that is critical, all in their own way. like i said, the queen, she denies the bad parts, like arrogance and exploitation and in fact exemplifies herself in the opposite role. so she is a bit like the perfect christ. i am sure she also does not get license to her id and try to be responsible. so she avoided the narcissistic personality in those ways, even though her role is narcissism itself. but that is the royal family and they have a long tradition of dealing with that obviously. but if you take an outsider like meghan, and put her into that environment, she can't cope, she does not have the tools, so if the rumors are correct, she ended up being arrogant, exploiting the people below her and so on. then when she was criticized, she split, and discarded the royal family, but keeping harry, because he is part of her. he defends her like you would expect. ""whatever meghan wants, she gets."" said harry to the servants. and that's now the id gets license. now, i don't know exactly the details of how, and you can explain it is many different ways, but it does happen eventually. i tries a general explanation above, but you could put it in other ways i suppose. but really you become the image, and everything else is but an extension of yourself, albeit imperfectly, thus inferior. it's probably that inferiority that justifies, and the delusion does not allow correction to reality. i mean, if you think a king of princess is about giving orders around, it's your image and nobody will be able to correct it. others know there are limits and dangers to that even if the power is there. user1357911 wrote: or the opposite if you look at it the other way - i used to hear people say people with no false social self were the healthiest (most genuine) nothing to have to put on if society functions as it ought to. yes, it is a typical narcissist trope. blame all of society if you are not god. it's not to say there isn't some truth to it, but like aristotle said, ""men are social animals, and if not, they can either be gods or beasts"". beasts are also very genuine, especially polar bears. user1357911 wrote: the more social script, the less genuine people are with each other unless some people are very sensitive and require particular responses - e.g. man a thinks sending birthday cards is idiotic, but everyone gets upset if he does not do so. yes, it's all true. but what is ""correct""? do you avoid all birthdays? that's what i do. but plenty of people would say it is incorrect because they like birthdays. so then they have to play the part and be social, and false. it's a choice people make, i am not ready to say which is correct or not. it can only be correct in some context, and for some people in relationship with that context. birthdays are a social construct, and a fairly new one at that i believe. i think i saw somewhere it was never a thing in the past. people would be festive as some moments in life, like coming of age, marriage and things of that nature, but not birthdays. i don't know if it is true. perhaps it is an extension of christmas. user1357911 wrote: what if the narcissist actually is the idol in the way their personality is built? they are, but socially, it does not work, so you need an image to hide behind. user1357911 wrote: why primary narcissism would have been considered to be ""primary""? i don't know. i don't really use those terms. i know about primacy psychopathy, which has a narcissistic component which happens to the be same as the dsm definition. i think it is more aptly called grandiose narcissism, but there are types of narcissism that aren't grandiose, and plenty in fact are grandiose victims, which is a kind of inverse grandiosity. but it's possible to have a narcissist personality without grandiosity at all i believe, as long as there is delusion and an embodied image. people sometimes call it covert narcissism because the grandiosity is not apparent. it's there, but kind of in the mind mostly, so in that case, direct admiration is not the thing, but can be gotten through others, or perhaps through work or something. user1357911 wrote: meaning supply for a person with a narcissistic personality structure would be ""back up or agreement to that integration to their character,"" and disagreement with the person's character would not leave the person feeling ""lacking"", only that the other person were lacking an understanding? in those cases the exposure would be as to whether the narcissism is correct, and the narcissist would find them self feeling hard done by in relation to their construct being denied or taken away when they were in the right? the narcissist is always correct, at least internally for the things they care about. someone that is lacking is an existential threat and needs to be corrected, or destroyed. it's the black and white thinking. it's kind of the whole point. it gets into a nice synergy with the antisocial absence of guilt, because now not only the feeling's not there, the conscience, but you get an added justification for said lack of conscience, that you are correct. user1357911 wrote: considering everything everyone thinks has an underlying cause it would make little sense to think of something like delusion as being a disembodied chemically induced disorder and not a reflection of the individual's thought process. its possible that some individuals are playing out a narcissistic rationale in their heads when engaging with a delusion or fantasy? well yes, everybody does, but it takes some special salience in some people and not in others. if someone is already disconnected from reality in general, it would show more. user1357911 wrote: differentiating an idol as something which performs a substitute place? rather than an idealization? which is idealization of something which can have meaning, but there is still some substitution if the thing comes from ego? not everybody becomes an idol. most people don't. they can keep differentiating themselves from their ideals, or their ideals from reality. the normal worshipper will think they are not worthy of the idol, and bow in its presence. so they put themselves below the idol. of course there is some substitution, there is a longing to be like the idol, but it never gets there. that is also why reality is not an existential threat, because the idol is superior to everything, so if something does not fit, it is just something to be avoided or integrated. but the idol itself is safe from corruption. here, there was some example some time ago. you may know that the principle that nothing can go faster than the speed of light is pretty much an idol in physics. now at some point, someone claimed they had made an experiment that proved otherwise. it created quite a bit of commotion, plenty of scientists actually looked at it, and showed that in the end, it was not the case, so they went and looked for the errors. that's a sensible approach, and they could do that in the firm belief of their idol. now of course, i am sure plenty simply split and rejected it because it was an existential threat to themselves, that it was impossible and so on. so they probably never cared to check in reality, or may have looked at some other reasons, like those scientists were not authoritative enough, or something along those lines. user1357911 wrote: absolutely re value system, but that is just a personal opinion. having said, if there were none, there would be no effective laws etc. and where the value system is wrong, the same can occur. yeah, i don't like the name value or value system. they really are stories with some ideas in them. value system is like a pizza you would put together just based on the ingredients. but stories have protagonists, desires, context and a lot of other things that give the ideas meaning. stories based on values or value systems are usually terrible, and everybody rejects them. laws are based on rights, not values. we know what's right in a story, no matter the values. in fact, most often the villain has values, but the hero does the right thing. like the villain wants to control the world, that's his value, but the hero knows the right thing is to stop the villain. it's not a value, just the right thing to do. now you could say he fights for freedom, but it usually looks silly and the hero ends up just as bad, bullying the villain for no reason, because he has different values. or sometimes it is just his name or how he looks. like drevil, clearly is bad and needs to be stopped, even though he just minds his own business. but his name sounds wrong and we go along with it. now of course if drevil collects people for experiments, it is something else and some rights are being trampled on. values are little idols. rights aren't, although lots of people think they are values, which is problematic. user1357911 wrote: that's interesting because i'd find it to be the other way (the way i described) when psychological errors occur - i mean what gives agency (permit in the person's logic) to the idea of hotdog or ketchup changing? the hotdog is tasted but the thinking becomes skewed. there has to be a rationale for the hotdog not being pizza, if it isn't rationalized and pizza is not a strong ideal... (the error seems to occur in a different place unless its just being experienced differently by different people?) well, yes, there is a rational, like i said, you taste the hot dog and it tastes different. you can also touch the texture of the sausage and compare to the cheese, or give a quick look at both and see the different forms, one is round, the other is a thick line. you could analyze them further with instruments, like decompose in their chemical elements, check with a spectrometer for the radiations. basically you have to look at the essence of each and since they are different, they will be defined differently. or just ask the waiter for the definition. like: ""what is a hot dog?"". chances are he will tell you the truth, and knowing what a pizza is, deduce the differences and the commonalities. in black and white thinking, you only look at those two things separately, instead of together. a real definition is both positive and negative. general and species. it's basically a mistake in using categories and definitions properly. mistaking specie and genera, and vice versa. that's also why i don't like millon all that much. he takes different generas and mix them together to create subtypes, but the ingredients he takes here and take out there, it simply creates bastards that may have nothing to do with the thing itself. i approach narcissism as a genera, and i try to explain what it is, how it works, how it cooks, and what temperature and so on. looking at the ingredient is useless if you can't cook or know what a pizza is in the first place, and what it is not. that's how you get hawaiian pizzas, they do not know what they are doing. user1357911 wrote: sometimes people only understand themselves, its harder to understand different people if they think in dramatically different ways - not just different ideas on one or another thing but complete psychological differences. so people talk about them selves a lot, or from their own perspective - but then again sometimes it is self interest. true, but it comes with experience and observation. keeping boundaries intact, self introspection and so on. it's a major problem though, i agree. user1357911 wrote: last time i checked e.g. justice they had done away with prosecution and defence. a lawyer is meant to ask questions to help defend your case if you are arrested, but i came across a situation where there was no double-checking of data through defence and prosecution. yeah, it was not a criminal trial, so no adversarial thing like that. even the opposite lawyer agreed with me, but the judges were full of it. too scared to make a decision. so they lied. user1357911 wrote: but isn't the individual self-invested in the idol/ideal? (does it depend as i was thinking above what gives license to the id? - no wait i understood what you meant, the idol is a lie to yourself and a cover for your own motives. (a bit like i mentioned when i explained the example?) right, it works both ways, so it is hard to tell where the self-delusion starts or where the deliberate ends. only the individual would know. sometimes you can tell in extreme cases, but not most of the time. but you can tell it is delusional, so it does not matter. so you can call out the delusion, of the lie, it makes no difference. most of the time though, it really seems like a mesh of both. user1357911 wrote: 1polarbear wrote: well, yes, if they are true rationalizations. it's just that some people might see rationalizations everywhere so you have to be cautious with those concepts, and it's something you want to use sparingly so not to be led astray yourself. they are rabbit holes, perfect idols. if the conceptual structure is flexible or changeable. if the issues are fixed however, not so much? no, it's because it is a closed system, that's what makes them a rabbit hole. realistic systems are open systems. they take input from the outside, and depending on the input, will churn out something different. closed system always churn out the same thing no matter what happens. you know the joke about freud and the cigars? https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/08/12/just-a-cigar/ the unconscious is a closed system a rabbit hole. it's a perfect idol like i described. so in the end, it is up to freud to decide if a cigar is a cigar or not. also explains the license of the id. now was freud a con man or did he believe his stuff? impossible to tell. probably both. whatever the case may be, he was totally invested in that idol, and became it, and really you have to ask him what is a cigar and what is not, so it's his own feelings and desires. not all idols are perfect like that, so less dangerous. you need an operator in a closed system, otherwise you realize the con. a person that will switch the machine on and off. the magician behind the curtain in the wizard of oz. it's a great example of an idol run by some narcissist. the narcissist is the small dude operating the big machine, which represents grandiosity. toto is the small dog that can see behind the curtain. user1357911 wrote: well, in that you actually do it, not that you see or imagine yourself doing it (id-ego integration) things can be integrated in image only or fantasy. of course it is better in reality, but most conflicts happen just in your mind. it's what therapy does anyway right? habits are potential, they happen in the mind first and are a disposition to act readily. so there is a bunch of work that can be done just in fantasy which corrects the mind and makes doing the right thing an automation of sort. so the ego is not just in act, it is mostly in potential. that's why we have stories, they straighten the mind, if they are good ones of course. so if you get in a situation, you know how to act. user1357911 wrote: in some people who are particularly healthy, the person wants exactly what they do? there is near-seamless integration but the person has all concepts built one on top of the other in perfect integration? some people might see the person as a martyr when they value a superego decision but in fact the person has just chosen what they truly value as a person? right. i mean ideally, that's the goal to aim for, imo. if something is truly a virtue, there is no effort, so if the good thing, let's say the superego is integrated, it's not difficult to act on it, and the id is fine with it too and actually helps by giving pleasure. if doing the right thing hurts, there is lack of integration, or its too new. it's like physical training, at first it hurts, but eventually the activity gives pleasure. user1357911 wrote: sounds like a pretty broad area. i get the impression reimaging is a bit further down the line if a person has comprehension errors as it is not usually accepted immediately, or maybe sometimes changing the image is not the solution because there simply shouldn't be an image in the first place, or the person is not suffering from a disorder of image so much as one of self-image? for example if someone thinks they are being strong, and actually are, but are doing it in the wrong way in the wrong place (for example staying at work with the headache.) yes but how do you fix it? you have to tell that being strong is also taking care of yourself, having the courage to do it, and that in the end, you are more useful when healthy than just being a martyr. i see that type of reimaging in sports. it used to be that people would just endure pain for no reason, out of some sense of duty and the image of being strong. now people are reimaging it and say things like mental health is more important, and so on. the sacrifice is still lauded, but the reverse is not seen as weakness. they aren't ""errors"" to speak of, it's different stories. it works, but is a slow process, and some people may never buy into it either. user1357911 wrote: the semantic idea; cancelling an idea is like; if person a is weighed against person b usually when denial happens in a narcissistic defence i found the two concepts were completely unrelated to each other, so weighing concept a against concept b and cancelling concept b would be an aphasia of the two concepts. (concept a and b cannot be weighed, it would be like weighing sheep and apple and expecting a number in response.) ok i see. yes, it happens, because people are focused on the pineapple. at least in the narcissist defense concept, one small part can be compared, but then it is generalized to the whole. so there might be the idea that apples are good because they have vitamin c, while the sheep does not, or something of the sort. so all sheep are bad, even if they have healthy fat the apple does not have. i don't think it is aphasia, but could be. user1357911 wrote: but the superego should understand responsibility to self, and if the person is likely to break, that they need to stop, the ego is in line with the superego and the ego supports ""understanding of own needs"" in the id? - or does that technically define the id (a mature id has understanding of its own needs?) i think it is a reimagining of the superego. that is how i would see it. an id is the own need, it's all it is. so the superego would say: ""need to be strong"", the id says: ""pain"". so it's the ego's function to either reimage the superego so it is understood differently, or you have to make choices between the two. either go with one or the other and own it. basically the ego is the will in older philosophy. the superego is the intellect that can be from the outside or an internal fabrication. so when someone follows the id, what they really are doing is making a superego that is not in sync with what was learned from society. either that or they are already in sync, so then there is no difference. for most things they are relatively in sync. you might want to wear clothes because it is cold, and society says the same. or you might be hungry, and society says it is good to eat. user1357911 wrote: i thought anxiety was more ocd than ocpd where ocpd is about being overly rigid, wouldn't that be ocpd from avoidance-sensitivity and not from somewhere else (surely rigidity probably also has its varying motivators?

i find people like that usually afraid of changes, which is anxiety. user1357911 wrote: but the effects of a person's behaviour are usually seen in moral terms. for some reason i am warming to millon slightly on this one because personality subtypes are described in terms of how the person thinks. yes, because his book is a psychology book, not a psychiatric one. but what he describes are not personality disorders, they just borrow the names from them. so that's where it gets messy. the dsm borrows stuff from psychology based on some archetypes described in length in some places, it simplifies them and idealizes them. then millon comes and take those little idols and make a pizza out of them, but does not explain the pizza itself, or the original. it's best to go to the originals if you want to go that route. i mean, if you've followed what i said so far, it is itself a narcissistic ideation quite removed from reality. now, the next logical step, is you become a millon expert, and start seeing those subtypes everywhere, or try to see it, and then you stop interacting with the person itself and instead interact with the idea you have of them, and if they don't fit the pattern force them into it, thus doing damage and in the end, exploiting people. so it's a dangerous path, which is why being process oriented is better, the ideas are smaller and more amenable to change according to circumstances. it can be broken down by behavior, instead of painting the whole person with some label. since it is broken down, it is easier to find the issue and fix it, while changing the whole person, you can forget about it. so all it gives in the end is something for entertainment value, which is what you see quite a bit in expert videos on youtube about those things. ok, you see personalities, but then what? so i get what you are saying, and i agree, i just don't think millon is the right guy for it, but he might give you some ideas, it's a good book overall. it's only an introduction though, not much more. user1357911 wrote: isn't ""healthy narcissism"" a different type of functional structure, for example self-value? yes, it is what people say, or it's how it has become, but i think it is the same. there is nothing wrong having a narcissistic personality here and there. like comics, they use it to great effect. if you want to be in business, it is a must for sales, etc. again, it is this idea that people are special monsters, i simply don't buy it. and millon does not either. user1357911 wrote: well not really, they're meant to be clear for example ""does your leg hurt, where does it hurt, is the bone protruding,"" isn't even an accurate diagnosis for a broken leg. it still has to be investigated further. yes, but real doctors don't follow questionnaires. i am not saying it should be that way, but it is made that way. it's a discussion between the practitioners and the scientists. plenty of practitioners will do like you say, but in theory they are not supposed to. even with the new dsm, they were supposed to rate each trait independently and there was a revolt against it. of course the scientists want that in order to do research, while the doctors oftentimes have other priorities, and for the therapists, it is again another reality. user1357911 wrote: so the ratio of people who actually have pds on places like this may be lower than would be expected? depending on how many people have had it brought to their attention externally? some pds can be very disruptive, not just to relationships but to personal safety etc. that is what made me think more people would seek help - i've met people who have done, and there used to be a pd helpline here in the uk - i am sure people used it. well, i am not sure if it has changed. but usually, people would go for some other reason, so they aren't self-aware. they might thing there is this little thing bugging them, then it ends up being a big thing. yes, they can be disruptive, but lets say an antisocial, almost none go there for it. they get caught by the man and get diagnosed against their will. it's the case for a lot of others too. or people might go for some marital problems, job issues, etc. people with pds won't go for those reasons, because it is ego syntonic, it's their personality. nobody in their right mind go to psychiatrist to change themselves entirely, but they might go for small fixes, like any normal person. user1357911 wrote: or alternately a narcissist can avoid looking at himself to ensure he does not have to attend to his self image? oh, they attend to their self image, it is all they do. it's the true self that is in trouble. it's just they can't tell the difference because they are joined. so it looks the same as an integrated person in their own eyes, even healthier than anybody else, if they were to look at it because they are so joined. so when i say it is a problem with the true self, it would mean nothing for a narcissist, they would think they've got it already. it's why it is a delusion. user1357911 wrote: i tried to look up what he had but it came up with all sorts of different things. but when i found it a bit odd when the search engine said he had psychosis/bipolar - surely unless the guy was hearing voices in his head telling him to do it that couldn't ever be an explanation. one link said he was diagnosed with narcissism. yeah, i don't think he was hearing voices himself, but his defense mechanism are interesting, and yes, in his case, they clearly are. he is like teflon, so anytime people try to connect to him as a human being, he deflects, and then throws back the stuff at the other person. so he is a mirror to other people, and he even says so himself. that allows a complete lack of responsibility, even though in reality, everybody says he was the boss, and ordering people around. so in everybody's mind, he is the leader, while in his own mind, arguably, he is the biggest victim. in any case, he shows a lot of narcissism in that regard, plus he is clearly grandiose and shows it in a virulent manner, and then there is the antisocial element he seems to have incorporated in his self image. but he is more detached from reality than your average psychopath, and he does not even try to look sane. so i think it's more than just a personality disorder, but you could say it's there as well. that's why those diagnosis are not particularly useful, but the behavior is. user1357911 wrote: the same way violence requires the breach in conscience to commit the act, superiority requires the concept of worth - unless the individual has just ""decided that"" with very little involvement?

(we are from low social class). we had some fights along the way, most my fault, usually motivated because at these times he didn't mean much of a supply to me anymore, cause i had gf or simply was more interested in other people supply. i wrote all this just to give you a clue how my social interactions were, i had the chance over more that a decade to build a personality and a healthy social circle but all i always wanted was my supply. i ditched a lot of people, and that is obvious in the way we both meet people and he held a stronger connection to them vs the one i accomplished, to be honest my connection to these people were very artificial and not genuine (oh! that word again), or to describe better: fake. one trait of our narc ways is the ease of moving on with the ability to have zero guilt, remorse over friendships/relationships. we have talked about my shyness a lot and ways to improve, and this guy make the same exact reasoning you do. im actually considering telling him about my narc traits as we are close friends(in his perception). so let me put this in a manner you can understand, we consider social interaction a very complicated matter, in our views you nons are very disturbed and have arcane ways of socializing, its stupid. i can tell you this cause over my whole life i've been unconsciously 'playing the game' (yes, the one you say we suck and suggest we go learn and fix from ground zero if necessary) in order to get my supply, but now i know my real motives why i need to socialize and it doesn't make sense anymore unless for supply. this will not create healthy relationships as we know from experience , so (in my case) part of the shyness come from the fact that i acknowledge the non race discern us as scumbags, crazy, disturbed and so on. the other part is the fact that we need to be viewed as great and better by others or sometimes just be looked at and ear some compliments or some kind of attention, and thats not always the case. perfectlynumb22, sorry for derailing your thread, but i identify myself with the shyness traits you describe.",1162,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"how did you survive after self-awareness? thank you all. sorry for not replying earlier, yesterday i had a lot to take in. i am almost certain of my dx. why i am conflicted about it is because to me, one of my ""values"" is to be true to myself. to be authentic. learning that i don't really have a sense of self, that what i think is me is not true, is very disturbing. but my values, mannerisms and likes/dislikes are always changing. it's not that i choose to change these to cover things up as pop psychology loving nons say on the internet. it's just that i don't have a real, genuine sense of who i am. these feelings come up every so often but somehow i just repress them. learning about n parents i don't want to pass the bs to my daughter. i honestly want the best for her, what i don't have, and that's authenticity and a good state of mind and emotion. i don't think i completely lack empathy, i just believe it is deficient. it is circumstantial and most of the time i have to actively put myself in that person's position. i honestly believe that everything will turn out all right. how can it not? i will always have a roof over my head, food on my plate, a place to sleep, etc. everything will be okay for me. the most disturbing part of myself is my systemizing. evaluating everyone as potential friend or foe. who will approve of me, who will disapprove of me? my existence depends on some form of approval. maybe not full blown ""i'm a pop star millionaire"" approval although being recognized as great would be nice. if i am not perfect, how can i be a worthwhile human being? how? how? okay getting off this tangent now. i'm going to see a therapist later today. i'll let you all know how it goes. he specializes in pds, ""trauma"" and ""psychodynamic therapy"" among others. maybe others can learn from what i learn. and nmind, i read some of your older posts yesterday. good stuff. keep up the good work.",1176,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

""mitleid"" (co-suffering) i would say is the same thing as emotional contagion, it shows that some internal feelings gets triggered in you, you feel an emotion, might be overwhelmed by it. it can be caused for example by being in a bad way yourself, or by having small ego-boundaries... aprophet comes to mind and his constant idea that he was ""telepathically"" feeling other peoples feelings. it can also be caused by other people [subconsciously] trying to make you feel a certain way though, as in projective identification. ""mitgefühl"" (co-feeling) is in contrast an ability where you investigate anothers state in a more complete sense, based on knowledge and curiosity and you are not overwhelmed by ""their"" (read your own) emotions. in kleinian terms mitleid is more a part-object thing, mitgefühl is more a whole-object thing, where you realte to the person as an adult and you might feel bad for them, but you are also having enough distance to be helpful. a caricature of a contaged (?) therapist would be a therapist for example who hears your story and then starts sobbing uncontrollably. aside from being evry unprofessional it also shows that he has a very all/nothin state now and he is being overwhelmed by something that is not clearly yours and not clearly his. if that makes sense. mitgefühl is a outcome of a lessening of narcissism and strengthening or accurate mentalization capacity i feel. so maybe if you are uncertain if its emotional contagion or empathy, you could try to see how clearly your conscious/unconscious boundaries to that other person have been in that situation and how much you felt of their emotions were in you and vice versa. also if you have the required knowledge to know if he was actually suffering for example, or if that was just your idea. dx: spd",1195,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
does the false self have empathy? akuma thank you for that explanation. interesting that those words have no translation in english selfserf in my experience being moved by someone's suffer depends much on your own experience of suffer. it sort of resonates with you. for instance i witness disabled person offering seat to disabled person. probably because they know what it is. when you talk about contradictions: i think it's very present in everybody. this person is threatening for your job then you begins to know him better. i have experienced that in new jobs. i remember a colleague who welcomed me very aggressively. later we enjoyed working together for long time. sometimes contradictory feelings coexists. for me it's a little like taste. when you eat lots of tastes coexist. sometimes you even can't name them.,1196,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"does the false self have empathy? philonoe wrote: akuma thank you for that explanation. are you for real, philonoe ? there are many ways to relate to people: 1) you may quite literally feel their feelings because you experienced them, a manner of relating through reminiscence and association 2) you may mirror people's feelings to validate them without having experienced them 3) you may understand, as a logical calculation or deduction, what they are going through all of the methods above have strengths and downsides: in terms of appraising the situation accurately, in terms of responding accurately... they all require some adjusting: as someone grows healthier, they also develop an ability to mix and match. but number 1 remains, by far, the most accurate and shortest way to get through to someone's pain and motivation, because that's literally what it was designed for!! basically what akuma is saying above is that number 1 is not a valid expression of empathy. he is denigrating one of the major point of entry into relating to one another because he has, admittedly, little access to it. it's not only offensive for a majority of people, providing you see through the mumbo jumbo, but also alarmingly wrong.",1197,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"does the false self have empathy? vinistonemoss, yes i find that comment interesting. there are different themes involved in the discussion. one is the ability to ""feel"" when someone lives something. it can be related to your own experience like we said. it can be related to your own state of mind. for instance i can totally miss someone's feelings in case i'm myself preoccupied. i become very selfcentered and sort of don't see people or people's needs. what i find interesting is to relate it to boundaries. if i have no good internal boundaries i become fragile with other's feelings. some people can't listen to other's feelings because they become too involved or depressed. if i have no good external boundaries i can project own feeling on the person for instance. in both cases there are no two persons in the room. in one case i disappear. in one case they disappear. that doesn't mean that i don't feel. boundaries make possible to relate to someone. accept they exist, they have feelings, some of them i perceive or share, some of them i don't. people who are able to listen and to relate - be therapists or not - are very precious. they make dialog possible. so yes akuma's post opens interesting directions it seems to me",1198,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"does the false self have empathy? the theme itself is interesting, but that's as far as i can go. going back to self serf's post, which is supposed to be the focus, remember? so going back to self serf's original post, it sounds like self serf experienced a genuine moment, if only fleeting, of consideration or empathy for someone else. something worth celebrating more than anything. now, i don't know, in this post, where one can find a hint that this could constitute emotional contagion. in fact, self serf is being forward, explaining that, because of is unwitting current state of self-absorption (""my own suffering"", ""absorbed by that"", ""my own loss""...), they may struggle to take in people's feelings. either you possess such bad boundaries that you let anyone and anything affect you, or you stand like a fortress in regard to other people's suffering, it can't be both. with this in mind, the whole emotional contagion tirade seems bizarre. at the very best, it's a rather passive aggressive jab, taking away the focus from the original question. if you are concerned with poor boundaries, perhaps an area to investigate is how you may contribute to supporting negative or destructive behaviors? if you seek figures to enable? perhaps you could remind yourself, and i mean that in the kindest way possible, that narcissism is a drug, and that by supporting a projected image instead of the person behind, you come closer to being a figurative dealer supplying the drug than to helping them. i'm otherwise always happy to discuss the issue of boundaries, since i have extensive experience in that regard.",1199,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"does the false self have empathy? maybe this is a good moment to relate the story that triggered the discussion with my therapist that i summarized above. basically there was a series that i am watching which essentially talks about abuse and the family dynamics that come with that and the attempt of the people to get out of it. so theres this moment where one of the characters that i like very much is depressed. a girl who was in love with him for a long while has just admitted to him that she realized she really never loved him but she needed someone she can pity and who had it worse than her; and he told her that he will never love her, and never love anyone for that matter anyways. so he comes home and doesnt speak and doesnt eat. so the other main protagonist is wondering what to do when one of the younger guys comes running to her saying ""you know he is feeling down but that doesnt mean we have to, right? right? lets do something fun!"" and they both walk off to have fun outside. i was perplexed, because i couldnt react that way, i immediately feel bad when he is feeling bad, i see someone i like very much suffering and my impulse is to go after him, to not eat either, to not be able to ""do something fun"", probably i would just want to sit there in silence but if i actually went out, i would probably feel guilty all of the time. of course the problem is that if i go after him, that is not necessarily what he wants, and even if he wants it, its not necessarily what he needs ; his current situatioon is a moment in his development and might be necessary; at the very least one has to clarify and to be able to accept the result. on the other hand side, the little guy is right; theres no need to feel bad because the othe rperson is feelign bad. and just like that weird girl, i might not really act out of love, but out of pity, maybe even out of fear. this is also what incited the inspection of the difference between mitleid and mitgefühl in my session with my therapist and i think this is what triggers vini here, because really realizing another person is seperate is a pretty big step, and one that cant be gotten to by narcissistic means and which doesnt just spontaenously develop out of nowhere; realizing other people have hidden thoughts you will never know, feelings you will never have access to, that of course you cannot feel others feelings is a scary thing and not without reason this shift is called ""depressive position"" in kleinian terms. and i think in a way this relates also very well to the question of selfserf about the false self in a way. when the true self (staying with winnicott) is the untainted aliveness of the biological organism and the false self is the hindrances to that aliveness implanted by our parents. and in a way that lack of boundaries, as philonoe calls it, that necessity to be ""there"" for others is such a false self aspect. my caregivers for example brought me up in a way where it was not always clear that they were seperate, and in i learned to be constantly wary of their feelings and their states, feeling responsible for their inner world, feeling unable to just let them be and ""do something fun"" a lot of the times, i would think. and i think in a way selfserf is still in the same position. i remember ""just going away"" (both from certain people in his family and certain inner states) and having fun is something that he struggled with tremendously. its really the same theme and i fidn it much more relevant, than a short-term ""constriction"", if only to try putting it into context. dx: spd",1200,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"am i a narcissist? aspergers well narcissism has a lot of different meanings, usually boiling down to some pathology in how people see themselves or how they regulate their self-esteem. ""narcissistic disorder"" can mean any personality disorder and a ""narcissistic personality disorder"" is again a different thing, and can be described either by consulting the dsm, or by looking at psychodynamic explanations for example by otto kernberg or other authors, and describes very specific structural changes based on early experiences, and is again subclassed... so- aside from the forum rule not to diagnose people - that always complicates the situation. normally you would go to a [psychodynamic / psychoanalytic] therapist for a few probatoric sessions and there you would get a diagnostic estimation, most likely from the perspective of their school of psychology. he also would then be able to give you options and directions as to which treatments might be available and how much sense they make for you. in that context he will probably also give you an approximation of the prognosis of such treatment in your specific case, based on said diagnosis, some quick structural / neurotic assessment he has made in the talsk with you and stuff like how psychology-minded you are, your motivation and other things. that being said - without evaluating any diagnosis here - a lot of what you list seems reactive to me; specifically reactive to someone who didnt have enough opportunity to learn interacting with others and regulating his self-image in relation to others in a more healthy way, perhaps. ive also heard from someone else that theres a range of behaviors and stuff that can be similar in asd compared to some other mental disorders including pathologies in narcissism, so there again, a differential by a professional seems the best choice. last but not least, surprisingly many people seem to somehow link manipulativeness with narcissism, which isnt the case. manipulativeness / conning etc. are aspects of antisocial disorders. while there is the ""interpersonal exploitative"" point in the dsm for npd, that has more to do with an unconscious using of others or taking stuff for granted, compared to an actual goal-oriented scheming to exploit them as seen on the aspd spectrum. hope that gives some pointers. dx: spd",1208,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"mortification akuma, am not entirely sure you followed my idea and it was my fault as i did not include the quintessnce of what mortifiction is. narcissistic mortification is ""the primitive terror of self dissolution, triggered by the sudden exposure of one's sense of a defective self ... it is death by embarrassment"".[1] narcissistic mortification is a term first used by sigmund freud in his last book, moses and monotheism,[2] with respect to early injuries to the ego/self. the concept has been widely employed in ego psychology and also contributed to the roots of self psychology. when narcissistic mortification is experienced for the first time, it may be defined as a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality, or both. this produces strong emotions of terror while at the same time narcissistic libido (also known as ego-libido) or destrudo is built up.[3] narcissistic libido or ego-libido is the concentration of libido on the self. destrudo is the opposite of libido and is the impulse to destroy oneself and everything associated with oneself ‘setback’ is really a soft word for what true mortification is. it’s like being struck by death itself but from your own insides. i felt this once when i saw my first girlfriend at a party together with a girl who was the best friend of my then dumped girlfriend. it was a mixture of disbelief/denial of thw fact that these two worlds i had tried to keep completely separate had come together in a way where all parties knew of my shortcomings and really, insanity. i felt like jumping off the balcony then and there. it was like a conplete resistance to the reality i was at tthe moment. the situation i described in my initial post was really more like being close unmasking. as it pertains to that girl i referred to, she was kind enough to stil offer her acceptance and understanding (even if she in all actuality did not at all understand why i started acting odd and tried my best not to pry further i to the identity of the person and continue the conversation. it was near impossible though because it just completely enveloped my being. to discuss with her my shortcomings in previous relationships would have been just too much, hence mortification. “should i kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” camus",1215,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
"mortification interesting, i am thinking about similar topics right now. why does someone develop libido and someone else destrudo? which factors are influencing the tendencies for these two different attitudes? ps: not totally sure, but my personal idea is that mortification is a death simulation, more than a real death. the subject needs to believe it's real 'though: differently, it wouldn't work. the goal of mortification is to protect the whole person from social exclusion, and from the real death that would come from that exclusion - considered that our survival depends on others, and even more when we are children. then, if the self isn't “right” for a particular social contest, the self “kills” the self, denies to exist in order to allow the individual to survive. but who is the individual? i think that the division between “self” and “not self” is more apparent than real: it's real from a superficial pov, not so real if you consider it deeper. the self divided the self in two parts, one part becomes something different, ignoring or acting against the self; the masked self looks like a second nature, but it's basically a derivation from the self. it's like halloween, when people wear like zombies, to protect themselves from zombies. ...just my opinion. “humor is reason gone mad."" “be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”",1216,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"mortification ‘setback’ is really a soft word for what true mortification is. it’s like being struck by death itself but from your own insides. the question is is it part of an evolution, of some path you are on to getting better or not. if it is, then its a setback. theres no need to dramatize it further or drown it in hysterics, if its already in itself hard to bear. then your job is to learn to bear it over time, with your goal in mind. or to learn keeping the goal in mind and then learning to bear it later. but if you chose to have noone to bring these experiences to, noone to figure out what they are, if they maybe are not what you think they are, to help you understand them, to transform them over time into something different, then there is nothing more to say and nowhere to follow you. dx: spd",1217,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"do i have npd? [being assessed] hi. i'm currently being assessed for a range of things and i wanted to see if i could speak to people with npd to get your take/opinion on this. it's really hard trying to find any actual help or neutral info on npd out there, it's all articles by supposed empaths talking about how evil narcissism is. bleh. anyway. i've always thought i had adhd and anxiety, then when my doctor started talking about personality disorders, i did some research and thought hmm, alright. i can see how i could be a cluster b, probably bpd. however, i've been unable to shake the idea i might have npd. this is why.. i do have a very cultivated self image. i'm very aware of it and i lie to maintain it, all the time. i don't feel guilty for lying. i'm happy to lie to most people, even close friends or family. i behave in... i don't know, i don't think it's necessarily abusive ways, but then, of course i would say that. i suppose if i try to objective about it, then yes, i can see how my behaviour can be abusive. obsessive. gaslighting people. however, i think my empathy levels are higher than you'd have for a diagnosis of npd. i don't think i have abundance of empathy, but i have some. maybe less than your average person. i can be quite self centred. i'm insecure and it really bothers me if people don't like me (even if i hate them). i will be literally obsessed if i think someone is one-upping me, to the point of self destruction. i guess i do think about being powerful and successful, not i'm not that bothered, if that makes sense. i like a daydream as much as the next person but i don't seek out material stuff. if you asked me if i think i'm better than others... not necessarily. i go up and down. i think i'm unique but not necessarily better than everyone. someone who hates me recently mentioned to a friend they think i have npd and they had all this ""evidence"". it made me kinda pissed they were doing all this research on me and giving me this diagnosis. but to be fair to them it did make me think about it and i can see some of their points. but, they're also a bit messed up themselves and got a lot of wires twisted so i can't take them 100% seriously. i do like praise and admiration, sure. i guess i do seek it. and it's very much like ""woah!!"" like a rush, a hit, getting that good bit of admiration or something, and then it passes fast. so i feel like i'm always looking for that next hit and not appreciating it when good things happen. to be honest i think i'm probably going to end up with a diagnosis of bpd. but i am intrigued by the traits i have that correlate with npd symptoms because i can see it. it's just goddamn hard finding neutral/supportive stuff out there for people with npd. even if i'm not npd, i think i could benefit from it. my ego is so ridiculously sensitive and i do think it would do me good to be humbled a bit, and to feel bad when i hurt people even if i personally think they deserve it. thanks for reading! k",1219,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"do i have npd? [being assessed] diagnosis is done by a professional at the beginning of a treatment usually and it makes little sense outside of that context - actually even inside of it it looses its relevance rather quickly, as for the patient the diagnosis has little influence on the ""day-to-day"" of long-term treatment. in addition its against the ruels here to try diagnosing someone anyways. empathy is restricted in different disorders ranging from substance abuse disorder to depression and is dysfunctional in most pds. thinking one has or doesnt have a certain type of empathy is not a good indicator and without having been in therapy for a longer time i think its hard to self-assess something like this anyways. this goes fo ra lot of stuff, as one is trying to get a clear picture of something with a broken lens. dx: spd",1220,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

(all take, no give) i think you’re either overthinking this or heading off in realms of crazy for which i have no frame of reference. the business about wishing to postpone orgasm, is very reminiscent of gilles deleuze‘s notion of the underlying dynamic behind masochism. the psychosomatic pain because you’re irritated by someone touching you is not something i’ve ever even read about. my own reasoning was rather more banal. i find blowjobs a bit lacklustre (probably as the result of circumcision), i feel they’re something a lot of women do as a matter of course because it’s expected of them, i personally wouldn’t want someone’s nob in my mouth so i feel a bit bad for them and at the end of the day i like to be able to interact face to face, either verbally or through touch. frankly blowjobs always feel a bit impersonal to me and i’ll take a suitably affectionate kiss over one any day of the week, though i appreciate i am likely to be in a minority in this regard. penetrative sex itself can suffer from the same problem if approached too mechanically. my philosophy in regards to sex generally is that it should be relaxed, based in good communication and for the most part, fun. if you can’t laugh when someone’s genitalia makes an amusing flatulent sound or someone falls off the bed, to my mind, you’re doing it wrong. even messing around with blood and other weirdness, it pays not to take it too seriously. passion is something which ebbs and flows on its own, which you can ride but never force or hold on to. and good sex, first and foremost, should flow. i’m usually going to be against anything which feels too forced, scripted, mechanical or contrived which i what i was trying to get at in part with the bateman remark. what you’re describing sounds far more complex and intense, sex as a surrogate for some other kind of interpersonal dynamic or similar.",1237,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"how do you know if they stay because they love you? my first impulse would also be to talk about it. now since you seem to think he wouldnt [dare to] be honest, that doesnt seem to be an option (?). which does raise a question though, namely why you stay with him. when i look at the intro of what you wrote, you say, that he didnt treat you well initially and you turned into what you call tyrannical, so when i read that correctly you are trying to control him a lot. but why did you stay in the relationship if it was clear to you from the start that something was wrong? this might be just me, but i actually have quite a black/white view on this kidn of thing. in my opinion a relationship is quite a fragile thing and you need openness and trust for it. so if one person cant speak openly, or there is abuse or fear involved that is not only problematic, in my view one instance of that damages the whole relationship. irrepairably. so while i would second esmokes idea, i would look at it a bit differently. if you want to try staying together, and if there is an option for you to somehow pair your therapy in a way - also if you two are even open to that idea - then i would maybe look at the relationship issues more through the lense of your personal psychologies, and vice versa, in contrast to trying to repair the relationship or to regain control over it; so trying to shift the focus away from you vs me towards a more internal view of whats going on inside you from moment to moment and how it connects to your past experiences etc. but i guess if thats an option is also something that requires you to sit down and figure it out together. dx: spd",1277,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"how do you know if they stay because they love you? @akuma, many reasons from personal insecurities like fear of abandonment to more squishy reasoning like that he fits in well with my family, and i have had really happy moments with him. the problem really lies with this underlying foundation of mutual distrust. this has created from my point of view a polarity in his personality. one moment he can be utterly fantastic and the next he can be horrid. sometimes this can swing in seconds. it makes me utterly confused. i can handle someone being fully stoic or fully emotional but i don't know which one he is because it swings with very little variance. i'm not sure if the trust he broke can be fixed at this point. i don't feel as if you can look at a relationship from a day to day stand point. you need to look at it holistically. i feel that i put myself into his shoes when we fight and that he doesn't care to put himself into mine. he will apologize and then do the same thing. i asked him what sorry meant to him and he said that sorry meant that he could understand how i feel, not that sorry meant any sort of remorse or that the word itself means nothing in comparison to making amends to the person. i'm not saying that i am being treated fairly. i'm just saying that i am getting violent and it's escalating. it's not consciously intentional but more a subconscious reaction. it is an impulsive action that seems almost like an emotional defence with a physical offence to get him to feel the pain he is putting me through. he doesn't try to understand me, as an individual. he piles me into ""all woman"" and fits me into that narrative. for example, he hid a lot of things from me in the beginning... well, he still does, and in one of our mutual things that we do together in a group, i saw someone with a female name that he has always referred to as a male. so i phone him and ask him. he believes my motives are jealousy but my motive is to understand if there has been a misunderstanding and if so, why he tried to hide it from me intentionally. additionally, we clash in terms of i will outright say what i want to say and want to settle a matter. he will avoid saying anything until he acts out. he said yesterday that there are a few things that i do that we can speak with the psychologist. this is still making me feel uneasy in terms of stuff once again being hidden from me. i feel very much deceived and confused as to whether this is paranoia or not. it doesn't help that he made it out that i was paranoid when it turns out i was not as it just muddies the water. datura is asking if he acted back with violence if it would deescalate or escalate the violence. it would definitely escalate the fight. i'm not sure how much it would escalate the violence. it just depends on what the fight is about. anyway, for a number of factors we cannot be apart for now. he is also involved with business within my family so that makes it more difficult.",1282,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"persona vinistonemoss, when you say validation, do you mean for an issue you're experiencing, or acknowledgement, or...? i've noticed mine sometimes develops a different personality without me intending it to, and i don't i realize until afterwards. my mental health caseworker left me a voicemail some time back and i didn't call back, so he dropped me which meant i no longer got a small associated financial supplement. i didn't want to call him back because i acted in a manner that made him really uncomfortable and maybe feeling angry or threatened or upset. i justified it (aka to avoid feeling guilty and needing to apologize) by thinking of the number of times i've been victimized by people in positions of power in the mental health field ---- and the fact that even though i had a letter from my psychiatrist from my old city saying i needed therapy not antipsychotics shoved upon me, he wouldn't help me get it. ( after almost a year of asking, i went over his head right in front of him to my psychiatrist, and a therapist who dealt with me in group, in order for me to get into therapy which also pissed him off. ) the thing is, if i'm honest with myself, it wasn't intentional and i don't know why i did it to him. i became another person without meaning to and didn't notice until thinking about it after his voicemail. then i noticed it with my psychiatrist around the same time frame. i was still being honest, but my mannerisms all switched into an entirely different person. again, i didn't mean to become that person. then i think about my therapist which i adore, and i become very agreeable with, full of admiration and put her up on a pedestal. i have reason to admire her because she's actually very impressive, but it's not who i am in real life. to note: she's aware of who i am in real life because i talk about it; it's just weird that i become a different person in my interactions with her - almost childlike. very sweet and docile, if i'm angry and low on patience, i avoid her to make sure i don't lash out on her. it's like, instead of consciously figuring out how to act in situations that are stressful to me, i unconsciously step back into autopilot and let some other aspect of me step in and take the wheel. i'm as surprised as anyone as to which part comes out. also, when i was taking my courses i tried to act very friendly, nice, dumb myself down and clown around - which is genuinely part of who i am at times. but a huge part of me acting like that was more because i knew i didn't see eye to eye with them and i come from a completely different place than them. part of my personas are that if i come into something with a really strong personality (when i have it), people will instantly become defensive and want to try to challenge me - sometimes a whole bunch of people all at once. i don't have the desire, energy or willingness to even attempt to engage in pissing contests (i'm not smart enough on how to ""win"" at doing so anyways) so i try to enter in very passive and polite and friendly and bubbly, but i can't always be that for very long. the contrast of me switching from being really docile and agreeable to a more aggressive and intense person probably made it even worse with them. that's when there become problems for me. i really do wonder if my social retardation is because i have aspergers/high functioning autism sometimes (among my cluster ###$ of other disorders)",1301,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

(...) a more severe type of narcissistic disturbance can be found in cases where the self has developed pathological identificatory processes to such an extent that it is modeled predominantly on a pathogenic internalized object, while important aspects of the self (as relating to . such an object) have been projected onto object representations and external objects. this severer type of narcissistic pathology refers to individuals who (in their intrapsychic life of object relations and in their external life) identify with an object and love an object standing for their (present or past) self. (...) it needs to be stressed, however, that within this more pathological relation of the self identified with an object to an object identified with the self, an object relation still exists namely, a relation between self and object, both intrapsychically and in external interactions. a still severer type of narcissistic pathology is characterized by a more profound deterioration of object relations, in which the relation is no longer between self and object but between a primitive, pathological, grandiose self and the temporary projection of that same grandiose self onto objects. the relation of a pathological grandiose self to a temporarily projected pathological grandiose self is characteristic of the narcissistic personality, a specific type of character pathology representing the most severe form of pathological narcissism. ibid p265 wrote: the difference between narcissistic personality structure and borderline personality organization is that in the narcissistic personality there is an integrated, although highly pathological grandiose self, which, as i have suggested earlier, reflects a pathological condensation of some aspects of the real self (the ""specialness"" of the child reinforced by early experience), the ideal self and the ideal object (the fantasy of an ever-giving, ever-loving and accepting parent, in contrast to the child's experience in reality, a replacement of the devalued real parental object). (...) the integration of this pathological, grandiose self compensates for the lack of integration of the normal self-concept which is part of the underlying borderline personality organization: it explains the paradox of relatively good ego functioning and surface adaptation in the presence of a predominance of splitting mechanisms (...) now the distinction between what constitutes a grandiose-self proper from a ""normal"" projective mechanism is a bit unclear and i dont have time to look for a good explanation. it might suffice to say that what is pointed at is early represantations of primitive inner images that can be a bit psychosis-like / toddler-level and who are more like precursors to ""person"" and ""thing"". so in a way saying that another ""person"" is an extension is inaccurate because on that level it is exactly not a person but a conglomerate of early self and object representations that have not much to do with the other person or with personhood - which is exactly why it can lay the ground for paranoid or negativistic projections as seen in ppd or aspd f.e. just for the sake of some pseudo-completeness i would point at a book by bernard barnett called ""you ought to"" which goes into the history of the super-ego concept and which might explain parts of these things a bit more accessible than kernberg and the likes. dx: spd",1341,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"differential diagnosis narcissism psychopathy hi everyone i'm a woman and i met a man and the only thing i'm sure of is that we both are disordered. i suspect we may both be narcissists (grandiose him, covert me) but i have an alternative explanation for both of us and i have difficulties in choosing between the two. let's start with him since it seems easier, maybe i'll do another post for my own differential diagnosis later. he seems a textbook narcissist and i don't understand if he has an insecure core or a psychopathic core. please, don't question the options i'm considering because i'm not writing everything (of course i have a lot of evidence of him being very manipulative, lacking empathy, pushing boundaries and being extremely charming and unable to bond -not only with me-. i don't know if he is antisocial. i know that he changes jobs often and that he has a huge need for stimulation. i also saw a little of his carelessness amd impulsivity but i don't know the extent of it). i'm just writing a tiny sample of things that make me difficult to choose between the two options... if there is any way to differentiate the two without looking at a brain scan. i was hoping other narcissist could help, because you know how you yourself look like. -when criticized he devalues me and shifts the blame. he never loses control when doing that, he is just quick to become patronizing and to put me down while smiling. a typical answer to (unintentional/imagined -i never told him something with the intention of hurting him-) criticism would be something like ""oh, the crazy fantasies of little girls always make me laugh"". is he doing that because it works (psychopath) or because he feels threathened (narcissist)? is it a projection of bad intentions or a manipulative tactic to keep me insecure? i never catched him overtly defensive. -we were searching for another woman in order to do a threesome and we failed. he told me something like ""it's her loss""... well, if no one was interested maybe we weren't offering that good of a deal. does he believe he is a gift from god himself (unassailability of psychopaths) or was he protecting himself from the pain of failure/rejection (compensatory narcissism)? -before having sex for the first time he told me, unprompted, he was ""pretty big"". did he said that because he lacks inhibitions or because he thought this would improve his chances to have sex with me or because he needed to regulate his self esteem? -he seems fearless when considering non verbal cues. he never fidgets, he talks fast (so i would think he is not concerned with finding the right thing to say), we both have a slightly weird way to manage eye contact and it would seem like it's not natural for him to break it under pressure... is he fearless because he is (psychopath) or because he feels superior to me (narcissist)? he always puts himself in situations i find a little risky, but nothing over the top as far as i know -not that he would tell me-. -he refused some money i offered to pay for a prostitute for him (don't judge) because ""we don't pay for sex. we don't need it"". was it because paying for sex is humiliating? because he wants to be in control and if i'm the one who pays, i'm the one in control? because he thought that refusing was more fun and spectacular and pleasant? because he wants to be seen as noble? and does he want to be seen as noble to be admired, to gain my trust and loyalty or just because it's the first thing that he felt like doing and it seemed fun and why not? -he uses a lot of big words. is he trying to sound intelligent/royal or it's just that he doesn't care about rules, let alone implicit ones? i avoid big words because i'm inhibited and i care a lot about the judgment of others, so maybe he doesn't because he is the opposite. he seems to care about being elegant/proper (he refused to go with me to do some outdoor activities that can be seen as ""for poors""; he is always well groomed and takes care of his body, takes a lot of selfies... once he even told me i wasn't being elegant, but he also wanted to stop me to do what i was doing, so maybe it was instrumental)",1342,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"humiliation question it's not my business if people feel it's worth addressing things or not; my only concern is that if you ever place yourself in a position where you were to be vulnerable with a therapist, that you make sure they're not triggered by you or your behaviors (no idea if i'm repeating myself) part of the ethics that a therapist is taught, is that they need to refer clients elsewhere if they find the person triggering because it can take away their objectivity and possibly cause them to take their issues out on the person they're working with - and no one should have to experience that. it ends up being counter-productive or even damaging. sometimes their pride stops them from doing the ethical thing of referring you to someone else, whilst others aren't aware it's happening - and some, i guess, are straight ###$ up and think they're god. a few years ago i had one who was deeply triggered by me. it was like he was talking through me to someone else and putting words in my mouth that were not only degrading but literally the opposite of what i was saying. if i'd believed what he was saying, it would have been relatively injurious to my cause. it escalated to the point that i could have gotten him fired if i'd brought in a complaint (and provided people would have believed me). when he took things too far, he asked me what i'd like; i requested that he transfer me to someone else to which he did immediately... and i lived happily ever after because i got a therapist who can be intellectual rather than feelings-based and tell me about different research and allows me to ask questions like i'm in a psychology class - and give me actual things to do / ""assignments"" that i can apply to my life, rather than just talking about my feelings or what has happened the whole time - or having feedback go in one ear and out the other (everyone has different needs)",1374,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

(alas i have become a threat to others´ [emotional] safety myself but that is a nother subject. all of this also alludes to why a lot of pwnpd get sweeped up by the booze (i, and every other pwnpd i know of, sure has a tendency for it) because it brings a reduced sensory input, acting pseudo ""return-to-the-womb"". later on, he also speaks about the condition of the inability to relax (intense anxiety), which is also way too familiar. which is accute of being incapable of relinquishing control and trusting your surroundings. in my mind it speaks aptly on the narcissistic condition and found it an intriguing approach...discuss at will. “should i kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” camus",1415,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"alternatives to guilt i believe people can leverage whatever emotion they have in their toolset. guilt is perhaps the obvious one since it is associated with morality. people with bpd have plenty of guilt on hand. in this case, the challenge may be to discriminate between toxic guilt (for instance, when you keep dating someone abusive) vs helpful guilt (for instance, if you act selfishly and manipulate people into looking after you). people with npd don't deal with guilt as much (they sometimes confuse shame with guilt), but they do have plenty of shame on hand. the trick, i'm assuming, is not to runaway from it, although it's very natural to try to runaway from uncomfortable emotions. if you don't feel shame, there is always anger left. for example, people with aspd are perhaps less prone to shame than people with npd (the latter more likely to trick themselves into thinking they care), but that does not mean they don't have strong emotions. emotions are always a point of entry, but i don't believe therapy/recovery/progresses have to be an emotional process in the dramatic sense of the word. stoic people remain stoic. emotional people remain sensitive, you just don't hurt as much or anymore. so the ultimate motivator is to eliminate discomfort (guilt, shame, anger etc.), but the fact that to eliminate discomfort you might have to go through a bit of discomfort can act as a strong deterrent. guilt-trips are always wrong. emotional appeal is bad strategy if your interlocutor does not deal with emotional empathy. and moralization is only occasionally ok to draw a boundary, for example if someone is encroaching on your space of freedom or someone else's. even in this case, it is indeed never wise (not to mention brutal) to expect someone to grow a moral system out of thin air. instead, it's to signal to your interlocutor that they're hurting you and/or sucking the air out of the room, to remind them of the world outside of their own. it's purely pragmatic if you will and can, at best, elicit curiosity but the goal should never be to elicit compliance. i don't know if people who were not taught empathy can grow one at an adult age. should be possible based on the literature. but it's not something i witnessed firsthand.",1429,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"attention seeking behaviour i think it all goes back to whatever triggered the personality disorder development in the beginning. borderlines fear abandonment because they were abandoned or discarded which caused a wound. narcissist adopt a persona as a personality because they were taught theirs isn’t good enough, malignant narcissist and severe aspd seek power and control because they were abused and controlled and fear the idea of giving in to that again. same thing with attention if you weren’t shown the love or attention when you were a child you will probably seek it in other ways as an adult because you don’t know any other way. the strategy is to shake these behaviors and become more stable with your own self image and not let others determine your self-worth. easier said than done i know but it should always be the gold standard. i personally detest attention whoring in general i still can’t figure out if this is some sort of projection or if i really just don’t like it. the idea of seeking attention because mommy and daddy didn’t give you enough is sickening to me i reject the idea completely but this is just my own take of the matter. just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses",1432,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
attention seeking behaviour i detest attention whoring in other people but i know that my behaviour (especially when i was younger) was all about attention seeking. i loved to push people's buttons to get a reaction out of them. i suppose its a bit like manipulation in a way. i'd learn what buttons to push to get the results i wanted. or i'd do dangerous things. i still do it now in a way. like i love to tell people (who i know have a maternal instinct) about my dangerous bike ride to work. i did exaggerate on it as well sometimes. and i get a reaction from them. it is down n to not having parents in my life and i know it. i'm not ashamed of it but i just wanted to know if it is related to pd. england's glory,1433,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"attention seeking behaviour attention is what's seen, but it's not what causes it. healthy attention is paid as a reward for something done which has value. people are currently giving elon musk attention because he successfully made a rocket to launch people into orbit. seeking attention for its own sake is psychological masturbation. if you want to flip this around, then you have to ignore the need for attention and try to do something of worth that will give you attention as a by-product. this level of attention will be more sustainable because it will give you a reason why you're getting it. you can blame and point at others as the cause, but it makes no difference where it comes from. you need to make the change. carrying on the masturbation analogy: if you want a relationship because it means you can have sex then wanking into a sock isn't going to satisfy your general loneliness, because you've boiled down the whole process to getting your rocks off. seeking attention is the same as wanking into a sock. it boils the whole measurement process into a single act; that of being recognised, while ignoring the real reason people get recognised: for doing someone worthy of recognition. start reading to people in an old-folks home, join your local search and rescue organisation, offer to coach kids' football, write a book, grow giant sunflowers. anything that gives some solid ground for recognition. i'm not arguing; i'm explaining why i'm right.",1437,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"rejected we're herd animals, so it's relatively ingrained within us to dislike the experience of rejection because ""back in the day"" if we were cast out of our tribes, we'd die quite quickly. both shame and sadness would have made us willing to conform. some people consciously practice rejection (and shaming) to try to get people to conform, and it often works (at least in our early years or struggling times) specifically for that reason. also, it can be offensive if one is not included in something on purpose because it's relational-aggression. there are lots of reasons for ""relational-aggression"" - including to reduce competition (sexual viability or attention in general, etc.). in which case, you'd need to learn to conform well enough to not be seen as a threat (and you may never be able to do that) or you'd have to accept that's what you'll get with that person and seek the type of interactions you want elsewhere. if there are ways in your thinking and acting that play a part in the exclusion, then it's worth addressing that if it's something important to you (while keeping in mind that being left out / rejected doesn't necessarily mean you're doing anything wrong). for me, being rejected due to be relational agression (being competition, asshole-ism, etc.) could lead to anger or disgust. if done respectfully because i was unwanted, it would lead to sadness. shame usually results from people thinking it's them rather than the interactions not being a good fit. also, with exceptions obviously, my dysfunctional answer to most interpersonal issues that matter to me (or my energy levels) is to distance myself even further - even when it comes to experiencing rejection from others.",1447,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"aggression so what, if anything has helped you hone yours in? also looking at anxiety/stress, which are modulated somewhat by some of the same pathways. general discomfort and dissatisfaction feeding into that loop. i quite obviously have problems with keeping at a task (get restless quickly and need variation often). obv this adhd aspect will probably be a part of my personality for keeps but just hoping that could offset it somehow. my aspd traits have been giving me (but more-so others around me) trouble for quite a while now so am really thinking if there is a good solution here chemical wise (have tried to postpone a visit to the psychiatrist for long now but am thinking i can´t put it off forever). mainly this is due to my aversion to psychiatric drugs and their side-effects (*tips hat towards aprophet*). it was a little more than a year ago that i tried taking 5-hpt along with correlating doses of l-dopa and l-tyrosine (these agonists have to be taken together in order to not deplete receptors inequeally) but at times i really sensed that i got more boldened, which is why i don´t want to get on antidepressants (in fear that it will enhance grandiosity and make me even more obtuse toward others) found the information provided here in this following video to be quite enlightening. it´s quite a long watch but goes in depth about psychopharmacology https://youtu.be/bnw2n4xwwzc there´s also research that shows dopamine to promote paranoia in individuals prone to it (can confirm). definitely need to eliminate caffeine intake and no alcohol also. i´m already microdosing psilocybin according to the stamets protocol 5 days on (2 off) along with lion´s mane for more neurogenetic benefits and feel that it has helped me somewhat, at least as far as aggression goes. of course it does not change my underlying belief system or the emotions that feed them, which are very twisted and skewed (and psilocybin at times puts me right in touch with them, i.e by relinquishing some control) but am doing damage control more than anything. it´s been a month or so now i think and am going for another two months at least. i´ve felt for long now that am going to snap and been unmasking near random people (unintentionally) because under huge amounts of stress i tend to get dissociative. before anyone suggests, meditation i have yet to gotten back into but somewhat considering. it is said that it´s not good to meditate when your brain is in a depressed state anyway, as it only sets these pathways stronger into your brain, so really my. i don´t feel a sense of serenity/elation often. anyhow rambling ceased, what has helped any of you lot? “should i kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” camus",1486,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

[he needs to remind me somehow of his agency somehow, like he is allowing me to do something, it is he that enables me to do something that i would otherwise come up with myself anyhow.] so i have grown to detest when someone of a position of authority tries to help or een guide me because my initial reaction (schema) is to take it as a way of them controlling my actions. [yes, it´s ###$]. this also makes me agressive. then at other points, with people that have taken a liking to me initially but have kind of shrugged me ´from their circle´ i become obtuse pretty quick into the relationship. like today i wanted to ask a favour from a coworker and thought long and hard how to approach him, figured the best way would be to assertive to get him to do it but i was too engaged and it was more as like a confrontation because of my body language (like asking him is such an ordeal am already set in fight mode beforehand/expecting him to refuse, but am not aware of it in the moment) to the point where another coworker stepped in (he noticed something was up. and the situation just got awkward. since i also gain ego strength from putting others down, i have to be very wary about that and i think so highly of myself that i want to boss others around. especially those that are higher up from me (it´s a subverting authority thing). and in a workplace that stuff can get ugly fast. esmoke wrote: exercise is by far more effective than anything else, whatever is behind the aggression whether it’s mounted in anxiety, it’s energy that needs to be burned off if you are completely physically exhausted you will feel content and relaxed after and peaceful. i won’t comment on self medicating as i don’t believe in it, anti-depressants can help ease anxiety and depression but those are sort of just surface symptoms from what i understand when it comes to personality disorders but it can help but from my experience there are a lot of sides, like feeling very emotionally flat which i found hard to deal with but it was pointed out that it’s possible i was just more stabilized and not as dysregulated so take it with a grain of salt. definitely can see where that would stem from. i am flat most of the day tbh and i am often concerned that my boredom/lack of care shows too much. at points am somewhat aware that i am dissociated from my feelings and body (i´ll have mind-surges, just racing thoughts, going in circles) but can´t really do anything about it if the work is static and just involves repetitive action a lot. as for self-medicating, silocybin helps for sure but the correct dosage is vital if i´m around people because it also makes me somewhat less aware at times, like i´ll be enjoying myself a bit too much and i´ll start to drift from (either lose myself in some grandiose fantasy or just be high on my own self) and lose track of others. i think it is helping, definitely honing in the anger, like putting another filter above of my usual reactions. and i´ve felt somewhat okay with being in harmony with others, being okay with subjecting to their will and not having to always go against the grain. “should i kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” camus",1489,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

anything. they could say anytinhg but nothing that you would accept, no information that you would be capable of making anything of. yes the false self (in the case of narcissit codependant) ""supplies"" on others abusing you, like a script. its 'prime directive if you will'. you should be well familiar with the steps ive taken. at first i learned everything there is to know about the nature of the condition and developed my true self as much as i could. its difficult with an arch rival in your head. in jungian terms that would learning about the condtion would be 'shadow integration'. the narcissitic personality is full unconscious, so you have to consciously integrate it and go threw his individuation process, using dreams and reflecting upon your actions. i did that not knowing what i was doing yet, just following my intuition, nor knowing the dream representations of your aspects (afore mentioned shadow, anima, self or archetypes). jung is considered pseudoscientific by conventional psychiatry, he is known for the theory of the collective unconsicous. i bypassed conventional psychiatry alltogether, they couldnt even diagnose me correctly, but now im going to enroll in some kind of therapy following the latest narcissistic injury. about the dmt. yes, breaking threw on dmt is a cure for the condition. and the best experience you can have is by doing it on acid, it prepares you for the blastoff, by the way. the problem is as you said, the false self will never let you do that. it fears the dmt, it knows that it supplies,feeds, strenghtens the true self. it will never let you break threw, like in my example where mila angelina connected to me a second time, she said now or never, again. and the insufferable false self said ""now is not now or never, now or never was back then"". what i most regretted, it still didnt register. it will lie to you and abuse you, never learn or change. and the dream images involving the dmt were the most apparent to me, ""wank off and wet your feet"", soul sister telling me to eat food before i return, from a 3-stove chandellier, but i took no note of that . and the dream where even small ammounts supply the true self (doctors with a constant supply of fetuses), so small ammounts are good too if you dont think your ready for breaking threw into hyperspace. also meditation, the true self likes that. but the false self makes you (at least me, in comparison to my friend thats been doing it a long time and advising me) incapable of entering, sustaining the meditative state. its realy difficult to meditate normally, but is easy when i have a surge of the true self, like when o. fell in love telepathicaly. i understand that what i write might seem delusional but its the truth as best i understand it, i cant help that. i couldnt make it up even if i wanted to. so what we have left are the spiritual solutions i mentioned above and one more, being in love. when the true self is in love it is stronger than the false self. also i think the false self is vulnerable during psychotic epsides, thats its one moment of weakness, but thats yet to be verified. the true self hidden under wraps (even someone seeing the true self, like in the moment i fell in love, my jaw dropped, gives narcissistic injury) like you say, is undeveloped, too weak to function on its own. and emotional pain can cause you to ""die"". its in quotes becouse it never dies, it just becomes weak, but all the capacities that were evolved are still there, but it has to be supplied. the ways to supply it (that ive discovered) once again: self love, being surrounded by people that care about you, dmt and psylocibin (for certain, maybe other psychedelics included), being in love, meditation, and twin flames telepathy. ofc you will be challenged and denied all the way by the false self, and its realy powerfull. powerfull beyond imagination. it knew to run insuferable and discard pattern when o. even for telepathy. i hope i answered your question.",1501,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"just took a personality inventory and ... wow hello, everyone, 27 year old female here, been following this forum and many others for some time. i just took the quite extensive personality inventory for dsm-5, and apparently i meet the criteria for aspd, bpd, npd, schizotypal and avoidant personality disorders. i should get some sort of medal, lol. cbt hasn't been helpful, my therapist honestly doesn't get me and only really addresses my surface and generalized anxieties. thus far, i've refused to take anti-depressants, which were his strong recommendation, although now i am honestly swallowing my pride and reconsidering. i've perused these forums for quite some time trying to figure out if i could relate to anyone given my symptoms. it's hard for me to relate to people in real life. i'm wondering if anyone has experience dealing with symptoms that cross over into this type of huge co-morbidity. i can't tell you guys how much i'd appreciate anyone willing to share experiences either on this thread, or through private message. it's very difficult for me to open up in real life, and it would be so helpful for me to be able to open up on here to anyone dealing with similar issues. i guess i could start with asking this: how do you deal with the fact that your psychological issues consistently undermine your various capacities and potential, and make it so that it's even harder to advance in life than for those who may not be as gifted? how do you deal with simply not being able to be around people? i am married, but i honestly can't tolerate anyone other than my partner, definitely not my close family, and i have no interest in meeting others. how do you deal with the depression, the self-defeating patterns, and just feeling all around so unbelievably misunderstood?",1502,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"narcissist latent homosexuality. well, can´t give you a reference for this but the sexual aspects of a narcissist are somewhat similar to a histrionic´s tendency to seduce and use their sexuality to get attention/admiration. it also has to do with sexuality that is underdeveloped and not integrated. so in that sense it´s close to a child´s, with high opennes. that doesn´t necessarily mean they will swing both ways in most situations. in my experience, someone´s attractiveness or lack of it sometimes overrides my capacity for friendship because i feel less motivation to associate with people who i deem in some objective sense lesser than (or in my eyes). they might have attractive personality qualities but i am extremely image focused so it´s tough for me to hone it in. the opposite is true also, i getvery self-conscious about handsome men. with ex girlfriends i had extreme insecurity when someone attractive was around them but tha´s more like a comparison thing and i don´t think this has much to do with homosexuality. there might be some homoerotic aspect to some friendships but i don´t deem myself homosexual by any sense of the word. am simply not into dick. i think one would know that one a visceral level, even if some of the narcissistic construct sometimes might veer towards borderline flirting with a male. the misogyny seems to indeed be inherent to the narcissistic personality structure. definitely has its beginnings in childhood and faulty parenting on part of the mother´s side. i only knew my mother until 9 so it´s difficult to attribute any importance. but the misogyny is largely the entitlement to garner unearned attention from the opposite sex. i also attribute some of it to quite a strong conservative undercurrent (quite primitively assigned gender roles) as quite deeply held beliefs that i would much prefer not to admit to myself. always idendified with fairly libertarian beliefs (false self) but i guess that is mostly virtue signalling. “should i kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” camus",1526,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"do these traits sound bpd or casually narcissistic to you? please keep in mind that this is an older teen, so not developmentally an adult yet. - is often extremely envious of others and senses condescension and enmity where there isn’t any. has gotten to the point where it’s mentally painful to them to acknowledge others’s talents- even people who want to teach kindheartedly are seen as threats because any superior skill is seen as offensive. has avoided people helping them for years due to rage that ensues when trying. -can rarely ever feel happy for others if they achieve or have something the want themselves. -pursues vengeance, usually with extremely hurtful words and the occasional physical violence. the violence is only hindered at threat of punishment. has once lightly bitten a toddler in anger to hurt them, often gets an “endorphin rush” from punishing children and making them cry despite being taught to be kind. will use people’s insecurities against them. is quick to be on the offense if feeling slighted. -hypersensitive to criticism, but will be very callous towards others. will not acknowledge one’s own mistakes or offenses without deflecting the blame on anyone else. -tries to manipulate and argue with others to do their work, and if it fails, will guilt trip them despite knowing its not fair. -often low cognitive empathy. for example, has asked excitedly asked rape victims to recall the details of their trauma without knowing it would hurt the victim, or once whipped a sibling but got offended when reprimanded because they didn’t realize it would hurt them. often has to actually imagine someone doing to them what they do to others to feel their pain instead of it easily coming naturally. won’t often do this. -generally unempathetic, but not entirely. examples would be when a friend was suicidal, they asked the friend to text instead of talk verbally for the comfort of said teen upon the verge of suicide. when friends have trouble, friend will offer advice but little to no emotional comfort. will only deal with facts. will ignore friends and family problems entirely if they can’t solve it with a step by step process that doesn’t account for extreme emotion. regularly threatens to hurt siblings (though doesn’t act on it due to fear of punishment). will empathize with people if they suffered the same pain they did, but refuses to empathize with people who don’t have the ability to empathize at all- considers empathy a transactional thing. other examples include brushing off people’s health problems, even potentially dangerous ones as “their fault”. is annoyed when people feel heavy emotions, has been called “robotic”. enjoys taking advantage of “doormat” type people, only hindered if they can’t get away with it. -is driven by their own form of justice. they have tried to subliminally influence many people online they deemed not worthy to live into killing themselves, and is regularly aroused by others’ pain- the most extreme example is arousal from a video of murder- the teen claimed it was justice because the victim deserved it for allowing themselves to take sexually risky endeavors (the victim was pulling a stunt and got taken advantage of, ending with brain damage.) is best sexually driven by fantasies of people being forced into extreme submission/subjugation. -often black and white thinking, won’t tolerate grey areas easily except for their own benefit. -has guiltilessly shoplifted multiple times, only hindered by fear of being caught. -seemingly shallow friendships, often asocial. -often has narcissistic fantasies, often lives in their own head where they are happiest. -enjoys collecting people they find interesting but can’t emotionally connect with them much- merely wants to be entertained by them. -can often feel empathy for others but won’t act on it/lack of compassion",1528,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"do these traits sound bpd or casually narcissistic to you? i had a neighbour who has been to prison a few times, he's about 24, and sounds quite like this. a doctor got his sentence halved with an apparent diagnosis of asperger syndrome. i and others including one friend who worked with people with asd for years don't believe the diagnosis. i think he is a victim of child abuse who came to self-medicate with strong dope which has blunted him in a way that makes him seem cut off in that way that might colloquially be viewed as psychopath-like. i think this neighbour and the person you describe both illustrate how these medical terms are at best - not that this is exactly a criticism and certainly not a damning and cynical one - working models that provide a literature to assist in management of the behaviours and symptoms. i personally don't believe so much in the terms as these working models of understanding. where i live bpd is now 'emotionally unstable personality disorder' and i was tentatively diagnosed with it myself by a psychiatrist who then immediately relocated, breaking the dialogue that might have coalesced this. i don't recognise myself at any age from what you describe. having exposed myself to various 'working models' of psychological understanding for thirty years whatever it is that i have seems to be changing. i'm more stable but the stability is not positive. mostly i'm not aware of people with an autistic spectrum disorder being criminally violent. but supposing they grew up in a neighbourhood where violent crime was normal. maybe they'd model that behaviour in the same way people with asd can model usually more socially useful and acceptable behaviours. similarly a survival thing, but with unfortunate outcomes. if there is something in this then maybe my neighbour's doctor might have been hoodwinked in the same way that some of us meet people with npd who we at first think have high-functioning autism, because we want to believe they are at sea, that they've in no sense meant us the emotional harm that arises. i believe the neighbour's doctor was hoodwinked because my neighbour's parents, living on an estate here known for child abuse, incest and domestic abuse, know what led to the start of his behaviours, whether either or both of them were the perpetrators. they've been negligent with the doctor whether with a secret agreement with their son for fear of legal reprisals should child abuse come to light. do you know enough about this person to know if 'things happened'? to me it sounds like there is too little mask to be talking about narcissism or npd. it seems to me that insecurities are much better masked there with a narcissism problem. what is the drug situation, do you know? this strong laboratory-altered dope is doing serious damage which sadly only those who don't use it and therefore have no denial about it seem to be able to recognise. one friend i had a decade ago is unrecogniseable now behaviour-wise and i'm certain it's the dope. the paranoia and paranoid misunderstandings are the key sign, and i get the impression inconsistent supply of it makes for extreme anxiety that tips over into anger, like someone with a messy coffee habit. i think once the strong dope is involved a person will be unreachable for a very long time. i'm inclined to avoid people who use it altogether these days. what i've said leads away from a certainty but i think that is not a bad thing - it acknowledges the openness of the person's future.",1529,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"narcissistic brother, help! hello all! i am a bpd patient, now cured, after many years of therapy, which i still attend, nonetheless. thing is that i have an npd brother. he is not officially diagnosed because he refuses to go and see a therapist, but i have talked about him with a number of pd-therapists (including mine) and the off-the-record diagnosis is npd. let me talk about him a bit. first of all he really thinks he is perfect. a perfect person, entitled for each and every good in this world. he is the smartest one. he is the best driver. he is the best in any case. his npd traits begun when he first suffered from acne, which he still does. whenever a pimple shows up, he is full, literally full of rage. he abuses mom verbally, he bumps his fists on the doors and walls, he says that in reality he worths nothing and then, when the pimple disappears, he suddenly believes he is the most handsome man on earth. he also manipulates people and especially me into believing that he is superior - as a man, a person, personality, everything. he tries constantly to downgrade me, especially in front of others and girls. for instance, me being almost 6 ft tall and him being around maybe less than 5 7, he constnatly states how short i am and that in reality i am a ""bit"" taller than him. i am not saying that because it annoys me but just to show you his attitude. i have a lot of gray hairs in my head, although i am just 29, still, when he discovered (literally) two gray hairs on his head, he panicky said to mom ""will i become like him?"", full of disgust, as if i had syphilis lol. he cannot accept criticism at all. when i tell him something wrong he did, he retorts something wrong i did too, so yeah, like, i should shut up because who am i to criticise him, mr perfect? if i insist, he starts insulting me and verbally abusing me, full of sarcasm. he even takes my clothes without asking because ""i have too many, so why would i need this particular sweater?"" the other day we had this huge fight. i have unfortunately lent him my earphones. after an hour i really needed them cause i had to speak with my girlfriend and it is always more convenient for me using them while speaking on my mobile. i politely asked for them 5 times. then, the sixth time i asked for them he stood up more slowly than a sick turtle and intnted to go get them. so, i was like ""yeah, i don't see you going getting them, hurry, i need them"". and he literally exploded: ""you will talk better to me i am not your sclave!! okay am i clear, you a*hole?"". i was speechless but, i got angry as well and we started this huge fight, where he was gaslighting me, telling me that i was sarcastic toward him (while what i said was a humorous embellishment, obviously) and that he refuses people talking to him so badly, that i am an a*hole for talking to him like that and so on. i became very very very angry an strated trembling, begging him to leave and he was like ""no i will stay here cause i so enjoy you being so mad, i will even make you madder"" with a sarcastic smile on his lips. i cant and dont wanna remember more. just stating an example. i could use a number of examples of such a behavior but it is pointless. i don't know if all this is narcissism in the sense of a pd but, since all people have narcissistic traits, i do need your help and opinions guys. i know that most people suffering, like my bro, seek help but he refuses. he said that he wont go to a shrink because he is not crazy like me!! imagine. do you think that a good strategy would be to avoid him in any case? we live under the same roof. i can't even. thank you in advance.",1531,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"narcissistic brother, help! well the most obvious thing would be to start living on your own. if you are better and you can get an income, to look for a small apartment or maybe a flat share. that would have the most positive sides for you in any case, not only due to your family, but for your life overall. as to that brother of yours, since you arent his therapist ultimately you dont have to indulge in his crap of course and i think in a way trying to figure out a way to ""deal with him better"" is already indulging, but that might just be me. theres a book ""how to talk to a narcissist"", which could give you some ideas. another thign is, you can look at the way that he interacts as externalizing - we have some people here, too, from time to time, who show up and they dont really want help or want to get better, they need human toilets basically. they just want to take a huge dump and then they leave until their mental bellies start acting up again. so in a way he needs a container for his inner stuff and i would assume - which in a way is also the topic of aforementioned book, eventhough i am not sure this perspective is taken explicitly, the ""quality"" of interaction with an externalizer depends on your ability to be a good container - to contain his extermnalizatiosn and projections and transform them into something that he can work with. but that being said, that is a therapists job usually, it can create a sort of co-dependent dynamic very quickly if you try to do these thigns and it can backfire on your own therapeutic goals, because it will take your mind off your own stuff and force you to concentrate on someone elses. dx: spd",1532,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
"narcissistic brother, help! hey akuma. thank you very much for your reply. i just realised that there is a thread about nons, and i apologize for not having posted there. in any case, i just remembered that his whole you-will-talk-better-to-me- attitude applied to other family members too. for instance, he has this disgusting thing not flushing the toilet after taking a dump (lol- sometimes at least) and when dad once scolded him for that he was like ""i will not reply anything till you stop shouting to me!"". instead of apologizing he demanded a special behavior. oh god. my bpd is coming back in forms of impulsivness and self-cutting because of his behavior and no-one here respects that. i am that close to start cutting myself again in order to release the pressure. the bad thing is that i am still dependent on my family cause i am studying and do not have a steady income. i think its understandable that you getting stressed out. part of you might feel a bit trapped there, especially when you are being forced to have contact with people that you perceive as toxic. so frankly i think that getting aggressive and having trouble containign that is maybe normal and not necessarily a bpd thing. what i would think is though when your brother (and perhaps other family members) are needing you to contain their $#%^, too, that this becomes too much; it gets stuffed inside of you and you are trying to get / cut it out again? so i guess its a good thign you are still in therapy, maybe you can explore ways to make it easier for you or more successful for you to set clear boundaries. clarifying this to both yourself and to the ones around you that you are not their soul-trashbin or punching-bag or toilet. that brings its own challenges with it, but in the longer run its much better, it supports your own cohesion, self-respect and other things. my2c. dx: spd",1533,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"my narc husband is a vvctim of his narc dad...help! i'd like some advise, on a bit of twist regarding narcissistic abuse! i'm married to a full-on vulnerable narcissist! we were best, best friends and team roping partners for three years before we ever dated. at first i didn't want to date him because he's friendship was valuable to me and i didn't want to risk it. those three years, he appeared he was very much in love with me (i know, don't say it), he was protective, kind, helpful, a knight in shining armour and very invested in my opinion of him. when i finally said yes to dating, i fell madly in love with him and a year later we were married. it hasn't been easy, of course and he does cycles through every narc pattern to a t. again, it was a rough start but a lot of learning and educated came along to help us grow. here's the deal, we are great, amazingly happy, repectful, mature and solid 90% of the time! he does get triggered, and does the ghosting thing, and silent treatment's, but few a far in between. they're short lived (2 months is the longest, and i'll explain). what's crazy is even during his ""detach phase"", he goes back home to dad, and he stays completely faithful to me and our marriage. he knows that's the one thing i will not forgive him for. by society standards, i'm out of his league (i don't feel this way, so please don't judge), but we truly compliment all aspects of each other. i'm very strong, independant and confident, i'm happy, positive and successful. he has no self-esteem, he doesn't find value in himself, basically he thinks he's a complete failure. i believe this is why we are so strong together! i'm very good at naturally empowering him. i do believe in him, i find so much value in him as a person and i strongly appreciate everything he does for me. i keep his supply filled and with ease because they're true things i feel and show him. on the other side, and its taken a lot support and education, but i don't need him to validate his feelings for me. if he hurts me, i handle it respectfully and in a way that's attacking and i know not to ""expect"" him to understand my feelings; and we've learned to communicate this aspect very well. this was a hard thing grasp, originally, but being strong and confident, i know where he stands in our lives, our marriage and about me (trust me, i'm not being nieve or making excuses for him). he's definitely my person and i am his! we are truly awesome together! before passing judgement, he see's 2 professionals, on his own accord, to for the tools he needs in his tool box to keep our marriage in the right path. so why am i writing this? you see, my husband's narcissism isn't the problem, it's my father-in-law's narcissism that is the whole issue. his entire life mission is to destroy our marriage. he lies and manipulates my husband so bad. remember me saying that he only runs back home to his dad. the relationship between that father and son is heartbreaking. his dad does not validate him, praise him, nothing. his dad treats him like he's 12, and my husband's maturity drops to a 12 year old when they're together. my husband cherishes his father, and i don't dare say one bad word about his dad...oh no, massive trigger! my husband has grown in his life's successes since being together with me. he now has a career, instead of being grunt labor. its a fulfilling career that my husband is so proud of and works hard at it everyday. he has a nicer vehicle, credit score and saving; his competitive side and confidence with team roping is growing and he's getting more successful in this goal. this causes my husband to always blirt out things to his dad for praise and validation...like ""we had amazing sex last, i was so studly!"" or ""i roped like this, or i did this at home for my wife, etc"". his dad just responds with an ""oh ya"" or shoulder shrug. another problem is that his dad loved me at first! he was proud i had their family name, praised how truly happy his son was, how he loved that i spoiled his son, etc. then, out of no where, that switched flipped to pure hatred! so, now that there's this horrible tension between the two most valuable people in my husband's life, there's a lot of turmoil in his head. my husband started lying to me and hiding just to have beers with his dad, the more he snuck around, the more evil things his dad would put into his head about me. his dad convinced my husband i stole 21k from him? what, we share and account and there's no way to steal money, he can see everything transaction. yet, my husband believed him for a few weeks. then realized it couldn't be right, andhad accountability for that mess. then one night, my father-in-law demanded my husband divorce me and ""get that ring off my finger."" he left me the next morning! his dad has also got physically violent with me, slamming me against the wall! and my husband justified it by just standing there, almost in shock or torn? this move out and daddy justification only lasted a few weeks. what's crazy is that his dad goes through all the narc phases but to my husband and towards our marriage. i think he pulls my husband home for his own supply and manipulation. then the second my husband says wait, what i am doing, no, no, no...he gets really hurt and scared. then his dad turns it all around and tells him i'm the best thing he's ever had, don't let me go, take good care of me, how much he loves me for his son, and how could you have ever thought about leaving her...ya, ugh!! the first of this year we moved 700 miles away from our hometown, then 2 weeks in his only brother was killed in a bad wreck. firstly, this was the first and only death my husband has ever had in his family. oh man, what an emotionally challenging ride this was, he was very overwhelmed. of course, he goes home and his dad convinces my husband he has to move home because they lost their only other child and they have no children left but my husband (my husband is 45 years old), and he needs to be back in his childhood room. this was a deviant and sick move. so, my husband comes back to me, on the fight, very mean and nasty and moved back home, per his daddy's demand. he's been gone since the end of january. now, he is starting to pattern back around, because he truly can't and doesn't want to live without his wife and the lifestyle we have in common, i fulfill his life/supply! i filed for divorce once, and it scared him so bad, that's when he found help, and went to his professionals. he doesn't want any one else! so, here's another piece to my problem-puzzle. my husband is ok and understanding that he's a narc, it doesnt make him perfect, or our relationship easy, but he tries very hard to keep our balances level with me being an emotionally driven person and him not knowing how to process that people have such feelings; however, don't you dare imply his dad is a narc, has flaws, or point out things his dad does to him and us. this causes a war! is there anything i can do to end this cycle with his dad, or help my husband be aware or see the patterns there? honestly, if i decide to divorce him, at this point, it'll be 100% because of his dad and the games he inflicts on my marriage, my happiness and my life. if i divorce my husband it will destroy him! also, like right now, at this moment (per patterns), my husband is teetering between i've got to start talking to my wife, before i lose her, but he's afraid too, because what if daddy finds out, or hears me? it's crazy to me, that my high level narc husband isn't even the toxic one, his dad is! i recently ""suggested"" a plan that when my hubs has to run, since he cannot control that urge (and he'll likely always have that negative dad influence), to try and do it with maturity, no silent treatments and shorter terms. if he'd learn to skip the hate-my-wife phase, it'd shorten this to about a week. honestly, it doesn't bother me that he has to run, he decompresses and comes back with power. missing me keeps that spark and relationship good, especially for him. it also keeps reminding him that i am valuable in his life! i know, i'm probably sounding a little crazy, but we work, truly! maybe a rare couple, i hope! so any help, please, regarding his dad? *i posted this on another forum and they lit up bashing my husband for his lack of accountability with his dad, they were very brutal and mean. please don't do this, although my husband is a narc, he is aware and he tries, but he is genuinely a victim of narc abuse himself! it's a really tough triangle especially for him. he needs validation from his very emotionally and mentally abusive father and it's very toxic!! so please don't bash my husband, remember he's a victim on this spectrum! also, my.husband, through his 2 professional ladies, knows how he developed narcissism as a kid, he knows it was his dad, but like a victim, he makes excuses for his dad during that phase of his life!",1535,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"is apologising to someone with npd a bad idea? or rather, is apologising to someone with npd necessarily a bad idea? i am taking tentative steps towards repairing a 'friendship' with someone who shows the traits and behaviours of npd. i haven't jumped the gun in deciding on the viewpoint - the more i read and watched, the more ridiculous it seemed to not conclude npd was the fair term for how she is. i had very little idea two years ago when things were going wrong and i blamed myself and apologised when in retrospect i shouldn't have. i succumbed to manipulation and gaslighting, and i was silent when this woman dealt in narcissistic and otherwise obnoxious gestures. i went through the thing, that seemed at one time just something i'd hit upon, of wondering if she had high-functioning autism. i've since seen a few videos talking of npd and asd being confused. (i've read many articles and some decent books too on the subject - a lot of it is rubbish and too geared up to 'turning and running', right though that very often may be.) i couldn't consider her to be just an awful person. i still believe a small number of details about her that seem in part to explain the reason for her difference, to do with childhood. i mean, if those were lies too ten she is a psychopath, and i don't believe that. enough was said at times to show the possibility of growth. i've written a letter that tries in about two-fifths of its content to gently express what i feel i've learned. some if not many wouldn't try this. i'm partly thinking our lockdown situations might make people see our current cocoons as places of not just self-protection but change. people seem to get that in some ways. in my letter i've 'unilaterally' apologised for not understanding what was behind her behaviours. i've included a reserved but articulate apology and my reasoning is that it softens what i'm putting to her, the accusation aspect of saying she has npd, and more importantly perhaps because it is a different kind of apology to giving in to manipulation. i think. i've said alongside the apology that people do sometimes get undeserved power from being apologised to, and that they can misuse it. this is part of tentative boundary-laying. this letter i've written from scratch five times in the last nine months. i've deleted all previous versions. 'fail; fail better.' i'm thinking i will post it tomorrow. i had left a gift for her last week, a film that i believe shows i've been listening to her. i once thought i was in love with this person. i have love for her but i am satisfied with the platonic basis of it now and genuinely would not even want to risk exposing myself to more given what i now know. it could go wrong, even messily. i will give up if so - i do need to feel i've done my best for this person, who is in her mid-40s, and who i can see continuing to wreck everything for herself for twenty years if her habits keep her alive that long. i am a quiet person who showed her patience and willingness to share time and to help her with an academic matter and some practical, techy stuff. i never 'used' that, as if i was bargaining. i gave willingly and only later made any kind of muted comments about her apparent ingratitude and the one-sidedness of things, once she'd blown up and made a load of quite feral, self-contradictory, self-deceiving statements. the fifth version of the letter i'm otherwise sure of now, but i don't know whether to excise the apology or find another way of saying that i regret being at sea before, without causing antagonism through the conspicuousness of the nearness of what i'd say to an apology. i do believe i knew someone twenty-five years ago who is very similar to this more recent friend. the way the matter has gouged into my life has probably been why i'm so heavily invested in trying something for this woman, being twenty-five years older and wiser at least after a fashion. what do people think? thanks for any feedback. i hope that people here can see that i'm investing a compassionate approach, and i strongly believe in that, at least for now. i admire anyone who's accepted they have npd or that npd literature is a working model of understanding and who is tackling this, if it can be done.",1536,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"is apologising to someone with npd a bad idea? short answer: yes by only reading the title and glancing at the post. pwnpd tend to take advantage of kindness, even if they necessary see you as a good person and their saviour in some regard. they just aren´t capable of corresponding with like, at least it isn´t first nature and will feel ´wrong to them"". apologizing will show that you are willing to make yourself subservient in this relationship. remember that a pwnpd doesn´t view helping them as necessary you, but it is a form of relationship where she will feel ""less than"" because she needed help and either feels indebted to you (and deep down resents it) and in the worst case, feels like they´ve duped you so they could use you as help. if it´s a question of boundaries that have been violated, it is a bad idea. by apologizing you are moving the boundaries even closer toward her court. taking the higher road might seem to you like a noble thing but if she is really narcissistically disordered, it is a show of hands how far she is allowed to push you. so if you are actually looking for raising the bar in the relations between you two, you might try to rationally (as opposed to emotionally, we tend not to don´t speak that monkey language, rather refuse even if we understand) set boundaries as to what is acceptable to you. keep in mind though that for a narcissist, making the first move to make amends is damn near impossible. their pride doesn´t allow that. “should i kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” camus",1537,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"is apologising to someone with npd a bad idea? id010471 wrote: thank you both. i can appreciate that you might see patronage in this, and i appreciate that it could be perceived as 'devaluation' for me to attribute what happened to my friend's npd. it may well be that that is how my friend responded in her mind, which would be a great shame. isn't it also possible though, that the idea of devaluation comes from the set of responses someone with npd has evolved? that this is dissembling? i am pretty good at criticising myself, sometimes accurately, with the benefit of forcing evolution, but also neurotically. sometimes when rejected i'm at sea as to the reason, sometimes it's not truly an insult but reasonable defeat of an unnecessary infatuation and sometimes there's a neurotic component, even if that isn't the whole explanation. i do appreciate that as far as a romantic relationship goes there are things wrong with me or that are problematic that she could fairly cite or that she will have had in mind. but, more relevant the purpose of the letter, what hurt in a more lasting way, and what remains, are those experiences that occurred once we had still pursued a platonic relationship, which i wanted and which she says she did, that are echoed in the material on npd, too often and too resoundingly to ignore. i would not risk looking merely like a psychobabble addict without deliberation. once we were meeting as supposed friends, there was still a diabolical amount of obliviousness, rudeness (to waiters, taxi drivers and myself) that for some time i just did not understand, or refused to see for what it was well enough to question myself about it. i was actually a bit surprised by the onesidedness of my perception, too and a bit scared of your reaction to it, which is weird but normal for me if i ""disagree"" with people on the forum. for me this also indicates though that - as cliché as this is lol - you reminded me of my caregivers. especially my mom has had a habit of being very convinced she is interested in me, and has - now that i aborted contact with my family - started writing letters and emails in which she is pathologizing and infantilizing me, but in the tonal content of ""i am there for you""... which for her probably makes her feel better after such projection. i see this in your post. in addition to that such reaction is almost a bit automatic, as after many years of the forum, the usual suspect coming [erroneously] to the npd forum asking for assistance with relationships is not necessarily of high insight and good mental health and to be frank a waste of time. akuma, do you believe that it is only selfishness behind my motivations? if i say that i had hoped to at least try to plant a seed, for this woman's potential benefit, do you not believe that at all? i dont think i have such positive perception of humans, no. i have an aquaintance for example who is a typical externalizer. its always the other peoples fault. ive been for 20 (sic) years trying basically every method in every book to get him to do that less. and i mean hes very extreme about this. hes a diabetic, too. so situations arise where he goes in under-sugar-mode and i tell him he should maybe test his sugar and eat something and he will wonder if he should call an ambulance for me because i am ""having problems"", refusing to eat somethign until he can barely walk etc. but i've also realized that all this helpfulness from my part is also an inability to accept him; or more specifically a deep wish for someone to be clsoe to me perhaps who ""fits much better"" with an additional fear of lookin for someone who might actually fit better. not saying this might be your motivation, too, just putting this on the table as an option. also because in my experience really, trying to ""help"" people can be not only motivated by stuff we fail to realize for a long time, but also completely useless. akuma, is it possible that you identify with this woman and that therefore your response is like hers may have been, perhaps tellingly? is there not something you can consider in this? that your view of how i've seen this is a defence that you could benefit from deconstructing? i feel this is possible, but i am at the listening stage, i've listened to you and am happy to listen more. your tag refers to npd in a way that suggests you accept the diagnosis - but do you still experience conflict between what led you to that and the discomfort and criticism of it? guess i answered this one already. its both i identify with both parts of you and that woman. and i guess you thought this necessary and a good thing to do. i still dont share that opinion though. dx: spd",1539,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"is apologising to someone with npd a bad idea? thanks. i am glad i haven't made things worse by continuing and i do regard these exchanges as some kind of success. i have some upset at the idea that my friend may have reacted in the way you suggest, though i'd anticipated the possibility - this is no criticism of you of course but a case of facing facts or strong possibilities. by chance i had found myself in another online exchange yesterday that fed into this. this woman has probably had a lot of male attention though this is not as a result of anything purely superficial. i think things have gone awry in relationships a lot whether it's down to the men's behaviour or hers or a likely fatal mix. we chatted briefly and regularly for two years before any meet-up - she is a waitress (downsized from a more academically informed career) and on facebook when i intermittently had an account. (i do need to make her not quite recogniseable here, just in case.) i think she probably expected the worst of my intentions, and that prior experience attuned her for that. i haven't been able to defeat that. in the time i've known her she has been around brutish men including someone who threatened a disabled neighbour of mine. i think this is a case of her fearing less the 'devil she knows' than what she imagines must be lurking behind my quiet attentiveness. i have been near to cutting ties with my own families for various very legitimate reasons. i don't know where you are but in my country there have been policies in the last decade that have messed things up very impractically and dangerously for many people and my parents voted for this while seeing the condition those policies had left me in. they seem to have achieved a slight understanding of this all too late and i've seen signs of something like guilt or a wish to make amends. it's a very odd thing having been treated violently or with verbal abuse as a child, to develop a mental health situation and then hear unguarded expressions of approval of these policies and politicians, whether it's malice, passive-aggressivity or extreme naivety. i can't quite say stupidity. i have a very specific conception of what love is and have seldom seen anything like it in others but i do feel that this couple in there mid-to-late 70s have some kind of not overly shallow feeling for me. they can forget having me as deep in the family as my siblings ever again and it's possible a new experience could wreck things for good. i would think you know best what is working for you but i suppose i'd also hope that you can stay open to accepting signs of concern even if it is a clumsy mess peppered with their unresolved issues. i don't know you but i honestly had an amount of tear brimming in my eyes reading your second response and i do personally believe we as a species can have a capacity that is an irreducible fraternal feeling that is awareness of others, of others' stories, and though agnostic i have experienced something fair to call boundlessness that feeds this true awareness of others that seems on the face of it to be just a name and some words. (are your parents overbearing, moralising types or just crassly insensitive and oblivious? in the latter case, though i suppose my parents have gone from the former to the latter with age, the latter seems something towards which it's easier to bear and tamp down the exasperation.) so, based on that, best wishes to you. if there are developments that might be of mutual interest in discussion i will post again here but will continue to read the forum in the meantime. i emphasise also to selfserf if they're reading that i read both replies attentively, finding - i suppose because there was less concordance and some resultant anxiety - more immediate questions to bounce off of akuma's comments at that point. certainly the last two sentences of your post remain in my mind. thanks.",1540,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"is apologising to someone with npd a bad idea? i am likely on the spectrum, so i apologize in advance if my answer is straight up—whether you are narcissistic or not. i believe the question you are asking is in itself a fallacy. apologizing is the expression of regret over one’s own actions, meant to let someone know you didn’t mean to cause them hurt or prejudice. as such, it should not be based on who the other person is or how you feel about the other person—it should be based on whether you sincerely believe you have done something you regret doing that might have caused the other person hurt or prejudice. it should be based on your conscience. it sounds to me rather like your real question is whether it is okay to try to manipulate the person to get the relationship to go where you want it to—just because you believe that person to be a narcissist. that actually sounds like something a narcissist would do... the answer is no. it is not okay to manipulate a person in order for your relationship with them to go where you want it to, independent of whether they are a narcissist or not. when a relationship gets to the point where you feel the urge to manipulate, it’s time to question the existence of that relationship. if that person actually is a narcissist, that doesn’t make it any more fair game. saying they deserve it because they are narcissistic is also a fallacy. narcissists don’t choose to be that way, and they are mostly not even aware of the damage they do because they can’t see themselves for who they are. saying that a narcissist deserves to be manipulated back is like saying that a handicapped person, an amputee or a person with a chronic disease deserves to be treated worse than the rest of us. narcissists are people too, and trust me, they suffer more than enough, precisely what their narcissistic ways are meant to be the painkiller for. if you send her that letter, there are two likely outcomes: it will have absolutely no effect and she will only laugh at it, or you will have declared war on a narcissist, and you really should know better than that. you can’t win with a narcissist. sounds like it’s time to let go for good.",1542,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"is this a narcissistic personality disordered person? hi, i am constantly being told that i call ""everyone"" a narcissist, however, in my experience, i now encounter so many people i believe it is very common, my own mother definitely being one unfortunately. i have just walked away from my gf since i believe she is one, if i describe her behavior, can anyone tell me if she indeed a narc? or the problem is with me? when we first got together, she seemed overly controlling. i had to delete all my dating profiles, i wasn't allowed to speak with my ex before her, she was not happy me having female friends, etc. etc. she would have temper tantrums over little things like me using my cuttlery wrong, but at the same time, she was constantly sending me love letters, little notes, it seemed over the top, and she seemed upset if i didn't match the amount of cards and love letters that i gave back to her. then came the first major problem; i had a female friend call me drunk one evening and i ignored it. i explained it was only a friend. as a consequence, my gf then got up in the middle of night and while i was sleeping went through all my phone messages. she then found a private discussion i had with my sister about getting money back owed from my ex (whether i should or not because it was over $1000) - it was only a discussion i had not interacted with my ex in anyway, just a private conversation with my family. this triggered my gf to go insane, and she had an explosive temper tantrum in the morning when i awoke. i then went to work and then found i was blocked by her on every form of communication when i got back to my own place. no matter how many messages i sent asking her if we could talk/resolve, or explaining that i had no feelings for my ex, she would not reply. she did not communicate in any way with me for two weeks. it was only when i had gone to hers for the third time, written a letter, and loads of flowers she finally gave in and talked to me. during the silent time she would unblock me on messaging, only to block me again minutes later, then deny she had unblocked me in the first place when i questioned it. when i had turned up to her's for the third time, she ""pretended"" she was on her way out to an important ""work"" meeting, but i knew this wasn't the case since she drove off up - what she didn't that i knew - was a dead end street. now the most recent episode. valentines night. i had sent her a card in the post, got flowers, chocolates, but unfortunately a personalised gift hadn't arrived (i explained that i was sorry about this). however on the eve, i felt like i was being interviewed. she seemed to give the impression that i was at fault because i had not talked about marriage or possibly proposed that evening (i only know her 8 months) etc. i then told her that if we were to get married etc, we need to live together first, and this requires her to get a job (she has not worked for nearly a year and i had been paying for 99% of our outings). we then got back to mine, and she had a temper tantrum saying that i had bullied her about getting a job (i had not, and had been very calm and rational about it) and said she was ""going"". this time, i did not try to stop her this time, and her temper tantrum got worse and worse while i hid under the bed sheets trying to avoid confrontation. she then repeated the same behaviour as before, blocked me on everything, ignored any messages from those channels of communication that weren't blocked. 4 days later it was my birthday, and still i heard nothing from her. the sad thing is i had got her an engagement ring, but she just didn't know. i then gave up and stopped contacting her after sending quite a few upset messages seeing as she had ruined my birthday (i had booked 2 nights in a hotel with champagne but instead spent my birthday completely alone because i had no time to make new plans). she then (2 weeks later) unblocked me from facebook. i gave her the ultimatum and said if she doesn't contact me tonight i am going for good. in response to this blocked me again! this triggered me to drive to hers, and her mum was there and handled me at the doorstep while my gf hid upstairs. her mum then told my gf to call me later, we spoke, and she apologised saying she was under a lot of stress at the moment (her mum is ill) but i said i would not tolerate such childish behaviour anymore and the damage emotionally and financially she was causing me. her mum then started screaming for help from upstairs (even though she didn't appear that ill at the doorstep), and the call ended. i am still blocked on everything and do not know what to do. i am torn because i am worried she is overburen with her mum being ill, yet she has shown to me she has deep narcissistic traits. also, i believe her mum is a narcissitic parent, pulling the strings, because her daughter is now looking after her, and she ignores me. it's like her mum doesn't want to lose her to me?

"cruelty, resilience me: seems to have emotional codependency, inverted and covert narcissist traits, and now possibly developed some sociopathic traits anyway... who can relate to this feeling? i feel like the passage of time and life can be described as a building going upwards. your earliest formative years are the base and then as you get older you build more and more levels. life hurdles can be translated as winds or other issues and you're either strong enough to withstand or you crumble. i feel like my building was structurally flawed, a flimsy internal build of planks lazily nailed together. and yet i was shielded by my spirituality and perhaps other things that kept me safe up until a point. a proper breeze wasn't just going to knock down my recent level, but knock down my entire tower. everything wasn't built properly. it was a weakness in resilience. you may not have known from talking to me, i don't seem like a weak or shy person. and yet one, proper life knock would have teared me down completely. but luckily in the knick of time i removed myself from my emotions. my spiritual path changed to machievellian and ""satanic"" ideals, i read a memoir from a diagnosed sociopath describing the invulnerable way they view and navigate the world. now i understand there is no point being sad because it accomplishes nothing, i avoid listening to songs that give ""feels"" and instead listen to dance/happy or dark/malevolent music most of the time. i was almost destroyed and it was so good, so horrid and twisting and mind-bending, and addictive... and i have this hole in me from codependency which just is pitch black and physically aches at times. and i want to be useful and used, but also i wish i could be needed (a common desire of codependents, but they seem to always be despensible). god... i wish i could be needed and belong to another... like a yandere possessive boyfriend fantasy... anyway something cruel happened to me. this isn't what almost unhinged me, and this didn't hurt me at all. maybe because i didn't actually care about my boyfriend and the relationship was so new. but... he slept with another guy and sent me pictures! and the other guy was bragging about how it's the funnest relationship he ever ruined! and i know that was just #######4 talk, cause he seemed dumb but like... in my toxic warped and emotionally invulnerable mind... it's just so delicious. that would've ruined the old me. utterly ruined. i still have pride so ""exposed"" them on facebook and i reckon i got my little revenge or justice. that was more of a necessity than anything else. but !@#@... if i could do that to someone... or be with someone who needed me. i don't know. i just, like toxic and cruel things now. can anyone relate to this?",1559,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"causes of overt/covert narcissist. first of all an aknowledgment. overt/covert are misleading labels, overness is realy a scale of outer/inner psychic energy focus. unless you understand the label as who the pwnpd is abusive towards, then outward and inward abusive differentiation makes perfect sence, but that is not widely agreed upon. so better terminilogy would be grandiose/classical vs inverted/codependant narc. causes of the condition are mostly developemental, not genetic, they stem from upbringing. if the child was not accepted as it is, with its strenghts and weaknesses, when the child aquired trauma, narcissitic primitive defenses evolve above the personality structure, designed to protect the self from further pain and trauma, so that the person may continue functioning. i might add here that these primitive defenses are not the self and are not even a personality, and those are fully unconscious. in jungian terms an unconscious complex takes over the functioning of the personality structure, stemming from the relationship to one or more parents (i'n my case was mother,oedipus complex, for inverted npd). to the latter relationship i would atribute the degree whether the child aquires inverted/grandiose strain. there is no reliable research on this that i've found, so we cant conclusively say if the precondition for narcissistic personality is that one of the parents is narcissistic, and uses shame-based introjection as a propagation mechanism.",1572,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"is he narcissist? i post this https://www.psychforums.com/relationship/topic215521.html about my ex bf some days ago but decided to move on from the matter. today i met a woman at happy hour, it turned out we dated the same guy!!! what a small world! i thought my ex only messes with women from different neigbourhoods, you know, far less likely get caught or involve in same social circle. i never run into him ever since we broke up. the conversation with this woman piqued my interest in womanizer or player's mindset( someone reponsed to my post said he is, i'm not sure what exactly is womanizer in this age, i have polyamorous friends, but they are very open and honest to all parties and people around them, it's different from this situation). she has totally different impression of him from me, he sounds like a narcissist in her description (i said it more like name calling, not in pd sense, i know nothing about pd, that's why i come here to learn), but i saw him as a clueless and insecure kid screaming for attention. in retrospect, i think i might let our relationship last longer than it should be because i was curious if he has any real personality, he always seems like an empty shell to me. i know, stupid me. but thanks to this conversation, i don't feel angry towards him anymore because it's pointless. we were dating at different universe, he played and married women speaking his love languages, and he mistook me as one of them, while i was trying to show him how to love from a different world that is completely foreign and scary to him. if you have the patience to read the gist of my side of the story with him from the other post. i see him as insecure, secretive, and socially clueless and annoying, though he was very gentle, quiet and sweet when only the two of us toegher. i did love cuddling with him and reading a book together or just playing guitar. he said he can be himself with me. we never fought, never raised voice to each other, he did walk out on me once when i confronted him, but it's not like a fight, i stated my stance very gently. he is very non-confrontal, says sorry a lot (while i'm very firm with my position and boundaries, i don't do it in a pushy way). so it doesn't sound he is a narcissist, right? the woman told me, he acted like he was king of our city, a casnova. he chased her down the street (i first asked her if he met her this way, she gasped, yes! lol). he mostly texted her and went to her neigbourhood, she never went to his, and never met his friends (i was silently shocked she didn't mind this in dating, but as we compared notes, she got a bit upset said he seemed really like you, so i stopped asking too much of their dating details). they dated a bit then she got annoyed he would flirt with other women, she started to have no string attached sex with him (why women still settle for less when they want more, and they can actually find it elsewhere easily?). he was very flamboyant, fun, and sweet, and got upset when he doesn't get what he wants. so all in all, she said he is a narcissit and hardcore player. i'm a bit puzzled by the different perceptions and different behaviors towards us. yes, the flirting and chasing women on the street pattern is always there. but when we were dating, he always called, we probably had no more than 10 texts over 4 months. i asked him if he likes texting (before revealing i hated texting), he said he doesn't text. he never acted arrogantly to me, maybe because i always took the wind out his sails whenever he did something superfical, though i did see he appeared like that in front of some people, when he talked to them, it sounds like interrogating. later when she asked him for hookups, he said he was with someone ( probably me, or with his now wife, the timeline was a bit confusing, that woman dug out the wife's instagram, we found something connecting the dot.) so she stopped contacting him. he contacted her again in august and september! that's when we broke up and just one month before he got married! i kinda feel bad telling her he got married, i hope she don't get bad hangover tomorrow. this woman certainly did a thorough dig of his romance history. she didn't know he got married though because the wife's instagram has no picture of him nor them together. she found out the wife's instagram sometimes ago where there was a picture of them together but somehow she deleted that pic around september, weird. when she showed me all the instagrams of the wife (i wish i had an account to catch this early, but then cheaters are going to be cheaters, what's the point?), i realized the wife was never just a friend all along, she must have been one of the fwb. for him, it's not lying when he said he wasn't seeing anyone, fwb is not gf; it's not lying if he omits some facts, he didn't tell me it was her he went out town in june, it was her he went to the out of town wedding with in july. clearly the wife had been infatuated with him for a long time, there were so many posts hinted her longing even though there were no pic of him. she follwed every friends (not many) of him, none of them followed her, she followed an account with his name(he doesn't use social network, probably she thought it was him initially). several posts on the same dates about her inner struggles and love when he and i were out on a date since her moving in, like ""when there is love at least a drop, there is a patient ocean"". on one post she dedicate to her brother, giving him advice on how to love a girl, she wrote: give her all of you, in bits and pieces, despite the thousands of girls you may have entertained before... i'm deeply touched by their true love! julia roberts in my best friend's wedding is nobody compared to her. i don't feel angry anymore, i have my closure. they deserve each other. i wish they stay married so he can be kept in cage. i'd like to hear real and fake narcissits opinions if he is narcissist - or if you are just a ""womanizer"" or player without pd - and what's in your mind and why do you do it instead of forming genuine loving relationship, long or short, like polyamorous or open relationship?

"as good as it gets - melvin udall (npd 101) i am not the first to make this observation but just recently rewatched the movie as i remembered liking it as a kid and to my surprise, it dawned on me how good of a portrayal jack nicholson´s character is down to perfect detail (all of nicholson´s mannerisms and expressions). it´s inherently fraught with how messed up the way of thinking is for a covert (plus most likely malignant) narcissist as opposed to neurotypicals and people capable of true empathy. whoever wrote it is a genius or perhaps jn really put himself into the character, just playing himself (as his whole life and especially recent rapport of him seems to allude to the fact that he might not be far off from being one himself) melvin udall is a mug, self-centered, misanthrope of a writer who lives a sheltered life in a world that he has complete control over. it´s over other people that he doesn´t so they are allowed only to play along if they fit the plot. he uses people only to the extent that he needs, (as extremely distanced self-objects) while he goes on in the world looking for a mother(ly) figure. when his character finds it in the form of helen hunt, her self becomes moot immediately. she becomes a prop in his life or a sort of trophy for him to adorn his already perfectly miserable life with and already in the movie there are moments where carol tries to hold melvin accountable for eroding her sense of self-worth. (she is not blind to it, but is being blinded through flattery and compliments [which melvin understands is a ticket into her life]. now this character is not without some redeemable qualities. there are moments in the movie where he seems to actually have sincere positive emotions (shortfelt) but they are mostly from a passive, receptive position and even then his mind is just overactive and keeps narrating his life so much he doesnt really experience it. it all is simply an exceptional illustration of how a narcissist is not actually living in the real world. being a professional writer of romantic novels, he takes great pride in the fact that he is capable of swooning the girl. and even though he has none of those qualities himself (probably fantasies only), as a narcissist, he still sees himself as the life of the party and the main character in everyone else´s story. he actually spends quite some time in the movie elucidating his lack of emotional understanding of life (some of the things he alludes to are the basic gist of human social interactions or rather shows what his expectations is of how people should behave but he himself is of course superior to all the typical niceties and social cues expected of people. he also often uses projection and calls others out on being a villain when in all reality, he is the one in the wrong. he has all the schemas going on his head and he knows perfectly how the world should work as he is actually going along truly living and breathing other people as props. so it is with his gay artist neighbour who he has berated since the opening scenes. his neighbour who melvin actually deplores, becomes the secondary supply for melvin to sustain his newfound relationship with a woman who is obviously struggling and is shown to be in a vulnerable position. he is alive only to the extent of all the narration going on his head, concurrently wearing a mask just as long as it is a good fit for the role he has set out for himself, mirroring and waiting for cues from others to know what his next act should be. (it´s all good as everything goes smoothly along, unless it doesnt after which he will be immediately upset by it and make others around him acutely aware of the fact that he is not pleased with how things are at that moment). he has extreme ocd (which i think quite a few members of this sub-forum do), which is almost like ´magical thinking´ tics. as if he continues on doing them, his world will keep from falling apart. he also seems to be extremely paranoid with how he is perceived by others, to a certain extent, always scanning around (also during his proud moments). alluding to the fact that he is only there experiencing them if others see it happening. he is of course rude to butlers and any others he deems lesser than him. he puts them down to gain any sort of self-esteem, which remains ever-elusive to him. i could pick any number of scenes from that movie but it just reminded me so much of how narcissists are with their (un-)significant others and the way the movie ends is actually tragic, because his character played his way into this unassuming woman´s life and he knows the right poetic things to say, even if he doesn´t truly feel them. the narcissists truly remains a mere observer in their own life. if anyone would want a an affirmation of really how sad and confined a narcissist´s life experience is, i would recommend this movie. a 10/10. also, found it hilarious that someone had written a case study on his character and prescribed prozac for the ocd as a couch psych. http://blog.udn.com/joannaliu/224925 “should i kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” camus",1579,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"struggling hello there i'm not diagnosed with npd nor have i ever seen any professional about this but i'm struggling and i'll tell you why. when i was much younger i did realise that i am narcissistic. i truly believed that i was superior, more intelligent, better looking and that i deserved more than anyone else. i treated people like $#%^ and i just could never take responsibility for any of my actions. i believed the world owed me a favour and i couldn't understand why it wasn't delivering it to me. anyway that was years ago and to be honest (until i joined pf) i didn't even know it was a mental health issue. so with this realisation about myself i decided to change. recently though i think it's reared it's ugly head and i'm thinking that what i may have become is a covert narcissist. it's like all of those traits i had when i was younger are tucked away, hidden inside me in a little bundle. i'm still arrogant but i put a funny spin on it as with all of the other traits. my struggle at the moment is that i think i'm projecting all this onto a work colleague but in my ###$ up head i'm accusing this person of doing the same to me. i can't figure out if it's me, him or even both of us who is afflicted with this. if i have npd then i have it. but i would absolutely hate to inflict this on another person. does anyone have any clue as to what to make of this or has it even happened to anyone here. thank you in advance. england's glory",1582,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"help & advice ok, this is over the last 8 years and the last 3 have been getting far worse. i must admit i always thought it was me, however in the last few weeks i have been reading up on npd and sociopaths and disorders and the npd stuff i have been reading, i just look at it and think ""thats her, she does that"" and ""thats me, the victim"", not a survivor yet as i am still with her.... so here is the gist of it and yes i am booked for counselling although im looking at the exit door as i don't think things will change..... she has suffered from childhood, abusive father, controlling, she is bullemic, then various boy friends and husbands abused her mentally and physically (apparently as i only hear this from her), she is the victim and has a lot of ex's(loads in fact) all had issues (apparently).... she has sexual issues, sex is just for gratification and she regularly will have an affair and fling or an extra boyfriend, when caught out its not her fault. se has relationship issues. she has food issues (bulimia). she has control issues and has to be in control and when the isn't you can see in her face its all going wrong and she is getting anxious. she is a pathological liar and even when caught out she says she will change and sobs forgiveness however the lies continue. she is manipulative, she is outgoing and the soul of the party, she attracts men like bees to honey, she flirts in front of me constantly, she is as jealous as hell about me and has a rage that goes with this. if it's going wrong for her she is overwhelmed and makes me feel guilty or pushes me away. she will toss me aside every six months or so and then beg to have me back like i'm on a yoyo or being flushed down the toilet constantly. she has a therapist - apparently its her therapist (like its her house, her car, her friends and her family) and we cannot see him together as its unethical as agains its her therapist - my view on this is he has no clue as to her problems (3 years now) and she lies to him like everyone else. she lies to friends and family and has a grander attitude but also plays a vulnerable part very well. she never says sorry or apologises and if she is in a corner just goes quiet, then after thought a day or so later comes back with a tiny point and magnifies this and now its all my guilt as my fault. im constantly put down in many ways and she hardly ever uses the words i love you, she says she is scared and cannot open up. she also convinced me that her infidelity is just her and i have to live with it or leave. i constantly feel like i am treading on eggshells with her. one time when in a corner and it all looked like she was going to implode she accused me of raping her when we were on holiday, which was a complete lie and threw me into turmoil as i didn't see anything like that coming. i'm not sure she is npd as i am no expert but like a say when i read up on it (2 books from amazon and a load of internet articles) all is see is 70% of what i read is her to a tee. i wrote to her and expressed everything i had been going through over the last year and she has agreed to see a joint counsellor (but not hers) however she also agreed to stop lying and hurting me and that lasted about 1 day. so i will be seeing a counsellor in the next few weeks, just needed to type this up and ask what people how know about npd think of all the above (there is a load more but thats the gist of it)....... thanks anonymous",1607,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"narcissist fluctuations in mood hi all, been posting a lot lately mainly out of wanting to understand myself and hopefully share with others. this is something about having this that's probably the thing that bothers me the most (i really mean that it's horrible). after all the years of wondering why i have mood swings now i know. people with this supposedly have mood swings related to attention/lack of attention, introspection, external life events etc. i guess this applies more to the compensatory type but could also extend to all types as well. take from online: ""alternates between feelings of emptiness and deadness and states of excitement and excess energy [forman]"" ""the average person high in the trait of narcissism, dawood and pincus argue, isn’t particularly likely to become depressed, but should depressive feelings set in, they would be experienced as plain sadness. the person high in pathological narcissism, by contrast, should be subject to feelings of a particular kind of depression “characterized by anhedonia [feeling empty and useless], feelings of worthlessness, nihilism, and boredom with life."" the penn state researchers believed that those high in pathological narcissism, with its dependence on feeling important, would show variations in mood corresponding to their perceptions of whether other people were recognizing and applauding them. these variations should occur on a bigger scale than the normal variations in mood most people feel. those high in pathological narcissism should also show greater emotional lability, or more frequent variations in positive and negative moods."" what goes up must come down and i mean that describes me to a t, most of the time shame, emptiness/lack of feeling, self-loathing (collapsing) thoughts, and sadness dominates my day, bar the short time i can okay about what's going on. sometimes i'll be smiling, next minute slightly tearful, others irritable, edgy, stoic, down on my self, resentful, depressed etc. it's not as severe as in bpd, more like a mild case of the emotion fluctuations and not as intense but it's more emotionally liable than people who have very little to no narcissism, apparently anyway, from what i now know. just how coverts will present in therapy for depression but leave as soon as the therapist validates them and sorts out there problems (which probably aren't as bad as they think inside their heads, it's easily to be down when your always absorbed in your own thinking and can't regulate that image of yourself in your head easily). what are your thoughts, and how the hell do you deal with this? bdd and vulnerable narcissism/avpd traits.

"narcissist fluctuations in mood the quote is funny, since oen of the most prominent explanations of depression is a narcissistic one, namely that you are devaluing an iedalized object and due internal repercussions you take the devaluation onto yourself. freud describes this mechanism in mourning and melancholia 90 years ago. so while on the toplevel i think the distinction is funny, there is no explanation here why there would be emptiness and so on in pwnpd. but all these thigns seem rather close together anyways, meltzers explanation of cyclothymic states for example is also about idealized objects but afair there it was about triumph over them or the lack thereof (?). in any event, mood swings as whole seem to depend mostly on unconscious splitting - which is also why they cant just be put away, because the reasons for the splitting and the inner objects its pointed at isnt usually in your consciousness. you could argue as a person prone to ego-fragmentation questions of idealization and devaluation are not really my concern. but dealing with this is i would assume done in longterm therapy, as there is no dealing with this in any other way. the mechanism always splits botht he self and the object and your ability to deal with the whole is therefore hampered. dx: spd",1610,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"what do you think of this? this is a very important article. i agree that the term narcissist is wildly overused nowadays. the fact that most studies on the prevalence of npd estimate only 0.5-1% actually have the disorder shows that the chances you are in a relationship with one aren't especially high. but, i was thinking about this the other day. wouldn't it be fair to say that the rate of npd varies dramatically between different families? for example, if there really is one narcissist in a given family, the chances are far greater that there will be other disordered individuals within that same family. as npd originates in large part from dysfunctional parenting, it would be fair to say that a dysfunctional, disordered parent would possibly produce a son or daughter who grows up with a personality disorder also and their siblings may suffer the same. then, there is the question of how much genetics play a role in the development of npd and other personality disorders? as not all children raised by disordered parents will become disordered themselves. and similarly, not all children who are abused go on to become murderers or pedophiles. it is widely accepted by psychologists/psychiatrists that it takes both nature and nurture to create individuals with pds and other pathologies. so yes, the term narcissist is way overused and the actual disorder is pretty rare (1 in 100 people at most), but the disorder and other pds probably group together at quite a high rate within particularly dysfunctional families (that's my theory anyway!). i have - high functioning autism, ocd (episodic), social anxiety and depersonalization/derealization disorder expect i may have - avoidant/schizoid personality disorder or traits",1613,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

hardly applies to me though: had bad gad in my late teens and developed an ocd/bpd type insecurity about sexual performance while sober (takes a while for some addicts to get back in the groove), and doing the freud thing, it's pretty obvious that's mostly what my ""narcissism"" is compensating for (alongside the general futility that comes with being a chronic addict). sex is fundamental to our nature, so lacking confidence means you'll lack something overall - if there's surplus energy (like bipolar-addicts tend to have), you'll eventually seem creepy. ironically, doubt it would've developed that way without initially having the other qualities my attention drifts towards, in order to make up for it. if someone seems vain or full of themselves, i interpret their vanity as a direct personal affront and attack to me and my self-esteem/self-image; i feel they are trying to make me feel inferior. i do then devalue them in my head, but it's not very effective and i tend to launch into full-out anger or even rage at how they're ""treating"" me. is that because they're effectively objectifying you? not only are they acting superior: they're disrespecting/disregarding your own virtues, by focusing on their own. you aren't getting the respect you deserve; therefore they are being disrespectful. objectively, they are being anti-social towards you. the more i think about it, the more obvious it should be, to not behave this way. i think competitiveness gets unhealthy when it results in maladaptive aggression toward the competitor. for example, if a businessman can't beat his competitor in business, he might try to blackmail him or set his factory on fire because he can't stand the idea of losing (a narcissistic injury), or simply because he's a psychopath and wants to win at any and all costs. if people react differently according to a scale between acceptable etiquette and their own insecurity, from what you're saying, much more empathy is involved in the healthier kind. i've read some of your other posts - are you a diagnosed npd?

"envy, vanity, insecurity & superiority does it always need to be about winning? i'm not describing it well, but there's a less binary middle ground between those two extremes, where stimulation/exercise have priority over narcissism. narcissism is involved, but reward-juju comes more from the de-personalised interplay (i.e. how it feels good to stretch different skillsets), such that winning isn't necessarily a factor...and distinct from the npd rubric, in that reward is proportionate to the challenger - win/lose may not even come in to it; rather it's a win/win split between exercise and better exercise. ifogg was an example of the kind of de-personalisation i mean. he's very clearly psychopathic/narcissistic, or whatever, but he relished having a challenger; and the closer to the mark a challenger got, the more he seemed to like them. talent and ability is more interesting to him than his emotions are. emotions interest me more than him, and probably care more about crossing over the line than he does. asking because dissociation increases when stoned and there isn't the person's facial feedback to remind me of their emotional state, and i tend to be insensitive as a result. bit more context: about a year ago i had a nepalese housemate who played guitar, and when he learnt i played as well, he was keen to have a jam session. at the precise moment he realised i could do things he was unable to, his whole attitude tensed up, and after a few minutes he started going on about how he wished he could play the same. children experience that sort of thing all the time, like when marble collecting re-emerged in the mid90s, but it's a hard one to meaningfully empathise with. the world isn't really solid, in that way; more of a wade through subjective dream-pools, of extremely narrow perceptual biases. reality is neural simulation through personality filter . if we comprehend how that applies to our own person, there can't be envy towards that which challenges us to stretch ourselves - rather we appreciate it (or them); without comparison, we like them more, for the pleasure of their talent. narcissism on the positive side - can't see any reason it can't have components of the negative (or that it can't slide towards the negative under influence of other variables). someone in between, for example, might lack any thoughts of superiority and enjoy other people as much as themselves - but say they're also part-schizoid, spend most of their time alone and don't connect very easily, and they've got some depression: that 'healthy-competition' drive, which is a kind of aggression, might become part-hijacked by the depression; and because the person's part-schizoid and more detached than normal people are, they drift into inappropriate-conduct territory, merely because they were abnormally selfish at the time, and their native margins happen to be wider than the norm.",1669,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"npd/did as aprophet says, i think the false self/true self dichotomy might make npd or pathological narcissism seem somewhat like did, because grandiosity is projected onto the false self and the ""host"" acts accordingly. but if that grandiosity is fragile (i.e. vulnerable narcissism) and the false self is therefore not robust, one can pendulum-swing to the other side, the deflated ""true self"", but since the true self isn't fully developed or fleshed out, it is really just an approximation of a person with no real sense of worth, identity, or self-esteem. at least, that's how it plays out for me, but i apparently have more identity issues than most with pure npd (i also have borderline traits). i do feel like i have two different ""personalities."" one is ""everything-is-great-and-everyone-loves-me covertunsure"" and the other is ""i hate everyone and everything and myself covertunsure."" maybe jekyll and hyde is more accurate. the shift into the latter is precipitated by a perceived rejection, slight, or narcissistic injury. but my default state these days is the latter. perhaps it's a safety net to avoid further disappointment. the most frustrating part of vulnerable narcissism/borderline disorders is the inability to self-soothe and having nothing to fall back on. there is simply no true self-esteem, so in effect your personality is dictated by those around you and you are at their mercy, which just makes everything all the more unbearable. akuma wrote: jebby0209 wrote: just wondering if there's anyone here that has had a series of events and evidence come forward that they don't remember doing it thinking about (even sexual). i've had so many things come to light that i'm thinking i have did. is it possible to be completely confused as to how you could have possibly thought that way or done something so horrible and completely not remember any part of it? is this the time to make a joke about not abusing alcohol? jokes aside though the anxiety you have about it isnt typical for did nor npd. if you feel you are getting unstabel though it is best to see a professional about it. couldn't jebby's ""anxiety"" be a masked form of shame? i think shame and anxiety go hand in hand. if shame is the reaction, e.g. ""i'm not good enough/i did something that risks me being rejected from the social group,"" anxiety might be a natural subsequent sequelae: ""i need to do something to remedy this."" are you then saying npd doesn't involve significant amounts of shame?",1674,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"destructive label sorry selfserf i have no idea what you were trying to say. i'm just going to ramble a bit, maybe i hit some contact-point somewhere. the true self/false self dichotomy is ultimately about how true you are to your impulses, needs and desires - i've probably said this in the past already, it was ""invented"" by donald winnicott to describe alienation from children from their aliveness by the rules and limitations set by their parents. its not used a lot in the context of npd, so i never know what to make of it when it appears here on the forum, especially since it doesn't have a lot of concretely descriptive value when people use it, since its too abstract. if such a thing exists in ""spirituality"" depends a lot on what branch you are looking at. if you are looking at advaita-vedanta of course you will find the atma-brahma nonduality and this ideas about some sort of primordial consciousness with everything else being maya or the play of ishvara... its a hard philosophical problem for the adherents of that school to show how such nonduality would be possible and how you can realize it if its nondual though. in buddhism in comparison no such thing as a true self exists at all (anatman doctrine) and enlightenment to a large degree realizing this, thereby destroying the 12 links of dependent arising by uprooting avidya (believing there is a true self). i think its important to make a clear distinction between these concepts, as they are not only different philosophical entities but ""working"" with them also is pretty different and has different goals and implications. as to demonic possession... its hard for me to see what you are getting at. if you hear voices after waking up it could be hypnopompic hallucinations. but if you experience your own minds contents as objects (read out there) more often, that per definition is in the psychotic range. but interpreting experience of course is also done on the basis of beliefs. having grown up in a very fundamentalist {the apocalypse comes soon] christian sect, i can understand that deconnecting yourself from childish ideas about demons might be a problem, even when you are not having some schizophrenia spectrum illness. but it can also just be a way to delegate responsibility for your well-being or for the multi-facetted nature of your mind to some ""evil beings"" so you dont have to deal with that, or so you dont feel guilty. dx: spd",1683,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

(again, there is no doubt that my beliefs growing up probably had something to do with it). sadly, of course after recovering from it, i still was somewhat dumbfounded and was back to my old self. the ways of interacting with the world did not change in the very least (being all i know, essentially). but that hour or two there was a regression to that age i emotionally froze at. that emotional age (which bioenergitcally occupies only a tiny portion in my chest) i designated as the true self. which, obviously as you elucidated, is not the correct designation. “should i kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” camus",1684,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"destructive label the way i understand it is it’s simply a denial of your true self, your true feelings, emotions, and needs. as they were taught at a young age that they were inappropriate or not up to standard so the child buries these feelings and desires deep down along with their needs and feelings that most people have to guide them. instead they learn to create an image of what people want to see, they want to be accepted and feel like they are good but at the expense of their own emotional and ‘spiritual’ health as their true needs and desires are not being heard. i was punished for dancing when i was young, it was seen as foolish so i was humiliated by putting me on display outside like a monkey to perform for strangers while i was being observed to make sure i did it the same. i still to this day cannot dance in public. i never made this connection except recently through therapy. so something i was so free and open with is now a buried fear, that i hide from everyone except you nice people. anyway that’s what it means to me, people are so different that it’s truelly individual",1685,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"emotion, intimacy and personality basically how progress with this goes is, i apply a cue sequence, and then maintain it - and it ultimately yields some kind of personal change in myself. and then i determine whether i like that change or no. most recently - i had used the sequence "" force union, incite love "". began to really, really really really - ridiculously not like it. ""forcing"" a ""union"" is just - creepy, quite frankly. doesn't resonate well. so it leaves me kind of stumped. i have the 5 cues with wave relevance, there's no more - just these five. there's other cues but, they don't embody wave relevance so, don't yield any effect. plus, i had a contention that ""jealousy"" would be a naturally occurring external phenomenon, but, i didn't really feel it coming on just of its own accord. that is, without conscious implementation, it just felt lacking. so, with the cues i have - how could i form a sequence? i can't ""jealousy"" a ""union"", or ""jealousy"" ""love"", can i? makes no sense. the implementers were ""force"" and ""incite"". but we're x'ing off ""force"" cause, it compromises the hypothetical non-impositional state of our personality. that is - we want male to female equality. males are big imposing brutes. females are non-impositional, non-confrontational etc and the natural flow is that females get the choice, selective control in the realm of sexuality. to equalize this - we must preclude the impositional element from our personalities as males - but without turning into spineless, emotionless nancies, incapable of getting females excited, basically. so i went into a deep state of thought. and what i deduced was that - perhaps there is such thing as, ""jealous union"". slightly augmented the cue, or rather - stripping it down - from jealous y to just jealous. ""jealous"" as a cue has the most emotional potency by far, thus it must be placed first in the sequence. ""love"" is more intimate that ""union"", so it must be placed after ""union"" in the order. in addition i feel ""love"" is like, a culminating application. can't really flow-through-it, as such. ""union"", definitely feels more flow-through, so we can place it mid-sequence, as a means to transition to something subsequent. ""jealous union, incite love"". https://i.imgur.com/r8c1qu9.jpg thus - i'm not really imposing a union - i'm just ensuring if a union comes to fruition, it's not doing so via imposition. it would happen i guess, via jealousy. not something i'm imposing - but basically i'm ensuring that union would be the product of jealousy - via this cue setup. as in, being ""jealous"" could be considered a state of wanting something you don't have, or can't have, which exacerbates how much you want it, and with that ""yearning"" - per se - we can bring the individual forth toward a ""union"" - and from there further down the intimacy chain, etc. does that chain of logic make sense to anyone else? cause it's relatively a recent deduction and really only beginning to make sense to myself.",1697,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"emotion, intimacy and personality at this point i must also reiterate my opinion that, communication does occur via perception of personality and appearance etc - yes; but at least equally in terms of ""waves"" - sensing each others wave patterns and emission. waves waves waves. can sense it almost in terms of a ""pulse"" - certainly when the emotion runs strong. a strong cumulative depolarization of the nervous system in some capacity. what's peculiar is, of course nerve regulation throughout the body stems from the central nervous system, which governs nerve activity through other areas. with the strong emotional depolarization, that pulse - what i get myself is, it almost seems to resonate most acutely through the mid-thoracic cavity; i.e. through the heart. obviously the heart being composed of an array of concentrated musculoskeletal nerve fibres, so we actually physically feel the nerve activity. i guess that's why historically sayings regarding emotion and love, they use the ""heart"" as a reference. ""broke my heart"" - etc etc. that emotional depolarization simply seems to be felt most acutely through that region. gut-brain axis also, like when you're at the discotheque and some really cute chick you were gonna hit on starts making out with some other guy right in front of you. this is exclusively emotional, but it actually feels like someone has kicked you in the stomach. so currently some investigators are focusing on gut microbiome as next-gen mental illness treatment, understanding the brain-gut connection. bottom line is, outwardly we've historically characterized our wave structure as our ""personality"", but i would say it's more accurately characterized as what it is. it's our wave structure.",1698,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"can someone with npd form deep bonds? ... this smell concern troll-y, but i'll bite regardless. maybe being measured in my response will change someone's mind somewhere, at least. can someone with npd miss someone? ... well, yes? my disorder started manifesting flagrantly as a result of traumatic grief. not to mention part of the disorder is wanting whatever may be on the horizon, to be the outward ideal of a perfect person who has it all together. in order to be reaffirmed of my value, even if it is part of a facade, i still have to have base social needs. this logically results in being able to become attached to others and desire their presences. can someone with npd love and form deep bonds? yes? what are you reading to believe otherwise? empathy =/= love, affection, or compassion. it's simply empathy. i don't really get close to people often, since people tend to disappoint me, but once i get past the initial stage of awkwardly gauging whether or not i want to bother my relationships are fairly normal with regards to establishing and building trust. can someone with npd admit their wrongs and can they ever understand how their actions might have affected someone? i can admit my wrongs. sometimes. it's begrudging and the person prompting it has to have me emotionally invested in them in some way. if i respect someone, i'll cop to it. if i love someone, i'll cop to it. if you're someone i barely know and i already barely want to interact with you? i'll weigh the cost of saying ""i don't really care."" as for understanding how my actions affect others, this depends on your definition of understanding. i can logically work out why what i did was inappropriate and seek to curb behaviors like that in the future if need be but i won't feel any empathetic pangs. are narcissistic abusers abusive because they are narcissistic or are they narcissistic and abusive? narcissistic and abusive. two different ballgames. again, i can logically grasp the consequences of my behavior if i'm forced to stop and think about it, or if i see i've accidentally hurt someone by being careless. my heartstrings won't be pulled in the way most people experience it but often i still feel remorse in that i have failed to be the ""perfect person"" by visibly failing others. i want to be better for others in order to prove to myself internally that i have tangible worth. my long-term partner has been baffled by my odd reactions to things, sure, but all my empathetic blindness has meant consequentially is that i need to check in more frequently to see if i've done anything wrong. can someone with npd ever change and be a bit more empathic, considerate, open to talk about emotions? again: you can logically be considerate as that's a part of the unwritten social contract of pretty much just interacting with anyone at all ever. maybe i'll brush people off or push ahead of someone in the cafeteria, but when it comes to my close relationships i've learned to ease up a bit and not be too pushy. can someone with npd remain faithful? my last relationship ended because they were the one who had cheated on me. again, i don't really care to form too many meaningful connections since my own unrealistic standards cause me to view very few people without a very obtrusive amount of contempt standing in my way of wanting to associate with them. even if i flit about in terms of networking, i only have a few people i actually let get close to me. i don't respect the people i work with. it's especially tough to find something meaningful since any prospective friendship also has to be patient enough to let me know when i've done something thoughtless, rather than assuming i do things with chessmaster-like intent.",1721,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"fantasies & other possible narcissistic traits when alone, i fantasize success about anything and everything. if i'm listening to a good song i'll picture myself performing it on stage and doing it better than anyone's ever done it. especially when watching movies - i put myself in the movie and how i'd do things better or be more successful than the main character. i also fantasize a lot about serial killing or just generally going around causing havoc and destruction. the latter fantasy was especially strong in jail. my fantasies involve having fame/infamy, power, and/or success. nothing to do with being seen in a good light or as good - just different and special. these fantasies are in the moment and thinking about them in my head satisfies the desire and makes me feel like i accomplished something. moving on, wherever i am, i have a need to come off as different from everyone else around me. this manifests as ""having"" different opinions than others and being antagonistic to other's views just for the sake of debating and have no problem effectively arguing both sides of any discussion and winning(at least in my head i always win). i'll openly disrespect authority if everyone else is a follower or the reverse, speak good on an ""enemy"" of the group. i'll also alter personality traits like in jail developing a more formal, thoughtful persona to separate me from the more brash, loud, and low intelligence criminals. or the opposite, behaving more like a fun jerk while in a group of polite people. whatever happens, i need to win. i place personal power above everything else; especially in interpersonal relationships. i use calculated aggression to make sure i get my way or at least change the terms so i get some level of control and yeah that's still a win. not always possible to control a situation but if i can't then oh well move on. having a person escape my metaphorical chains is one of the few ways to anger me. when that happens of course i work on getting that back into my hypnosis. though while losing something important to me will cause a flash of anger i never let emotions show because losing control is weakness, much less chase after the object. as such i come off as a rock and described as methodical. in jail fellow inmates called me a serial killer because according to them i was too calm all the time and had no feelings or emotions and that i looked like one day i would snap and beat someone to death. i certaintly do, i just don't behave like i do, because of my level of control. closest i'll be seen behaving emotionally is when i use anger to make a point or get something. i've been consistently described as every narcissistic word out there. arrogant, grandiose, egotistical, etc. i will say in my core i've always viewed myself as superior - but it doesn't manifest overtly as haughty, cocky behavior nor blindly thinking i can do anything. from my readings npd worry about other's perceptions and feel a lot of emotions i don't. i also don't seek validation the way a typical narcissist seems to. i don't like being complimented or people being kind or touchy with me. it's annoying. i don't like people getting too clingy, following me around, or looking up to me as a superior. people who try to kiss my ass are weak. so, i don't particularly chase admiration, attention, unless i'm bored but not to regulate ego. i get my kicks and gratification from controlling people actions, perceptions, and emotions. i regularly ask people to do increasingly bigger favors because i like to push boundaries. that was quite a bit of info. those with good knowledge on the core of npd, do i seem to fit in your opinions? p.s: i've been dx'ed with aspd on several occasions and never has a clinician mentioned narcissism other than one mentioning grandiosity. i don't fake it. i just make it.",1730,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"respect, narc’y defenses and triggers i get pissed off real easy and get over it real quick. the thing is i can never remember what my anger is like. i have this really short memory for emotion it seems. i think it's because any emotion i feel at times is fleeting. it's there and it's gone again. a psychologist asked me once to explain certain emotions to her and i couldn't. how the f** do you explain something you hardly feel. anger is probably the deepest emotion i experience but it's also shallow. i could be having an aggressive argument with one person online and having a pleasant conversation with another at the same time and neither would be aware of the other. one thing that triggers my anger is being disrespected, but that depends on the circumstance. you could insult me to my face one day and i wouldn't give a s***. do it another day and i'll want to rip your head off. another thing that triggers it is noise, certain noises that other people seem to be able to tolerate more, like someone mowing the lawn more often than expected. one of my neighbors used to mow his lawn a lot. i wanted to go out and put a f****** bullet in his head. i rarely express rage, but i think i must feel it a lot when angry because my first thoughts are usually always violent ones. it's funny, i can be calm as day in the middle of a severe storm (and i should know. i've lived through three of them) and yet i'll lose it over a pebble in my shoe. sometimes it's the small things that bring out the beast in me. last edited by realityhere on wed nov 27, 2019 4:32 pm, edited 2 times in total. reason: swear filter evasion not permitted.",1747,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
"respect, narc’y defenses and triggers @zero i can relate to much of that. i have times when i'm less able to deal with keeping a lid on things. it started when i was a kid and i used to tell my parents that it felt like burning. i never really understood it, as it would come out of nowhere and i'd end up going feral. it still happens now, although not with the same ferocity. i think it's calmed down for a number of reasons. i think age has an effect, as you've mentioned. i'm not sure if this is due to physiological things like testosterone, as when i get aggressive i do so in the same manner as i used to. but i think there's an acceptance and a recognition of what's happening, and the awareness takes some of the power out of it. having a wife who understands, to an extent, what's going on inside my head without judgement helps too. i think a lot of the problem is restriction. good behaviour and following other people's guidelines creates a powder-keg of pressure which, at some point, is going to go boom. now, when i'm heading there, she'll often notice before i become consciously aware of it, because i start becoming more distant and my language towards her is more detached. she'll then say, ""go out and shoot something; i've cancelled our plans to go out with friends tonight."" weed helps too. regarding confrontation. i'm very confrontational with pretty much everything, and if i get into a situation i'll push the other person hard to make a move and then all systems go, but usually people back down. i was driving through a local town and this guy was driving right up my arse, so i stopped the car in the middle of the street and got out, stood in front of his car and started shouting at him, what the ###$ he thought he was doing. i told him to get out of his car because i couldn't hear what he was saying but he just locked his door. i got back in the car and drove off. my wife said, ""feel better?"" ""yeah,"" ""ok, stop at the shop, we need milk."" i guess what i'm getting at is, sometimes anger isn't a problem. allowing it to come out in smaller doses will stop the build up so much, before you end up playing football with someone's head. last edited by newsunrising on thu nov 28, 2019 2:58 am, edited 1 time in total. reason: please do not evade the swear filter i'm not arguing; i'm explaining why i'm right.",1748,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

"npd bf of 2 years has been seeing a man. is he gay? i'm confused and heartbroken. i've been in a rocky, on-off-on-off again relationship with a covert type, somatic narcissist. i did not diagnose him on my own, he has several times over the years told me his issues and that he suspects he is, but refuses to get treatment for it. sometimes he has periods of clarity where he doesn't seem disordered at all, but most of the time he slips into it along with all the typical somatic behaviors that come with it. i've been working on myself to erect boundaries and extract myself from the relationship and i'm in a much better position than i was before, but i still slip up and get involved with him again. the entire two years we've been ""together"" (i say that loosely because we could barely go 3 months without him vanishing without a trace, before resurfacing again several weeks later.) he would triangulate me with three specific women. i never met these women, nor did i know them, but he would give me context clues such as where they lived, what they did for a living, etc. whenever he and i were on the ""outs"", he'd invariably let it be known to me that he was with one of these women. he is a businessman and splits his time pretty equally between 3 cities. long story short, and unfortunately i can't give all the details here because they are too specific, but i accidentally found out, unexpectedly, that all 3 of these ""women"" he's been talking about are actually all the same person, and that person is a gay man. there is a plethora of information about this person available online. this person also lives in, works in, and regularly travels to the exact same cities that my ex-bf spends time in for work. in fact, they used to live less than a mile away from each other. all the details match, age, career(s) (he has more than one and they all match each of these mythical women he's told me about), living and working location, 100% the conclusion is that all these women he's told me about is actually just a gay male he's been seeing. further, i've drawn the conclusion that their relationship pre-dates ours and that i'm likely the ""side"" person in the equation here, and this man is his primary relationship. again, i can't go into the details without seriously risking their privacy but this nearly for certain is the case. i really don't know what to think. i'm in a state of shock. he has several gay male friends, one of his work partners is gay, he seems comfortable in his sexuality and being masculine or feminine, so i'm surprised he feels the pressure to be in the closet. i am so confused! i'm oscillating between sadness for him that he feels he has to hide this big secret, but i also wonder if this is just how pwnpd are, they don't care where supply comes from as long as it's supply? this ‘other wo-man’ is clearly good supply. semi - famous, intellectual, beautiful, essentially a younger v 2.0 of himself. i'm not mad. i'm not going to call him out. i’m not going to confront. but i have no idea what to do or say or think now. i spent all night bawling, partly out of sadness, partially relieved for having an answer to this weirdness, finally, but now i feel numb and i need to talk to someone about this. if i stuff this inside of me and move on without discussing this with someone, i'm afraid i'm going to end up falling into a depression of this whole charade of a relationship that i stupidly hoped would still somehow work out in the end. i just need to get this out. i haven't said anything and won't. we're not on speaking terms as of yesterday, which is also when i found out. any advice on how to proceed in a responsible manner in this situation would be appreciated.",1813,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"inverted narcissistic craving hello! i'm a 24-year-old gay man in australia. i have a younger boyfriend, it's not yet apparent to me if things will work out but so far it's going okay. i read a link someone posted about inverted narcissism and am surprised to find parts that strongly apply to me. would i call myself an inverted narcissist? i don't think so... but maybe. i literally only discovered the term a day or so ago. narcissism usually seems to come from our upbringing. i've looked back on my life, early developmental years, and found interesting circumstances and things that could have shaped my current personality. childhood: it was lovely. before i hit puberty life was lovely. sometimes my parents confused me with their irregularities. in kindergarten i was nice to everyone and my classmates would ask me why i was so nice, why i'd lend things without expecting them back. and i just understood the golden rule and that was that. i was rarely ever a brat. i did, however, have a weird masochistic compulsion that made itself apparent when i was as young as ten or eleven. i don't know what caused it. i tried to make myself the butt of jokes. i actively humiliated myself and made myself out to be an idiot as a ways of entertaining other people. i feel uncomfortable to admit that. i don't understand where the pathology came from. if you believe in past lives and spirituality, there could be something there. anyway, what i did went beyond being a 'class clown', i was never one to misbehave. i encouraged people to mock and ridicule me, and i don't know why. i made myself out to be an idiot. as a teenager i had intense self-hate and depression for no reason i could understand. my family does have a history of mental illness on both sides. i continued to be a disgusting idiot, i think i degraded myself to please other people. how strange. i had a form of dysphoria about body hair and it made me disgusted by myself. anyway i think that in my late teenage years after some changes (including shaving, which had never occurred to me at the time), my self-esteem slingshotted the other way into narcissism, in some regards. i do believe the inverted narcissist can alternate as the situation allows, but perhaps only in some ways and not completely. a truly fascinating condition now that i've read into it and its counterpart. i did and do often feel that i'm extremely beautiful, sometimes the most beautiful person i've ever seen. i became deeply religious at a young age and so altruism became further embedded in my psyche. i'm not religious anymore though still have spiritual beliefs. i am, even now, realising how much my personality is truly shaped by this disorder. i'm undiagnosed. i never believed i had a disorder, until this literal moment. i'm well-functioning. i do get obsessive and delusional. wow... narcissism... inverted narcissism, a personality disorder. i was very lonely all my life and wanted nothing more than a boyfriend. i even self-harmed over it i was so depressed and despairing. it was all-pervasive, this need to have a relationship. the genetic disposition of my family, the intense depression and self-hating of my early teenage life, tendency to be stuck in mental loops and later despair over and need for dating is probably what shaped me to be this way. my first relationship lasted six months, he had anxiety that he takes medication for now. the relationship was one-sided and i was extremely attentive and doting, i believed that he needed the care because of his condition. i didn't love him and didn't care much when he broke up with me. i believe my current and former boyfriend also felt that i was in love with them just because of how i was, but the truth is i am simply very attentive and doting and enthralled by my partners. i crave someone to worship, someone who i can be their narcissistic supply. if i had to choose i'd rather date a codependent because i want stability in a relationship, certainly need it if i am to love at my strongest. i sometimes like to dominate, i certainly like to provide care, which is why i'd want a codependent. the idea of being with or worshipping a narcissist is still exciting for me to contemplate. i don't think i could give an inverted narcissist the bullying they may require. anyway... input will be highly valued by me. thanks for reading.",1817,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"inverted narcissistic craving thanks for sharing. lets start with this. i could have edited your post, but on second thought there is no need for you to read your post again, you spent enough time editing, so just a sample so i can get threw to you with what i mean: ""as a teenager i had intense self-hate and depression for no reason i could understand. i always hoped for the best, tried to apply the golden rule to everyone, care about everyone, even if i didnt care about myself, didnt think i could undo the damage done to me. i never liked myself the way i was, i often drifted off into fantasy where i was better, more witty, successfull and accepted for who i am. i actively humiliated myself and made myself out to be an idiot as a ways of entertaining other people. i thoughts its ok, i liked making others laugh, maybe most of all things. i was always the class clown. i missbehaved a lot, could never fit in to societie's rulestructure. anyway i think that in my early twenties after some changes (moving out to student dorm, taking care of myself), my self-esteem slingshotted the other way into narcissism, in some regards. i became deeply atheistic at a young age and saw humanity as a kind of a ""spaceship earth"". altruism became deeply embedded im my psyche, i thought i love all people, becouse of the destiny we share on this planet. this made me often taken advantage of. im undiagnosed, but i always believed myself to be pahological. i shared this thought with my sister, who also held this belief. i was very lonely all my life, but didnt believe a girlfriend would help that. i could connect to some people in some regards, but never felt anyone truly understood me."" my hope is to illustrate how much the disorder shapes your behavior. now about your newly aquired self-awareness (""i posses inverted-narcissist traits""). you must understand that this awareness does not equal the awareness of ones actions, why one does the things he does. one of the characteristics of npd is the lack of the capacity to self-reflect. this one makes sence. one couldnt be self-abusive if he understood, that he does it. you cannot know, or you might actualy stop. you say: ""wow... narcissism... inverted narcissism, a personality disorder"" yes, i faced disbelief like that, just like you did, when i first found out. now you bring up a key difference. i had many short relationships, which all failed and i just didnt believe i should make someone unhappy, by being with a pathological person like me. i thought ill just be alone, doing my things, learning about the world, an observer, living vicariously threw my intellectual and artistic pursuits. your craving to be with someone has led you on the right path to answer the questions you've always had. npd is to be primarily understood threw your relations to other people. you must be aware by now that you lack emotional empathy, the ability to empathise or emotional intelligence, and whole object relations,without which you cannot understand or meaningfully relate to other people. we can talk later in detail how this works, but for now be aware that the feelings you are having are not the same feelings other people have. you dont think of yourself as emotionally shallow do you? did you think you were the most empathic, caring person as well? you say that you crave to be supply to someone, but that is a very recent realisation right? i did exactly that, it was stronger than me, but without realising it. actively seeking the abuse. i am very ashamed of that. id advise you to investigate codependancy further, you dont have the right idea yet. a codependant is primarily someone who stays in the relationship regardless of the abuse inflicted. they are deeply sacrificial and need the other persons validation. i have no doubt you could make a codependant happy, though, just by accepting her as she is. you could give another invert the bullying he requires under special circumstances, one author explains a method, you'd have to be in a life crisis following narcissistic injury, to shift your patterns while he restores your supply and hope. dont be so sure about that anyway, i did find myself abusing inverts when i felt justified by their actions (stupidity, dishonesty). not for my pleasure, becouse i believed i have to give them a lesson.",1818,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"inverted narcissistic craving i can relate to a lot of your post. i'm also gay, almost 30 in the u.s. i almost always feel lonely. i crave and require admiration and attention—although you didn't mention much about this, which if you didn't need this as a narcissist would be very rare, almost excluding such a diagnosis. i also felt terrible about myself (and my body hair, for that matter!) in adolescence--and still do most of the time. i also felt ugly and slingshotted into the other extreme of often feeling amazing looking and beautiful when people stare at and admire me. your belief about being the most beautiful in the world borders on, if not being, delusional, as literally no one is the most beautiful in the world or the smarter. i say this as someone who's been called ""incredibly handsome,"" beautiful, etc. (never gorgeous though, which is still upsetting.) so i'm not coming at it from someone who's not attractive and wouldn't get it. first, a) beauty is subjective, and b) there is always someone better looking. btw, this is something i really cannot tolerate either as a narcissist. and i understand it intellectually but cannot emotionally accept it and when i'm confronted in the real world by a more attractive person, i typically freak out and find a way to boost my self-esteem. when i'm with a good looking friend and they get more attention, i get extremely jealous and angry. your class-clown type behavior, your self-hatred, all these sound like low self-esteem with compensatory narcissism. maybe vulnerable narcissism, as i think they're often related or even one in the same. the main questions are, do you have empathy? do you have the real ability to self-reflect and introspect or do your internal mechanisms seem inaccessible? do you apologize and feel guilt when you do something wrong, or is it purely shame-based or externalizing?",1824,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"parents being sorry hi akuma, it's understandable that you feel ""used"" and ambivalent about both your grandma and family members who visit her but don't help out while there at her place. your grandmother is at an age when it's difficult to get around physically, so there is that to consider. the other part may be that asking for milk is her way of getting to see you on a semi-regular basis to get some attention. with a husband who has dementia, she could be climbing the walls for adult conversation, however brief, and relief from the ""sick room"" atmosphere that likely focuses a lot of attention on her husband in their home. have you considered making your walk to grandma's a routine thing, like every thursday, for example, and asking grandma if she needs anything? this way you commit to that one day of the week (your boundary), whether or not other family members have come to visit or help out (or not). you can also state what chores you can do or won't do for for her. if you don't want to take out the trashbins, then make that clear with your grandma, e.g. you have your limits, and caretakers should limit the demands, otherwise they get burnout. you can't change others' behavior, but you can put down some boundaries for yourself. from my experience of looking after elderly parents-in-law, it's no picnic. however, there does come a time when an elderly person can no longer drive or do some things for him/herself and needs family assistance with daily living. some have partners who are no longer mentally capable of having a reasonable conversation with and that can get pretty lonely. being in touch with family members probably makes your grandma's life a little more bearable.",1839,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

dazn153 wrote: covertunsure wrote: despite making some progress socially, getting a nice new apartment, etc. in the past few months, i think i'm getting worse and headed down a very dark path. some of you may remember that i have an obsession with my looks, specifically my facial attractiveness. i compare myself to movie stars and other extremely attractive people. i have an obsession with the word ""gorgeous."" i've never been called that. i'm a guy, but i know some men are called gorgeous and as a gay man, i've used it to refer to other guys). my mom the other day bluntly reiterated that i'm not gorgeous and said i don't need to be to find a partner. a lot of people have told me that, trying to give me a helpful reality check, which only makes me feel worse. i feel angry, agitated and narcissistically injured when i think i don't measure up, and i can't stop thinking about it and repeating things to myself like ""you'll never look that good"". my feeling of attractiveness varies wildly, 80% based on getting attention on the street or in bars from others and 20% on looking at the mirror. so i've been going down a very dark path. constantly hypervigilant for rejection or disinterest by people i'm attracted to, serving as further proof i can't have everyone i want, to which i feel entitled. having fantasies of suicide and mass shootings to reclaim a sense of control and power. today i called a random attractive stranger i liked an asshole because he ignored me. usually, they don't hear me because i utter it under my breath, but today he did, and he looked back. i pretended i was saying it into empty space but i only sabotage myself and make things worse. i don't know what to do and feel like i might snap. i know i'm crazy and ridiculously obsessed with all this but it is driving me insane. that is the ""annihilation"" phase. it is when you realize that the reflection back is false. it is significant damage to the ""false self"" that we have had so long. it usually comes with age or some significant event where you suffer from severe injury/rejection. just realize that you are not alone. the psych ward helped recover from this phase to destroy the false self somewhat and to accept reality a bit more (it's expensive though). a psychotherapist is somewhat helpful, but not that impactful because they don't understand it unless they are also npd. the homicidal ideation is actually quite normal. many people go through it. if you have some bpd in you also (you may because you fear the rejection), it might pass into psychosis, which releases extreme anger and attention needing. do you have any coping mechanisms? i think what helped me the most was either getting professional help in a psych ward, or meeting others who are like me. then you just realize you're not that crazy. what triggers the annihilation phase? i don't recall a singular triggering event or trauma. maybe it's just been a gradual reduction of supply seeking in public, or getting tired of the #######4 facade. i don't know, i can't pretend to understand it. my obsession as a teenager was about my intelligence and constantly posting on internet forums as a substitute for irl social interaction. i constantly got into arguments and debates to prove my intelligence and get validation/supply. i was obsessed with iq, although (much like my looks, interesting...) my iq isn't quite the genius level i wanted/want it to be. now it is an obsession with needing to look like a movie star, gorgeous, etc. this obsession definitely transcends a mere ""oh, i wish i were better looking *moves on with day*."" it's an all-consuming experience that consumes at least 50% of my waking day's thoughts. basically it is torture. especially when i'm confronted in the real world, on the street, with not being constantly ogled and gawked at. (yet strangely, when i am ogled and gawked at, i don't much like it.) but why should i care in the first place how good i look or how i compare to george clooney and other movie stars? that's the important, substantive question, and one my parents and my former therapist ask(ed) me all the time. how did you meet people like you, and what do you mean more specifically by people like you?",1856,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"getting worse, going down a dark path? i think you meant me when your were addressing dazn153. i've already written loads about my looks obsession and i doubt i can add much more or answer any questions about it. you can explore them in my forum and blog posts if you want, but i don't feel up to writing more. i don't feel a need to look gorgeous, but i'd like to remain young looking. i'd be happy in the 7 to 9 range. i don't want to look like a movie star or a model. i have an obsession with the past, my past. (no, i don't have an exact definition of that, it's a rough way of indicating looks, not an objective measurement, of course.) i think a lot of mine is an identity crisis. i want to remain forever perceived as in the young world, in my bubble of my ideal-self projection, like a ghost, in my eternal performance. i can't go into it any more because there are nuances that i can't even put into words, layers i can't even peel away. i don't think it's just me. i'm obsessed with the whole ""tragedy"" of the loss of youth. i'm guessing you're about 30 now. in 10 more years you'll be 40. in 20, 50. and on and on. you don't know what the years will do to your face. (google mickey rourke, images.) at some point, you'll have to find some other meaning, some other source of fulfillment in your life, or it'll be hell. i've always had idealism and still do. my looks obsession has just been a flaw, a weakness, i know i have to transcend. but if you're unwilling to at least start working on this, on internalizing values about yourself other than your looks, then you're in for some real emotional misery down the road. it's up to you. get some depth. the inner life of the secret schizoid is incommunicable.",1858,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"boundaries not the first time i´ve listened to this but it really made me think and consider again my experience of growing up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbkpqskhgck i know that i have fairly crappy boundaries and the lack of bodily ones have become especially clear to me as of late. if i wind myself up and go around without being grounded (majority of the time), it´s like my mind gets ahead of my body, am not really well situated in it. my dad (cnpd, just to reiterate) held off on physical contact throughout my childhood and the majority of memories i have of him doing it were always in somewhat of a ´scientific´ manner, if you will. as he has always been a fitness freak (a liftime jogger of a religious nature, to the point where he got irritated if he hadn´t for a reason or another done it and lashed out on us), one of the things he would do when my sister and i were little was take us to cross-country skiing trips and i always had this sens that he expected us to get into jogging like he has done or smth of the like as well. his touches wer always in very rational, i.e. noting to us which muscles had seen the most use during the excercising and so on. tbh, throughout my life his presence always felt distant like it was too well-considered and came from a rational place, without warmth. there was the odd acknowledging (but very selective) pat here and there and he had the habit of giving (again, awkward) high fives when he dropped me off for a longer time period. the single hug i ever remember him giving us was when he announced to us that our mother was very sick (late stage cancer) and he gathered us around and told this to us in a solemn way. other than that, it´s just been emotional neglect from his part because he simply lacked the capacity. as a teenager i was quite isolated and a loner so i didn´t really partake in anything i deemed ´rowdy´ with others. i had only few fights in school but they were just that, fights - they got started quick and intense and subsided as fast. well, anyhow fast forward to 27yo me who has done little to no contact sports (always felt team sports were too cookie-cutter) but with action sports. the only boundaries to be found out are the truly physical ones like when your skin or worse bones break and it has nothing to do with other people and sensing their boundaries. i have a friend who is quite well socialized but suspect had a somewhat narcissistic father (he´s told me as much and has some codependent traits) who oftentimes tries to mess around and wrestle with me, which leaves me dumbfounded because it´s quite difficult for me to gauge how i should respond. am somewhat of a strong believer that people with empathy intuitively know. this is something that i´ve not and there´s a part of me that thinks maybe this could be something missing in my life that when improved, could carry further benefits to other areas of life as well? so the takeaway from this to me is - lack of contact=lack of socialization. do any of you relate to this at all and how were your parents with physical intimacy? “should i kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” camus",1864,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"boundaries im sorry i just dont like peterson. i just saw the video and its the same as all the others. the conclusions he draws, and he no doubt thinks those are very significant, are not actualy very significant at all and in fact trivial. you should try someone who is a buddha, like me. like buddhism, means 'awakened one'. emerald https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucvw2u2 ... bzuyow0dwa or teal swan https://www.youtube.com/user/thespiritualcatalyst for example. its excellent that you drew the conclusion that you are like your dad, someone you detested. that was my first step to self-realization too. that how i treated bony was a mirror of how my mom treated me. yes i was cared for, by many people, my dad too, although he was distant but he was an ok person and being manipulated by my mom constantly, all the girls that fell in love with me and even the mom of the first girl that fell in love with me, when i was 13. she fell in love and my mom and sister was present and her mom, right there, it was a on a winter camp in zakopane, carpathian mountains. her mom said she fell in love and what i should do (reciprocate). i said i wont reciprocate and i remember her hurt and my mom so pround of me. that im hurting this girl right in front of her. i learned more from her mom in that moment, that from my own mom ever. althought i wasnt able to understand the significance yet. a friend in the warehouse that saw me fall in love with bony, knew we were both in love with eachother, he wanted to tell me just becouse i knew english and made jokes to him, if i just admitted to him that im in love, thought he will be telling me something that is obvious anyway. not to the narcissists. instead he got to see all the insanity firsthand. becouse he didnt have thoughts yet, i was mentally ill. only the narcissists has thoughts. another friend in college in the student dorm when i was breaking the heart of another girl by being insane, wanted to tell me too, nagged me to admit to my mistake of getting naked and getting in another girls bed, as a joke (the two girls were friends). so i had poeople care but i couldnt understand it and hated them and only just understood that recently, and its still very traumatic. id rather not have known. many people that wanted to spend time together and not abuse me, becouse i secretly craved to be treated narcissisticaly by a narcissist aparently. so things like that, when other people had your best interest in mind, had plenty and it still wasnt enough when your self abusive. the example of my mom sleeping with me when i was 7 was actualy and example of abuse and not respecting my boundaries, not of being cared for. she did other things like asking me to touch her tits if front of my dad. or demeaning me in front of the family, laughing at me, telling me im the bad one and i need to be fixed, thats what realy damages a child. or when a guy puched me in front of my house, my mom saw it and screamed ""good, punch him again"" and calling me by my nickname. even the guy who punched me was kind of terrified at the pathology. ps what do you mean written in bold? you mean what you put in italics?",1867,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"beauty (and uglyness) for the vulnerable narcissist here's my problem, and i'd appreciate any suggestions on this: i don't think i have npd. i used to go to therapy and my therapist told me i was a narcissist. it was a couple of years ago and i never got to ask more about what he meant because i abandoned therapy sessions. i do think i have narcissistic traits though, especially of the vulnerable/covert kind. my main problem is my looks. i am not an attractive guy, quite the opposite actually. i have a few scars due to acne on the left side of my face, a slight lateral deviation of the jaw and assymetry in the jaw (i mean besides the lateral deviation, it's like my chin is not really symmetric). i also have a bad posture. but really my ears are the problem (""cup"" or ""lop"" ears). when i was younger i wasn't too concerned about my looks, or maybe i was but i managed not to dwell on the matter that much. but as i grew up, all my friends started dating and guess who didn't. at some point in my life i started doubting whether any girl could possibly be attracted to me. i also tend to feel inadequate and stupid, although i always got good grades in high school and at university. when i'm with friends i always feel like they're putting up with me and wish i wasn't there. i'm convinced there's a couple of ""friends"" that just don't like me, but the more i think about it the less able i am to tell objectively if that's the case (because it may just be my imagination or self-loathing). i think i could deal with all this, but what really bothers me is that whenever i go out, i look at every man in the street with envy. i envy their good looks, but above all their ""being normal"". it's like they have it easy--- they will get the girl, have a family and be happy. i don't have the guts to talk to a girl for fear of rejection. but it's more than that. i feel like if i ever invite a girl on a date she will politely say no but also she will be surprised at me asking her out. it would be like a man with no legs that wants to run a marathon not knowing that he's disabled and can't do it. (""boy! you'd think he knew he has no legs by now!"") i look myself at the mirror and can't really tell whether someone could possibly find me attractive or not. and i know looks aren't everything, but the uncertainty is killing me. i don't know if there's any piece of advice you could give me, but anyways, it's good to have a place to say what i need to say.",1879,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"i think i may have covert narcissism hi, i hope this finds you well and that you're in a better place than you were in april. i am codependent too, and i am 34. at 22, i acted, felt, and thought a lot like you. i was enmeshed in my parents' lives in an unhealthy way, felt like i needed to please them to get financial help, would always hand over the remote compulsively then resent it, and even went to church with my dad because, well, consciously, i needed his help with money. but underneath this, i wanted him to approve of me. if you are indeed codependent, you likely have a lot of unresolved trauma from childhood and early adulthood. trauma doesn't have to be rape or violence. we do not become desensitized to pain over time; we actually become more sensitive. the same repetitive pain can eventually bore into us and create trauma--a damaged area that doesn't heal with time, and causes reverberations of anxiety, low self-worth, numbness, sadness, anger, and so on. if you were traumatized in your childhood home--if you are still being traumatized, as smaller slights hurt more over time--you will have a toxic environment with your parents where you are basically living, eating, and sleeping in your trauma site. a man tried to rape me once when i was 26 outside a campus apartment and every time i passed that area, i got scared and anxious. so i stopped taking that route. i didn't realize until later that this same fear and anxiety was occurring in my home because of unresolved trauma there. it is not healthy to live where you were hurt (or are being hurt), and that doesn't mean you don't love your parents. in my 20s, my codependence looked a lot like covert narcissism. i was numb. there were a lot of people in my life, but they were shadows more than anything. i pretended a lot. i was not able to forge genuine connection, and so i settled for second best--trying to perform well enough to be approved of, fit in, enjoy attention, and push loneliness away. two disorders can look the same, but they are not born out of the same motivations, and their internal structures will be different once you start to deconstruct them. connection is about sending something of yourself out into the world (or to god) and having an other (a sentient ""object"") respond to you with their own something that they have sent to you. the two currents meet and connection is forged. in both codependents and covert narcissists, this connection is broken. narcissists have fortified the wall separating self and other, a wall that is supposed to be semi-permeable, and thus their signals just get bounced back to them. they are locked in a frozen lake looking out at the people on top. saying stay here, look at me, see how many flips i can do, i'm beautiful right? going a little crazy by myself down here but the good news is that i'm so frozen, i stopped feeling most unpleasant things a long time ago. been spending a lot of time with myself, and now i'm pretty into that self, who is my friend, because if he wasn't there i would basically die from the isolation. and you can see how envy, rage, coldness, the false self, and so on would come into play. their signals coming back to them, they think are coming from the people on top of the frozen water, and that is projection. codependence is different; the barrier that is supposed to be semi-permiable has become perforated, and too many foreign agents infiltrate the self. we don't know where we end and other people begin. we think their problems are our problems. the narcissist says, you owe me something! the codependent says, you say it is true, and so it must be. the narcissist says, you will help me believe that my false self is a real, special, beautiful person so that i can keep believing i'm ok and not down here by myself. the codependent says, well i can't just leave you alone down there can i? never mind that we never actually touch and i am so, so lonely here with you. o;p[]\. and because we aren't sure of ourselves, don't trust our volatile emotions (is this real or is this traumatic injury), we want other people to tell us how we are supposed to feel and act. i know these are hopelessly garbled metaphors. maybe they can help though. the narcissist is frozen. the codependent is injured. both can help the other feel special to compensate for low self-worth. you mentioned going to church and whether you believe in god or not, there is something transformative about putting our trust in an eternal, benevolent fortress of protection. there are resources outside of yourself and this world that can heal your pain. you don't have to feel like this forever. carl jung was not a religious man but he was amazed that the seemingly incurable disease of alcoholism could be cured with the spiritual-based 12 step program. you could always go christian lite with the self-helping and addictively enjoyable messages by andy stanley, just google andy stanley and your move. he talks to nonbelievers about how christian ideas can be applied in a way that is relevant and immediately effective. (my sociopath/narcissist brother goes to his church!) other resources include the book codependent no more, which is a great listen on audible, or get the book at the library and i promise it will change your life if you are codependent. and also, look up trauma is not a life sentence, which addresses the problems with how modern christianity treats jesus like snake oil while talking about the dark ancient poetry dealing with trauma in ancient jewish writings. finally, the self compassion meditations by kristin neff. this is a form of meditation (mindfulness-based stress reduction or mbsr) that has been empirically validated by the scientific community to help with chronic illness and pain, depression, anxiety, and a host of other ""incurable"" problems. i spent decades knowing something was very wrong and not knowing how to address it. tried therapy, meditation, yoga, self-help, drugs, rescuing, literature, eating disorders, workaholism, and all the while reeling from the pain, self-loathing, and shame. i hope you won't go through that. i always thought, well it wasn't bad enough to say i was traumatized...and i had heard about codependence, but it didn't seem dire enough to cause all of those crippling problems. i was wrong on both counts. i hope you'll continue on this path of learning about codependence so that you can get better.",1892,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"best therapy for narcissism well when youre more schizoid then if i may give a tip, i'd look for a therapist that can complement that a bit. else you might end up in a therapy where he gives you supercool interpretations to your absolutely amazing free-associations, which might leave you convinced that its working really great and you might feel very good about it (or relatively) but in reality its just a sort of wanking circle and no real progress is made. also psychoanalysis i think is suited pretty well, but the speed of it will probably be slow. i dunno if youre aware of this, so its probably good to say this up front, thats a thing of many years. it depends a lot on your psychological setup and the therapist himself. my therapist is very ""respectful"" as he always says of my kinds of defense and what is defending against so even while i'm irritated sometimes that its so slow, its less dangerous - both in terms of you leaving therapy abruptly, or becoming more ill. also - but that also will be talked about with your therapist after a while i assume - it might be necessary or a good addition to get into a rehab center or psych-clinic for a while while in treatment for specific stuff - some stuff can be resolved more quickly in that way, or so i hear. finally as to childhood trauma, i dont think theres a therapy form that ""focuses"" on this per se, if its psychoanalytic, because the focus is on whats on your mind currently. so while that might be a bit weird and chaotic, it also means you can talk about stuff and in ways you feel ready for it when youre ready or when you feel like it. dx: spd",1903,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"best therapy for narcissism psychoanalysis is not the treatment of choice for childhood trauma, and yes, there are therapists trained in the treatment of it, so you should seek one out. it sounds like you are very cut off from your emotions--dissociated from them--which is very common in traumatized people. someone who is an expert at treating complex ptsd and dissociative disorders would probably be the most helpful. you can find a list at isst-d.org (international society for the study of trauma and dissociation). most people don't realize that prolonged abuse in childhood causes complex ptsd and dissociation and that this accounts for many of the symptoms that we have as adults. one can't really put one's bad childhood behind (as i used to think you could) and just go on from there. it comes with you in all sorts of ways, and most of them are hidden from awareness. it affects basic things like relationships, trust, self-image, etc, and people often think that's just how they are when it really has a lot to do with how they were treated as a child. dx:did/osdd first post our journey thread",1905,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"thoughts on *the wizard of oz and other narcissists* i do know that there is a book called *the wizard of oz and other narcissists*, but imho the author really missed the mark on identifying the npd in that particular story. the following is just something i thought of while watching *the wizard of oz* yet again, while struggling to understand what on earth happened to my npd ex-husband who had once been such a good man and loving father. as most people know, the condition of narcissism is named for a character in a greek myth, narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflected image in a pool and pined away for it until he died. this has led to the idea that narcissists love only themselves, but that’s not exactly what the story means. because he was so empty on the inside, narcissus only existed when he saw himself reflected somewhere else. and that’s how someone with the condition called “narcissism” goes through life: an empty hole on the inside, with no sense of self-worth or self-validation to make them feel whole and human and good. at some point, possibly in response to some loss or trauma or pain, they stopped looking inward to create those things (that takes work) and indeed cut that off completely so that 100% of their validation comes from the outside - from other people (because that seems so much easier and so much more rewarding, the way it's always easier to use a drug to get a quick fix of whatever you're looking for.) but of course no other person can give them what every human really needs - which is self -worth and self -validation and self -respect - and so narcissists spend their lives as bottomless pits for attention, admiration and validation. and they only end up more and more and more empty, because that sort of pit cannot be filled from the outside. it can only be filled from within. in *the wizard of oz*, our famous four characters search for the things which every human needs: a brain, a heart, courage, and a home. but just like the narcissist, they make the mistake of searching for others who will supply those things instead of looking within themselves and finding what they need on the inside. the munchkins represent well-meaning friends who actually encourage the narcissist to search outwardly instead of inwardly. “follow the yellow brick road!” they say, because the yellow brick road leads you to the someone who, the munchkins believe, can give you what you seek – namely, it leads to the wizard. glinda the good represents a true friend who wants to help but knows she cannot, because she understands that she cannot give the characters what they seek and no one else can, either. the wicked witch represents full-blown narcissism run rampant. she is surrounded by evil, misshapen characters like the flying monkeys who try to bring her what she wants – namely, attention and admiration that she has not earned – and by thralls, the winkie guards, who are enslaved by her cruelty but don’t know how to break free of her. in the end, the wicked witch is vanquished by simply washing her away with honesty and courage. and then the flying monkeys are gone and we see that the guards were not really loyal to her at all. the wizard is a fraud, of course, because no one can give you what you must create and nurture from the inside – courage, wisdom and love. glinda finally tells dorothy that she had the power to go home all the time. “why didn’t you tell me?” dorothy cries, and glinda says, “because you would not have believed me. you had to learn it for yourself.” and so they did. as we all do. npds spend their lives looking for love and validation from flying monkeys and enslaved thralls - who have the power to destroy you and will not care if they do - instead of the npds using their own power to simply go home. in this story, ""home"" is the place *within yourself* where you will have all the intelligence, love and courage you ever wanted or needed - including people who will love you simply for yourself, as auntie em and uncle henry and all the other ""real"" characters loved dorothy. that's why there's no place like home. the witch wanted the ruby slippers, but they were unobtainable for her. that's because the ruby slippers represent home and you must make your own home - you cannot just take someone else's and expect their home to be yours. and of course the flying monkeys represent the enablers, sycophants, lackeys, toadys, groupies and hangers-on that powerful narcissists and other addicts virtually always attract. the monkeys are pathetic, unnatural creatures who exist on the crumbs and leftovers of the narcissist but really care nothing for him, because if he's gone they'll just attach themselves to someone else. remember the ""memphis mafia""? they were elvis's flying monkeys, enablers who lived at his feet and would bring him whatever they thought he wanted - even if it was really very harmful and would ultimately kill him, which it did. michael jackson had flying monkeys, too. one of them was right there with him when he died. (i don’t know that michael jackson and elvis were npd, but both were certainly addicts for prescription drugs and, like every addict, both of them cut off their family and all non-enablers in favor of flying monkeys. every addict of every kind has flying monkeys.) elvis and jacko are just two examples of people who chose - yes, chose - flying monkeys instead of the genuine love and respect they could have had from real family and real friends. there are many more, both famous and not. i looked at some excerpts from *the wizard of oz and other narcissists.* the author seems to feel that the wizard himself represents an npd. but the story didn't strike me that way at all. as i mentioned above, it's our four main characters who represent the npds because they're the ones looking for others to supply them with what they need instead of looking inward to find it. and the wicked witch represents npd run rampant at its most destructive. but the wizard - now, think about it: the wizard is first shown as nothing but an ugly and very angry face, shouting and growling and erupting in fire and fury, living as a recluse and trying to get rid of all these npds who keep trying to get things from him. he's not trying to get anything from anybody. he hides from everyone and tries to get them to leave him alone. he clearly looks to be angry, lonely and suffering. ""go away!"" ""i was hoping the wicked witch would kill you and i would never see you again."" ""pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!"" no npd would ever say such things. they live for constant attention and emotional feeding from others. they are the polar opposite of the wizard. to me, the wizard represents the spouses and adult children of all the charming, sweet-talking, innocent-looking npds who have been tormenting them to death for years. there is a lot of talk about “narcissistic rage” from the npd, but i can tell you that the npd’s victims often find themselves literally raging and screaming from the extreme frustration and agony of being used as a drug instead of treated like a real human being. finally, when the wizard's true form is revealed as a gentle and quite ordinary man - who is a fraud only in the sense that he cannot give the npds what they want any more than anyone else can - he is able to get the npds to look inside for what they want, and then he is able to get free of them and go home himself. it's left to glinda to help dorothy with the biggest hurdle of all - understanding where home really is. i don't think the wizard represents a full-blown narcissist at all. that's the wicked witch. the angry, hideous, reclusive and lonely wizard represents the npd's tormented and isolated victims. i was thinking about where toto figures in the story. i think that because toto is an animal - a normal, natural animal, not a fantasy creature like the lion - he therefore represents the kind of innocence and purity of spirit that can never be contaminated by narcissism. he can neither be one nor respond to one. it is in protecting toto that dorothy finds the courage to destroy the wicked witch, and it is toto who reveals that the angry, blustering, supernatural-looking wizard is also a ""real"" creature who should be treated as such - not merely used as a source of supply for npds, which is what left him raging, suffering and reclusive. when the innocent toto pulls back the curtain, the wizard can finally respond to the npds as his real self and *then* he is able to get free of them - presumably to go back to a normal, natural world. the only place where the metaphor doesn't quite hold, imho, is that the wizard actually *is* able to turn around the behaviour of the npds simply by pointing out their own positive traits to them and showing them that they didn’t have to go looking for what they needed from someone else – that they would find they had brains, love and courage all along if they would only look within instead of demanding these things from others. we know that such a change happens only rarely, if ever, in the real world – maybe because npd is never treated as the addiction it really is. maybe we should all insist that an npd start looking within to find positive traits and a loving home - and maybe they would. surely that is a better life than being like the wicked witch, who was indeed powerful and the focus of attention but was also despised and feared and alone with only thralls and flying monkeys for company - and they cared nothing for her in the end. surely we wish better for the people we love, whether they are npds or not. perhaps especially if they are npds.",1924,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"book comment review synopsis grb comments on alistair munro's book ""delusional disorder..."" i highly recommend the website http://shop.ebrary.com/ , where you can read the above book online for free. the information below is taken from p. 232-234, which deserve to be read in their entirety. for me, this section of the book has given me some modest hope, as it paints a picture of the treatment process and some possible favorable outcomes. there is also some practical advice for the psychiatrist. by necessity, i will paraphrase munro: because of the patients reluctance to trust psychiatrists, ideally, assessment and treatment should be by a family physician... but they may not always have the necessary familiarity with this condition and recent advances in its treatment. the psychiatrist must be patient and will often have to spend more than one session gaining the patients confidence before even trying to persuade them to take meds. the patient will usually vehemently argue against taking medications, ""but calm persistence does finally pay off in a reasonable proporatioon of cases"". medication should be started with a ""very low"" dose which is then raised ""gradually and cautiously"", to prevent sudden onset of side effects, ""an event guaranteed to induce immediate noncompliance."" munro recommends that the patient see the psychiatrist at least once a week during this early stage. munro is a champion of the drug pimozide, used in low doses (""starting with 1 or 2 mg daily...and in most cases [will need to be gardually raised to] no higher than 4 to 6 mg per day""). he has used this drug primarily to treat delusional disorder of the somatic subtype, with good results. minor improvements may be seen within a few days (e.g., reduced agitation, somewhat reduced preoccupation with the delusion), but it takes about two weeks (on the average; sometimes as much as 6 weeks) of treatment (assuming the patient is compliant and responding to the medication), before significant amelioration of the delusion is observed. i will quote the following passage in whole, as it addresses a scenario which has caused me worries (the person stops taking their meds), and actually manages to turn it around into something hopeful: quote: quite often the patient feels sufficiently improved early on in treatment that he or she decides to stop the medication. inevitably the delusion and the accompanying agitation and preoccupation start to reappear and it is then that the treating physician has the best opportunity to obtain ongoing co-operation. even when the patient is still adamant that his beliefs are real, the experience of improvement followed by incipient relapse seems to make a deep impression and if the patient now trusts the physician he or she will often become extremely compliant. in successful cases the complete turnaround from rejection to trust is both remarkable and heartily gratifying. munro also observes that in the cases where the patient makes a ""good recovery"", it is often ""relatively rapid and notably complete... even when the delusion has been present for a very long time"". sounds great, doesn't it? [icon_smile.gif] he also talks about long-term maintenance of treatment (which not surprisingly typically involves continuing meds indefinitely), and mentions that of the (admittedly small) group of patients he has been able to follow up with over the long term, about 1/3 have actually been weaned from meds. these occasionally have relapses, but apparently have sufficient insight at that point that they actually voluntarily resume medication. i also found the following passage very interesting: quote: there is a dissociation between acquired insight as to the desirability of continuing treatment and in-depth insight into the illness itself. many patients never accept fully the psychotic nature of their experience, but so long as they agree to take treatment, it seems unimportant, and probably unkind, to face them with the fact that they were delusional before the medication took effect. munro concludes with a few thoughts on non-drug treatment of delusional disorder, stating essentially that psychological (""talk"") treatment is essentially not helpful until possibly, in some cases, after the delusions have been resolved using medication. a final warning is given: ""there is a general consensus that psychotherapy of an exploratory, uncovering type is not appropriate in delusional disorder. "" i'll say it again, this section of the book deserves to be read by anybody dealing with a loved one suffering from delusional disorder. it helped me, and i hope it will help you, too. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- roger c comments on ""i am not sick, i do not need help"" by dr. xavier amador dr. amador writes from his own personal experience, both as brother of a schizophrenia patient, and as a clinical psychologist. a large problem with treating people with schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders is that many times they won't stay in treatment. the usual explanation for this is that they lack insight into their illness. that is, they are not aware they have a mental illness, or in many cases even that they are exhibiting symptoms. attempts to reason with such patients about their illness are futile. dr. amador postulates that this inability to perceive their illness is caused by the same kind of brain disfunction that is responsible for the illness itself. experiments have proven this to be true. so, since most of these patients are incapable of understanding that they are ill, how can doctors and family members convince them to stay in treatment programs? dr. amador gives a four-step method for providing patients with insight into the benefit of treatment, thus giving them motivation to stay in treatment. for example, one schizophrenic patient wanted very much to be able to hold down a job, but had only a few jobs over the years, most of which lasted only a short time. rather than simply telling this patient that a job was out of the question, the doctor empathized with the patient's desire, and then helped the patient look back to the times when he was able to get a job, and the events that led up to losing the job, and related these events to the patient's treatment program (or lack thereof). this helped the patient to gain insight into the benefit of treatment. the book finishes with a couple of chapters about knowing when to commit a loved one, and how to go about it. all the advice sounds reasonable, and dr. amador's track record of success with it speaks for itself. it should be universally applicable, since the method is based on identifying issues that are important to the patient himself; anything he is dissatisfied with and wants to change will provide a means to motivate the patient to stay in treatment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- sean et al comments: i saw dr. amador speak at the 2003 nami national convention, if you ever have a chance i suggest seeing him. he spent a great deal of time at the end of the session answering questions from people with a mentalli ill loved one. his sympathy and understanding towards the person with the illness was incredible. as he spoke he explained schizophrenia and the inability to recognize the illness in simple terms: he asked someone from the audience to give a brief bio about themself. the woman who volunteered (i'll call her susan) was a psychologist with a loving husband and two children. she gave a brief description of her job, her family, and her life in general. then dr. amador then went on to talk directly to susan, saying basically the following: quote: susan, i have some bad news for you. you aren't really a psychologist, in fact, the practice where you think you work called me and asked that i tell you to stop going there every day. there's more though, you aren't really married. tom also has asked me to help you get help and to stop going to his house. those children aren't yours, and the house isn't yours. you're sick susan, and i'm going to take you to the hospital and get you some help. this demonstration, more than anything else, made me aware of how frightening it must be to have schizophrenia and have your reality stolen from you. no wonder someone with such an illness has conspiratorial thoughts. if someone came and told me my entire life was imagined i'd think they were lying. when they went on to say i needed help and then started trying to make me take medication i wouldn't trust them. i know i haven't done the demonstration justice, but try and imagine yourself hearing those words. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- grb comments on amador: one approach is to ""empower"" the patient to make their own decision about whether to stay on meds, by promising that no one will object if they go off the meds, under the condition that they keep a journal during the periods that they are not taking medications... also, a thought on the idea mentioned above, about finding a motivator for the patient to stay in treatment (and which could presumably be used to motivate the person to seek treatment...). roger had mentioned difficulties in applying this concept in his case. i would agree that this approach would work much better with schizophrenia, for example, than delusional disorder, because in the latter case the person is only affected by the disorder in a limited way, due to the ""encapsulated"" nature of the delusions. the person suffering from dd is likely to be highly functional within society in general and professionally, whereas the disorder primarily affects interpersonal relationships with those close to him or her. so, i think it is a general truth that many people with dd actually do not perceive a worsened quality of life as a result of their (untreated) condition. they might notice a positive change after starting medication, which might be helpful in assuring future compliance, but the problem of how to get the person into treatment in the first place remains vexing.... dr. amador introduces his four steps. listen effective listening is really a skill that needs to be cultivated. you will need to learn to really listen to what your loved one feels, wants, and believes in. listening without learning is pointless. first, you need to walk in the other person's shoes to gain a clear idea of their experience of the illness and treatment. for the uninitiated, this is not as easy as it may sound on the face of it. too many times we make assumptions without checking them out with the person about whom we are making assumptions. knowledge is power. when you know how someone experiences the idea of having a mental illness and taking psychiatric drugs, you will have obtained the leverage you need to begin to build a treatment agreement. but you will also need to know what their hopes and expectations are for the future, whether or not you believe they're realistic. and finally, you want to identify the cognitive deficits (e.g. problems with memory, attention, focusing thoughts) that are creating barriers between you and the person you're concerned about and between that person and effective treatment. empathize the second step involves learning when and how to express empathy. if there were a moral to each step and chapter, this one would go something like this: if you want someone to seriously consider your point of view, be certain he feels you have seriously considered his. quid pro quo. that means that you must empathize with all of the reasons he has for not wanting to accept treatment, even the ""crazy"" ones. but don't worry; empathizing with how a particular delusion makes one feel is not the same as agreeing that the belief is true. this may seem like a minor point, but, as you will learn, the right kind of empathy will make a tremendous difference on how receptive your loved one is to your concerns and opinions. in the chapter devoted to this step, i give you step-by-step instructions on how to do this using techniques such as reflective listening. agree find common ground and stake it out. knowing that what you want for the other person is something she does not want for herself can make it seem as if there is no common ground. she doesn't think she needs medication or therapy, and you think she does. like any conflict of beliefs between two people, to resolve the disagreement to your satisfaction requires that you discover what motivation the other person has to change. common ground always exists even between the most extreme opposing positions. the emphasis is on acknowledging that your loved one has personal choice and responsibility for the decisions he makes about his life. during this step, you become a neutral observer, pointing out the various positive and negative consequences of decisions your loved on has made. that means refraining from saying things like, ""see if you had taken your medication, you wouldn't have ended up in the hospital."" your focus is on making observations together - identifying facts upon which you can ultimately agree. rather than making an observation or statement about what happened you ask a lot of questions such as ""so what happened after you decided to stop taking your medication?"" ""did the voices quiet down after you stopped?"" ""how long after stopping the medication was it before you went to the hospital?"" if you are truly collaborating, asking questions rather than giving advice or direction comes a lot easier than it may sound. partnership forming a partnership for recovery is the last and, in my experience, the most satisfying step in this process. the aim of this step is to help you to collaborate on accomplishing the goals you agreed upon. unlike the previous steps, this one involves both you and your loved one making an explicit decision to work together and to become teammates against a common opponent. you may call the enemy different names, but the names are irrelevant to arriving at a plan of action. the final step culminates in arriving at a treatment agreement. _________________",1939,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"welcome welcome. i have been recently asked to moderate this forum on delusional disorder. i am not a doctor, but i believe i have some first hand experience. what is delusional disorder? this illness is a psychosis characterized by non-bizzare delusions which last at least one month. the intensity of such perceptions may wax or wane over time. the person suffering from delusions is often functional in all other aspects of their life. statistically this illness strikes woman more than men. there are at least six sub-types: erotomanic: belief that another person, usually of higher status, is in love with him or her. this other person may be a boss, coworker, celebrity, or stranger. grandiose: belief that he or she is much more important, powerful, wealthy, or talented than he or she really is. jealous: the belief that his or her partner has been grossly unfaithful without regard to substantiating evidence. persecutory: believes that he or she is being plotted against, spied on, followed, or harassed by unknown enemies. these delusions sometimes involve conspiracies of people out to ""get"" the sufferer. somatic: he or she is ill or has other types of health problems. mixed type: suffers from more than one of the delusions listed above. delusional disorder is sometimes a associated with other personality disorders or a subset of other psychoses; and there is a certain overlap with paranoid personality disorder. it may be helpful to you to check the posts in that forum as well. the above information was culled from various internet sources. for a more detailed list of resources please visit our resource guide. alex47",1940,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"glitch on thursday, august 7, around dusk (9 pm), i let the dogs outside. i opened the wrought iron door, and all four dogs ran outside. first, the australian cattle dog, then the two little beagles (a blue and tricolor), while growling and nipping at each other, and finally my lovable bernedoodle. i shut and locked the door; it felt darker in the house with the door shut, so i turned on the light, and the blue beagle was somehow still inside. my friends say they call that ""getting old."" they say it happens all the time with their keys, glasses, tools, etc. i've read about the concepts of samsara, duality, nirvana, and the matrix theory. not to mention my news feed on msnbc has stories about alien technology, ai utilization, and even physicists discussing the concept of the multiverse. while modern psychiatry has a place in recovery, it isn't the solution for every part of perception and experience that can't be solved. i feel well. i'm not insane, just pay attention mindfully. i've been meditating more lately. most people are so plugged into technology and living in distraction, they'd probably not even notice if something like that happened to them.

"question of how delusional beliefs are caused triskelion wrote: option 3: delusions are created by the introduction of a false statement which is incorrectly perceived as truthful, which then in turn influences the perception of anything that contradicts the new ""truth"". a bit like how you could teach someone for their entire youth that 1+1 = 11, and then you provide proof of it being 2, so the brain has to adjust. once it chooses to believe 1+1 = 2, it then discards any old memories saying otherwise. gaslighting works similar too. in general you can make someone believe a fallacy if you are persistent enough. to look at your options, it's a bit of both but also neither of those options. you don't make these things up. you are somehow triggered to believe something. that actually makes sense. i did wonder if development believing in false memories or lying to yourself too much can create unhealthy self-delusion, like in severe form of narcissistic personality disorder. some people believe that people with narcissistic personality disorder lie to to themselves too much that bags to question if they became delusional overtime, not that it's the same as as traditional psychosis. but only some people with narcissistic personality disorder lie to themselves that are harmful to others, most of them cause relationship issues that severe harm. some people generalize people with narcissistic personality disorder as being all the same, but because not every person with narcissistic personality disorder are the same, generalizing people with narcissistic personality disorder as being all bad is stigmatizing. some websites say that people with narcissistic personality disorder lie to themselves too much and are delusional overtime, but i get confused, because they don't use the word 'some', because not everyone with narcissistic personality disorder are going to have all the traits. please, educate me if i am wrong",1956,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"how to deal with what i believe is delusional jealousy? hi, i’m new and i hope this is the right place for this topic. at first, when my partner started acting strangely, i thought maybe it was me giving off the wrong impression somehow, or perhaps he was just abusive or narcissistic, but his behavior has morphed into something else and him into someone i don’t recognize. we’ve been together for 2 years and are living together. his main behaviors a- wanting access to my phone and phone password. going into a frenzy if i receive an app notification thinking it’s from another man. - contacting me constantly wanting to know what i’m doing and mad if i don’t reply -slowly trying to chip away at my friendships saying all men are in love with me and i can’t have friendships with men. -constantly accusing me of having online and offline relationships - when i go to visit my family he thinks i’m out doing it with random men when i’m with my family. - if my friends are male, male coworkers, or even a male female couple they want me and i’m doing it with them. i cannot even mention talking to a male coworker in my break room without setting him into an episode of yelling screaming and accusations for hours on end. -looking at and misinterpreting my social media and thinking i’m doing nefarious things that are actually incredibly innocent. i could go on, but these are the main ones. i have never cheated on this man (or ever tbh, it’s just not who i am) and i did eliminate my male friendships to make him happy and so i didn’t have to put up with his behavior. even when he is presented with proof (like my google location, calls to show i’m with my parents, showing him the apps that have gone off, giving him my phone passwords) he still insists on the delusions. the most recent was that i was in a hot tub at my friends house doing it with other men. my friend does not even own a hot tub (he has been to her home), and furthermore, i was at my parents home and in bed and calling him to show him this, but he wouldn’t believe me. i sent my google maps location and he didn’t believe that. i finally got a hold of him on the phone and showed him my child sleeping next to me and he somehow didn’t believe that and turned it around to say he was calling because i’d blocked him on text (i didn’t). he does not even think he is jealous nor controlling, and sees no problem with this behavior and thinks i am 100% cheating on him. if i deny and provide evidence i’m cheating. if i say that i’m not going to argue because he won’t believe me either way, that’s also proof of the cheating. he is not sorry he hurts me or makes me cry. he offers no apologies for his behavior, and when the constant accusations upset me and i try to leave the room or start crying, it just angers him even more and he says i’m just upset because he’s right. i am not in a position to leave for another few months due to life circumstances. he has already grabbed and thrown my phone and i am worried for the behavior to escalate. how do i keep him calm until i can get out of this situation. any suggestions would be so much appreciated.",1959,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"how to deal with what i believe is delusional jealousy? this is exactly the same as what i went through 5 years ago, they only reason i have come back to this is that i was clearing out an old mobile phone and i forgot it still had 147 deleted voicemails from my then girlfriend, i had a listen to a few and i cant believe the abuse i put up with. my ex now (tf) suffered from delusional jealousy, and exactly like your partner mine would be on high alert for the slightest phone notification, even if a cyclist wrang his bell going by, she'd think it was my phone. she'd imagine hearing it, and when there was nothing to show her she'd accuse me of deleting messages. she'd say that male contacts in my phone were made up names for secret girls i was in touch with! accuse me of having affairs with family members, friends wives, people from work. if i went to the toilet with the phone in my pocket, then i was away making secret calls. when she phoned me, if i answered the phone too quickly then (in her head) it was because i was on my phone messaging another girl, if i took too long to answer then i must have been physically up to no good with another girl. if she called i had to let the phone ring 3-4 times then answer it, i had to call her while driving to work, at lunch time, and on the way home. if in didn't either then i was up to no good. if i went shopping on my way home i had to show her receipts to keep the peace. if i was in an area and there was no phone service, she'd be calling and calling and by the time you'd get a signal my phone would be beeping with missed calls, she'd then call i'd answer the phone it would still be beeping with her dozens of notifications, she'd say those noises were notifications from other females, she'd be screaming down the phone. any night out would always end with an argument, you couldn't talk to anyone, you feared anyone coming over and talking to you, if a girl spoke to you even if she had her own partner with her then you were having an affair with her. i dreaded a family occasion where id have to take her. i had a family funeral where she was adamant i was having an affair with my own cousin, and she even said my cousins husband was in on it! i cant believe i put up with it, probably because there were good days, but they always followed by a bad days, but the bad days were far more than the good. i always hoped it would get better. and i did love her, but that slowly start to ebb away. anyway it slowly got worse and worse. i told her she'd needed serious help with her jealousy, if she didn't get it then i was going. she said she spoke with her dr and she was recommended somewhere. she wouldn't tell me where or who, i wasn't allowed to go as ""i would tell them things"" which i thought was the whole point. anyway after a few visits i sort of sussed that this was some sort of well being place, she came back one time with the notion i was gas lighting her. that's when i said ""i'll show you how much im gas lighting and controlling you"" i just left the relationship there and then, never looked back. she harassed me for about a year after that, but i never ever took her on that was 5 years ago, she send me a message a few months ago, half apologising. i never responded. jealousy will turn any relationship toxic, it will always get worse, you need to bail out for the sake of your own sanity. its too late in the night for me to read this through for mistakes! i'm just rattling my way through typing this trying to recall all her accusations, so apologies if it doesn't make much sense! another thing she did was accuse me of having an affair with a girl at her own place of work, that i had never even met !! she would watch this girl at her work on the phone to her own boyfriend, my girlfriend would then phone me and if my phone was engaged then it meant i was on the phone to this other girl !! get out while you can.",1962,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"question about delusion i don't know if this is in the right place but i have wanted to ask about this for a long time. i have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 with psychotic mania. when i am manic, i have delusions that i become a famous person and genuinely believe i am this person, sometimes for months at a time, but they are dead in real life. before i experience this, i often experience him talking to me with a voice in my head (not from the outside but within my head). when i'm unmedicated i also experience sensory hallucinations, thought insertion, ""radio waves in my head"" etc. i have gotten quite good at managing these sensory hallucinations but my executive functioning is still greatly impacted while having episodes. this side of myself has gotten better about not getting into trouble but i was wondering if there was research and case studies i could research on this phenomenon to better understand my experiences. i did try medication but it stopped working after some months with regards to the voice/these episodes, although they did help with my mood issues and some other hallucinations i was experiencing. i couldn't afford healthcare so i haven't been medicated for a while but i am doing alright for now.",1963,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"cotard's syndrome? hi, i'm new-ish here. i tend to lurk, but this is my first post. recently, i have not been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder (did) and schizophrenia, though they're being heavily considered, among other things, if that helps contextually with what i'm going to write here. i am not looking for a diagnosis of any sorts, just concerned about arising symptoms and wanting to express those feelings. not a big fan of reality checking / reassurance of my existence/being alive, even if that contradicts me posting here in the first place, but it just tends to bring me more denial and frustration / distress. == i want to make it very clear here that, throughout this entire post, there will be themes of death/dying, abuse/trauma, and similar themes. i will not go into explicit detail but i want to put this warning here to be safe. it is never my intention to harm anybody. == so basically, i think i'm dead. realistically i know that this makes me sound strange to those who do not suffer delusions, but it feels very real to me. it's hard for me to say 'it may sound strange to those who do not suffer delusions' in the first place because alongside my feelings of being dead/in hell/rotting after a traumatic event basically exactly three years ago, nobody really feels real to me anymore, including myself. it's been increasingly difficult to consider the thoughts and feelings of anyone around me when my brain constantly presses the fact on me that nobody really is real, this is all a fabricated personal hell that i'm living in, and that i am dead. all my constant suffering and traumatic experiences are justified by this, it feels like. i feel like i live in some kind of sick, twisted version of groundhog day; while the days may not be exactly the same, i experience a great deal of amnesia surrounding the previous day when i wake up the next, my routine is always extremely indifferent, and i always have to experience some kind of intense distress / abuse / manipulation at the hands of my guardians or ""friends""/family / traumatic experience / misfortune in general. every little glimmer of hope i get is instantly snatched away from me. i experience a lot of physical and mental symptoms that also make me feel like i'm slowly decaying. it feels like my cognitive function and thought process is horrible and has drastically eroded over the years (i'm 20), and i am constantly physically ill or sick or in pain in one way or another. this is just the tip of the iceberg, and i could most certainly go further in detail why i feel this way, but i guess the bright side is that i have a psychiatrist i recently got in touch with that i can see in a week or two to talk about this with if the feelings continue. even if i feel like they'll only be there to tell me what i'm feeling isn't real, and that i am alive, and everyone around me is real. it does not feel that way. my brain completely rejects the thought immediately upon considering it. this is more of a ""vent"" than anything else, but if anyone can relate or ... i guess, offer anything else in terms of moral/emotional support, i would appreciate it. i'm not very interested in trying to bring me back into reality or trying to ground me but if that is even allowed here it may help me more than i think it would, which is not at all. xp thank you for reading this wall of text, lol. obviously some ""part"" of me knows that this isn't the case if i'm posting here to begin with, but it feels like a very small ""logical over emotional"" part of my brain.",1965,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"cotard's syndrome? i used to haunt* these forums daily, but haven't for a long time, and suddenly today i found myself reading your post. as a great believer in synchronicity, and because your post may be the first genuine and heartfelt thing i've read in some time, i decided to register and make my first-ever post. i, too, have experienced what you describe: so many things about reality right now are different from how i remember them being before a series of traumatic personal experiences befell, and i have wondered if i am in some kind of afterlife limbo (the bardo, as it is described in the tibetan book of the dead ), and my daily experiences are in some way either self-inflicted or imposed by some unimaginable and seemingly omnipotent external force. there is no advice i can offer, since i'm as much in the dark as anybody regarding the nature of my plight. in myself, i understand this as a kind of psychosis, and i have been advocating for my own treatment and doing my best to comply with the medical advice i have received. it isn't always easy when, as you described, each day is very like the previous, but since i trust that these medical professionals, for the most part, have my best interests at heart, i figure that if this really is the bardo, then the best thing i can do is remain receptive and alert so that i can more easily absorb whatever lessons i'm being taught, or undergo whatever purification process it offers. i have no illusion that absolutely every body around is trying to help, and indeed, there may be some who, for whatever reason, try to thwart my progress. i can't say for certain whether they're all npcs or if there are simply individuals who have a polar alignment opposite to my own and are reliably deceptive, but over time it has become easier to sense who can be trusted, and how far. but i do not believe that such a state of affairs can be permanent, or that its purpose is solely to punish transgressors. it seems more and more obvious that my experiences are informed by my expectations, and my environment is most likely to be filled with the things i pay most attention to. this is where things veer off into frankly mystical territory, so take it with a grain of salt, but there's a strange kind of tautology at work hei'm certain that the experience of my senses cannot under normal circumstances be an accurate and complete reflection of how the universe truly is, but it seems impossible that there would be anything here that doesn't contribute by its presence to the wholeness of everything, so at some point i must have proved some worth, and i find myself incredibly fortunate to be having this experience. i guess i'm just hoping that you will not succumb to despair and hopelessness. it sounds hokey and kind of unrealistic for me to say so, but each day really is a gift, or it can be if seen with a certain openness and relaxed willingness to connect with and participate in the experiences it presents. at the same time, no truth i have found externally has stood the test of experience, and i've concluded that, ultimately, the truth that can be found is only that which i will discover within. the inner work is often the most difficult, and i think it yields the most profound and lasting results. i hope you're feeling well and optimistic today, and i'm grateful that i had the opportunity to read and respond to your post. -- * i guess that's a pun, although i wasn't intending it at the moment.",1966,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
needing help about my delusional friend pls help hello everyone.. i registered here because i need to ask someone for advice about my friend. she is driving me to the point of seeking a restraining order against her. i'm sorry i'm advance since english is not my first language. i never heard this ever happened to anyone before and i think that my friend needs some serious help. first of all i am a female and my friend is also a female. i'm not married but she is. to a wonderful guy. we meet at a party about 2 years ago. she and i became good friends after only few months. don't get me wrong she is a great friend. her hubby is a great guy. now this is the weird part. my friend is obsessed with past lives and reincarnations and such. nothing wrong with that. at least that's what i thought so. few months ago she changed quite a lot towards me. i don't know if this goes under delusions but... few months ago she asked to see me for coffee. she was very serious and acting nervous. she stared taking that she found out about her past life. didn't wanna tell me how. the weirdest part she said to me is that she knows who i was in my past life. she is convinced i was her husband?? like what? that she and i lived during the 2nd world war. according to her she was a nurse and i was a pilot for russian air force lol first i laughed and told her she probably just had a dream. she was so insulted she literally slapped me and said all kinds of weird things. that this is serious and we needed to explore this further and so on. still i though she was joking. since then she calls me every day she comes almost every second day to my place with her rambling about us being married and so on. i told her to please go talk to someone. again she acted so insulted. her delusions are worse and worse every day. two days ago she literally locked me up in my place demanded me to believe her. she became violent and i feared for my safety so i told her i believed her. she hugged me and finally went about her day. later i called her and politely asked her why she thinks i was her husband and what she wants me to do about it now. she went silent then said to me: i don't know. i asked her did you talk to your hubby about this and she says to me; you are my hubby omfg i started to yell and basically lost my temper. told her i'm not gay she is not gay and that she should go to her real bio male husband and to leave me the f... alone. she got mad and serious. she said that i insulted her and that i will pay for this. now i'm scared. i'm shocked and bewildered and i don't know what to do. should i tell her husband? should i report her to the police for harassment? the thruth is that i don't know if she is really mentally ill or what is going on? she did have some severe stress at work. is this some kind of a delusion? or psychotic break or what? did anyone ever heard about something like this? please help. any advice would be appreciated. thanks you in advance.,1967,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"needing help about my delusional friend pls help i've just googled reincarnation delusion and found some ""psychic"" websites that ""teach"" you how to gain access to your past lives. it's possible that this might not be a delusion if she's interested in this stuff and has consciously concocted a past life based on familiar people / things around her (which just happens to include you). one obvious thing in your post is that challenging her belief causes her to react badly, so i wouldn't do that. aside from that, avoid being alone with her, if you think she's a danger to you. if you no longer want to be her friend, gradually lose contact. this is kinder than ghosting. if you ghost her, she may remain invested in you and wonder why you suddenly broke off contact. an easy way to do this is just be ""busy"" and ""busier"" than you were, which is leaving you with no time for friendships (that's your excuse). in time, just drift apart, without any hurt feelings. if you still want to be her friend then, ask questions, rather than denying her experience, so you can figure out where all this is coming from (without judgment), i.e. whether she's actually suffering from mental illness or she just believes in ""psychic / mystic"" things.",1970,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"entanglement #boudaries #consentmatters apparently, anybody can touch your body’s privates and get away with it. that was my takeaway from talking with the municipality. on last saturday, a comedian leaned in. when the picture was taken, i thought it was his stomach pressing into me as it was happening. it wasn’t till the next day when i looked at the photo that i got the joke. in the photo my eyes show a laughable expression of alarm, when you zoom in. at first, i too thought the expression was funny, until i realized, this violation touches complex trauma wounds. not a modern joke at all. this is an old school romance move and it’s unhealthy humor, it’s not cool (old school romance is defined best by “beyond heaving bosom’s: the smart bitc#es guide to romance”). in the late 90’s the romance writers of america association banned rape and rape culture from mass media content, this started the evolution of new school romance. i want new school romance with actions in the context of healthy relationships. #consentmatters #notajoke. this is past the point of funny. the comedian did not ask for consent and i do not have a consensual relationship with him that would allow such public familiarity. i am not okay with this. it didn’t happen because i was dressed sexy, case in point, my basic long green dress. i was not drinking. i quit alcohol a while ago. although i drank for years to cope with the last time a man violated. the original trauma that i couldn’t make sense of happened during an exam while experiencing orgasmic labor at the birth of my daughter. it took me 15 years to process that trauma to be able to respond with a healthy ability to hold my boundaries. by the time i reported it to the medical board it was 15 years after the incident, it was past the 5-year statute of limitations. but what’s 10 years when you are healing trauma? healing is slow with these types of wounds. that is my experience anyway. on monday evening, i decided to make my own moves: • i called the sexual assault hotline and looked up my rights at http://www.rainn.org . • i went and made a report to the pd. i chose to enforce my boundaries. this is a health issue regardless of age, race, ethnicity, gender, and disability status. last time i waited to act i suffered for years without healing, stuck in my issue and getting stuck in the energy of entanglement. i’m not gonna play around with the idea that “someday he will love me.” i’m past that place. i got sick of telling my story sadly, years ago. that was the whole purpose for choosing stand-up comedy. then this fool touches my trauma and i have the picture of it as a bad reminder that comedy needs to evolve. that is right mr. comedian, that’s you. i do not accept it. my ability to put up with sexual misconduct has been depleted when the physician abused his power at the birth of my daughter then i lost my mental health. i don’t have the privilege to laugh this off. last time a man with power abused his power i wrote a book. this time you get this post. this is about me having agency and holding healthy boundaries. why does the city get to decide i don’t i have rights against sexual misconduct? today 11/11/2021, veteran’s day, i got a call from the pd. the municipality refused to act on my report. my take away: guard you’re a$$ and tits ladies and gentlemen. apparently, anybody can touch your body’s privates and get away with it. the hotline #, i’ve needed it 5 times already. i only want sexual contact and intimacy within the context of a healthy relationship. comedian, this wasn’t a healthy move. please don’t assume every woman wants sexual touches. i assure you, i want a healthy relationship, and this isn’t it. violating a woman and not having a relationship where she is satisfied is just wrong. please don’t touch without consent. #consentmatters #thecomedian #humanrights #boundaries public apology - dialogue matters dear friends, family, and the comedian, i want to apologize to friends, family, and especially to the comedian. i'll start out with full disclosure, i have serious mental illness and have been struggling with inflammation and to be honest, my mental health has not been 100%. it varies day by day with my personal issue (i have a problem - causing inflammation and impacting my wellness). i do not say that as an excuse for my actions, but if i was 100% i would like to think i would have done better. not that i want you all up in my business, but i was feeling really lousy about this situation. and i believe honesty is the best policy. i want to explain what happened, and what i learned, and what i hope for in the future. 1. i posted a long post on social media that consent matters. i perceived that the comedian had touched my breast during a public photo opportunity. some agreed with my perception of the picture, some could care less, for some it induced trauma, and many others were confused, i'm sorry for adding to everyone's trauma. it isn't that i didn't perceive it, but after talking with my therapist, i realized i needed to have a healthy conversation with the comedian if i want to try to heal. 2. in reflecting, i've experienced samsara, duality, and delusion before, so honestly, at this point, it doesn't matter if he touched me or not. my therapist believed i needed to talk with the comedian to process this event better for my own ability to heal. my narrative was just that, one-sided, without the perception of others involved. 3. when the comedian and i had a brief dialogue, i understood that he had no intention of a cruel joke, harming, violating, or even touching me. i realized the intent wasn't there. it was not my finest moment mentally having gone out on a limb with the picture on social media saying to guard your privates. my social media narrative didn't help the situation. while i agree that consent matters, after communicating with the comedian's loyal fans - who convinced me to take the post down and listen. people said, ""this comedian lives by his values."" that made me think i needed a better way to understand my perception. i have character and have lived differently enough to know my narrative isn't always reliable, and my therapist is right, dialogue matters. plus, i have no interest in harming anyone's career. 4. the comedian is really the funniest comedian who's come through town. i would like to humbly apologize to all of you. i have another issue of a deeper trauma that i've been stuck trying to heal for over 15 years. this time, i developed a fear that i'd feel trapped the same way struggling with this perceived violation. thankfully, i hope to heal from this matter with the comedian better than the last issue where i perceived that exam with the physician as a violation. 5. if i could go back, i would have had a dialogue directly with the comedian about the issue prior to going to report it through posting all over social media. the comedian and i deserve to treat each other as fellow human beings and have a dialogue about what happened. today, i think the united states is falling to $#%^ because people aren't having these conversations. the legal system sucks for dealing with things, it takes too long, there is little healing, and a lot of wrongs are being done by the system. i needed to hear the comedian's point of view to find a common ground to listen and understand what the heck happened. this world is wild with video everywhere, and we need to connect and understand all the information - especially together. i want a world where everyone wants to be and that means i want to listen and understand more. i want people to talk with me to find common ground when i'm hurt. i'm human, not perfect, but trying to do better. 6. i thought railing against the issue of my perceived violation would make it better. turns out i felt worse than if i'd sucked it up and tried to cope with my perception in isolation. with any social issue, we need a social solution. there was a need for dialogue and inclusion. isolation is about the worst thing for mental health. we need more conversation and dialogue. 7. thank you to m. a super fan for helping to raise my awareness of how this issue was traumatizing and irresponsible. i'm sorry. 8. thank you for reading this long commentary. please accept my sincere apology. next time i think about posting, i'm gonna try having a real conversation instead. i wish i'd called someone sooner. i am truly sorry for any emotional response my earlier post may have brought. in reflecting on this i've decided to take a vacation from social media (after this post to make amends to the comedian). sunny i quit social media because the narratives attached to this were trying to make it about something else. social media is not good for mental health. i wish for hope and healing. it wasn't really fair to have this up here without the picture of the issue.

"paranormal living so there i was sitting at my desk. in a moment of weakness, i searched for changes to a playlist. shortly after i pressed the search button, there was a crackling noise, and a bit of ink appeared on one of my comedy flashcards. i studied the watermark and it looked like a heart shape. not perfect, but close. i looked at the ceiling to see if something fell, then tried to scratch it, to see if it was a piece of pastry from my almond croissant earlier. it wouldn't come off. it was as if someone drew on my flashcard with a tiny fountain pen. when i turned over the card it was my lucky number 3. a bit that jokes about experiencing the ghost of my daughter's grandfather...

"paranormal living part i in the spring of 2015, on my way home from work, i was almost to second avenue and 24th street heading towards the nearest train. by the time i dragged my pumps around the corner i saw some commotion on 2nd avenue. a woman dropped a quarter and i thought it vanished from sight. it disappeared from the surface of the pavement. it wasn’t that it had rolled away, it evaporated into thin air with all our eyes on it, as if we were hypnotized to watch it. two businessmen were walking down the street, towards three women heading uptown. i overheard their exchange about the coin. they all were looking down. “where’d it go?” the man asked with the midwestern accent. “it vanished into thin air,” an older lady dressed as if she could have just come from church said in disbelief. “that’s crazy,” her friend said shaking her well plastered hair. “impossible,” the other man said peering through thick glasses. a third woman in sandals walked down the steps to look on the ground there, as if the quarter rolled out of sight. the midwesterner reached into the pocket of his khakis. “here you go, i don’t need this one,” he said handing the first lady a shiny new quarter. i walked around the group as they continued to search for the lost coin, baffled at its disappearance. i relaxed when this happened. reassured by the midwesterner’s generosity and the experience of the coin. i felt connected to the east village and gramercy through my routine walks along their sidewalks. but when the coin was taken from the sidewalk where the woman dropped it near 24th street, i felt that something more powerful in the universe linked to my reality. as soon as i got home, i video called my friend, sophie. she remembered another story i’d told her. “yeah, i’m a little worried. i know the idea of time travel is delusional, right? but, could the coin have rolled back in time? could october have been the other end of a wormhole? back then, a coin appeared out of nowhere in that same spot.” i said hesitating a bit, knowing i must sound out of my mind. “oh my god, i remember you telling me,” sophie said letting her jaw drop open. in the fall, i had been worried about money and wasn’t sure about my future. i’d started to feel like if i didn’t have a solid financial situation, then i didn’t have value, but that was when the quarter rolled toward me. there was nobody else around. the quarter appeared out of nowhere in the center of the sidewalk, in front of me on my walk to work. at that moment i was thinking about my monetary value when the coin came to me. once i saw the coin, i gave up obsessing about money, but felt paranoid for a few days. i kept walking, freed from the ideas that i needed more money. that coin spoke to me in a deep way. it was a sign that someone somewhere had the ability to give or take away things. i believed my relationships with the people around me, and with whoever controlled that quarter and knew my thoughts were really what should matter. the coin was not under my control. in october 2014, i didn’t need the money as much as a symbol of worth, and seeing the coin appear out of thin air had shocked me awake. i didn’t chase the quarter, because i didn’t know where it came from. it made me a little paranoid that someone was watching, and playing with me. so, i let the coin roll down the steps to the paved patio and kept walking. “oh my god. a wormhole on 2nd avenue?” sophie questioned lifting her brows. “i don’t know, i searched for the “disappearing coin trick” and saw all sorts of magic tricks that can be played out. there is even one stunt in a café where they made a scene happen like out of a poltergeist movie. i don’t know how it happened, but it was reassuring to think that there is some other force watching out for us.” i said. “but how would they have known to roll it while you were thinking your self-worth was tied to finances?” sophie asked. i shrugged my shoulders. the strangeness that inspired much of my life over the past decade was made up of reality, but i worried. was i misunderstanding my surroundings? either i was getting sick again, with the experience with the coin, or something strange was happening around me. it isn’t that i asked for strange things to happen, they just did. and when they did, i tried to document them. everyone said it couldn’t be real, my family and providers said it was delusional. but i accepted treatment, i took effective medication. why did things keep happening? when the coin went missing or appeared out of nowhere, it made me wonder; what if it was real? i shrugged my shoulders. i didn’t want to believe my experience, because if it was true, then someone may be in control. had a magician, god, or some other intelligent life form played with me? i preferred to think i was just sick again. sophie had lived with me while she was in college. sophie knew strange things happened around me. things would be moved about, spices would go missing, just before i’d reach for it. the radio would turn on and off independent of being touched. and at times it spooked us. the doors would be unlocked when it should have been locked. the lights would at times flicker on or off without being commanded. sophie worried that somehow, i was at the center of something strange. i had confided a secret. it involved new hampshire. it was just weird enough that sophie thought spooks could be targeting me to drive me mad, to take away my credibility regarding the secret of the sexual abuse at jamie’s birth. sophie added the coin to the list with the radio, lights, lock, and spices. “look at it this way, at least you got to experience the coin. some people go their whole life without interesting things happening to them.” “ah, they probably have weird stuff happen to them, too. they probably just weren’t paying attention,” i said jokingly. “seriously, when things happen that are strange most people just ‘let it go’. like that time my keys were lost, and i found them in the freezer. you are not alone in this, you’ll be ok, just take it easy, and relax, it will sort out eventually. just keep documenting, someday they’ll understand,” sophie said concerned that maybe i wasn’t mad. for me only time could give me insight into the coin. 2017 eclipse the sun was high in the sky as i drove away from the beach. jamie sat next to me on our trip home to new york city. i’d rented a car to pick her up from a ymca camp near the delaware water gap in new jersey and we’d driven up to visit dr. mitchel’s family at their annual beach house vacation. their family invited us to share their time with them to help fill the void of loss. we backed away from the white house towards a small green mermaid statue at the edge of the sand dune. dr. mitchel had walked over to the fence in sandals and shorts. he’d lost a loved one to mental illness, and our relationship acted as a healing connection. at a yankee dental conference dinner with his wife in 2009 we’d shared stories that were deep and personal. i shared my story of the sexual abuse by a physician at the birth followed by the onset of mental illness, and i learned something fascinating about dr. mitchel’s wife’s beliefs. “we come into this world to help one another through this lifetime, and work toward our soul goals.” she said. over beef burgundy with pasta, we forged a healing relationship. dr. mitchel provided insight from his years of experience, and i gave him a way to try to heal his soul from feeling the pain of helplessness against losing someone special to mental illness. as we left the parking lot that summer day, he lowered the thin linked chain that cordoned off the entrance to the lot between the sand dune and the fence. he waited for us to slowly drive over the chain. then he refastened the metal to the hook to chain off the entrance, and we all waved goodbye. that morning the radio buzzed in preparation for a solar eclipse. jamie alternated between itunes dj, google maps navigator, and conversationalist. the sun was high in the sky when we pulled out of the parking space. we talked about her time at camp, her response to the letters i’d sent to her at camp. she scheduled a visit with her new best friend from camp. we started to plan for her going back to school and i explained my work schedule for the coming months. while we travelled along the eastern seaboard, i was hit hard by the thought that i’d missed so much of motherhood wrapped up in my thoughts about the birth. my heart tugged at the realization that i’d lost so much time in motherhood trying to heal from the memory of being sexually assaulted during the exam in childbirth. i’d never had a fiercer attraction than i felt for the man who touched me. when the physician violated my sacred space, regardless of his intentions, i broke in response. i’d never had anyone touch me like that who didn’t say they wanted me, too. i’d never been touched by someone who i didn’t have a consensual agreement with who i could love. after dr. richard’s touch, it was too much to try to reconcile the reality of my perception of his abuse with my fantasy of desire. i became trapped in the memory of his touch wanting forbidden love. he did not, and would never be able to love me. he was just doing his job. i was treated clinically rather than like the human i am. when i was put in the role of the patient, i was told it was time to examine my progress in labor. the system took my ability to protect my sacred space at the most vulnerable point in my life. would i have been allowed to say something? would the system have let me say he was too hot? in 2005, i don’t believe they would have accepted my desire to change providers without making it a big deal. both the fantasy and abusive reality were bad for jamie and me considering our situation. i was a 28 year old new mom, with jamie to care for, and reconciling the sexual experience required every free cell in my brain for years and years. due to my illness compounded by my preoccupation with the memory of the trauma and ptsd from the experience, i struggled over the years to stay in the moment. the radio tuned into a pop station as we approached 2:52 the time the 80% eclipse would begin. cars pulled over on the side of the road. drivers held their phones to the sky, tracking the sun above. i kept driving, noting that it was just a little less bright out. it wasn’t significant enough to stop. it didn’t impede my vision. the traffic in connecticut along 95 was heavy and slow. as i drove something happened to me. it was subtle, but profound. the feelings that had held me tight for over a dozen years released inside me. as we listened to music, it happened. jamie played total eclipse of the heart on repeat throughout the eclipse. after the eclipse we talked about the taylor swift trial verdict that i’d mentioned in one of the camp letters. i explained the significance for women everywhere, when a disc-jockey was found guilty of groping her. she was not held to blame for his losing his job over his actions, and counter sued for a dollar for the grope. i had a personal reaction to the events of the swift trial. i went back in my memory and considered my experience from a new perspective. silently, i reflected as the music played and jamie texted with all her new friends in a group chat. her phone was blowing up with hundreds of comments, it chimed like extra beats in the music. we laughed as it took on a beat of its own, and she silenced her device to a vibration. the chuckles pained me. i felt upset at the memory of dr. richard’s touch in my sacred space and how it had taken such a deep root inside me. i grieved about the time i’d lost as a mother, and how jamie had been hurt by my inability to move past the memory of not being loved by jack or dr. richard. but i was determined not to wallow any more. i recognized that i have the rest of my life to be the mother the way i’d set out to do when i started trying to conceive jamie. i hoped that she would heal from the pain of not feeling unconditional love. for the longest time i didn’t know how to love. after everything i went through, i didn’t like myself for a while. i tried to love jamie the best i could, but not loving myself, i didn’t have the resources to meet her needs emotionally. it wasn’t until i broke free from jack that i began to heal my heart, and learned to love myself and began to fulfill jamie’s emotional needs. she’d been raised with a form of unsatisfying and conditional love from jack. it was a love based on a behaviorists world view. when she behaved as her father wanted she was rewarded with feeling his conditional love. my love was unreliable for her due to my medication sedation, and illness. these ailments physically limited me. she was still rightfully angry that i wasn’t a better mom for her. she compared her experience with her friends. “you failed me so many times, i’ve lost my trust in you through years of disappointments and broken promises.” she said. “i’m trying. i want to be the mom i set out to be when i planned to have you. i’m sorry i got sick, and i know i need to do a better job as a mom.” i said. “you shouldn’t have had me if you couldn’t handle it.” she said. “i was well when i conceived you, i had no idea i would get so sick. even if i had known i’d get sick, i still would have had you, because you are the best part of my life. i love you more than anything, and you are my connection to the future.” i said getting teary eyed. “i don’t believe you. if that was true, you wouldn’t smoke.” she said. “i’m quitting. we have to go on a tight budget this fall, and i’m giving up all the expensive things that are not essential.” i said. “good. you know how upset it makes me to see you killing yourself with cigarettes and alcohol.” she said. we continued to plan for the fall. she made a list of all the clothes she needed for the fall, and we talked about how we would make our budget work. jamie was the best seventh grader i’d ever known. she understood our situation, in some ways she understood things better than me. i loved how she was bright and intelligent. my heart squeezed with love, and painful regret and guilt for all the time i’d been captivated by the memory of the trauma of the touch from dr. richard and not being loved through the experience. in that moment i realized, i’d never really be able to love the physician who’d put me on this path without the world changing and understanding from a higher level a higher love. for the first time in my life, i began to feel upset for jamie and the injustice she’d endured due to my experience. jamie was such a great kid. she was a member of the principal’s council, the student government group at her school. her leadership qualities were strong, her logic was sound, and her intelligence keen. i couldn’t remember a time when jamie hadn’t been correct in her assessment from her perspective. the issue i had with her perspective is that it was not always grounded in love and trust, and i felt responsible for that weakness. over the next few weeks we shopped for school clothes, supplies, and i signed her up for riding lessons at the barn. even if her and my relationship was still healing, she had a healing relationship with the horses at the last barn in brooklyn. i trusted that even if she didn’t feel good about her relationship with her dad and me, she looked forward to riding. i knew that gave her something in life to love. even though we didn’t have much money to spend on things, i made sure to pay the bill for her horse riding lessons. by the middle of the month i took the bus up to albany, ny to run a meeting for my professional association. i’d been elected as president shortly after i’d published my book, a mental health advocacy story i’d published as “fiction, based on a true story”. i mean, how else do you publish delusional memoir? i’d shared the book, and even having read “all in her head” the house of delegates for the new york dental hygienists’ association elected me as president. on the bus ride home in september 2017, i googled something i’d just learned about, the mandela effect. the mandela effect was first noted by fiona broome a paranormal expert who attended a dragon con event in 2011 and a group of individuals had alternate memories regarding president nelson mandela. fiona broome remembered a story where mandela had died in a prison in the 1980s. he’d lived through that time to become president of south africa and didn’t pass until after 2013. i wanted desperately to understand my reality and these strange phenomena where many people were affected with the same shared memories unnerved me. the mandela effect opened many questions for me. i’d remembered books from my childhood were berenstein, not berenstain; i remembered the portrait of dorian gray not the picture of dorian gray, and hadn’t it always been sex in the city, not sex and the city. these small but memorable changes had crept into my memory bank, and this time i was experiencing something that i wasn’t alone with. up to 20% of millenials and generation x’ers were mandela effected. most disturbing to me were the changes in my recollection of geography. according to news stories there was a terrible hurricane, named maria, in the atlantic ocean. i read and overheard people talking about puerto rico described as the 52nd state. i’d remembered it as a territory rather than a full state. i remembered the flag had 50 stars because there were 50 states. however, i returned to understanding that the group consciousness agrees with me that there are 50 states. when i exhausted the news on the mandela effect, i meditated on my emotional response to the time i’d lost on my journey through motherhood to the memory of the physician’s touch. tears fell from my eyes at the injustice jamie had suffered due to my inability to release the trauma of the memory of his assault. jamie was with her dad that night. i got home from my trip after midnight. on monday morning september 18, 2017 after i walked jamie to the train for school, i finally came to a new conclusion. i didn’t feel right blaming or holding the physician accountable for my grief for jamie. i decided that forgiveness was the best way forward. i found peace in my decision to love myself. i forgave myself and the physician. my phone buzzed with a reminder from my step mom jill to take my medicine. when i reached for my pill bottle, which should have been half full, it was empty. it scared me. i’d noticed spices and things around the house coming and going again. like the fingernail clippers the year before. september 2016 last night i went to bar chord. i sat at a picnic table in the backyard where the murals are painted. it was the first free night i’ve had in a while, jamie was at her dad’s. one thing led to another and i ended up going home with an artist. i hadn’t meant for it to happen. i learned the artist was married, and i knew that it was wrong for me, but it felt so nice to connect. so intense. i liked it intense. part of me worries i’m playing with fire. i don’t know how i’ll feel once i bond with him. in a weird way, he feels like my equal. i like that, but i know i could never trust him. i worry it will turn into a dark and unhappy space for me. i think about dr. richard and it makes me cry. i know, that will never happen, but i still want dr. richard. people like the artist help me forget how sad i feel about not knowing dr. richard. october 2016 last week i looked everywhere for the fingernail clippers. they disappeared from the place i expected them to be. the small china cup that held the clippers was missing. i searched and searched, the kitchen, bathroom, closets, my daughters room, her closet, my boxes of things. it was 1:30 am by the time i gave up. everywhere i looked there were no clippers. i finally found a fingernail file, a gift from the empire conference i attended a few years ago. i grated down my nails irritated at the missing clippers. then tonight, when my friend, the artist, asked to smoke a cigarette, i went to get something to take to the terrace to ash in, and there it was: the small porcelain tea cup with the fingernail clippers. it was sitting right there, right where it was supposed to be last saturday when it was missing. “it’s back,” i said. “what?” my friend asked. “the ashtray went missing, and now it is right here. do i have selective vision? how did i not see it before? how is that possible?” i asked. my friend had no idea the significance of my find. he was oblivious to the irritation i experienced last sunday night at 1:30am. i had searched and searched for the clippers and that tea cup. i would swear on my life that it was not there just last sunday, but it returned to me today. it was a full moon, and i told my friend the artist that i couldn’t be intimate with him anymore. i felt too guilty having a relationship with him. he had commitments outside of the connection we shared. so, i told him i needed distance. he played some songs for me on youtube, then i said it was time to walk the dog. we said a hurried goodbye, and i returned home to consider the significance of the reappearance of the nail clippers. i wondered if it had something to do with my email. i’d told everything, the truth of my story. i felt reassured when things i needed were returned. if ever something goes missing and isn’t returned i’ll worry that my protectors failed. for now, i feel safe. when my medication went missing the morning of september 18th, 2017, i worried that i wasn’t supposed to take the medication. in my state of fear, i lied to my family about taking my medication. on tuesday, i went to work. i’ve been told that the medication doesn’t leave your system for some time. i didn’t feel like a threat to myself or others, so i didn’t consider going to work a problem having missed my dose of medication. i slept okay that night, not as soundly as i usually do, but i made it to work on time. it was a good day, filled with positive interactions with student learners in the clinic and their patients. however, the computer system axium was acting up. with one of the patients the odontogram where the teeth are charted on the computer screen said a front tooth was missing, but looking in the mouth and looking at the x-rays, the tooth existed in real life. we couldn’t figure out how to make the tooth appear on the chart. i brought over dr. burns and she confirmed the tooth was there, then we emailed everyone in it to address the computer glitch. it unnerved me because i’d read a story about the mysterious planet nerbu x in our solar system. i was starting to see signs in my environment, and this error message made me wonder if axium, our flawed electronic dental records system, might be a metaphor about our world. like nerbu x, the glitch in the system was showing the tooth as missing when it was actually present in real life. after that, every time something happened, the error messages in axium would give me warnings. it had me on edge. “i don’t know why it is giving us all these error messages,” i told one student i was working with. “i know, i’ve never seen it be this bad before.” she said. “if i didn’t know better, i’d say it was a sentinel being.” i said half joking, half serious. “what does that mean, sentinel,” she asked. “a sentinel being is something with consciousness,” i said. everyone in the cubical chuckled as we dismissed the error message and the signatures were accepted. at home that night i was getting more messages in the form of things appearing around the apartment. a stray orange gatorade bottle appeared in the fridge half empty. we didn’t know where it came from. then, the radio was also acted up. it turned on randomly to sing pop music with lyrics that were a little different than i’d remembered them. in response to my decompensation, i created a key to interpret the signs and signals. the key used the alphabet to interpret signs using my assigned protective concepts. i used the semantics reading the words in the reverse direction. for instance, “trump” meant: “plan. god, you are thankful.” trump t thankful r are u you m god p plan when strange things happened, i’d use my key composed of protective concepts to guard me from fear of the experience. i believed i was being saved by semantics, a form of a game. it felt as if mythology was real dealing with my experience of being played with. wednesday morning came, and the morning was going well until 10:30am. i walked over to the reception desk on the fourth floor by the cd side of the clinic floor. each clinic floor was divided into sections: ab/cd. i saw a grey metal hole punch with “cd4” etched by a dental drill. when i saw the shaky hand scratched letters i became afraid. explosive, i thought when i repeated cd4 in my mind. the chakra at the back of my neck opened in fear. then, the fire alarm sounded as i stood in front of the reception desk and printer. it howled throughout the building the second after i had my fearful thought. unsure what was going on, i walked back to my students who had just finished the final step i’d assigned. i’d already checked everything else. we dismissed the patient beneath the ringing sirens, and flashing lights. there were lines at the stairs as the building evacuated. my students asked me if i was afraid. “no, i have faith in a higher power,” i said and made eye contact with the people nearby on the stairs as we waited to descend. i prayed to god for protection from the siren and the fear of an explosive. when we got outside the sun was so bright and warm. it was a beautiful september day. i took a deep breath, and after a few minutes they let us back into the building. that night i got home and hugged jamie tight. we made dinner after she finished homework. i set out my bag for work the next day in queens. when i went down to walk buddy, i read the dramatic news stories between trump and kim jong-un. the stories were so funny when i used my key to interpret the news, that it made me laugh hard. the belief system was rooted in a deep level of feminism, whereby women could take back power in the world through withholding climax from their men for the sake of world peace. a car parked along the service road began to blink with the right turn signal on. the car was empty. it almost felt like the lights were laughing with me. for as long as i could remember, when i walked buddy the automated lights we passed would shut off in response to our presence. i worried that somehow the lights were responding to buddy and me. it bothered me that my presence caused darkness. i’ve always preferred bright lights. brightness diminished my perception of bokeh or light refractions on the lenses of my glasses and helped reduce my perception of auras that sometimes surround people and objects. i took the f train thursday morning to queens. i sat at my desk in the morning light and looked over kew gardens. the lush greenery of early fall had yet to turn into autumn splendor. class began on time and i worked with students in anatomy lab to support their learning. things were going well with the exception of my issue with flickering lights following me. as we entered the clinic the lights started to blink. the small led lights flashed like we were at a disco. even the large overhead lights would randomly turn on and off. “these lights are weird, it’s like supernatural.” one student said spooked by the strange phenomena. “it’ll be ok. just think of it as ambient lighting,” i said trying to reassure her. “i guess, but i’ve never seen anything like this. do you think it will be ok when we have patients?” she asked. “i’m sure it will stabilize before we see patients.” i said. a man came in from the side door to the clinic and flipped off and on the light switch observing the unusual lighting effects. he tried every switch near the door trying to figure out which switches were impacted. “are you here to fix the lights?” i asked. “i’m the electrician. it’s something happening with the transformer,” he said. we all chucked at the twinkling lights above. after he moved to the other end of the clinic floor, the student and i began to work. “welcome to supportive learning,” i said. “my goal is to help you to review any content you may not have gotten right the first time and help you to review your study habits so that you can build both your core knowledge and your process knowledge. by that i mean the things you memorize – core knowledge. and how you learn or check your knowledge base – process knowledge,” i said. i noticed that it was emotionally challenging for students to feel like they’d failed when they missed questions. i reassured them that by reviewing things and approaching the errors with a growth mindset, where learning is a process and not a fixed objective, they’d make it through their educational journey as life-long learners, and i worked to reassure them that the knowledge base in the profession was expanding rapidly. “when i was a student, the difference between non-succedaneous and succedaneous, was not core knowledge that i retained. the injustice in the dental educational system is that it abuses student hygienists by making you pay for and learn more than an associate’s degree, then it fails to give you full recognition, but don’t worry, this program’s master plan allows you to put your earned hours towards a baccalaureate degree. sorry, i’m getting off topic.” i said, and we returned to the corrections. i asked the students to open their text books and find the text with the correct answers, underline the text, then write the terminology in a notebook to make flashcards later. “this will help you to learn your source material and be able to easily access where your knowledge came from at a later date,” i said beneath the twinkling clinic lights. i believed my higher power was showing me through these student’s lessons a simple truth. i thought the instructions had two meanings. one was teaching students how to find their sources and become researchers. second, these instructions could be used later for determining that we live in a multiverse. i knew i’d never be able to prove or disprove my belief in a higher power and how i’d been shown the multiverse. i read something about “disco lights” and the prophesy of jesus. i wondered if someone was playing with me again, or if my reality was being influenced by a higher power. that night jamie was at a friend’s home. new york city public schools were closed for the jewish and islamic holidays. i reached her about 6pm, and we both felt tired and hungry. by the time we got home, it was past time to eat. i fed jamie a quick snack, and started heating water, and chopping garlic and peeling potatoes for a meal of fried catfish and garlic mashed potatoes. buddy stayed by my feet hoping for me to miss the trash can or drop a scrap. i changed his water when he scraped at his bowl. i searched for the recipe for the catfish meal but couldn’t find it. rather than abandon the attempt at cooking, i decided to use the quality ingredients delivered earlier that week and rely on my skills as a cook. i dipped the catfish in an egg batter then dredged it in flour and added some ground sage before frying it in the buttered pan. in the other pot the potatoes boiled with the garlic. the raspberries and whip cream topped snack had improved jamie’s mood. she joined me for our meal that night. we talked about how our budget was working. she continued to understand the limitations of the budget. i didn’t share my concerns with her about the fire alarm, the “disco lights” at work, or the missing menu card. instead we focused on her. she wasn’t feeling well. her sinuses and “allergies” were acting up. i suggested we rest the next day. “i’m not feeling very well,” i said. i was beginning to feel transient physical, visual, tactile, and other sensory symptoms of medication withdrawal and amplification of psychotic symptoms and an altered perception of reality. i was too sick to think of the consequences of going off medication cold turkey. the burning skin was back, in addition to pins and needles, heartache, chills, burning souls of my feet, chakra bursts, pulsing energy, etc. the list of my symptoms was starting to grow. “i’m not either and i have so much homework. i have to write pages and pages for english.” she said. i was struggling with fear and fatigue, and our home showed it. there was stuff on the chairs in the living room, i needed to do laundry, scrub the kitchen, and pick up the laundry on the bathroom floor. plus, i needed to take out the trash. the building’s trash shoot was closed off for renovation, meaning i had to walk outside to the curb with the trash, and i hadn’t done any house work since the previous weekend. it just felt like too much. jamie was old enough to help but she told me it was my responsibility not hers. i tried to explain that we were a team, but she would get upset because her teachers had overwhelmed her with assignments. i chose not to argue. instead, i took down the smelly trash when i walked buddy. as i walked buddy, i noticed my surroundings. there were police in the neighborhood that night. a long nypd van with 6-8 officers sitting inside looking at their cell phones was parked at the corner of ditmas ave. and ocean parkway. i read nypd “delusional plan. why, nation.” it made total sense that we needed police, to protect against some people’s delusional plans. fortunately, my plan was the love orgasm plan. i felt safe within my semantic game. buddy and i walked past the nypd van to cross ditmas. i saw a captivating woman in the crosswalk. she stopped dead in her tracks when she saw buddy. she lifted her gaze to mine. she wore a wool skirt and shall wrapped around her shoulders. she connected with me through thick glasses. she looked young for such a look, and when our eyes met, the pain in my chest lifted. i walked buddy past her path to clear the way for her to get out of the middle of the lane and thought about her calming gaze for much of the rest of the walk. her stare helped me feel comforted. that night was to be the fall equinox, and that witchy woman’s gaze soothed my pain. we passed down the block past the rose bushes to the corner of webster, where buddy always marks the corner of the fence. as i looked down at the bushes inside the fence, my vision went to black for a split second. when i could see again, i saw a black and brown spotted tabby cat sitting between the bushes with a downcast gaze. the second before i’d only seen dirt between the bushes. i felt safe with this animal there. buddy was indifferent stopping to smell the patch of grass in front of the fence. knowing that woman’s gaze helped me and being watched by the local wildlife (stray cats) reassured me. this night the lights stayed on as we passed by the buildings. i wondered if the cat was a shapeshifter, or if i’d slid between the veil. jamie was in bed by the time we arrived home that night. i felt exhausted. i threw off my shoes and climbed in bed. but my mind was a buzz. high on a mixture of curiosity, fear, and hope, i couldn’t stop my thoughts. they just wouldn’t turn off. they slowly progressed. my mind wasn’t racing, it awakened to a new type of processing. my thinking lifted. i could no longer perceive time normally. the months of the year were hard to recall. i struggled to schedule tasks. however, my ability to play a game with semantics wildly expanded. when i wrote notes about my experience on the computer screen, a text box appeared. it simply said, “compare and contrast”. the message assigned me a task to look for contradictions and contrasting events. what i learned as i played this game was that it was inappropriate when reading about death, dying, or most news of sadness or terror. as i read the news, i listened to music on itunes, iheartradio, and from my radio. everything felt predetermined and intentional. did someone know my thoughts? when they didn’t like what i was thinking, the phone froze, song paused, or a new story launched for me to read. the devices controlled my perception. when i asked if the fire alarm was their doing, they were perplexed. “you mean you don’t know?” the text in the browser asked me. when i searched my memories trying to know what i didn’t know, that was when the browser launched independent of my key strokes to a news story. it was an article about durga, the hindu goddess of justice appeared from the american institute of vedic studies. i’ve been feeling for a long time that someone was helping me through my struggles with mental illness. the great mother goddess, who appears as durga has been given many powers by gods and goddesses. she is a super power in the realm of the supernatural. i tried to understand the significance of this information. the songs on the radio sang sweet love ballads. it made me wonder if maybe god loved me. i kept sinking low when i had the thought that only god would love me. my dating life was fun, but when i reflected on the inability of the men in my life to love me through my mental illness, my heart ached. i wanted unconditional love. the type people at church talked about in my youth. when i thought that god loved me romantically, it was a powerful aphrodisiac. i liked it, but i sank low when i thought of how i felt about the men in my life. pulling back from the memory of the men who’d failed me, i lifted my mind, and thought about my history of my romance with god. i couldn’t forget the way i’d taken my virginity. the first time i’d had sex was with jamie’s father, jack, which was true. but, i’d climaxed before that on my own. i’d used the most powerful thing i could think of in high school. i fantasized about god. i knew it was wrong, but it was fun. part ii durga’s plot while i was coming to grips with my new understanding, and the intensity of the grandiose idea of god’s love. the messages continued. from a combination of the text on the screen, music on the radio, and my thinking i came to believe that durga and the angels of heaven or gods, depending on what religion you used to try to describe the higher order of our subjective reality and the higher realm of power. i believed that durga plotted with others to design a “bad romance” whereby all religion paints the backstory for this love affair with the third eye, a higher power, and sexuality. in romance writing the force is the thing that brings two characters together so that a romance can blossom. in my story that force was the concept of healing. someone in the higher dimension thought of using “healing” as the force to bring god into proximity long enough for humanity to fall in love romantically. in 2005, i broke when i couldn’t separate my fantasies of the physician from the reality of the abuse of his exam during my labor at the time of my daughter’s birth. then my husband didn’t love me through the experience, and i struggled. i believed that god was slowly healing me through time, and modern interference. until the 2017 eclipse, i was unable to conceive of my experience as sexual abuse. i wanted to believe in the physician’s humanity and believe that he didn’t intend to assert his power over me. but thinking back, i remembered the look on his face when my husband took a picture with the physician’s camera for a picture album cataloging all the deliveries he’d attended. his trophy collection. i couldn’t forget his cruel expression when the flash exposed him, i lost my mind as i tried to erase that memory. i wanted to love his humanity and failed to connect with reality in my attempt. the experience changed me. eventually i couldn’t sit with the anger, i didn’t like feeling that toxic, so i chose to forgive, but still, it left me forever touched, and the ramifications for my daughter and my relationship were significant and long term. when i deeply reflect on my perception, i am uncertain of any reality that is not verified. memory is subjective. it can be influenced and twisted by many forces. it was also the most vulnerable moment of my life. plus, with having experienced so many versions of reality in the multiverse during my illness*more later, i have stopped believing that there is a simple reality. the physician may be the well-intentioned version of himself, and not the power player i remember being touched by. anyway, at this point, the intention doesn’t matter. i perceived it in my reality, and i’ve forgiven him. he is free. i am free, too. i chose to love him unconditionally, regardless of his actions or my delusions. even though i don’t get to be with him in the physical world, i feel alive in my higher level connection to the universal source. i live in the light and live my life with love, and it feels divine. i am better not having him in the physical sphere. any connection to him is of a higher level. it only happens when i lift up and feel the energy rise within and through me. but i find sometimes we go to the sitting place in my mind and spend time being sad when i cannot lift beyond my visceral needs. i’d been through so much. a song played on my iphone by rockell who sang “show me the way.” the song wanted me to show the way. i couldn’t escape the reality that i need to care for my child, and i knew i was suffering with my illness. i knew i would need to return to medication to treat my illness and return to sanity, but i knew the side effects were severe with the medicines i took. after over a decade of medication compliance my body was suffering from the medication side effects. the smooth muscles throughout my body had become stiff. even breathing was at times labored and uncomfortable especially when wearing a constricting bra. instead of worrying about me, i started to worry about the physician and his world. i was told not to worry about the physician. i was told that when his time comes, he dies a peaceful death. the messages told me that on the journey through to heaven, god (or whoever was playing with the messages) looked back in the rear-view mirror and saw an image of his likeness in the physician. who knows, maybe durga forced him to do it. there was a country love song about those two meeting in the back of an old bar and falling in love. i think maybe it was all an elaborate setup. when i focused, i worried about reality. i read news stories about the threat of nuclear war. then the messages started coming. i was instructed that i had to decide the future with my action. i was given the choice either to climax, or the world would be destroyed. the messages told me our futures were at stake. thinking of my role as a mother, of course i chose to climax. what was the worst that could happen if i pleasured myself? it was so strange feeling as if someone could read my mind and control me so intensely. however, i never felt my free will was taken. despite being played with so completely, the choice to act was always mine. although, the perversion of psychosis is real. i felt coerced into action. it was my understanding that some higher power needed to ejaculate on the solstice, or the next thousand generation would be baron. somehow, i was the focus of the attention of the higher power and by climaxing i believed this started a religious chain of events – beginning the rapture. my delusion of grandeur about the end times is a common theme in mental illness, although my experience of it may be different. granted, looking back on the scripture, my belief is impossible. the bible clearly states the pregnant woman gave birth with “labor pains” to a male child. and i didn’t have the wings of an eagle, i had mental illness and a half-written romance novel titled the “great blue heron”. at climax i felt a sensation of honey like energy spread over my body. i was vibrating so intensely, i felt like i was buzzing. the music on the radio sounded so alive and fresh to me. i felt high. that night i didn’t sleep. as i understood it, he needed to climax to reproduce to create a new heir for his family. somehow my climax helped him out. minutes later a story about a dynastic heir emerged in my news feed. when i stopped sleeping, my mind kept slowly thinking new thoughts. it wasn’t going fast, just slow and steady. i needed to consider to understand what was happening to me. i was captivated by the game, and my experience. throughout the night i read forwards with the authors intent, then applied my semantic language reading backwards in loose associations that i found to be ironic and funny to read. it felt like i was experiencing the feminine and masculine forces of the ethos. it created a funny and ironic balance. the basic protective concepts when placed together explained something about our god, who i came to understand as coming from a higher realm like magicians in a parallel universe. i believed he was king arthur, the king of heaven, and really the leader of islamic, jewish, and christian faiths, who is a masculine force. past experiences with things appearing and disappearing around me had altered my understanding and perception of time. when i shared this story with my writing group, they cautioned not to share it, because my story may be radically insensitive to religions around the world. but, i have lived experiences of mental illness that defy reality. i still remembered the story of the coin. unsure of what to do, i’ve kept my story silent for the most part. taking it out and working on it when i am able. when i read the signs, they explained that he (god, the male god) orgasms. i mean, we were made in his image, right? so, why wouldn’t he orgasm? “orgasms are,” i read when the messages told me to “grow.” the humor tickled me at the notion that durga, the supreme mother goddess had set up the author, my god, in a sort of a bad romance, where all world religions form the perfect backstory for the setup for this new mythological reality. she assisted using the character in my imaginary world “sunny” trying to help me through my mental illness. she’d plotted for arthur to work to heal me from the original sin of the physician’s abuse at the birth of my daughter, and to rebalance the male and female forces in the universe. even jesus worked into the backstory to create a reality where america exists as it can today to allow our higher power to fall in love. even the pope was part of the conspiracy to create a world where god can heal us all. the music sang to me with unusual lyrics to a song i had heard before. the lyrics were nothing like i remembered them. i’ve looked for the song and can’t find it in my library or locate the artist, but i remember the story vividly. the lyrics told me a story where god and others saw the holy light but failed to descend in time. “we’d just taken you to walk the plank. we were so surprised. it was so surreal. we didn’t look at what happened until it was too late.” the music said. putting it together with the messages i was reading in the news stories, i figured durga was who they saw in the light. they could see durga, because she is a goddess. their family in heaven share a third eye. they’d explained that they saw their family’s sins and sins committed against them. i saw into the third eye as i gave birth to jamie and looked into the holy light beyond the lotus. the flower opened with the purest light i’ve ever seen at the center. the lotus flowered during the transition in my labor hours before i gave birth. i sat and breathed deeply and used techniques i learned in yoga practice in my early 20’s to deal with the pain. as i meditated, the sensation of the contractions of labor was intense. they felt similar to the orgasms of pregnancy. the lotus flower pulsed and bloomed with one thousand petals of every hue of color. reds, greens, yellows, oranges, purples, blues, and at the center was brightest light filled with love and sensual energy that shot sparks through the entranced imagery. there was darkness all around the periphery of my vision of color and light. the radiating flower pulled me towards the light and held my attention through the labor. there was also a mandela in an electric yellow/green and orange pattern that emerged from the lotus. it was hypnotizing. i understood that because arthur explained he saw durga, they determined a sin had occurred, but seeing the holy light transmitted simultaneously, they were confused. so was i. they later explained that being sexually abused during the birth violated me. but they hadn’t immediately gone to look beneath the veil to understand my story. when the sexual abuse was registered as sin, it changed everything. he said the world could never be the same. i believed they were changing timelines to prepare for a new reality – one where equality and justice ruled. in response to my curiosity about the romance plot, i looked back at the story i’d written in 2011. originally inspired after my first professional encounter with dan, my boss’ boss whose gaze made me feel things i’d forgotten i knew how to feel. i remembered something. i remembered being taken by the browser and shown the sir name for a line of english nobility. i’d laughed at the idea that my writing used the sir name for the king of england. this was too much. it was impossible, wasn’t it? i’d debonded from jack with the hope in the delusion that someone loved me. the idea that dan (my boss’ boss) could love me burned hot, until father figure by george michael played, and i realized he was too old for me. i was young enough to be his daughter. plus, i didn’t believe he’d abuse his power that way. i knew i was sick and delusional, and that in fact, my computer was hacked and leading me around the internet. i’d chosen to believe that someone could love me, and the content on my broken computer, over trusting my broken relationship with jack, the head of information security. looking back, i wondered if i’d trusted jack, if things would have turned out differently* footnote story about the hack in 2016/2017. i found a copy of one of my stories saved randomly on the hard drive of my computer rather than saved in a file. it was randomly dropped at a high level of my organization system. i usually kept my written works together in a file under my projects folder. romance with god when a revised version of my failed submission for the flame contest showed up on my hard drive i opened it up curiously. i couldn’t remember revising it with such a strong masculine voice. i wondered how it got on my computer. was i blacking out, or forgetting the memories of my work? i started to read it, and that reading played over in my mind creating new threads of thinking from which delusions formed. had durga helped me again? or, my heart skipped a beat, arthur?

"paranormal living a note on the ability to lift my spirit and the 12-step program in september 2021, i found my way to a 12-step program. i remember standing in my kitchen one saturday afternoon and realized, i’ll never get sober alone. i had the insight that i needed social support. if i stayed alone, i wouldn’t have the strength to abstain on my own. in recovery, i've learned it requires myself to be stronger than i like. through finding other people who are doing the work and willing to lend support to my program, and through working these steps i’m beginning to reliably stay a little bit better emotionally, physically, and spiritually. plus, by not drinking i don’t nearly drown in the self-pity of my experience. the principles of the 12-steps require that i’m well to do the work – in my humble opinion i don’t think i can do it when i’m unwell. it is too messy to try the steps while i’m sick. mental health recovery needs a strengths-based program. recovery from alcohol and addiction focuses the light on the shadows. must be well to do this. i’ve been feeling healthier again so started to read more. the program is basically a set of spiritual steps that work as a type of metaphysical instrument to extract oneself from the depths of despair. in my experience, i’m predictably experiencing relief when i actively work through the program. what i’m finding to be true is that – there is no magic in recovery. we get what we work for. in the first 111 days, i’ve attended over 133 meetings. i’d heard that to aim for 90 in 90 days may help, i found that through learning from the program, i felt something i’d been searching for a way to see my own role in the trauma. a way to appreciate how my character defect escalated what might have been a problematic incident with the physician at the birth, but for most people would not have resulted in the personal devastation and total annihilation of self. the devastating tsunami wave of pain and misery knocked me out for a very long time. i’m not claiming that this method is perfect, i have a long way to go, but it is the beginning point for a new start of my spiritual healing journey.

"delusional jealousy in spouse?? sallysea, the few times i started packing things up (and when i moved all my clothes out of our closet into the spare room) my husband stopped making the accusations that i was having an affair, etc. i believed he still had the same thoughts, but he didn’t want me to leave. even now, when his behavior has de-escalated (stopping testosterone shots helped immensely) i believe he persists in those aberrant thoughts. he just doesn’t talk about them. you can expect this to wax and wane but not to go away. i would continue to gently encourage him to get an evaluation and help.",2008,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"wrote a letter to my husband’s doctor day before yesterday was the pits. more paranoia from my husband, more bizarre thought processes, and the continued accusation that i’m having an affair with that poor guy albert. as his anger grew, he kept screaming at me that he knew when i did it, and he was going to text albert and call his wife, and go confront him and knock him on his ass. i told him i was tired of denying bs statements that were not real, and i’m done doing that. if he wants to text that guy, we’ll he should just do it. i just kept brushing off the horses and he kept coming out of the houses to yell at me. he was really unhinged. this is so sad. last week he said he’d been feeling really tired, and asked if i was poisoning him! i told him that since i’d been on a diet, i haven’t even been cooking for him, and it looked like he remembered that was correct. day before yesterday i again told him that his brain was playing tricks on him, and that he really needed help. he just yelled “you always want me to think that, but i know what’s going on.” so, i wrote a letter to his oncologist, a doctor he likes and trusts. i told him what has been going on, and frankly it’s been much worse since the chemo he had in 2018. last year he was supposed to get an mri of the brain because i asked him to please tell this doctor about his increased anger episodes. he did, and the doc ordered the mri. but, because my husband’s allergies were so bad, he was unable to lie down and get it done. he tried twice. i asked the doctor to please make a neurological referral if he felt it was appropriate, and to please try to get that brain mri done. i’m starting to suspect the onset of dementia or something like it, or frontotemporal deterioration, or something similar. but a neurological evaluation could only help at this point. now i’m just waiting to see if his oncologist actually initiates anything. it felt like i was “ratting” on my husband and his bizarre behavior, but i’m at my wits end. this has to change or i’m leaving. and that would be horrible for my husband.",2010,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"wrote a letter to my husband’s doctor thank you sunny. i’m still waiting for the other shoe to drop, as it were. i hope his oncologist calls him, and states some reason for ordering the brain mri and a neurological referral. the oncologist is young, and from pakistan. i don’t know what his familiarity is with older american men and their macho approach to “i’m all right, you are the one that’s messed up.”. surely he has encountered this in his oncology practice. after all, many cancer patients are older, and also have some mental decline. i’m really just out of options to try to help my husband and try to save my marriage in the process. to be honest, i’m less concerned with the marriage than i am with him. bizarre things happen daily, screaming and insults, etc. but i put up with it because i care for him and i believe he has something wrong that is causing this. today, he couldn’t figure out how to get the ratchet binders loose so he could unload the tractor from the trailer (it was in the shop). i tried not to get involved, because i know nothing about ratchet chain binders. but he insisted and i tried to help. it ended as these usually do, with him finally saying i should just shut my f***ing mouth and do what he says. well, darn it, i didn’t want to get involved in this in the first place! then, he promptly forgets that he just insulted me, and acts like nothing’s wrong. right now, he has gone to bed early as he usually does an di am sitting here wondering if i should go back in the bedroom when i’m ready, or go to the spare bedroom. he now takes his phone with him into the bedroom, probably so i can’t see his odd sex texts.",2012,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"wrote a letter to my husband’s doctor the day started out ok, but went to hell. we actually had a few good days, and my husband talked about how the chemo he had possibly could have changed his behavior. he said it would be a good idea to get an evaluation, and asked that i call and schedule. and that call was on my agenda today, before everything blew up. we had finished working outside, and i had told him i was going to get some weed killer to spray the weeds along the edges of the pasture we just baled. he said he didn’t want me to do that (he has reasons but they don’t make sense, so i won’t add to the story). later in the house, he accused me of always being against him because i wanted to spray the weeds. he started yelling and accusing. it’s like some little seed starts in him and blossoms way out of proportion. i said “well, here we go” and grabbed my purse and took off to town. he immediately texted that he knew i was going to meet that poor guy, and his other usual hateful stuff. i went into town, did some errands, and had a lovely time shopping at home depot for a few things. i got home and headed back to my home office. about an hour later he barged in, yelling, accusing, demanding that we get a divorce. he hates me, despises me and how could i be such a slut as to have sex with xxxxx. i told him to get out. he kept screaming that he wants 50% of everything and he means 50%!! he kept screaming and yelling through the door. it was a little scary. so i spent the next 2 hours downloading the divorce forms and filling them out. they are ready to file in the district court tomorrow. i’m not sure where i will go but i have to find a place, have to get this house sold, sell the horses and cattle, and all the equipment.",2014,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"wrote a letter to my husband’s doctor yesterday i thought the best idea was just to move out, get my own place and start divorce proceedings. but i didn’t. i came back home, worked on the painting in my home office, cleaned out some closets for goodwill and straightened up my bedroom and my office. lots of work! i also looked at the financial implications of a divorce. we are fairly well off right now, with a farm and a house that’s close to paid off. if we were to divorce, sell the equipment for probably half what it’s worth, sell the cattle and horses, we would definitely have cash, but not enough for either of us to buy a place nearly as nice as this farm. i have money of my own that i inherited, and he has no separate assets. just thinking of selling all this and starting over is painful. so, what if i just stay? if he wants to get a divorce, then let him go do all the paperwork, or find a lawyer to do it, and get it all underway. this morning, i got up and went out to do some errands: goodwill, home depot and walmart. when i got home he was out and i had time to keep cleaning, and then work in the orchard. he came home and asked if i was going to get fertilizer for the fields. i said why are you talking to this disgusting slut? if you want fertilizer go get fertilizer. he said he had to work on the borders (we irrigate tomorrow). i said i don’t care, do whatever you want to do. he kept asking me to do it. i told him i wasn’t going to do anything for someone who calls me a disgusting slut. he kept saying he couldn’t do both, and the fields need fertilizer (true). so i said from now on, we are just business partners; you have your life and i have mine, and i got in the truck to go get the fertilizer. when i was done with all that, i was filling water troughs and he came to talk to me. i didn’t talk to him at all. he started ridiculing me and again said how he knew what i was doing, etc., etc., escalation again. he was now screaming that he wanted a divorce. i said fine, go get one. he went into the house and i went back to the orchard. i spent an hour there and went in the house and showered, and now i’m on the front porch cooking chicken fajitas on the grill. i think he’s cooking in the kitchen. the point is that i’ve discovered a new resilience and a thicker skin. his screaming insults now have no effect. i wonder how he will take that. i’m no longer trying to save a marriage. i’m trying to save a human being from himself. still no contact from his doctor though. oh well, i truly am doing what i can. all the firearms have been removed or hidden, so no worries there.",2015,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"dualing with declerambault episode 1: a college crush that somehow finds a way to my dreams where it weaves a world for us to live in. a beautifully intoxicating home for every stray thought and hope and desire. a world that evolves and solidifies with every visit until i’m falling in love with my crush and the future i dream of. when the story threads dry up i create another world and another with different career paths, different friends, different locations but the same easy companionship and the same love. it isn’t long, however, before the dream world clashes with reality. i see her with a guy who couldn’t possibly be her boyfriend because he isn’t me, but of course i’m lying to myself and the dream world crashes down around me. with an extraordinary amount of resilience, the dream world picks itself up, dusts itself down and rebuilds itself. the foundations are now cracked but somehow i start to dream again, at least until the next reality check. i crash and burn over and over and the heartache is real. i’m losing my dream partner, after all. i leave college and try to put myself back together. eventually, the heartache fades. i’d never had a mental illness before so i’m shaken that my reality was so distorted. i try to rationalize my experience and find a name for my episode, declerambault’s syndrome (dc). i discover all i can about my enemy, identify all the indicators and try to arm myself in case of further attacks (counterdc). episode 2: i avoid any big dc encounters for years but my luck runs out with n. some similarities with ep 1. crush that goes nowhere but hungrily devours my thoughts. dc is on one shoulder encouraging me whilst counterdc, on the other shoulder, is urging caution. dc distorts and counterdc over-corrects so it’s almost impossible to find my way to the true reality. inevitably, i’m left broken and i promise myself that next time i start dreamweaving i’ll stay clear of possible dream partners so that i don’t feed my dc. episode 3: two years ago i see l for the fist time. i feel a strong attraction to her but no reciprocation. second meeting is brief and uneventful. third meeting is also brief but there’s some eye contact and it feels like something is brewing. covid strikes and i don’t see much of her during the first lockdowns but then i start hearing her voice in my street. at the sound of l speaking my name dc wakes up from his long sleep and begins to weave his magic. the new dream-world begin to grow and deepen and demands more and more of my time. i should resist. i know where it’s taking me but its endless paths and possibilities are lighting my way through a dark lockdown. i lose myself to my dream l in my dc worlds. my dream-world has moved so far ahead of reality that the two worlds have started to jar, pushing me further and further down the rabbit hole. i hear l say she wants to spend the rest of her life with me and dc breaks free from his tether. he’s off. he’s flying like never before and he fills dc land with love and hope. meanwhile counterdc is becoming increasingly uncomfortable. something is off and it’s dawning on me that l’s affection for me is total and unconditional. she looks at me with pure uncontrolled adoration and i know now that she’s going through her own dc episode. she calls me the man of her dreams and this says it all. she’s lost in her own dc worlds and i’m sensing no grounding, no counterdc. i guess this is her first episode and her family and friends don’t know the warning indicators. they seem oblivious to her behaviour, to the signs that are obvious to me. i should reach out to them but i’m more ill than i’ve ever been before and in the back of my mind i’m aware that during an episode you can invert everything and believe that the person you’re infatuated with is in fact infatuated with you. knowing this further destabilises my grasp of reality. my dc and counterdc have never been more polarized. they’re fully at war with each other and it’s ripping me apart. my avoidance strategy is no use here. she’s living almost next door to me. i hear her through every window and she always seems to be there when i go out. she tries to connect with me but her spoken messages never fully reach me. i’m left with fragments that are too easily distorted by either side in their war. i start sensing anger and some bitterness towards me. maybe she expects me to meet her half way but her beautiful face is the face of my next breakdown. i’m in love with by dc l and she’s in love with her dc me and it’s clear to me how impossible this is. i can never compete with a dream. i can see that each failed message she tries to give me is tearing her apart and her pain, in turn, is tearing me apart. i know how hard it is to connect at this stage. you believe that your future and all your incredible dreams depend on this one moment and the pressure is unbearable. it’s taking its toll on l. soon i hear that she’s moving out and a door in my dreams slams shut. she delays leaving, giving me hope, but eventually she packs up all my hopes and dreams and takes them with her when she leaves. so here i am, broken, full of pain and regret and declerambault has beaten me again. i don’t know where l is and how her battle with dc is going and letting go of that is going to be the hardest part for me. i hope you’ll excuse such a long post but i felt that i needed to share it somewhere. i’d be grateful for any advice. thanks td",2021,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"another day, another delusion hello all: another stressful day today, irrigating the farm. up at 3 a.m. my husband did not catch the voice mail from the irrigation manager yesterday, saying we might not get to irrigate today. so he stressed about that and was angry “why didn’t he keep calling until he got a hold of me.” i just say “i don’t know” to most of what he asks. why didn’t my husband actually check his phone during the day to see if the irrigation manger had any updates. taking care of details just isn’t his thing. so we do actually have enough water to irrigate, and he gets started. water going everywhere, and as usual he leaves it on way too long so we have a flood. as we were walking through the back cow pens, i point out that the water in the drain ditch looks like it;s going to overflow into the cow pen. i might as well have hit him. he blew up and said i was always criticizing him, etc. etc. the usual yelling and screaming. he left and went into the house and later to check the water. i finished my work outside and then left for town to do some errands. he texts me, saying “i bet i know where you’re going”. implying i’m running off to have sex with albert. it’s where his mind always goes. i feel sorry for poor albert who has no idea my husband has this bizarre idea about him. can someone please explain why he has a one-way thought process on this???? frankly i am so turned off about sex because he’s focused on it, and he uses it as a weapon. we haven’t even tried to have sex in months. he does have ed and says he needs to fantasize to “encourage” him. i’ve told him i don’t want to hear all that crazy stuff, but what he does in his own head is his business. so i get home hours later and he acts like nothing’s wrong. i’m so done with this charade. is this any way to live? i’m not really expecting an answer, just hoping that writing it down makes me feel better.",2022,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

(because i had driven the truck last and probably had the heat on). he instantly blew up, saying i was always nagging him and didn’t i think he knew enough to turn on the ac. screaming and yelling at me, calling me names as always. i opened the door, he stopped the truck and i got out. this must happen once a week. i went in the house and did some work on the computer. he comes stomping in to the office, asking me if i’m done helping him. i said i just had to get out of the truck. he told me he was going to check the water, then come back in the house and take me up to the ditch if we needed to adjust the valves. he left. i finished what i was doing, then walked all the way up to the ditch to be ready when he wanted to switch. after a half hour or so, he drove up on top of the ditch, and said he was turning one valve on all the way “here it comes!” he yelled. then he drove over to shut the valve on the north 12 acre piece. i took all that to mean that i was to adjust the valve where i was, to route more of the water to the 7 acre piece, and less to the 3. so i did that. it looked like the 3 acre piece was about done, and the water already in the field would get to the end. then he drove to where i was, screaming “what are you doing, that field isn’t done!!” turn that water back in the 3 acres. he kept screaming ‘you never listen!” all you think about is having sex with albert. so we are back to albert again. i told him why don’t you have sex with albert, you think about him so much. then i turned around and walked all the way back to the house. gathered up a few things, got in the car and went to town to do errands. before i left, i put a note at his place on the table ‘get help. you have delusional disorder. you are mentally ill’ i come back a few hours later and he has completely flooded the cow pens. i mean, the cows are searching for a dry place to stand. what a wreck. so that 3 acre piece wasn’t finished watering, huh? oh, and the ac is not working in the truck. i don[t even care. he can get it fixed if he wants to. it will be a cold day in hell before i get back in that truck with him. *mod edit* last edited by snaga on fri apr 02, 2021 4:03 pm, edited 1 time in total. reason: be mindful of the issues most people in pf have, thanks",2027,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"here we go again; dd husband hi newsunrising; yes, i have spoken about this to a psychologist friend of mine. she suggested that he have a full neurological work up, and go from there. great advice, but difficult to accomplish. i tried to get it done within the context of his chemo treatment and aftermath, but he could not complete that mri. during his delusional episodes, i admit that i get as loud and angry as he is behaving, and that’s not a good context for the “you need help” discussion. the one benefit of my reaction is that it has seriously reduced the frequency of his delusions. leading me to believe there is at least a small volitional component. either that, or the new consequence of his delusional behavior (me behaving angry, mean) is so distasteful to him that it modifies his behavior and he doesn’t mention his delusions. regardless, if i am actually going to get him evaluated, i need to react more lovingly the next time this comes up. as far as my coping mechanisms, i used to just clam up or leave the house, which was effective for me escaping it, but did nothing to stop or reduce the delusions. it was no help to him either. my current method (yelling right back at him, angrily screaming you need help) has reduced the incidents, but still not really effective for an overall solution. tomorrow we are irrigating the farm again. high stress leads to his delusional outbursts every time, so i need to be prepared. when it happens tomorrow, i will respond in a calm, direct manner, and try to lovingly tell him that he needs help. wish me luck!",2029,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"here we go again; dd husband what an awful day. it was so busy. i had several professional appointments (9 a.m. and a:30 pm) that i had to keep no matter what, but they were via zoom so i didn’t have to leave the house. then, some people who had asked about buying some cows last week called this morning asking if they could arrive at 9:30. i told them this was fine. but no, it wan’t fine with hubby. he got really angry because we had to go out and sort off the two cows they wanted, and that meant he had to get up from the tv. sorry buddy, but cow sales is part of what we do. so we are going back to the cow pens to get them, and he starts yelling”why did you tell them 9;30 was ok? it’s not!!” well, they were already in the truck driving from 2 hours away, and i told him that. what was i supposed to do, tell them to go back to the house and wait a few hours?? sure way to blow up a sale, and we do need sales for income. that answer didn’t sit well with him. we started sorting the cows, and cows will be cows. they don’t go where you want them to, and can be unpredictable. in the middle of this, when i am having trouble getting 2 out of a pen, he starts laughing at me and ridiculing me, not in a nice way. he was very very mean “you are so dumb, you are terrible at this” he says. i told him why can’t you be a partner in this, instead of being an adversary? he continues to laugh and ridicule. then i told him i wish i had never married him because he had one goal in life: to make me miserable. well that stopped the ridiculing and all conversation, but it was definitely an escalation of the conflict. so much for responding to him with love today. that was impossible. the buyers arrived, we did what had to be done (branding, etc.) while he continued to mutter at me under his breath when no one else could hear. finally they were gone and we were back to the cold war. he went to get the fertilizer to put on the fields while i had to take down some electric fence. he got the truck stuck, and rather than ask me for help, he walked all the way back to the yard, and got the tractor to pull his truck out. i asked “do you need any help?” and he did not reply. fine. we continued the cold war all afternoon, ate separately, and he has just now come out of the bedroom asking if i want to watch a movie with him. what the hell do i do with all this.",2030,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"letters never sent. tonight i found myself skipping the inspirational meeting and writing instead. the mic for the event came through my speakers with a repetition, an echo. instead of bearing with the echo on my monitor, i wrote a letter to the physician instead. i wish we could talk. the nights i don’t have a distraction these past weeks, months, and even years, i lay there and cry. especially the past two weeks, it lasts for 30 minutes to an hour until i fall asleep. i try working so hard i'm tired, but in some ways it's worse. i wish i had been able to heal my situation with my daughter’s father (my ex) or find another lover who could love me. cognitively, i understand. i’ve only brought you pain. you’ll never be able to love me. i get it, but my heart doesn’t understand. i’m feeling sad about this. fifteen years hasn’t made it stop bleeding with tears and heartache. i’ve realized a few things. i’m not exactly a prize, i mean i am amazing, but not traditional. and second, nobody else touches that brokenness the way you did. i don’t know what to do. abandon it? give it more time? keep letting it bleed out tears? i am tired of feeling this way. it’s been too long. then i imagine your playlist is for me. that helps until reality reminds me there is only silence between us. reality stings. playing with the broken bit increases the intense longing. so i try to quit. writing this, i hear the blood pounds in my ears, and the tears drip on the page. then the calm self-regulation comes back. i’m okay, but wow. why does it feel so intense? it’s been almost 16 years. sometimes when it hits me at work, i wonder if you ever have to close the door and ground. if only they hadn’t made a mistake in the office and scheduled my daughter’s father with you. if only… wishful thinking isn’t helpful. what helps? 1. my delusional hope – i imagine sitting on a dock with you talking like it’s the 90’s, and nobody is trying to reach us with cell service to redirect this line of thinking. i tear up, and my chin quivers thinking about it. i want to love and feel loved. yeah, gush, tears, longing. that is my dream that someday, something will let us reconcile that exam, and i can reintegrate that part, and heal whatever i may have hurt in you. 2. my hope based in reality – i believe that with a good moral man in my life, i hope that someday i may heal. the problem is that: a. good moral types are usually paired. b. they rarely know what to make of my extremely flawed dramatic story. c. i’m not sure i’m consistent enough for one of them. d. but that is my reality based hope. 3. other’s hope for me – i believe other’s are correct, that you aren’t the only way forward. 4. but, seriously, i wonder if we both would benefit from a conversation. it’s just that you might be the only way to align that part. who the heck knows what i broke in you. maybe i hurt you too. i function; it is just that the hurt part doesn’t stay well. i feel anxious about the spiritual connection i feel. that bit that thinks it bonded to you at that moment and pulls energy from it. i don’t know how else to explain the feeling. i lay there and feel what i wonder you’re feeling. i cry so hard when you feel empty or disconnected. then i feel foolish for thinking i have any real connection, and it just hurts. without distractions, i struggle.

"does anything work? hi uriahsky, welcome to the delusional disorder forum. hope you find this place as supportive as i have over the past decade. so medication helps most people with delusions. but anosignosia or not knowing one is sick is a symptom of the illness. the longer delusions go untreated the harder they are to treat, in my case i’m still struggling with making sense and healing from a trauma that’s over 15 years in the past at the birth of my daughter that involved an exam. i’d document your issue, and if the individual becomes a threat to self or others get help immediately. when talking with the person - explain nicely that they need to seek professional care because they aren’t well. there is a great book by dr amador titled “i’m not sick and i don’t need help”. they key strategy is to listen, empathize, agree with some aspect of their complaint like (i agree you must feel frustrated), and partner to get the person help. also contact your local nami organization. they can help, too. the helpline is always there to listen and support you. hope that helps. sunny ""i trust that if i start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -sunnyg",2052,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"k2 messed me up. any solutions besides medication? hello, my name is ""insaneinthemembranes"" (lol have to use a little humor ). lets just say thats my name for now. i have lived quite a difficult life getting in quite a bit of legal troubles. i always have been a cautious man because of my unorthodox lifestyle. i have recently been using k2 (synthetic cannabinoid) for about 12 months. it has been about 7 months since i have touched the stuff except a recent relapse about 4 months ago where i smoked it once. that was a little history of what i believe is causing my problems. i typically am a very logical man and i do pride myself on this. i study quite a bit and look into many subjects. now i thought at first i was being setup by some people to harm me and it really took me quite some time to realize that i am insane. i have been really focusing on what is going on and the delusional thoughts that go through my head. i have not seen a doctor and to be quite frank i will not go see a doctor. i worry about getting on medications that will slow my brain down. i get a strong feeling people are plotting on me. they want to set me up to get me killed, poison me, kidnap me, or beat me down. i look at certain people and thing they are a part of an organization that wishes me harm. i get a sense that my roommates are hiring a hacker to hack my computer. i get a sense that undercover cops are following me when i walk around and that i am being watched for something someone made up on me. i think people around me are undercover federal agents and they are spying on me to get information for something someone is setting me up for. now at first this did cause me a headache. i am pretty good in remaining calm in violent situations so i don't let things get to me so pretty much no one knows whats going on with me. it's something i can hide quite well and put a smile on my face. i truly thought this was happening because its really hard to know whats happening when you first initially deal with this. especially with no support from anyone because i really don't have any family or friends in my life. i have come to the understanding that these sinister plots on my life are nothing more then delusional and have self diagnosed myself with persecutory delusions. i know it sounds dumb me self diagnosing but when i researched the different variations of psychosis it seems this is the correct one. my question now is what is a good way to cope with this? now that i understand this things are different. i have a deep understanding when i hear my roommates plotting on me in the next room or when i think a group of people is part of a gang trying to get me then i just smile and act casual. understanding this isnt true. that it must be some delusion coming from my ego thinking im better then people or special in some way so i am a target. in the end that is what it happening and thats me giving myself the most unbiasted opinion i can. it's interesting recognizing my insanity and i am trying to out think it. seems crazy right? lol trust me i get it. trying to fix a broken tool with a broken tool it seems but i refuse to be heavily sedated. any ideas on something that can calm me down? im taking zoloft that isnt prescribed to me at a dose of 100mg. i have about 500 pills left i got from a friend. i take ""stress comfort peace of mind by natures bounty"" in the morning with my zoloft. at night i take ""honey lavender stress relief soothing serentiy blend tea"" with my 30mg of melatonin for sleep. i try to work out a few times a week and pray on my knees every morning and night. im not a christian but i am open to any options that might work at this point. hence the weird herbal concoction i have going on lol. i do not drink any caffeine because i noticed it will put me in a manic state that really intensifies these delusions which i cannot allow. i chew tobacco and i dont drink or use any mind altering substances. if anyone knows of anything else to add to this please let me know. i am winging this right now and i just came up with the medical diagnosis about 2 hours ago lol. it truly does match what is going on with me to the ""t"". thank you all in advance -insaneinthemembranes",2061,,,,
k2 messed me up. any solutions besides medication? thank you for your reply. the zoloft is not natural but prescribed to someone else. i figured it would help with the anxiety/depression. i do appreciate your 2cents because that is why i am here. hopefully i can get some more feedback on this and opinions from some more members. thank you again,2062,,,,
"husband is having a delusion - please help, anyone my husband of 2 years is delusional - he believes his insides are twisted/not aligned and that he can repair this problem by moving, contorting and breathing. he believes he is the only person in the world that can do this and that he is a medical miracle. he has had x-rays, cat scans, blood tests etc and there isn't anything physically wrong with him. his first episode was in april this year...i let it go for about one week then took him to hospital where he was admitted for 2 nights - he came home on anti-psychotics and anxiety meds. this seemed to stop the problem but over time he has changed his meds and i feel the delusion never really went away. about a week ago it started again, and he was in hospital again this week, against his wishes - the only reason he went is because he had an episode at work and they called an ambulance. nevertheless, he believes he has achieved something amazing, and claims he is now 'fixed' although he continues to make weird movements. he is now on lithium and a new anti-psychotic drug. he has agreed to stop smoking weed, which i think was a huge part of the problem. we are on day 2 of the new drugs. he is super sad, feels very alone, and doesn't know if he can continue to be married to me because i don't believe him. i hope his drugs and the removal of weed help. soon. has anyone ever heard of a delusion like this??",2063,,,,

"could it be erotomania? i am deeply concerned that i have erotomania. i have been in love with the same guy since i was 14. he is a professional dj, used to be a dj for a now very famous rapper and is currently touring with another well known rapper. i first saw him in the background of the first rapper's music video when i was 14. i didn't know who he was but for some reason i was extremely drawn to him and to this day i still don't get why. he is a very handsome man but back then when he was only 21 he was cute i guess but not someone that would normally make my shallow, 14 year old self swoon. i started fantasizing about him. i gave him a name. i wrote stories about us falling in love. a couple years after that i bought a documentary dvd the rapper had put out and the dj happened to be on it. so i was able to get his name. i friended him on myspace. he had a girlfriend at the time but i was 14 and he was 21 so there was nothing i could have done anyway. fast forward to my late teen/early adulthood years, i continued to follow him on social media. i would look at his friend's pages just to see photos and videos of him. never tried to contact him outside of sending a couple little (very corny)messages to him saying i thought he was very talented. he responded saying thank you and that was that. in 2011 he dated a woman (i was 20 at this time) and i remember feeling devastated and crying about it. i never had any ill feelings toward her, didn't even really feel jealous. i was just very sad he wasn't with me. they've broken up and he appears to be single. there have been brief moments where i haven't really thought about him much. like if i was involved with someone ""in real life.""i've dated and been involved sexually with plenty of other people but nothing ever got serious. as soon as those situations fizzled out i went right back to dating him in my head. right now i'm not interested in being with anyone (other than him) seriously so i keep things casual. sometimes while being intimate with other guys i pretend it's him i'm making love to.the only things about my situation that are different from the typical erotomania symptoms are i do not believe that he is sending me signals, i don't stalk him and have no desire to (well...more on that later).i have never told him how i feel. i have looked him up in a people search just because i was curious and wanted to know more about him. i don't communicate with him. i don't feel violent toward him or anyone in his life. lastly i don't believe/think he reciprocates my feelings.at least not really. three years ago, i fell on hard times and found myself in a homeless shelter. my first night there, terrified, hungry and full of anxiety...i remember all i could think about was him. so i prayed. (i grew up christian. no longer religious but very spiritual with belief in god, the power of prayer, the universe etc.) i prayed that god would tell me why this man has dominated my mind all these years especially now since i should be focusing on getting my life together. my belief is that god told me that man is my soulmate and we're to be married and build a life/family together. i've prayed for signs of this and believe they were confirmed. i've prayed for certain things to happen for him and they have. i waffle back and forth between believing that this is so, which feels amazing, and not believing it, the latter causing me so much anxiety and emotional turmoil. i feel like i'm crazy. like i'm delusional and hell i just might be. i've prayed that god would remove these feelings from me, make me not find him attractive anymore but to no avail. i live in michigan. this guy lives in miami. many times i think of going to miami ""on vacation"" with the hopes of running into him or going to one of his shows and him seeing me and falling for me on the spot. i suffer from ptsd and bpd (borderline not bipolar)due to abuse from both parents growing up and going into my early 20s. feeling unloved most of my life, the idea of having someone god chose that is guaranteed to love me is very comforting. i was also brought up in church and it was drilled in me that god is supposed to choose your spouse for you. anyway. i know this is very long...but i'd like some insight from anyone struggling with this as well or who has knowledge on the subject. i plan on speaking with my therapist about it this week. i spoke with my last therapist about it as well but she didn't seem to think it was a big deal.",2065,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"vent--delusional partner first off, let me say that i have suffered from manic and psychotic episodes in the past and i believe that my partner's current delusions were caused by trauma from my psychotic break three months ago. my psychosis originated from traumatic childhood memories and research into ritual abuse. during this break, i believed that i was being manipulated by a universal cult and that my partner was literally god and that they would kill me if i didn't design a better universe for them. that episode ending with me trashing my entire apartment, breaking a window and hurling household objects outside, screaming incessantly, and finally physically hurting my partner when they tried to stop me. my court date for that incident is tomorrow; i am transgender so i am expecting to be confined to solitary without hormones for close to my maximum sentence (3 years). my only hope is my partner's testimony since they witnessed my delusions and they don't blame me for the incident at all as i am normally very peaceful and kind. however, after i was released from the mental health facility, my partner began to echo elements of my delusions. they told me that they had broken their own mental programming and that they understood everything. they believe that they are being constantly stalked by a mysterious ""they"" that includes their actually-loving mother but doesn't involve a cult (i've insisted that the cult isn't real). they believe that colors and words and numbers are all used as a kind of code which can be used to manipulate people psychologically or to communicate with them convertly, and since then they've mostly communicated with me in code that they refuse to explain, which makes it difficult to even understand the nature of their delusions. they think that we're in grave danger and that they have to change and control me to protect me. since then, my partner has admitted to repeatedly attempting to brainwash me ""for my own good"", which they are ashamed of but can't stop doing. in conversations, they often ignore me completely and ask me questions repeatedly even after i've answered them. in the last week they've started randomly moving objects around the house, including my personal items: so far i've lost my toothbrush (3 times), my makeup (twice), my guitar picks, my only pair of shoes i can use for walking, my inhaler, and my food stamp card. the inhaler, food stamp card, and shoes are still missing; i can't go outside without my shoes and my partner keeps asking me to anyway because i ""need to get out"" (luckily i do have a pair of heels i can wear to court). he's also scribbled messages on my checks (e.g. ""give me all your $#%^"" or my name over and over). he has also damaged other household objects, including a handbag, his own clothes, and a now-destroyed houseplant that my partner was really fond of (he named it ""franky""). he fills bags with small objects and hands them to me telling me that they're his ""rights"" and that he's the one going to jail, not me. we're packing (because jail) but all my partner has done is to stuff hundreds of objects into cupboards and claim that they're packed. on that note, my partner has also been committing minor criminal acts. they claim to have stolen from work (i think they took cash?) and last night they came home with three torn-down covid-19 signs. they keep stuffing their pockets, bags, and once their boot with random small objects that he says he stole from me, even though half the ""stolen"" objects are usually his. the night before that he broke his dad's window for no discernable reason. that night was particularly strenuous: my partner hurt me physically and attempted to terrify me psychologically (it worked). he also spilled hot wax all over me, the floor, the counter, and my laptop while i begged him to stop, then refused to clean the mess afterwards. then he tried to eat the ruined candles. i can't even get into all the mind games he played with me that night because it was so convoluted and the conversation was so confusing that i can't even remember exactly what happened; i just know that the constant verbal and physical pressures ended with me crying and hyperventilating and begging for him to stop torturing me. he didn't really seem to care except when i started screaming and fainted. the only part of our verbal exchange that i remember was when he was talking to a non-existent bus driver off to my left while still interacting with me physically as if i was the bus driver, even though he wouldn't look at me and shushed me every time i tried to speak claiming that he was explaining everything. that part of the conversation lasted for more than half an hour with him repeatedly giving me his bus fare and then taking it away again. i feel hopeless and there's no one to comfort me. my partner will sometimes get angry with me when i try to touch them, and they usually seem to do so when i'm feeling upset; thankfully when they're less delusional they still hug and cuddle me like they used to do. they also refuse to even lie down in the same bed as me because it ""doesn't feel right"", but there's really nowhere else to sleep so now they no longer do. so, every time i sleep and wake up, my partner has had 8-ish hours to run amok without me and i wake to find more of my things missing. my partner may go to jail if they keep this up, and i have literally no friends or family so if they can't take care of my things while i'm gone or give me a place to stay when i get out myself then i'll be leaving jail clothesless (aside from whatever i'm wearing when they take me), homeless, and without a job or my cats or access to medical care. even if they do take care of my things, when i get out i may only be returning to them for more psychological torture. thank you to anyone who read everything; i just needed to vent. i am devastated. my partner was nothing but perfect for me until this happened and i've loved them more than i've ever loved anyone else in my life, but now i feel that i've lost them in addition to everything else in my life, and that makes me want to die. i can't take this anymore;

"so scared of inheriting delusional disorder hi everyone, i am a first time poster on this forum, and i'm just so glad that there's some kind of outlet for what's been going on in my family life. i have a 57 year old father with delusional disorder, who has been consumed by this illness since 2007/2008. i think this illness came about when he essentially lost a personal injury trial a few months prior. he dedicated about 5 years of his life into this case. i guess he tried to make sense of it by (wrongfully) blaming my mother for conspiring with the insurance company against him. at the same time, my little brother was diagnosed with autism. it was a very stressful transition time in my family. i'm going to spare the details of how his illness manifests, because it is so similar to what everyone has been posting here. this has been a huge strain on my family (my mother, myself, and two siblings). he does better when he is on antipsychotic medications, and for a period of about 3 years, he seemed to be his old self again. he worked, socialized well, and just seemed to be a good guy in general. as far as i could tell, he just had occasional moodiness (who doesnt?). i thought this was a miracle and that this disorder was controlled and a problem of the past. that was the case until he started to become non complaint with his medications (yet again). he is currently ordered by a mental health tribunal to take his antipsychotic medications every month, and he still defies the order. he tries to trick doctors in various ways to say that he is compliant. essentially, the police have to show up at the home in order for him to go get his shot. when he is well, he is able to work, socialize, and be a productive member of the family. when he is unwell, he mismanages money, does not care to work, and essentially makes accusations against everyone and makes life difficult. my dad needs to be medicated. and once he's medicated, he needs to go to therapy. however, that's not what i am writing about. i am so scared that i will inherit delusional disorder just like my father. it seems that there is mental illness in the family. my father has dd. his brother was an alcoholic (who knows what kind of disorder he was hiding?). my grandfather (dad's side) certainly had some sort of mental health issues later in his life (but he was a ww2 survivor - a lot of this was attributed to his war experiences). my grandmother (dad's side) has a family history of mental illness as well. my mother's side, as far as i know, is clear. i am a 30 year old man. i am currently single, but i have a good job and would like to start a family sometime in the coming years. i've had no real mental health issues other than family and typical life-related stress. i experimented with drugs in my early 20s, but they were never an addiction. overall, i would say that i've done better in school and work life than my peers. i spoke with a psychologist about my concerns, but i think she just did not understand dd. she seemed to conflate the disorder with schizophrenia. she basically told me that since i've not had any psychotic symptoms up to this point in my life, and that my siblings do not have any psychotic disorders, that it is extremely unlikely that i will ever go on to develop a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia or dd. however, dd can be onset at any time in your life. i am so scared that i will be a burden to my (present and future) family. i am so scared that i will become a shell of myself and create trouble for those i love the most. the problem is that there is no certainty about what my future will hold. any help and insight would be appreciated.",2070,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"so scared of inheriting delusional disorder no one has answered, so i'll give it a go... the fact that you're worried about it is a good first step, as it means you're aware that you may entertain unrealistic thoughts. the issue many face is that they refuse to accept that their delusion is what it is and argue beyond reason that it's true. however, there is a danger that your obsession with getting delusions gets to a point where it itself becomes a delusion; that you're so convinced that you'll get it that you'll see it where it doesn't exist. i don't know if you've ever seen a film called a beautiful mind, but if not then it tells the story of john nash who was deluded to the point of vivid, visual hallucinations. medication etc didn't work as a long-term strategy, but he eventually managed to cope with the delusions by employing a real-world test as to their existence. it's not the same as you, but it might be worth considering some tests that you can deploy to test any beliefs against reality, even posting them here to get an more objective opinion might help to confirm you're living in reality without the need to become obsessed with the idea. i'm not arguing; i'm explaining why i'm right.",2071,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"to the shell of the person that i married i've been lurking on these forums for awhile, looking i guess for some kind of advice or outlet. i posted a few months ago on reddit about my current situation and since deleted it; frankly, most of the advice given was unhelpful, if not unkind. i am convinced my spouse of four years (together for nearly a decade) has a delusional disorder, likely stemming from ptsd. most of his delusions center on infidelity, but are accompanied by full-blown auditory and visual hallucinations. he claims to have seen me, on multiple occasions, have sex with other men in our apartment. twice now, he claims to have recorded evidence. of course, i've asked to see it, and of course, there are plenty of excuses as to why i can't: he deleted it, it's with a lawyer, etc. i'm fairly certain yesterday marked the end of our marriage. the outbursts and name-calling have only gotten worse. his favorite today is ""junkie whore."" secret drug addiction seems to be his rationale for why i'd sneak men into the apartment for sex. for money. for drugs. i don't know that i'm ready to discuss all the gory details, but today he mentioned my handle. it's a handle i've been using elsewhere, mostly in discord-based support groups. he thinks i use it to hook up with other men. i have no idea how he knows about it. he's not that technical. maybe i just left my laptop open at some point. i guess i'm hoping that maybe, one day, perhaps once he's found someone new, he'll find this post. perhaps when he starts accusing her of the same things, he'll care to look. i suppose i just needed to write something down somewhere. all the things i wish i could say to him. how i wish he had gotten help. how much i want him to find happiness and peace. how fearful i am that he will end up alone. how sorry i am i couldn't help him. how much i hate the cold, distant person i became last couple years of our relationship. i was just trying to protect myself. to anyone else reading this, you're in my thoughts. i wouldn't ever wish this on anyone.",2081,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"ddj is it worse around the holidays? hi exhausted. i'm exhausted too. i'm not sure of the answer to your question as my husband and i have only been on this roller coaster of despair for a couple of years but i hope you do get a chance to make some nice memories this year. i read some of your earlier posts and your story is eerily similar to mine - feel free to read my previous posts for context. i spent a long time trying to find others in my situation because i think it helps to not feel so alone. i was going to write a new post but this board doesn't get a lot of traffic so i thought i would just reply to you. i left my ddj husband in july this year but our separation isn't going very well. we see each other most days for a few hours and usually have dinner at whichever house has the children on the day. when i left, i did so on the basis that my own mental health had taken a beating and i was sick of being told i was a liar, a cheat, narcissistic, schizophrenic and evil. i was an emotional wreck and having always been somewhat of a people pleaser, i spent my every waking minute trying to make my husband believe that i loved him and wasn't cheating. i left without a reconciliation plan and bought a new house to live in. when i was still home with him, he would sometimes sit me down for a serious talk to explain to me that he understood i was in a difficult position. he thought the man i was supposedly having an affair with must have had some sort of hold over me and he wanted to help me. other times, he would tell me i was schizophrenic and possibly didn't know what i was doing because it was the 'other me' doing it. he was so convincing that at times, i would sit quietly in the bathroom and search deep into my own memories and thoughts to make sure i really wasn't getting up in the middle of the night to have the 'affair' while everyone was asleep. more than once, i had suicidal thoughts because i just couldn't deal with the accusations, the way he looked at me, how when i didn't make eye contact because i felt degraded and humiliated, he thought it was guilt etc etc biggest problem i have today is this. i've let myself become very emotionally dependant on him and that's really bad. as a person who wears my heart on my sleeve, i struggle to convince myself that it's his illness that made him say such horrible things to me over the last two years. when he was saying disgusting things, i warned him that he wouldn't be able to take them back and warned him that i may never get over them. he wants me to move back in but i've convinced myself that we can never reconcile until i get the following: 1. he has to take responsibility for his mental health being the cause of the problems 2. he needs to apologise (sincerely) and show genuine remorse for what he put me through and the damage his mental health has done to me 3. ideally he should stop smoking 'funny stuff' to remove the paranoia side of this illness he has been taking risperidon for about 6 months at 3mg a day and he meets with his psychiatrist once every few weeks. i went to the last meeting and explained to both of them that i can't be in a relationship with someone who believes i have ever cheated on them. my husband stated that he knows i'm not cheating now. the psychiatrist added that while my husband doesn't think i'm cheating now, he will likely never realise that i didn't cheat because it was real to him at the time and he may always believe i cheated and put him through all of that. to me, that basically means that he will never treat me with the respect i deserve because he will always think i'm capable of lying and cheating. i like his psychiatrist but aside from managing his medication, i don't think he's doing any cognitive therapy with him and i have read that for this difficult disorder, both medication and ct has better success. my husband refuses to talk to me about the issues that lead to our separation. he doesn't want to talk about them ever again. if i do ask him anything about the events of past, he says he just wants to live in the now, he's not stupid and he knows the truth. if i ask him what truth he knows, he replies with a cryptic answer. if i try to get a non-cryptic answer, he tells me that i'm the reason for his beliefs because i have always been the person to keep bringing it up. he seems to forget that while i was living there, he treated me with so much disrespect and contempt, it was hard not to bring it up. he always says that he wasn't bringing the topic up but was merely just pointing out oddities he noticed around the house (which were usually indirect attacks at my supposed infidelity). i'm thinking that after christmas, i'm going to have to go no contact so we can both move ahead but there's something stopping me. i don't know what is blocking me because while i was happy to spend the rest of my life with him, we never really had a great relationship to start with. we had some really happy times but more unhappy times and these days, i don't get a lot of comfort from being around him because the medication makes him lifeless, unmotivated and unresponsive a lot of the time. hope you don't mind the long post but feel free to share your thoughts - i'd love to lend an ear to someone in the same situation as me. other people just don't understand what this is like. family and friends say, ""just leave the a#$%%e"" as if we're just being idiots and they have zero sympathy for what it must be like for the sufferer. i hope you have a very merry christmas and hope the new year brings new special memories to hold onto. you are not alone.",2084,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"ddj is it worse around the holidays? just a quick update peeps. hubby (ex) has been on the risperidone for 10+ months now. no change in his beliefs. i often wonder if his extremely fixed ideas would be different without key 'facts' or would a ddj sufferer just make other things key 'facts'? for example, my husband's 'absolute proof' moment was initially a lie detector test that gave an incorrect result. then, it was a video that i apparently put on his phone of me having sex with someone else. the video couldn't be found even with restore deleted images apps. there was however a still frame image of the video and the woman doesn't even look like me. another piece of undeniable proof, was an audio recording one morning that he set up in secret outside out bedroom. there was a faint noise that could have been a neighbour but more likely, it was our small dog snoring. that was interpreted as me sneaking someone in and having sex with them. funny thing is that around the time of that recording, you can hear me talking to a man. the man i was talking to was my husband. you can hear his distinctive voice clearly but he still believes that i had someone there. more recently (aka yesterday), he said his definitive proof was a short recording from our security camera several months ago. the early morning recording in question showed a light coloured shadow moving slowly across our front pathway. i watched it. my guess is that it was a headlight from someone's car. at an absolute stretch, i guess it could have been a large white dog but it was so blurry, you really couldn't make anything out. apparently, that video shows me having sex with someone outside on our front garden path. he does not think any of these 'proof' moments are irrational thinking at all. very sad!",2088,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"friend with apparent delusional disorder hi, someone whose been a friend for over thirty years appears to have been exhibiting delusional disorder for these past 3 years. she hasn’t been officially diagnosed or seen a doctor about this, but here’s some history: firstly i have to avoid going into specifics just in case she ever reads this, and shall refer to her as “mo”, which isn’t her real name. around a decade ago “mo” was assaulted by a guy she’d started seeing. while she only confided this part recently i believe it to be 100% genuine because it’s entirely plausible, fits the timeline, everything appears to stem from this event, and it doesn’t have any of the characteristics common to her delusions. also she’s always been a very forthright, straight up and honest person aside from the delusional behaviour. seven years later mo naively confided this in a friend, who knew the guy in question. this person didn’t believe mo’s story, accused her of making false allegations, and then proceeded to embark on a passive aggressive campaign of slut shaming and gaslighting on social media. it was a few weeks after this (around 2016) that mo first began exhibiting symptoms of paranoia. initially she appeared to be manifesting the non-bizarre persecutive variant, but recently it’s expanded to include grandiose delusions and erotomania. subsequent to the onset of all this she began smoking weed to “calm her nerves”, and this most certainly seems to be exacerbating the problem. aside from the delusions mo functions normally, but certain aspects are starting to intrude on her life and career. she’s also started to broadcast these delusions to more and more people. the delusions clearly aren’t true as they stretch plausibility too much. while the story remains mostly consistent it keeps growing arms and legs, and more and more people are now identified as persecuting her. it seems only a matter of time before i am perceived as joining her ranks. the delusion has gradually expanded from just the friend who originally shamed her, to a millionaire sportsman from overseas who is paying a team of hackers to persecute her because she reject him, an instagram model, hundreds of followers that these people have across social media, to an international web of conspiracy that includes any cameras and microphones she comes into contact with. more recently a second faction of world famous rock stars has begun defending her honour against the evil masses, one of whom is a band member in redacted who is now her secret ‘boyfriend’. all this has been communicated subliminally over social media, where the whole drama apparently plays out, and also via the radio etc. it’s literally everywhere, and she is right at the centre of all this action. it is impossible to reason with her, she admits it all ‘sounds crazy’ but is adamant that it can’t be because it’s all true. she’s been regularly expressing suicidal thoughts, although this depends on here mood, which depends of who is ‘winning’ this instagram war. at the moment i have the impression that she’s too important to humanity to harm herself. i managed to get her mind off it all for a while last year, and she admits now that she was considering that it could all be down to her mental health... but then she spilled part of the tale to some other people who tried their best to politely humour her, and now she ‘realises’ that the notion of her being delusional was ‘nonsense’ because these people immediately brought her plight to the attention of redacted, mobilising it against her detractors. as if. she has even gone so far as to report all this to the police, who recommended that she see a doctor, but she won’t. does anyone have any suggestions as how i can encourage her to see a doctor? she never goes to a doctor with anything, not even when she’s ill. her parents are completely unaware of all this. she rightly keeps it from then in order to avoid upsetting them as they are old and infirm, so that avenue is out. she has confided heavily in one other friend whom i know of, but don’t actually know personally. i could contact this person but if word ever got back to mo then that wouldn’t play well. the problem has become apparent to some other people she interacts with, and together we’re trying to manage it all as best we can. it might be possible to arrange for the people who humoured her last year to come back and verbally inform her that they are not actually involved in mounting a campaign in her defence, but i suspect that might go badly, or she’d have some way of explaining/denying it. the story has become so grandiose and complex that the details have begun to get muddled. is there anyone here who has successfully recovered from this dreadful illness? what would you suggest? we’re in the uk.",2089,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"delusional disorder on dr. phil show (feb 21 2020) on friday, the show's guest was a woman who accused her father of sexually assaulting her when she was a teen and videotaping the incident. years later, she was now accusing her brother-in-law (her sister's husband) of selling the video on the dark web. this was a family of attorneys, and they were struggling with the accusations. according to the guest, who is about 50, a few years ago, she suddenly remembered the assault, a memory which she had suppressed. her niece said that a few years back, the woman appeared normal, and she had good relationships with her family. from listening to the woman, it sounds like her delusion grew to include her brother-in-law as a result of her ""piecing things together"" and ""trying to figure it out"". i gritted my teeth. my dd relative frequently uses those phrases. at the end of the episode, dr. phil announced that he believed the woman has a delusional disorder, specifically the persecutory type.

"imaginary fleas this fixation with imaginary fleas, or similar, is happening with my mom, too. her delusional disorder began 10 years ago, at age 68, and at first she though her then-husband was having multiple affairs, and that he was sanding her furniture. a couple years later, with her poor husband enduring weekly accusations, she thought he was going to kill her and she left, and thankfully her doctor convinced her to admit herself to a geriatric psychiatric unit, where she stayed for 2 weeks. the doctors there referred to her delusions as 'fixed' and tried anti-psychotics, but the medication didn't change her delusions at all. my mom and her husband divorced, which was strongly encouraged by the psychiatric hospital experts, and which my sister and i were relieved about because we could see the stress on her husband, a dear man who was then in his 70s. she moved to an apartment on her own, and became convinced he was still entering all the time, to damage her furniture or move things around, or take things, to then return them later. there are so many other things she was suspicious of, too many to list here. she spent money on cameras and door alarm monitoring. anyway, a few years ago, she said her apartment has fleas, but get this, her dog did not! she still spent hundreds of dollars on flea treatments. she even took what she thought were flea carcasses to a dermatologist, and was told she has delusions. (she's received that diagnosis from various doctors, to no avail) she started to say her ex-husband is blowing dust and fleas on her through holes in the ceiling, and that he lives in the apartment above her. a few months later, she said she had the fleas under control, but then earlier this year, she started saying she now has mites all over her body. she puts various tree oils and who knows what else all over herself, and does a lot of laundry. she caused a rash on her face, probably from putting various 'treatments' on. and now she also picks at her imaginary mites. a month ago, she suddenly signed a new lease with a new apartment, saying she has to get away from her ex-husband (who, in actuality, is in his 80s now, can't walk well, and lives hours away from her). we worked very hard to help her move, though she didn't consult with me about whether it was convenient, and yet we knew with 100% certainty that moving would not stop her delusions. sure enough, it's been just 2 weeks since the move and a few days ago she told me her ex-husband lives in the apartment above her. she still thinks she has mites, and she's also developed olfactory and auditory hallucinations. she thinks she hears her ex-husband whistling, and gets angry with us when we say we can't hear anything. and she thinks she smells vapors or fumes that he's blowing on her somehow. we're hopeful that the new place she moved to, which has independent apartments, but also has assisted living services, will place barriers on her behavior, or somehow enforce mental health treatment. we'll see. i'm also 100% certain that even if her ex-husband passes away before she does, she will still think he's tormenting her, or that he's hired people to do it after his death.",2097,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"i am the accused - will it go away if he meets someone else? hello i am new to this forum and am at my wits end with my partner of 10 years. to cut a very long story short i have been accused of having an affair and committing fraud for the past two years. it started suddenly one day and has been relentless ever since. initially he was manic and psychotic for over two months and he frightened me so much that i got the police involved. he thought he was being chased and filmed on the motorway and followed into work with people breaking into his house and moving things just to unnerve him. he comes and goes as he pleases and at times is quite scary as he is verbally aggressive. he had an affair four years ago which i forgave, he didn’t apologise and i feel he is projecting his guilt into me. i am also accused of staring at men younger than my sons all the time and am told that i’m embarrassing for doing this. the person i’m accused of having the affair with is a random estate agent i met a few times when selling my house and this person is also accused of recruiting me to commit the fraud. i’ve left him so many times but then feel sorry for him as ‘he isn’t well’. i’m told by his family that he had a very similar psychotic episode when he split with his first wife but this only lasted about six months - this was four years before he met me. he told me himself when we met that his wife had an affair but she wouldn’t admit it but if she had then they would have been ok - he’s used the exact same words to me too! i’m told by his sister that he had an affair when he was married - two years before he accused his wife of doing the same. my question is that if i just let him go and he met someone else (which he keeps threatening to do as he constantly tells me that i don’t love him) would he just get better? i’m thinking that this may be the kindest thing to do for him, as much as i love him i am the total focus of his delusion and probably being with me isn’t helping him. i add that he has lost a very good job and a 20 year career six months ago because of this and they paid him off to leave - this is also my fault apparently. he hasn’t accessed any help as he doesn’t see that he has a problem. it is all me and i’m just trying to make him think he’s going mad. sorry for rambling jan",2098,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"wife has dd any help is appreciated well it’s day 6 of her stay at the psych ward. i went to visit her the past 3 nights. it is truly sad that there are rules of engagement when going to see a loved one in the hospital, but not a hint of what to say or not say. she hates me for putting her in there. (don’t blame her) it’s horrid. she wanted to know why and i told the truth which she didn’t want to hear. she had left her wedding ring there in the safe as huge fu to me and it worked. but i explained to her, i don’t want the ring back if it’s not attached to you. i asked if tucker was still in the picture. she looked offended and hurt but her reply was basically that she doesn’t think personal relationships are fair game. she offered me roommate status after stay and i said no. your my wife or your not. i am so sick of arguing the same crap over and over. the psychiatrist there apparently didn’t read my notes on hyperparathyroidism or doesn’t care. that’s not even an issue. it feels like the whole thing is insane and i just opened the door and walked in the middle of it. i feel that i have to do the leg for her doctors and it’s not enough. i say blessings for anybody that has or had a loved one in a “behavioral center” you deserve medals for tolerating the bs and keep going back. you are hero’s. well that’s it for tonight. i’m sitting in chipotle because i hate the empty house. my first hour everyday is re-telling my self what happened. for some reason i always want to talk with my wife in the morning. old habits. i just want to forget. forget how fu my life has become. fu because it was the worst birthday i’ve had in 45 years. fu because our anniversary and her birthday is coming up in a week. i just know it will make me look like a bigger jerk than she thinks i am. i bought a card for both and they really don’t make so you have dd cards so i went with blank. anyways thanks and keep on keeping on.

"erotomania? my husband and i have been together for 31 years. he is bipolar 1 and has had difficulties with psychosis, mania and depression many times during our life together. he has a tendency to think women are attracted to him, and are coming on to him. the last woman this happened with started in 2010. she attended our church and works at the same place he does, though not in the same department. he started to talk to her before church started. she is in the choir. then, it moved on to emailing her a lot. he has done this other times. emailing a few women he thought he was having a relationship with. some of it was sexual in content. i don't know specifics about the content with this last one. he hasn't given them to me. but, in 2011, she had their employer warn him to stay away from her. the end of 2012, he became manic and phoned her. she had him arrested and ended up getting a restraining order against him. she then got a permanent restraining order against him in 2014. this woman was just one of many women who he was convinced was attracted and coming on to him. recently, i had a conversation with him about this. he is totally convinced that these women were attracted to him. i know for a fact none of these women ever were interested in him. obviously, the last woman made it extremely clear. unfortunately, he thinks her husband made her arrest him and get a restraining order against him. is this erotomania? is it possible to talk sense into him? make him see that none of these so-called attractions were real? he is a professor in a university. recently, he told me that an attractive, young woman in his class flirted with him. but ""he did not take the bait, and pursue it."" he was quite proud of himself. i am very upset. i am sure that was not at all what happened. 20 year olds do not come on to 58 yr old men who look 75. i am worried that he could lose his job if he did ""act"" on an imagined come on. he almost lost his job twice because of the last woman with the restraining order. sorry this is so long. does this sound like erotomania?",2121,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"mom has dd - persecutory type and i am at a loss hi, new here - quick introduction: my mother, in her 70's, has delusional disorder persecutory subtype. she's always been a little odd - a little paranoid, but about 8 or so years ago my stepfather died and she went totally off the rails. she moved into a townhouse, and then became convinced that the neighbors were out to get her. she thought they poisoned her dog, she thought they had bugged the townhouse, she thought they were pumping poison in through the air conditioner, that they were talking to the property manager to get her evicted, etc. etc.. i lived in a different state at that time and believed that maybe she had some bad neighbors (i mean, i knew they weren't poisoning her, but i could believe that maybe they were unpleasant). so she moved to a house in a different neighborhood, and again the same kind of delusions popped up, except now she was convinced she was hearing them talk about her, and somehow she became convinced that the old neighbors knew the new neighbors. she was overwrought with anxiety a lot of the time. finally convinced her to see a geriatric psychiatrist, but she bitched about it, because she didn't think that there was anything wrong with her, and she wasn't compliant with med. so...i moved to another part of the country to start a new job, and because i was so stressed out from not being able to help from a distance i moved her up here too. first it took months to get her moved out of my house into her apartment (finally happened with something of a scene - she paid rent for four months without once sleeping in her apartment). within a month, the paranoia set in again. took her to a psychiatrist multiple times, but she incorporated the psychiatrist into her delusions. moved her to a totally secure beautiful condo - doorman building, private garage, etc. - and she is convinced these neighbors are mafia and drug dealers and that they know the old evil neighbors. she thinks they are destroying her hearing, that they're trying to drill through her ceiling to abduct her, and that they are shooting lasers at her to make her blind (through the floor, ceiling, walls) but that aluminum foil can protect her. she also had a delusion involving my aunts, so now isn't speaking to them. this winter i caught her sleeping in her car to avoid the neighbors, took her to the er, and she was committed for a short stay, but after 3 or 4 days when she wouldn't sign herself in, they let her out. then a new psychiatrist, drugs that seem to do nothing, and she won't take anything that would make her sleepy because she feels like she needs to be vigilant all night. she spends almost all day everyday at my house, which drives my husband and kids crazy because it is just one thing about the neighbors after another. it stresses me out and depresses me. i have no family to help shoulder the load on this. i hate it because she could be having a nice life, but she's making herself miserable for no reason. i know she's hiding things from me because she knows i don't believe people are out to get her - like she asked a friend to take her to a hotel last night to get away from the neighbors, or that she sleeps in her closet sometimes. if you look at her, she seems put together - nicely dressed, pays her bills, drives, highly articulate and intelligent. she does have some short term memory issues the last year or two leading to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, but it is pretty mild. i feel so hopeless. i can't help her. she doesn't get better. she is petrified of being by herself, but it is impossible to have her move in with us because it is so hard to hear the paranoid ranting all day. she called the police on the neighbors the other day, and i had to go behind her and call them the next day when i found out, to explain her diagnosis and that the people upstairs aren't actually doing anything wrong... sorry for unloading, it is just so hard right now. anyone have advice? or can let me know i'm not alone? thanks.",2122,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"mom has dd - persecutory type and i am at a loss hi tennesseegal, i'm sorry you're going through this about your mom. i know how it feels to have nearly that exact scenario and it's so unusual and heavy that you can't really talk about it to people because it's too much. my husband and kids are supportive, but i try to shield them from the responsibility and burden. thankfully, i can call my sister to vent once in a while, but she lives very far away. my mom is also in her 70s, and we've been dealing with her delusions for the past 9 years. she was married to a nice man, they'd been together for about 30 years. but suddenly she began to think he was damaging her furniture or knotting up the fringe on her blanket or scratching her paintings. really weird stuff. though, she also thought he was having multiple affairs with neighbors or even acquaintances of mine. three years into her delusions, during which i'd been conferring with doctors, elder specialists, and talked her into seeing a counselor, there was no change. then she snapped and thought her husband was going to kill her. she called police and then was willing to go to a geriatric psych unit for two weeks. they, like previous doctors, diagnosed psychosis with delusions. but she refuses that diagnosis and won't take medications. she is now divorced and living in an apartment. she has become more vocal about her suspicions, telling her friends that her ex-husband is stalking her, that he enters her apartment to damage her things all the time. she spends money on surveillance, cameras, and alarm system. she complains to her apartment manager and calls police occasionally about the 'break-ins', and the police have contacted us so we can share information. the police agree that she's got all her abilities - paying bills, keeping her apartment nice, etc. she's super smart, funny, very pretty, and stylish. this brain illness is so tragic. she says she wants to move to get away from her ex-husband (who we still keep in contact with and help take care of, but in secret from her - so complicated). i know i can't stop her from moving to another city if she ends up really planning that, but i also know that wherever she goes, some delusion will be there always. even if her ex-husband died, i know she'd still believe he's somehow hired someone to break in, or blow dust on her, even beyond his death. the staff at the psychiatric unit where she was in 2012 let us know that we can set limits on what we allow in our house. so if she starts talking about her delusions, i don't engage and i tell her i'll have to take her home if she continues. i've talked recently with county elder specialists, and they, too, told me to guard my own peace of mind. the professionals said i cannot let my mom's upset affect my life, and that i can't ease her discomfort. it's hard for me, because i really wish i could help her. i've tried so many ways, to no avail. so now i see her about once every 10 days, help her get groceries, or sort papers, or take her to lunch. we connect by text or phone every few days and i listen to her current suspicions because i want to keep tabs on her actions. she does keep secrets from me because she knows i don't believe her, but sometimes she lets something slip, like a new suspicion, or that she's filed a new complaint somewhere. i used to think my mom could live with us when she got older, but not now. her being so upset is unpredictable and troubling, and being with her is full of tension, with us guarding against what topic she's about to bring up. she's not violent, but i don't know what her delusions could bring her to do. when she stayed here for 3 nights recently because of a minor medical procedure, i locked my bedroom door at night (our kids are at college). i feel for you, and it's helpful for me to hear that there are others experiencing this with a parent, too.",2123,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"mom has dd - persecutory type and i am at a loss hi there i previously wrote a whole reply and lost it so fingers crossed this time. sorry to hear you're having such a hard time with your mum. unfortunately my situation is quite similar, but without the hubby and kids. my mum is 72 and the delusional disorder started around 15 years ago. she has also always been a bit paranoid. my mums delusions are very similar. she thinks one of the neighbours has bugged the house and is harming her through the electrics/wifi (sending shocks etc). my mum also believes aluminium foil or a baking tray can protect her. my brother lives abroad so it's just me. it's very, very hard. these aren't my words, but they are from another carer for someone with a mental illness and sum things up pretty well. they described the situation as 'heartbreaking, isolating and testing to the soul'. the situation weighs very heavily on you and takes a huge toll. the paranoid ranting is very hard. my mums issues were always 'episodes', but this current episode has lasted since may and is not going away. to be honest, the fact that her illness was episodic kept me going as i knew that the dd would eventually go away and there would be a period of respite, however brief. also my mum has started to get more 'manic' and irrational about normal thing and has a lot of mood swings. she got massively stressed out and irrational about cleaning the living room earlier. you'd think it was a cesspit, it isnt... she's also been quite mean recently....it seems like i do nothing right which is devastating when you're going through hell to support someone you care about. my mum has tried almost every antipsychotic out there and as soon as she reaches an efficacious dose the side effects (fatigue, sleepiness) become intolerable. i'm sorry i can't be more positive about the situation, but at least we're not entirely alone in this. i'm in the uk and would really like to get in touch with others dealing with this. i'd really like to hear more about your experiences colleen, but i'll write a separate post before i lose everything i've written. take care g",2126,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"husband with delusional jealousy - no hope? hi. i have been reading everyone else's posts on this topic and while i've accepted what is happening and why, i wanted to do a mind dump for others to read before they become the same fragile mess i have become. this will be a long post but hoping that it helps others and also hoping that getting it all down will be therapeutic for me as well. here goes: my husband and i have been together for 17 years, married for 2. we always had a difficult relationship because we are very different people who really just came together accidentally. that is important in our back story but it's the last two years that have nearly killed me emotionally. about 3 years ago, while i was working away from home, the distance did amazing things for our relationship and we fell madly in love with each other for the first time since the early days. when my work wrapped up, things just got better and better - i never thought i could love this man as much as i did. when i was driving across the country on my way home, the kids and he were using my computer to check where i was as it was a two day drive and i always keep my google location services on. on my second day of travel, my husband rang and said he'd been up all night worrying as apparently google maps showed that i didn't go home to my apartment on my second last night. i laughed it off because when you look at the 'pings' on google, you could see quite clearly that i did go home even if the main map made it look like i hadn't. my husband mostly accepted what i said but he was actually dwelling on it. no matter how i explained it, he started analyzing other things. things like: - why sometimes i was cold on the phone when working away (this was mainly because refused to get a job and i was getting cranky about making the sacrifice of working away from him and the kids and despite the excellent pay, it didn't really get us ahead because he wasn't working and was using marijuana on a daily basis). also, he has always had a habit of being a bit stalky with repeated phone calls for no particular reason and i had other things to do. i should also mention that my best friend of 30 years was on her death bed with a brain tumor and ii was a bit of mess over this. - why did it take me so long to clean my 1 bedroom apartment before packing up - i wanted my bond back and knew how particular agents could be with bond cleaning so i cleaned everything meticulously. these discussions were initially very low key events but over time, my husband developed a couple of theories. first theory was that i met someone out and didn't go home one night because i spent the night with the guy. once that was debunked, the theory was that i met someone in the basement of the apartment complex and then regularly left my unit to go and spend the night with him. that theory fizzled so then he started focusing on cars at the local shopping centers that had number plates from the state my work was based in. the theory was that the guy i was having an affair with moved his entire family up here to be close to me so we could sneak quickies in whenever we wanted. after a while, he found a guy in our area to fixate on. this guy apparently looked weirdly at him and i in the supermarket and someone similar to his description was seen on our street one night. the guy he fixated on was a parent at the kids school and he went around to their house to talk to the wife. he found out that the guy worked as a miner fifo so whenever he saw the guy was home from work, he started watching me and analyzing every thing i did and every move i made. some of his evidence an accusations we- the guy is tall and probably well endowed and sex wasn't as good any more because the man had stretched me. - i must have pubic lice because he'd seen me scratching even though this clearly wasn't the case. - any song i listened to had hidden meaning because the guy had sent it to me. - a guy from my work sent me a message after we got engaged saying 'so, you've been swept off your feet?'. according to my husband, this had nothing to do with him - it must have been the imaginary affair guy. - one morning he found a small puddle of water on our front deck. this could only have been due to me getting up in the middle of the night, having sex with my lover and washing away the evidence. - another morning, a small piece of timber had fallen off the top of our deck and this can only have been due to my tall lover pulling it off. - some plants out the front half died. my lover must have peed on them. - i got sick last year with a kidney stone which resulted in a uti. these two things must have happened because i'm sleeping around. - i am nearing menopause and was using extra large tampons. i discretely bought some personal lube to assist which he found and decided it was for my lover and i. - hubby has had heart problems and at one stage, he asked the dr if it could be that he's being poisoned. - when he takes the kids to school (round trip of 6 - 8 minutes), my lover is hiding nearby and we have sex while he's out. that is just some of it. i arranged and payed for a lie detector test and this is something i wish i had never done. i was so upset and stressed that the result came back inconclusive so in his eyes, this is also evidence that i am a lying, cheating #$%^. at one stage i had to take out a dvo because he was making me wear a fitbit to bed and night and he was getting pretty scary for a while. happy to say that he is not violent and has never gotten physical with me. i'm embarrassed to say that i married him while this was all going on though it wasn't until after we got married that he became 100% convinced that i was cheating on him. before that it was - 'now that we are engaged, i trust you' & 'once we are married....' etc. in 17 years, i have never even looked at another man and i have extremely high morals and standards. i have never cheated on anyone and never would. my husband used to look at me with love in his eyes and heart but now he just looks at me like i'm his worst enemy. denials don't work. arguing doesn't work. at the end of the day, he has a fixed belief that he knows what is going on and no matter what i say, i'm guilty. i have been a prisoner in my own home for over a year. i can go out if i really want but the repercussions aren't really worth it. if i take too long at the grocery shop, it means i've hooked up. if i stop to get fuel on the way back from my parents house, i've hooked up in a car park or somewhere public. if i shave my legs or wax my bikini line, it's obviously for my lover. i barely get any time alone and he has set up hidden recording devices around the house. one day, he listened to an audio recording that i think was the dog snoring, and i was accused of having someone here as the noises can only have been made by someone having sex. another day, he asked (yelled) me why i had put a video of myself having sex with my lover on his phone. he had deleted the video and couldn't show me but he says it was videoed on his phone from a site like youporn. apparently, i have uploaded these videos of myself to youporn. as i'm writing this, my other half is meeting with a psychiatrist. i don't know how this will play out but he agreed to go on the condition that i also go and get checked our for a personality order like bi-polar or something because he believes i'm a compulsive liar and narcissist because of what he thinks i'm doing to him. he has only really gone to prove that i have a problem so i don't think it's going to help. i will post updates as events unfold. at this stage, i don't believe we have a future and we are planning to separate. main reason is that i just can't deal with it anymore. i have not done a single thing wrong, yet i feel guilty every time i do something that he may read something into. i feel unloved, disrespected, emotionally drained and my health hasn't been great since this all started. i think we are at the point of having a very toxic relationship and it's not doing either of us any good. i guess the most frustrating thing for me is the no-end arguments where he keeps telling me that 'he knows what's going on' and there is nothing wrong with him at all.",2130,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"husband with delusional jealousy - no hope? a week after the psychiatrist appointment and i haven't really gotten much information about how it went though, the psych has scheduled an appointment for me to come in at hubby's next appointment. we both had individual appts with our relationship counsellor yesterday and she advised me (and said she also advised him) that due to the toxic nature of our relationship, if something doesn't give, she is going to have to get child protection involved. she is encouraging me to move out or make him move out though this isn't something he would ever do. i sat him down when i got home and we discussed the planned separation. i told him that i'm moving out asap and the kids will have their home base with me but he can see them whenever he wants. naturally this wasn't taken very well and a huge argument followed. i am extremely confused now. he is now trying to convince me that the affair he has accused me of having has never really been the problem. the problem is that he believes someone is stalking around our house and has been in our house and if i know nothing about it, then it must be someone who means harm. i tried to rationalize with him on this. nothing has been stolen and no property damage except for a couple of half dead plants outside have happened. why would someone be stalking us? why haven't our cameras caught this person? why haven't our neighbors seen anything? he doesn't have any answers but most of his evidence of this is all a bit fuzzy. two things of about 20 could mean someone has been hanging around but someone is home here 95% of the time, so it all sounds a bit unlikely. the two things are quite substantial. 1. he has an outdoor camera he had placed around the side of the house. one day he brought it in (only out for a day) and he discovered the memory card was missing. obviously this is sus but it disappeared when we were home and it's weird that the camera didn't get taken as well as it was just sitting there. there are only 3 possibilities: - around that day the electric meter checking guy was around. the camera was on the meter box. we have some junk in that part of the yard. perhaps he was poking around the junk and realised the camera was there and took the card so we didn't see what he was doing. - hubby forgot to put the card in - they are very tiny and would be easy to misplace - someone is stalking us 2. some of our outdoor downlights (solar) have switches on them that have apparently been turned off. no idea about either of these two things but as mentioned, these are the only two substantial things he has seen. the rest are as stated in the first post but include plants that have half died, footsteps around the side (pretty much proved to be our large dog), solar light falling off the gutter, small bit of wood falling off the top of the front deck, puddle on the front deck, side fence has started leaning a bit. he says there's lots of other things but hasn't actually told me them. anyway, i don't know whether he is just scrambling with this new revelation (about the problem not being me potentially having an affair) to keep me here or whether i'm going mad and i've been dwelling for a long time on the accusations and i'm the one who has kept it going. logic tells me that i'm not going mad because he often splurts random accusations though often quite cryptic. eg ""you like your men big"" (hubby is not particularly tall but he is lean and fit) or ""the door handle is warm as if you've been hanging on to it watching for me to come home (sometimes he'll say that i'm being mounted by my other man while hanging onto it). i think i've become a bit acclimatized to the comments now because when i read back that last comment, i realize how disgustingly sick it sounds.",2131,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"husband with delusional jealousy - no hope? thanks for sharing your story, sshhbear; it has common elements with many of the stories that have been posted here over the years. i'm sorry that you're going through this. i think that at this point a divorce--and moving away from your husband--will give you both some peace. from the stories i've read here, it seems that a very tiny few have made recoveries. usually with a combination of medication and therapy. however, the obstacle to this treatment is ""lack of insight"" which accompanies dd. it's the inability for a dd sufferer to recognize that something's wrong with his or her thinking. like your husband they think ""there's nothing wrong with me"", and they refuse to accept medication. if he won't accept medication, then there is nothing further you can do to help him. you can't fix him. at this point, you can only help yourself. you can do this by minimizing your contact with him; this will reduce your own anxiety that is caused by his behavior.",2132,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"husband with delusional jealousy - no hope? update. i bought another house and moved out of our family home 2 days ago. i cried a lot the last few weeks because i really didn't want to leave him. i had to for my own sake - i was getting more and more depressed and he interpreted my mental state as me having doubts as to whether i was doing the right thing. i know i did the right thing but it doesn't make it any easier. i don't know whether my current emotional state is due to this unresolved thing hanging over my head or because i grieving over my lost love. i am doing most things right though yesterday we sent each other a lot of silly flirty texts. i miss my husband but if i was still in the house, i would still miss him because he doesn't trust me or look at me with love anymore. good news is that the psychiatrist prescribed respiridon and while he ignored the prescription for the first couple of weeks, he did fill it and has been taking his tablets and has been to the psychiatrist 3 times with a 4th appt scheduled in 11 days time. i hope he goes. at the second visit, the psych told him that it's a pretty good bet that he has a mental health condition and privately told me that delusional jealousy was the likely culprit. hubby doesn't believe still. the risperidon isn't helping unfortunately. he took a low dose for the first couple of weeks (1mg) but now i think he's up to 3 or 4 mg. hasn't had any impact - his beliefs may have actually become more concrete and he doesn't want me to talk about it to him at all. i understand that not talking about it would be better for him but god help me, i need closure. my moral compass is soooo strong and it makes me crazy knowing that someone in this world, worst still the person who knows me best believes i would do something like this. it's eating me up. i'm going to start daily yoga and meditation as soon as i have my boxes unpacked because i really need to find inner peace with this thing. at several times during my ordeal, i locked myself in our bathroom and curled up on the floor in complete despair. luckily i never felt suicidal but i did have fleeting thoughts in times when i felt everything was hopeless. so glad i made it out while i still had a shred of sanity. i'll update in another week or so. on a lighter note, after a particularly sad day last week, i was curious just how my body could keep producing tears and nose goop. i collected three of my tissues and weighed them. 400g! wow! no wonder my skin looks dry at the moment. i must have cried kilos over the last year ps if anyone is going through the same thing, drop me a line for a chat if you need someone to talk to. i am still on my journey despite moving out and i would love to help anyone who wants a mutually beneficial sounding board.",2133,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"husband with delusional jealousy - no hope? having a bad day today. actually, most days are bad. i am so miserable without him but know we can't be together anymore. i think the thing that is making me so sad is that i honestly thought he would come to his senses at some stage after i moved out, search his soul for the truth, then smother me with apologies for the way he has treated me before begging me to come back. wow! i was living in a dream world, wasn't i? the reality is that his medication is for 'making him feel better and getting rid of the constant butterflies in his stomach' according to him whereas i was hopeful that it would make him think clearer and see the truth. i suppose he's right but in the meantime, he still thinks there's nothing wrong with him, i'm still a cheating, lying s%$t i have no company at all for 4 days every week and i'm obsessing over the whole thing. worst of all, after i stood by this behaviour for 2 solid years, he's not here for me when i am literally falling apart. i can't talk to any friends about it because that would be speaking against him to common friends/family, i can't talk to my sister because she's been my sounding board and is sick of hearing about it and if i try to talk to him, he thinks i'm pathetic and tells me he's losing more respect for me each time i bring it up. i know that no one is going to ride up on a while horse and make everything better, but at this stage, i would be happy with a small pony coming to the rescue. i don't know if i'll be ok. i'm seeing a counsellor but she's away until early august. i probably need to go to the drs and discuss depression but that is not my style at all. i had post natal depression with my second child and i managed to pull myself out of it without medication and i'm hoping i can do the same this time. i really don't want any medication to fix me. i just want my husband back. and that puts me between a rock and a hard place because in the .01% chance he comes back from his delusional state and i let him, my family and few friends won't accept my decision due to what they think of him now. i've always made a point of telling them it's not his fault - it's the illness - but he hasn't always been a good partner and they are happy that i've finally left him. i'm just rambling today, sorry. it has just been such a hard thing to deal with.",2134,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"husband with delusional jealousy - no hope? hi sshhbear, i'm sorry you are going through this. but i think you absolutely did the right thing in leaving. from reading about this illness over the last decade since my mom's brain went haywire, very few are able to see that they have the illness. and my mom has gotten much worse. my mom's suspicions are continual, no matter where she is, whether at home or visiting someone, and have gotten even stronger. her delusions change and morph and she still rewrites conversations and occurrences, even ones she had a previous story for, they are now even more different. she has also now developed auditory and olfactory hallucinations, where she thinks her ex-husband (she hasn't even seen him in 7 years) is blowing a toxic vapor into her apartment, and he's also whistling or singing nearby, just to drive her crazy. in reality, he is now elderly and lives over 2 hours away. i tried telling her that, but now she says he's in her apartment building while using a walker. i dread the days that i visit with her when she says she ""has to tell me what's been going on"". she calls the police occasionally to report the ""break-ins"". the police have spoken with me and they have her on their crisis care list. she totally thinks they believe her. i know they are just trained to not refute a person with delusions. at the beginning, her delusions were jealousy-type. she accused her then-husband of having multiple affairs all over the place, once following him to the gym, and she wanted to confront a lady down the hall. later, she began thinking he was going through her papers, and then later she began thinking he wanted to harm her. anyway, i'm telling you this not to alarm anyone, but just to describe the progression this illness can take. we were so hopeful in the beginning when she had a hospital episode and was diagnosed, and was seeing a mental health person for quite a while, but her delusions never went away. it took us a few years to sort of fully realize our mom is permanently ill, and for the angst and stress over it all to dissipate. i saw a counselor for a while, just to come to grips with it, and to help establish my boundaries. i've spoken with a couple attorneys and mental health experts, and all have said there's nothing i can do. i consider my job now just to make sure she's okay, and we see her and try to be nice, but we limit the conversation topics, and limit the time we spend with her. it's all super sad. i hope you find peace, and someone or a mental health group to talk to. it's hard when this illness is so rare, with the seriously mentally ill person able to function otherwise, that others really can't understand what you're going through.",2135,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"husband with delusional jealousy - no hope? hi sshbear, i just wanted to tell you that you are not alone and you are moving in the right direction. your story is my story (almost word for word). i too have just made the decision to put myself and my children first and move out. it was too toxic. it never stopped. i am exhausted trying to defend myself and i am now at the point where i just loose my $#%^ at him whenever he brings up an accusation. so it was time to go. i told him i havent given up on him and i'll be here waiting for him when he can see things for what they really are. i know that my never happen. and i know my marriage is most likely over but i realise now after struggling and being tormented for 3 years that nothing i say or do will change my husbands mind about what i havent done. and i am slowly coming to the conclusion that my husband will never forgive me for something i didnt do. its heartbreaking. i finally made the decision to get professional help for him and as of today it is completely out of my hands. he works away week on week off and last night shift he dudnt sleep for 3 days and completely went off the rails. told me to ###$ off and get out of the house, that he loved me but i didnt deserve him and he was gone. hes never said that and a big red flag went off in my head. ""i need to save my husband from himself - this really has nothing to do with me"" so i made the decision to call our local mental health community clinic. i told them my story of secret cameras, tracking my car, cloning my phone, the hours upon hours of studying the recordings, the 2 years of unemployment, the not coping with life, the daily wild accusations and imagined scenarios etc and the newest finding. meth. my husband was a pot smoker too and in searching for answers i tricked him into a urine test. he failed miserably and i was heartbroken. .. but it explained alot of his behaviours. alot but not all. here i was being accused of being a liar and a sneak, all the while my husband was sneaking ice into our house .. and i was unknowingly buying it for him. so right now, as we speak a revision board is being assembled to assess my case and within the next 7 days my husband will have his rights taken away from him and he will be taken by ambulance to the hospital to be assessed and treated. i feel sick about it. i want to throw up. i know he will see this as the ultimate betrayal but i know i've exhausted all other options. this man is destroying himself, his family, his marriage and his career and i've been sitting there hopelessly fighting a battle i can not win. i know that things have not gotten better, i have tried being patient, understanding, silent. i have tried reasoning, common sense, begging, threatening and now all i'm left with is the realization that this is beyond his and my control. i love this man with all my heart. i would never dream of cheating on him. ever. period. but this is not the man i married and i cant stay with him the way he is as i'm his trigger and he is destroying me. the ironic thing is that although he will see this as the ultimate betrayal it is in actual fact the ultimate act of love. i know i'm sacrificing my marriage to try and save this beautiful man. hopefully one day he will understand. if there is one piece of advice i can give. remember that this actually isnt about you. and you will only destroy yourself trying to fix it on your own. if you believe his delusions are plummeting him into a depression, get him help and let them take it out of your hands then be kind to yourself and talk to a professional about the hell you have been through (because it is a living hell) and no one goes through this unscathed. xo",2136,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"husband with delusional jealousy - no hope? thank you beautiful people for your replies. it's so heartbreaking isn't it? i have tried to enlist members of my husband's family to help and they are really supportive when i call them but then i don't hear back from them so i don't know if he convinces them of 'what he knows' and then they don't bother getting back in touch or if it's because they just can't be bothered with it all. i have thought about trying to get myself into a 'rebound' relationship just to distract myself from obsessing over what i haven't tried yet. i have even pulled out an old deck of tarot cards (with no experience or knowledge aside from a quick google) to get answers and they appear to be freakishly right every time though of course, they can be interpretted to whatever fits a person's circumstances. don't judge me for going spiritual - i will try just about anything at this stage. faithfullyfedup, did you have any luck with showing him similar stories on forums such as this? i find when reading other people's stories, some delusions seem to be the norm. eg - the middle of the night meetings with these lovers - the hyper vigilance etc - limiting their other half's movements - blaming the other person of having mental health problems etc - thinking the other person is lying about everything i have also thought about calling the hospital to take him for an assessment but he smokes daily and because of it, he is calm most of the time. if anything it's me who loses the plot when we argue. i never really felt there was a right time. i might make some enquiries about triggers to watch for in terms of getting him help. he's still taking respiridon (or says he is) but he did tell me that after his last psychiatrist appointment he probably won't go back. faithfullyfedup, how did you go with him being taken away? did it happen? also what about your kids? the best i could convince him of was 50/50 shared care so this is in place now but i do worry a little about the kids. they are 12 and 14 so not silly and they know the basics around what is going on, but really don't want to know anything else which is good. they love their dad and he loves them with all his heart so i believe they are safe. i guess my only concern is knowing how this condition can escalate. originally i put my foot down and insisted i have them 4 nights but because 'there's nothing wrong with him' he stomped on that after the first week and pressured me into the 50/50. while i do love him, he has always had a knack for being quite intimidating and i'm a people pleaser so that makes it hard to stand my ground with things like this. i had one conversation a month ago when i asked him when the last time he thinks i was with this lover and he said it was two nights ago. i said ""really? because i've been on my period for the last 3 days"" and he knows that my first 3-5 days are insanely heavy. his reply was, ""yeah but that doesn't bother this bloke!"" never mind that it would bother me. i find that now, when we talk on the phone, he will tell me that i am the only person who can fix the problem (unsaid: by ending the affair and not lying anymore) and if i try to reason with him, he tells me that he is losing more and more respect for me every time we discuss it. he says he just wants me to come clean and stop living my life as a big lie. he sent me a text a couple of days ago telling me that he thinks i'm like a gay person who hasn't come out yet and is struggling with the decisions i've made. oh my god! it is so, so, so frustrating!!!!",2137,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"husband with delusional jealousy helloo, this is kind of long but i kinda need to vent. first let me start by saying i love my husband more than words can describe. we have been together 12 years and have 6 children. (2 his, 3 mine and 1 ours). my youngest 3 children live with us (ages 12,12 and 9). my husband has always had a bit of a jealous streak and has always cheated on his sognificant others. my husband has cheated on me multiple times and has had various drug addictions, and has been clean for over a year now. may of 2010 my husbands oxy addiction came to a head and i had caught him talking to other women on singles web sites again. i was 5 months pregnant at the time with a high risk pregnancy with twins and had placenta previa.i found his account and his passwords and saw all the conversations. that morning he had been 2 days without opiates and was in withdrawal. when confronted on breaking his promises yet again, he attempted to kill himself with a bottle of 100 doxepin pills. he was rushed to the hospital and kept for observation after his stomach was pumped, he blamed it all on me, i drove him to it. the doctor reccomended inpatient rehab. i agreed. we found a wonderful place that would not only treat the addiction but help with anger management and had daily psych visits to treat the underlying cause of the addiction. being a nurse myself, tyhis was fantastic news. the day of discharge he refused to go. i played the tough love role and told him if he didnt go he couldnt come home. he left the hospital and came home and got his car which i had put his belongings in. he left and went and stayed with one friend, then another friend and his wife. although suspicious of frequent lengthy phone calls between he and his friends wife, i didnt know he actually had something going with his friend (excuse me, his dealers) wife. after being gone for 2 weeks, he agreed to come home and go to rehab. he told the kids, we scheduled the day and time...and....he never showed up. apparently he and his friends wife took off together. needless to say, my children and i were devestated. it was a rough couple of weeks. fast forward 4 weeks, i lost my job due to missed time to file a protective order when he threatened me and latenesses due to child care issues. exactly a week later while packing up my house to move myself and my children in with my parents, i went in to premature labor. my local hospital rushed me to a higher level hospital where my husband rushed to my side. our twin boys were born 2 days later 15 weeks premature. we stayed at the nicu and the ronald mcdonald house with them until at 2 weeks old one passed away and at 3 weeks old the other passed away. this was so devastating to us, our parents, our children, everyone. we then went to stay with my parents with our children. homeless, neither of us working. we got my husband into a suboxone program which he has stuck with ever since. during all this my husband made so many promises and assurances how different things were going to be. 4 months after our boys passed away, we couldnt stay with my parents any longer so i got a good paying job as a nurse manager and went back to work. 4 weeks later we were back in our own hosue with our children. through all my husbands addiction problems and the loss of our boys i realized that i was co dependent and vowed that i would not rely on him or how he treated me for my own emotional well being. after being back in our own house for months, my husband, although faithful, just didnt treat me like he loved me. he wouldnt get a job to relieve any of the financial stress off me, when it came to the kids sports, i did all the scheduling and transporting and he rarely touched me. the final straw was on valentines day when i wanted him and he pushed me away. i made the decision to stop trying so that i wouldnt allow him to hurt me anymore. thats when things got tragically worse..... after that my husband became even more jealous and controlling. swearing i was having affairs, accusing me of any male he saw at my place of unemployment, constantly calling me names. in july of this year it got even worse to where he was staying up all night for days ata time, going through my phone, checking all my emails, my facebook, my call logs, on my cellp[hone account. he calls numbers off my phone in the middle of the night and wakes people up. he finally left and went to his dads. we had tickets to a baseball game that friday so i ended up taking the kids by myself. he swore i was there with my kids and my boyfriend. those 3 days he was at his dads he started to become psychotic to the point of where he told his stepmother that i called him at 3 in the morning and told him i didnt love him and to not call me anymore cause i have company in my bedroom. he showed up at my house the nexct day and started taking some of his tools out of the basement. accusing me, calling me names, broke my phone, told our kids what a whore i was etc. he was so off, he couldnt even walk straight. he then showed me a whole bottle of xanax he had stolen from his dad and told me he was going to kill himself. he left the house drove around the block and came back but i had locked the door. he banged on the door and demanded and begged for me to let him in which i refused. he told me he was going to go kill himself now then walked down the sidewalk and threw his phone at my house breaking both his phone and my window. he then got in his truck, drove around the block and slammed his truck into the passenger side of my car. i called the police and he ended up being taken to the hospital under an emergency petition. once they pumped his stomach and cleared him medically he was placed in a psych holding area and deemed incompetent. while in the emergency room he was so bizarre. saying things to his mother and the doctors that i was in the parking lot in a truck having sex with my boyfriend in the hospital parking lot and that i had moved my boyfriend in to our house. when he was seen the following day by the psychiatrist (which was a sunday) he was diagnosed with paranoid delusional psychosis, bipolar disorder and delusional jealousy. the doctor told me he was being admitted for inpatient psych treatment and would be there about a week. he was going to get antipsychotics and mood stabilizers and wouldnt be discharged until his delusions had resolved. the following morning ,which was monday, i was told he was refusing his meds and they would pursue a court order to have him take his meds. that same afternoon he was discharged. why? we had no insurance. he had a friend pick him up, drove to his dads house stole another bottle of 90 xanax and punched his 70 year old father in the face. he doesnt remeber the next 2 days during which time i picked hinm up from a hotel and brought him back home with the promise that he would get the free outpatient help the hospital reccomended. he never did. so, for the last 3 months, i have been dealing with daily accusations and name calling, extreme fights, checking me on gps, if he comes to pick me up at work and sees a male employee or doctor in my office im sleeping with them. when we are at the childrens sports games, i will be talking to some of the other moms and he swears im talking to the male coaches. he tells me daily that i dont love him and im torturing him. he has had a second hospital visit for threatening to kill himself in august but was released in a few hours. he swears he sees picture messages on the cell phone account that i have sent to other men but when i tell him to show me they arent there and he swears i erased them. he accuses me of leaving work for lunch daily and having an affair at a park. i was counseled this week by my director of nursing that i have 2 weeks to fix this or i will be terminated. he texts and calls multiple times a day when hes in one of his moods and if i am with patients or in a meeting or meeting with families and dont answer or eespond, its proof that i am having this alleged affair. i rush out of work every day after 8 hours on the dot just so he doesnt accuse me. he drives me to work daily and picks me up, but swears i leave. dont get me wrong, there are still days at a time where everything is great and he is like his old self again, but more frequently its pure torture for me and my kids. he swears he doesnt have a problem and doesnt need any psychiatric help that its all me. he swears this is the same reaction any man would have when his wife is cheating, constantly begs me to just tell him ""the truth"". now he has convinced himself that the reason i am in trouble at work is not because of him but because i have missed so much time having my affair. my cell phone was stole from my office last week and he is convinced that i either gave it to my boyfriend or sold it and gave the money to my boyfriend. i am at my wits end. i dont know what else to do. he desperately needs help and me and our children cant go through this anymore. i have offered to take a polygraph, but will this even help? part of me thinks that when i take it and pass he will see that i have been telling the truth but part of me knows that it wont make a difference.",2139,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"husband with delusional jealousy almost 7 years later and it still no better. we have attempted marriage counseling, but he didn't like the marriage counselor. honestly the council wasn't doing much to help us just kind of sitting there and listening to us argue. i have continued to be faithful i have continued to be a good wife. he just seems to get worse and worse. he twists his memories of things that happened years ago to feed into this delusion. i have been accused of everyone and anyone that is a male that we have been around accept both of our fathers and my brother. i have been accused of my teenage son's friends and my stepson's friends that i have known since they were little children. if a wrong number calls my cell phone, it is very obviously my boyfriend calling meand a signal for me to get in touch with him. if i do anything to make myself feel better about myself like dye my hair get my nails done, try to lose weight, or buy new clothes, i'm doing it to make myself more sexually attractive to other men. he can't seem to fathom that after 18 years of being cheated on i have no self esteem left. we are currently separated and he has been living in his father's basement for over a year now. we still talking everyday and see each other frequently, he comes home for a couple days and stays here quite often. it's still like a goddam roller coaster. there will be a couple of really really good days where he super attentive, super affectionate, and can't stop telling me how much he loves me and how he knows that i would never cheat on him. then those couple days are over and there will go days to weeks of daily accusations of ridiculous things. i have been accused of manipulating facebook, getting on his facebook to talk to his friends behind his back.i can no longer get on his facebook to check up on him and make sure hes not talking to other women because if i do he swears i'm doing it to talk to his friends. he is recently told me that i have attempted and succeeded in seducing all of his friends and that he is now a laughing stock and a joke amongst his friends from the day we met 18 years ago his brother and stepbrother who i never talk to both if he is sleeping at his father's house and i am home alone in bed sleeping, i must actually not be sleeping. in his mind he has become convincedthat i am sneaking his friend in after his friend's wife goes to work. his proof is that he doesn't hear from me after 10:30 at night. this friend of his also happens to be the birth father of his brother's stepson, our nephew. he hasn't seen this friend often through the years but a couple of years ago they did get back in contact and this friend shot on our pool league team for about 6 months. this friend of his is a recovering heroin addict and has had many remissions. this friend of his also at one time was rumored to have been trading homosexual favors for drugs and/or drug money. it is beyond me why he would think that i would ever want a man like that period. on the rare occasion that this friend does get in touch with him he swears this friend always knows when he and i are having problems and is convinced that it's because i'm telling this friend. so he has decided that he is put 2 and 2 together and come up with 5 and because this friend's wife works night shift apparently, i don't know because i never talk to these people, i must be screwing this guy at night i have been utterly and completely faithful to this man for over 18 years. i love this man with everything in me, i would never even think about cheating on him.i am someone who is always even as a small child try to do the right thing. my mother says i was born with a desire to follow the rules. i was raised in a christian church with strong morals. and i live by there is morals. just the idea of being intimate with another man in any other way is appalling to me. i feel like i'm constantly walking on eggshells. i never know when or where the next accusation is going to come from. whenever i'm on my phone or the internet i'm accused of secretly messaging someone. he accuses me of cheating with a neighbor. although he doesn't live here but is staying with his father, he has decided that i need to move into a newer and better house. i am not ready to move right now. yes i got a large raise last year when i got a promotion at work but i have been renting this house for 8 years. it is 2 blocks from my parents and my landlord is very lenient with late rent payments. he has never once filed a late rent notice when my rent is late. my credit score is currently very low and i need to do some credit repair so i can buy a house. he sees none of this as a reason for me not to move. in his mind i won't move right now because i don't wanna either be away from the next door neighbor that i'm screwing or his friend who apparently lives somewhere within a mile of me. i honestly don't know where his friend lives because i don't talk to this guy after so many years and so many accusations i don't know what to do. the more i deny that i have done any of these things the angrier he seems to get. he swears that i just refuse to admit to all the horrible things i've doneand that must mean that it's because i won't stop doing them. in his mind it can't possibly be that i want admit to things because i haven't done them. previously i was self assured, outgoing, friendly and usually a genuinely happy person. all of this has caused me to be anxious, depressed, and even sometimes contemplating suicide. my nerves are constantly on edge because i never know what's going to come next. my life is spent walking on eggshells i have panic attacks. i am barrage and verbal i attacked with accusations on a regular basis. i know that this is verbal and emotional abuse. i know that his thought process is it logical and that this is delusions, but i still keep thinking that at some point he will realize how wrong he is. i know it's stupid to think that 1 day he'll magically wake up and realize hes wrong, but i can't help it. if i get angry and argue when i'm being accused, if i raise my voice to him that proof positive that i'm guilty. if i refuse to argue to him that's proof positive that i'm guilty. it's a no win situation about a year ago i finally decided that i would take a lie detector test to prove to him once and for all that i've never cheated on him. i looked online and found a local one that was relatively cheap at $400. i contacted this woman, scheduled and paid for the test myself and went and took the test with him. unfortunately, i fail to do any research on what a lie detector test really does. had i done any research i would have never done it. i went into the lie detector test thinking that this magic box would off automatically prove to my husband once and for all that i was telling him the truth. little did i know that all the machine does is register your fight or flight response during questioning. this is the reason they don't do lie detector tests when rape or abuse victims. i went into the test confident that this was gonna be the solution to all our problems. the polygraph examiner called me 3 days later to give me the test results.to my shock and surprise she inform me that not only had i failed but that i had failed miserably and that i was a horrible liar.i couldn't understand how this could possibly have happened. i was telling the truth the whole time. after much research and consulting an expert experienced polygraph examiner i discovered that an experience polygraph examiner would have never done the test on me because of the verbal and emotional abuse that is occurred over this issue. obviously my husband refuses to believe this. i'm really and truly at a loss. i don't know what to do. i really do love this man. i really have never cheated on him. i want my husband back. i want me back. i want everything to be normal. i just don't understand how he can't see how good we could be together if you would just stop these accusations.when hes not angry at me and accusing me of things other people are actually jealous of the affection and love they can see between us. i just want this all fixed. i feel hopeless and i feel helpless.",2141,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"husband with delusional jealousy it is absolutely hell living like this. he gas twisted so many things. strangely enough, there is a coworker of his i have never even met or talked to that he has accused me of cheating with for a couple of years now. the strange part is this man sent me a friend request on fb today. as i clearly gave nothing to hide, i notified my husband right away. why? because i told him i would always be truthful and not hide things from him. and i anticipated that my husband, ny protector would stand up for me and also see that im not hiding things from him. well instead, he blamed me. he saw the friend request as proof positive that im having an affair with this man. so instead of getting amgry and feeling betrayed towards his coworker, he decided it was an elaborate ruse set up by me and his coworker to cover up the fact that our fb accounts were connected (not even sure what he means by that). so i instead sent the asshole a message calling him out for randomly sending a friend request to his coworkers wife. he respinded thst he hadnt so then i sent him a picture of the request and again basically told him off. of course in my husband's eyes, that was wrong as well. i honestly dont know how or why this person sent me a friend request as my husband actually has me blicked from his fb. again, my husband sees that as even more proof. theres so many examples i see on other threads of these bizarre paranoid behaviors that my husband exhinits... call or text from the wrong number? its obviously my lover. neighbor mzkes noice next door, the husband is signaling me. i get my nails done, cut my hair, buy new clothes....im obviously trying to either look goid for my boyfriend or its just that i have the insatiable desire to have attention from all men. if i have a sniffle, i now have a cocaine problem too. if i shave my legs...going to see the boyfriend. didnt really go to the grocery store....went to see my boyfriend got my promotion last year because....you guessed...sleeping with my boss car slows down anywhere near our house... my boyfriend is checking up on me or stopping by. i am a sex addict and i need some help. i am so cold and uncaring, why do i torture him so? my 19 year old twins know all about my whoring ways and give him funny looks because they really want to tell him. my sons teenage friends....sleeping with me. apparently i have successfully seduced 100% of his friends and relatives, and none of them will tell him because they are all afraid of him. that success rate is better than a playboy model so i guess i should be flattered. i use my paycheck to pay bills for men i sleep with. i post ads on craigslist looking for carsex. i bought a locking bracelet and gave him the key, he swears o either bought two or my boyfriend has the real key. if i check his facebook or phone, im not checking up on him, im talking to his friends if i check his location on gps, its to make sure he isnt sneaking up on me and my boyfriend. the list goes on and on.",2144,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"my friend is always blaming me when something goes wrong hi soconfused. i'm sorry you didn't receive a timely reply. this forum is not as active as it used to be. currently, the conventional advice for this type of situation is: do not ""confess"" to something you didn't do. don't reinforce the delusion. an obsession with the enemy's ""confession"" is a common theme in some of the stories in this forum. a lot of times, the victim tells the enemy: ""i'll forgive the affair/lies/stealing/cheating/whatever if you'll just tell the truth"". it's tempting to say what they want to hear, in hopes that they will stop talking about it obsessively and compulsively. but it's not likely to work; i think it would just lead to new, bigger, worse accusations. do not deny the accusation. even if you're telling the truth, denying the accusation will only make the accuser hold onto the accusation even tighter. even if you have a perfect alibi or undeniable logic that clearly reveals the truth, it's as if the victim's brain will create new pathways to hide the truth from him or her. the accusation/delusion might morph a little bit at this point, but the disease will still likely identify you to the victim as the ""enemy"". change the topic. this tactic works for family and friends who aren't the ""enemy""; i'm not sure if it will work for the person whom the victim's brain has marked as ""the enemy"". i know it sounds ridiculous, but it works. a relative of mine can talk for hours about all the things her husband has allegedly done to try to ruin her life. a simple question such as ""oh, look at your garden! what kind of flower is that yellow one?"" can change the topic--and her mood--completely. do you know any of this person's family? i would talk to a parent or sibling and explain to them what's going on. maybe this has happened in the past, and they'll recognize a pattern. or...they might believe the victim. if so, this is likely to happen again in the future. even it you break off all contact with him, the victim's brain will eventually identify a new ""enemy"". next time, it might be one of his family members. so if you talk to them, even if they don't believe you now, you've given them the info to recognize a pattern later. i think you have to end the friendship. but let him know that you'll be there for him if you need him in the future. i'm thinking something like: you keep accusing me of things i didn't do. it hurts me that you think i would do those things. i think that we both need time away from each other. i won't call/text/email/visit anymore. i truly wish you the best.",2148,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"newly engage - he has delusion jealousy. hi ladywytch, are you saying that you aren't living with him yet? if that's the case, then when you move in with him, it's going to get 1000 times worse. don't think because he sees your honest behavior 24/7 that the suspicions will suddenly go away. living together will just give the disease more fodder to pick apart. i'm wondering if his ex even cheated on him at all. he's giving you ""the treatment"" because of something you didn't do. he's trying to control your behavior. no, he can't help being suspicious. but, yes, he can control his reaction. he's punishing you for something you didn't do. to give someone ""the treatment"" is still emotional abuse. would you marry a guy who slaps you around? probably not? so why would you marry a guy who's emotionally abusive? do not set a date until you completed a year of counseling together as an engaged couple. you mentioned that it is ""difficult to schedule"" appointments. well, if the relationship means enough to him, then he will find a way to make the damned appointments. this is not a good foundation for a solid marriage. think with your head now and not with your heart (or limerence hormones). all the signs are right there. if you ""won't leave him"", then at least don't live with him.",2155,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"am i delusional?? i just spoke with my eldest daughter on the phone. she is a nurse that works on the psych-med-surg ward at a top hospital. she plans on becoming a psychiatric nurse practioner. i told her that i was speaking with a lawyer about what happened to me during a recent er visit. this is unlike me, but it bothered me so i had to speak with a lawyer. i had a night where i got drunk. my husband thought my heart had stopped and he called an ambulance. i sobered up in an er ward. still being under the influence, i was very nasty to the nurse. i said some awful things to her. i knew i hurt her terribly. (this is also unlike me) i wasn’t physically aggressive. i didn’t try to hurt anyone or myself. i wasn’t wandering around, stumbling. i did ask to go to the bathroom quite a bit. they had to get someone to escort me. i would wait until someone was there that could help me. otherwise, i waited in my bed. and eventually i sobered up enough to keep control of my nasty mouth. i did find out the ‘nurse’ wasn’t a nurse at all. i could tell she was angry with me, probably tired and hurt by the things i had said. after awhile, they came in my room and made me get into an enclosure bed. basically it looked like a baby playpen with mesh sides and top. i couldn’t even stretch out in it. it was awful and i wanted to get out of the thing. it was all i could think about. i finally found a zipper beneath the floor of this playpen. i forced my finger through it and unzipped it and slithered out of the playpen. i got back into my normal bed and waited. when the ‘nurse’ came back into the room, she was surprised and nastily called me an escape artist. she didn’t try to restrain me after that. eventually i was released and went home. i told my daughter all about this. she said she didn’t understand why this would be so traumatic to me. with my history, i would think she would understand, but she didn’t. she just couldn’t understand. and i don’t understand that...except that she is young and can’t fully comprehend what has happened in my life. it’s been a year since all this happened. a lot has happened. i’ve been on a crusade to get off all unnecessary meds, especially the opiates (for cancer) and benzos (for gad & ptsd). then the memory of this came to me and i decided to speak to a lawyer about it. i mentioned it to my daughter tonight. she told me that she is scared for me because of this. she said she thinks i’m delusional. now i’m beginning to question myself. maybe i am delusional. but i think to myself,’i seem to be getting better. i’m not depressed. i’m getting out more. i’m more and more active. sure, it’s taking some time but i’m doing it.’ so how am i delusional? part of me thinks that for most of my life (i’m 55 right now) i’ve had several traumatic events, and i’ve never done anything about it. now i feel that i have to speak up. to say hey, something wrong happened here. it’s not the money. it’s the principle of it. but now my daughter has me doubting myself. am i being delusional? if i am, then i need to watch myself. if i’m not, why does my daughter think this? no matter what, what do i do under either circumstance? i am at a loss. i don’t know what to think. so i’d appreciate any feedback from others. ideally i should be able to figure this out by myself, but obviously i’m ill equipped for that. at least for the moment. so what do you think about this situation. am i delusional? is there something wrong with the way i’m thinking? wither",2157,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"am i delusional?? i am not sure i understand what you mean about being delusional or not. do you mean maybe you never went to the hospital and none of this happened? or maybe it wasn't so terrible? i don't think we can answer that for you. but it is clear that you are struggling with this. i think maybe more important than contacting a lawyer (at least as a first step) would be to try to work through the trauma of the situation or to get a mental health assessment of some sort. maybe you are traumatized or maybe you are delusional, but medical help could best solve either of those problems. when you are focused on one traumatic event that sticks with you for a long time, then maybe it is necessary to get outside help in order to heal. sometimes a little help can make everything become clearer. try not to let an event from your past ruin your present either. i know it's upsetting but don't forget to enjoy the things you can in life even if it is something small like your favorite tv series, a cup of tea, a walk in the park, etc. i understand you have to set aside some time to deal with difficult things, but it seems like you are not in the specific situation anymore and you have your daughter to provide a fresh perspective so that's a good thing. how are you doing now?",2158,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"help needed hello, i got married to this lovely girl last year in february. we dated for a year before walking up the altar. there were some issues that i just chose to look over and initially even believed 1) she said a group from new zealand ( where she had been a student from 2003..did not manage to complete despite changing 3 colleges as everywhere people were ‘ out to get her ‘) was hacking her phone and listening to everything we spoke on phone and were watching her change and stuff 2) everywhere she went she drew in new people like her workplace acquaintances into the whirlpool saying that they too were plotting against her 3) once she came home and fought with me saying she saw me talking to a girl at her workplace whom she believed was a part of the plot. i never spoke to her nor was i a part of any ‘plot’ 4) just out of the blue she would fight with me saying i called her a bitch. of course i did not do that. i rubbed it off saying that she’d probably misheard me. she calmed down but the resentment was there nonetheless we got married, the accusations got wilder.... 1) jesus came in my dreams and told me you are hiding something and trying to break the marriage 2) she accused me of wanting to indulge in wife swapping with a couple who are good friends 3) she would accuse me of saying weird and random things 4) once she drove the car so rash after accusing me of saying some weird thing that i thought she’d kill me 5) final straw was after 18 months of marriage she accused me of calling her a c**t and a s**t out of the blue. 6) generally she is a very sweet and a calm personality and goes to church at all times but when this hits her, she starts screaming and becomes evil eyed. there is nothing i can do to argue with her beliefs 7) she felt someone was laughing at her on the phone line. i got her phone checked up but nothing was found she left the house and her parents think i’ve hurt their daughter, when i suggested a psychiatrist visit all hell broke loose. my wife though agreed to the visit with disgust, her diagnosis came out perfectly okay even though she made some bizarre statements like .. 1)he walks behind me and spies on me. 2) he goes out in the middle of the night to drink tea 3)he laughs at me together with friends and security her parents lied to the doctor saying that i had apologised to them for my behaviour to her the doctors said she is well behaved and well dressed and did not show any symptoms of a disorder when they kept her under observation for 7 days so now, her paranoia against me is grown more .. she has blocked me off all telephonic ways of contact. which she refuses to accept.she stays in the us now where she is studying. i am funding her education and paying off her loan, she has got no regard for that. just for your information she has accused several people in the past who were her friends of wrongdoing. all of them left. she accused them of the same plotting thing. to her, the beliefs are real and no amount of proof or convincing can help some people don’t even know what my wife thinks of them. to everyone she is a pretty young girl with a perfect life. i love her and want her to get better. but her super overprotective parents and she are the biggest roadblocks. i’ve tried convincing them as well but got bombed. she says i have been an indecent husband and that i have spoilt her life and that she does not have any trust nor faith in me.. i don’t know how to deal with this ... this is sapping me of my life.. is there anyone who could give any suggestions ? thanks for reading this long post... last edited by snaga on fri may 03, 2019 2:06 pm, edited 1 time in total. reason: please try to avoid all caps in thread titles, thanks",2159,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"my husbands delusions make me the bad guy and i need advice hi there. so i’m recently married and i believe my husband is suffering from a form of delusional personality disorder. he’s yet to be officially diagnosed but the signs are there and he is going to see a doctor. i never even thought this was a thing and i always assumed his trust issues with me would eventually go away. but they haven’t. i should’ve seen the signs. i mean, i did, but i never thought it would get this serious. long story short, my husband is convinced numerous friends of his are trying to inform him that i have a shady past or there are things i have done that i don’t want him to know about. this is 100% not true. i’ve lived a life i’m pretty proud of and there’s absolutely nothing i’ve ever done that i wouldn’t want him knowing. these friends of his though, have never actually said to him “hey man, listen, [insert my name here] has done some shady $#%^ and as your friend i am going to tell you these things”. it’s always his friend speaking in “code” trying to tell him something. just the other night his friend mentioned turning a new hvac system that was just installed in to a tin man costume for halloween. my husband literally just started a hvac career so the comment wasnt completely off the wall. i obviously laughed at the comment by my husband took it as his friend trying to tell him i had been talking to some musician whose stage name happens to be the tin man. he was convinced of this. a bunch of other instances like this have occurred and the advice i need is how am i supposed to cope with this? i’ve read so many articles that tell me how to talk to him but how am i supposed to emotionally handle this?? i am the target of his delusions and it makes me so mad and so angry and sad and i get so mad at him for accusing me. i feel just disrespected. but everything i’ve read tells me i need to basically relax. but how can i? i’m so mad at him i don’t even want to see him right now. i’m so proud he’s actually opening up to this possibility that this $#%^ may be made up in his head and that he is going to get medica help but in the meantime i just want to crawl under a rock. does anyone have any advice? thanks.",2160,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

desperately need advice about husband with ddj hello i am at my wits end with my partner and can totally relate to this post. i just don’t know where to turn and have been putting up with his erratic behaviour and accusations for two years. he also says that if i admit to the affair that we can move on and he will forgive me. i have walked away so many times but then feel sorry for him as i think he’s unwell and i’m not being fair on him. i am also being accused if committing fraud and have been recruited by ‘people’ to do so. he is verbally aggressive and then turns up wanting to be loving which i just can’t do. there is no swaying from his beliefs and the more i defend myself the more i am guilty in his eyes. we have been together for ten years and prior to this he was lovely. i haven’t felt safe at times. he has recently told me that he’s met someone else as he can’t trust me. he says he loves me but he doesn’t believe anything i say - he tells me that i’m lying when i tell him that i love him and miss him. i think that if i just let him go and be with this new woman and stop responding to his emails that his delusional paranoia will go away as he perhaps won’t do this with someone new meaning that he will suddenly get better overnight. is this the way to help him get better or wound he just continue with someone else? he has lost his job because of erratic behaviour at work (he thought he was being followed and was going to be blamed for the company’s it systems worldwide being hacked - they eventually paid him off to leave). when he’s around other people he can appear perfectly ok.,2184,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"need help with dd wife. what happens to the kids? i am new here, i read many posts in this forum, and found a ton of useful information. my wife of 18 years is delusional, and our story is no different to many i read here. it has been 3 years since the first episode, when she was sure there were cameras at home looking at everything she did, and i was with our neighbors watching her (this happened after watching the truman show...) everyone in the streets mock her and talked about her. these things went on during all this time, she never accepted that she is ill, no matter how much evidence i show her. about a year ago, she started focusing her delusions on me. she accuses me of lying pretty much every time i open my mouth, the members of my whole family are pathological liars. i mock her and copy all her gestures to the point that she starts crying when she is with me. i hide things to make her crazy, and i conspire with other people to steal from her. she also thinks that i have another woman, and sometimes that i have a male lover as well. i could go on and on, but i don't want to make this too long. seeing that she is not willing to get help, i am thinking of divorce before i start getting sick. reading the posts here, i didn't find any case in which the ill spouse gets good treatment, takes his/her medicine, and the marriage goes on without interruption and live together happily for a long time. it seems that divorce is the only way out. at this point i am totally convinced that our marriage is over. what i don't read much is about what is the effect of this problem on the kids. we have 14 and 16 year old boys. their mother has been good to them, and although they are aware of her problems, and many times they witness her treatment to me, they are not too upset. whenever she talks unreasonable things to them, they just laugh it out or ignore her, and she doesn't seem to mind. my main worry is that, once we divorce and i am out of the picture, would she start focusing her delusions on them? has anyone experienced that situation. i am very worried about something like it happening. at the end of the day the most important is the well being of the kids. i'll appreciate any comment, suggestion or ideas about this. thanks for reading",2186,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"does my wife have ddj our marriage has had good years and bad years, but over the last 29 years the good has certainly outweighed the bad. things were going great, we were eagerly making plans for retirement in the future, until recently when things have rapidly turned dark when the endless accusations began. the first major accusation was that i was having an affair with the girl that cut my hair. then the laser beam focus shifted to my work. she began to incessantly drill me about who i had lunch with in the cafeteria, etc. then i was accused of having an afffair with one of my female co-workers, and then another. she then started checking my home email, computer usage, text messages, and cell phone calls... demanding that i identify each number and the conversations that took place from 3 months prior. the accusations continued to grow. she ""knew"" i was getting up in the middle of the night and spending hours on the computer. her health began to fail, she now needed ambien to sleep and doctors prescribed anxiety and blood pressure medications. because of her health, she asked if i was trying to poision her. she asked if i was secretly taking pictures of her, and asked if i had video tape equipment hidden in our bedroom. my beloved wife then began hiding tape recorders in my home office and car in hopes of ""catching me in the act"". the clincher came when i received what i thought were a couple of innocuous wrong number texts. one was about the individual going out to eat after church and the other was pertaining to someone's family reunion. i texted back they had the wrong number. my wife didn't think they were so innocent. unbeknownst to me, she hired a private investigator. together they tracked down who had the phone number and did research, background checks, etc. apparently this individual was a known homosexual. so now the accusations came flying that i was having a homosexual relationship. that is when she moved out and filed for divorce. after 29 years i am left devasted, hurt beyond words, and left searching for answers. the woman i knew for all of those years bears no resembalance to the woman who she is now. could this be ddj, or some type of side-affect from the medications? or could this be a sign of some other underlying mental health issue?",2189,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"does my wife have ddj hi sandollar. i've been lurking on this board for over a year. but your post is the one that brought me into the light. if it makes you feel a little better, i will tell you that i've experienced almost exactly everything you have experienced. i would regularly read other posts and nothing quite matched my situation. but your situation matched mine almost verbatim. it started 4 years ago with accusations that my personality had changed. that maybe i was having a mid life crisis. it then changed to me having an affair with someone. then she figured out who the affair was with so i was then having an affair with a specific person. she made up stories about seeing this woman with us in restaurants when we went out. but never did she see us together. i worked with this woman at a previous job but had very little to do with her. then 2 years ago, i think she had nervous breakdown. her story changed to me surveilling her in our home with recording devices and cameras. this is so i could keep tabs on her thus allowing me to do all sorts of nefarious activities such as operating a porn site, having an affair, maybe even doing drugs. she claims that i took pictures of her and our daughter at night and posted them on the internet. but no pictures have ever been produced (because they don't exist). i was then accused of getting up at night to do all sorts of things. funny thing is, i sleep very soundly and rarely wake up at all. i've been accused of giving cues in restaurants to people that are watching us. i've been accused of tricking her sister into taking my side in all this. i've been accused of gaslighting her (trying to make her think she is crazy) so that i can have her locked up and then taking our family assets for myself. so i've been living with this now for 4 years. i'm about at the end of my rope. i asked her why she still lives with someone that would do all these things to her. she says that she is keeping her commitment to god and our family. death do us part. needless to say, we both have a strong faith. i'm willing to work with her and help her but i cannot take the continued scrutiny and accusations that come out of the blue. i've tried to lay down boundaries but they do no good. she's just not dealing with reality. so she uses her ""faith"" to give her the right to abuse me at every turn by staying in our marriage and keeping her commitment to god. after reading all the posts on this site, i've pretty much given up hope for her to ever get better. i can't get her into counseling because that's part of my ""plan"". so i'm just trying to get along as best i can. there's much more to this story but that's enough for now. good luck!!",2191,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"help with ddj wife i just wanted to chime in about causality. i don't think anything that anyone does or says causes delusion disorder. i think it's just a brain gone wrong. i'm not an expert, but i've read many accounts of people who have loved ones with this disorder and their backgrounds and life situations are all varied. with my mom, she will tell everyone that her ex-husband abused her, and she's very believable until she starts to mention the part about him scratching her cooking pots, or sanding the picture frame. but all the stories have changed a lot over the past 9 years that we've known she's had delusions. they divorced over 6 years ago, after he lived with constant accusations for 3+ years. we were worried about his stress. she accused him of multiple affairs, of stealing her things, etc. now she thinks he is still entering her apartment to damage her things. believe me, he did not abuse her, he did not steal or damage her things. they were together 30 years before she got delusions. their relationship wasn't perfect, but it was nothing anyone did that resulted in her having delusions. i am relieved they are no longer together because of the terrible stress for him. i wish so much their being apart could have also relieved her stress that her brain is causing herself, but that can't be helped. she refuses all the delusion diagnoses she's received, from multiple doctors. over the years, not only do her details of the delusions change but the types of delusions change, too. in the past year, she has acquired the type where she thinks she has tiny bugs on herself, like fleas or mites. i just don't want loved ones to think they could or should have done something different, or blame themselves. i've tried so hard to ease my mom's mind, but nothing works and i've learned to let it go and distance myself. it's very sad because in some ways, she is still 'there' and there are times when she seems fine. it's a tragic illness.",2201,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
help with ddj wife i feel the horror. i am so sorry. i too have been accused of a lot. the worst things are the sexual deviant things. i finally moved out. i hate what i say sometimes but they make you insane. only if somebody has walked in your shoes and experienced what it’s like to be called a rapist a pedophile a demon gods mistake queer cheater. it’s embarassing and humiliating especially when it’s done in front ont of people/ strangers. they don’t know that ur wife has dd. they know that you were called a rapist by a lady who looks like your wife. you can’t say oh she’s nuts and it go away. i understand. it’s awful. they tell everybody like an evil kid. i think when all is said and done this is one of the most horrible psychiatric illnesses and causes the most collateral damage to luv ones. good luck.,2202,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"help with ddj wife i so relate to your statement 'by a lady who looks like your wife'. when my mom was still married, and then going through a divorce, i let both attorneys know that there was no abuse, no affairs, etc. i've also phoned her doctors without her knowing, just so they can understand her illness. and thankfully, the police and medical professionals that she's reporting her ex-husband to have all been able to fairly quickly see that she has delusions, and no one has actually investigated or questioned her now-ex-husband. she thinks i'm close-minded and can't see the 'truth' and she tells me that the police know what she says is true, and that her friends believe her. i've so far successfully not revealed to her that the police have phoned me to discuss her delusions. sometimes i feel like i have to follow her all around town and tell everyone she's talked to that all her stories never happened. i just hate that she's saying terrible things about her ex-husband, because she still thinks he comes in and hacks her computer, poisons her, etc. so awful.",2203,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"should i be afraid of my roommate? this is my first post here. i’m not even sure if this is the right forum, but i meed some advice. sorry in advance, this will be a bit long. i’m an american student studying in china. i live on campus with a roommate, another american, who is also in most of the same classes as me. from the beginning (2 months ago) she was very quiet and somewhat lethargic, but neither of these things bothered me and we’ve had a pretty peaceful cohabitation so far. in the past week, things have changed drastically. i noticed she began doing little inexplicable things; keeping the window shut constantly, tossing my things onto my side of the room if i accidentally left them laying around. then, 2 days ago as i was preparing to head out for class, she asked me suddenly if i had a “problem” with her. i confusedly said no, and when i asked her why she thought that, she responded that she kept “hearing my name everywhere”. this made as little sense in context as it does here, but she somewhat coldly dropped the subject when i assured her i had nothing against her. when i returned from class, she briefly stepped out almost immediately; when she returned, her mood had gone from her usual stoic silence to genuine anger. she accused me of insulting her on very petty points (her weight, skin color, etc) to other students around campus, and further stated that my comments, and comparisons between her and myself, were now being widely discussed. i obviously denied everything and, thinking there was some misunderstanding, asked her who had been saying these things. this is where things became odd: despite my asking multiple times, she would not name names, or even describe the people supposedly badmouthing her, but kept insisting that “everyone” was talking about her. she said she had been hearing my name “40 times a day” over the past few days, and that she had also heard my voice yelling “i hate her” repeatedly outside, while gesturing towards the sole window in our dorm room. at this point i remembered her sudden habit of keeping the window closed at all times; the window looks out over a large courtyard, one can only hear what people outside are saying if they’re shouting. i eventually got her to specify that she overheard our classmate outside, saying “she ought to tell her” in chinese, to a male voice who replied “she won’t/didn’t tell her”. i don’t know how this dialouge was supposed to relate to the issue at hand. please note that the accused classmate is extremely uncomfortable speaking chinese in any context, let alone gossiping loudly outdoors. still thinking that there was some misunderstanding, i became upset and teary. besides denying any wrongdoing i asked her to tell me immediately the next time she heard any such comments, so that i could confront the people in question. by this time i was suspicious that these things could not be happening in reality, but i didn’t try to argue with her on that point. she calmed down, though i’m not sure what exactly made her suddenly passive. when i asked if anything else had made her think i hated her, she made vague comments about how we needed to mutually help keep our room clean, and pointed out that i often left the toilet cover down, as though doing so was a clear sign of ill will towards her. when she eventually apologized if she had falsely accused me, she offered me some tea in an abruptly cheerful way. for the rest of that day she was her usual (stoic, untalkative) self. the next day at 6 am, when i hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet, she repeated the same charges against me, only this time with certainty that was genuinely disturbing. she claimed to be hearing my name constantly, and at that moment gestured to the men outside chatting in what might have been urdu, saying incredulously “you don’t hear it?” she refused to hear anything i had to say and produced a list of other dorm rooms that had vacancies, which i now realize she must have gotten the day she first confronted me, saying that if i had a problem with her then i should move out. when it became clear we were at an impasse i silently prepared to head out for the day, while she sat on her bed staring into space for what must have been 15 minutes. since that discussion, which was yesterday morning, i have been avoiding her entirely; i went by the room briefly to get items i absolutely needed, with classmates watching over me, and am now sleeping on the floor of someone else’s room. i obviously can’t know exactly what she’s experiencing, but the thigs she’s saying have led me to believe she’s hearing things that are not really there, at the very least, and that it’s not safe for me to be around her. today is sunday; tomorrow morning, i plan to go to the dorm manager’s office as soon as it opens, and ask for a new dorm assignment far away from her. so here is my question (finally): besides moving out of the room, is there anything else i can do to improve this situation? we have the same curriculum, so i will still have to see her in class (although her attendance is very poor), and the thought of that fills me with dread. on the other hand, she has never threatened me in any way, and the chinese government is extremely unsympathetic towards the mentally ill (to the point that she could be deported or even imprisoned if evidence of her illness was sufficient) so i’m hesitant to report her delusions to anyone. she probably needs help but we are in a country that is notoriously poor at providing it. another problem is the language barrier; my chinese is decent, but i am not at all fluent enough to descibe this situation accurately to anyone beyond “i don’t feel safe around my roommate, i must move as soon as possible”. i don’t have any way to contact her family or friends. i don’t know what else to do. any advice would be appreciated.",2204,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"should i be afraid of my roommate? just move out. probably she is not fit to share a room with anyone. chances are good her voices will change focus. sadly the only helpful message would be „it is just your voices, this happens inside your head only“ (i have to tell my co-workers frequently) but i am afraid she has no insight in her illness, so this would not work. all the other problems are beyond your responsibility. seem you can do nothing but leave and let things happen according to chinese standards... sorry",2205,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"feeling depressed with ddj wife me (32m) and my wife (30f) will be married for 2 years come this friday and i am feeling miserable thinking of the options i have in front of me. i did not know that a di sease such as delusional disorder jealous type even existed till i first found this forum when googling desperately about what could be causing my wife to be so paranoid about me.and i think maybe she is suffering from it. she thinks 1. i have cameras set up around the house to spy on her and do what i need to do. she has removed smoke alarms and co sensors in our bedroom since she feels there is a camera in it that i have planted. i have asked her to have it checked by someone if she wants but no go. 2. i write on her with my finger the initials of the person i am supposedly cheating her with when i hug her while sleeping. 3. she is suffering from an as of yet undiagnosed condition which causes her severe uncontrollable itching in the genital and anal regions. she thinks this is because of stds i have passed on to her. i have taken std tests 3 times in the last two years and still she doesn't believe the results. 4. she checks my pockets, my underwear, and everywhere to find the ""device i have hidden"". when she doesn't find anything she says maybe i have it implanted in me and use it to communicate with another woman when in the restroom. 5. i have given her my phone and she has set the passcode for it. i only use it when i get calls or when i call my family in front of her. and still she feels somehow i have hacked it to be able to communicate with others. she has accused me of hacking her phone, her mom's phone and everything possible. 6. she finds her own hair in our car, wrappers she put sometime back, her hair clips and she says they belong to some other girl. 7. she keeps hearing imaginary conversations i have with supposedly other women discussing how i am going to get out of this marriage. i have taken to recording my laptop screen (with audio) when i am working and even when i show her the recording which clearly has no conversations she says the video is rubbish and is manipulated. 8. she used to say she can smell perfume on my shirt after coming back from work. (i do not use any perfume at all). 8. she has accused me of flirting and showing interests in all sorts of women. women who were old enough to be my mother and my own cousin. 9. she bought a bunch of spy cams and tried to keep them all around the home but i found out since i saw the email confirming her order. she used them only once and has not used it since. 10. if she is ever out traveling alone or visiting her family she will video call me up at the middle of the night and ask me to walk around the home to show that there was no woman in our home. she has now gone to her grandfather's funeral and has set up some security cameras all over the house. but still she accuses me of turning them off whenever i want to. 11. i work from home nowadays because i find it hard to take the accusations that accompany me actually going to my office and even then she accuses me of communication with some woman through some means. does this sound like ddj? all these accusation have taken their toll on me. i get very agitated and start yelling when she makes these accusations or as she says it asks me questions. we have had very bad fights. we have gone to couple's marriage counseling and they don't really help as it mostly ends up in her accusing me and me defending and the resentment over the accusations. i always used to wonder why she is so desperately making up stuff to make me seem a bad person. it even seemed like she would actually like me to be the bad person just so that her thoughts of me are proved to be right. when i ask her she says no, she only want to ""correct"" me and get me back on the ""good"" path. i find that line very very insulting as i have not been unfaithful at all and i have done everything possible to help her trust me but she just ignores all my efforts and says i just find loopholes and cheat her and am controlled by the person i cheat her with. i want to reiterate i have never even been unfaithful and my wife is actually my one and only relationship ever. reading up on this disorder makes me think she is most probably suffering from it. i have called her paranoid and imagining thing during our fights and she says i am gaslighting her and that she is totally normal. i am not able to live in such a marriage anymore and i am going to give her an ultimatum of going for therapy and stop accusing me here onwards or i am going to go for a divorce. the saddest thing here is i actually love her and she loves me too. when she is not having one of these suspicions she is so loving to me it breaks my heart even thinking of leaving her. i am just breaking down crying every few hours when i think of what i should do and all the happy moments we have had. i look at our photographs and it kills me to even think of giving up on our marriage. but she thinks of me as a cheater and a liar who is putting up an act for every other person in this world. i have been completely open with her. she knows the password to every account of mine. she has my phone 99% of the time. but still there is only distrust. i know i cannot continue in this marriage if i am going to be accused like this every now and then. this has affected me mentally. i have stopped socializing at work and have cut down on most friendships because of all the accusations. i know i cannot bring a child in to this world with her if we are going to be like this always. i am distraught and am depressed. any words will help. please help me through this horrible time. why did my wife have to get this horrid horrid disease. we both love each other and we are not able to live happily as we deserve to.",2206,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"feeling depressed with ddj wife i'm really sorry you're going through this with your wife. i can tell you that for us, it seems to get worse and professionals have told me that i need to maintain boundaries, because i can't help her, i can't solve her delusions, and i need to protect my well-being. in our case, my mom has been divorced from her husband for 6 years and her delusions about him keep changing and increasing. she has also developed another kind of delusion, in addition to the paranoia and jealousy kind. she now thinks she has little bugs on herself, she said it was fleas at first, then she said they went away, and now she thinks she has mites. she still spends money on a door alarm system to keep her now-ex-husband out, and calls police occasionally because of the break-ins. of course, there is no one coming in and stealing her stuff (and sometimes she says he returns and puts the item back), or hacking her computer, or causing her water pipes to make a noise... on and on. she recently told me she's hired a private investigator, and joined an domestic abuse support group. i only wonder how many weeks it will take for these people to realize that the stories she tells never happened. they'll probably start to question when she talks about her ex putting dust on her through holes in her ceiling. she has had doctors tell her she's got delusions, but she won't believe that, and then won't see those doctors. she was on an anti-psychotic medication for a couple weeks, but it didn't help. i've tried and tried to comfort her and calm her fear by letting her know there isn't anyone after her, but she gets angry and accuses me of being naive and stupid. when it started, she thought her husband was having multiple affairs, even with some of my acquaintances, and that he molested my son, and had her car tracked, was damaging her furniture, and on and on. we were so worried about his stress level dealing with the constant accusations. he loved her and endured for 3 years, and finally she pursued a divorce. he's not my dad, but we are still connected with him and make sure he's okay. he's still like a step-dad to me, and he's a wonderful man. we are so glad they are no longer together because of the stress on him. please don't feel guilty or blame yourself for needing to be away from the delusional person. sometimes it's necessary. this illness is truly horrible. i will always make sure my mom has a roof over her head, but i need to minimize contact, and minimize my family's contact with her. it's very sad, because in some ways she's still smart, funny, cute, but in other ways, my mom is gone.",2207,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

are co incidences a part of delusional disorder? i suspect my boyfriend has delusional disorder. the doctors havent confirmed it yet because he doesnt agree to go for treatment. but they are going in the direction of paranoid psychosis . which is just another name for dd as far as i know . there are a lot of co incidences happening that are confirming his delusions . his delusion is that i along with his friends are family are talking behind his back and giving him hints about it to mess with his head . none of us talk to each other. the co incidences usually go like this . we have a conversation and a few days later or sometimes later whenever he talks to his friends they say a word or something similar to what we have spoken about. sometimes he knows that he could be just over thinking but still doesnt fail to accuse me of lying to him. he also thinks god is talking to him and going out of his way to be a part for my boyfriends life . he also thinks that when he is high with consumption of weed he becomes more spiritually receptive . he asks god a question and the next word he sees or picture he looks at or something he hears is the answer . talking about the co incidences with friends. an example of it when he told about his chat with god . he gave me a reference of his friend gordon because it sounds like god . later when he met his friend and spoke to him about god and his chat that friend took gordons name. gordon is a mutual friend of both my bf and his friend. they talk about him quite frequently . now he thinks i told his friend all about what i spoke to my bf and he took gordons name to mess with his head . and many such incidences. i did not talk to any of his friends . im not friends with any of them . he keeps accusing me of talking to them . he also accused me of having an affair with them . i cant take all this anymore. these coincidences or his over consciousness because of his disorder are giving his thoughts more and more validity . how do i prove my innocence like this . i'm not even sure if what he says they said is actually what they said. what do i do ? they are making my life hell . did any of you face something like this ? or know some way you'll can help me ? how to convince him ? i'm trying to arrange a polygraph test but its very difficult to find one where i live . and i'm just 19 so i cant travel far away for it neither do i have the required amount. and i dont want to involve my parents . i need help to deal with this .,2216,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"are co incidences a part of delusional disorder? the short answer for me is yes. my wife also has a major problem with coincidences, but they don't result in her blaming me for something. it results in her thinking she has ""proof"" that the other people in this town and at her work are plotting against her. her delusion is that she thinks that these people wanted her to leave me for other single men that they know. and when she didn't leave me, they decided that to make their ""man friends"" feel better about themselves, they had to make her look really bad and break her down. so every coincidence that happens is proof to her that they are doing this to her. the problem for me is that they thought to fix her up with their friends because they found out that i was such an awful husband, and if i hadn't been so bad, they never would have thought to fix her up with their friends. so in the end, it's all my fault, but i'm not blamed directly for each of these coincidences. i was not a bad husband, not that i was perfect. so i end up apologizing for things from the past that i did not do. that seems to diffuse the situation, and prevent a nasty argument. i'm not sure what to tell you about your situation. he's specifically blaming you directly for these coincidences. i will tell you that simply saying ""i didn't do it"" probably will never work. i'm really grasping at straws for a suggestion, but how about this...... with this friend gordon, there are sort of 2 parts to it. 1-that his friend new about his chat with god and 2-that you were the one to tell him. is it possible to deflect this, sort of, and just say something like - ""i have no idea how your friend found out. i didn't tell him, but somebody must have. are you sure you didn't talk about this with anybody else? or did someone over hear something?"" you may have to defend yourself and prove that you couldn't have said anything. like maybe you've been so busy that you haven't even had time to call your mother etc. i guess what i'm getting at is i think you might have more luck arguing how the coincidence happened as opposed to trying to convince him that nothing really happened. i have had absolutely no success trying to convince my wife that these coincidences are nothing. absolutely no luck at all. so here's a recent example. she went for a 30 minute jog yesterday. while out jogging one of ""them"" passed by on a motorcycle. she was convinced that this was intentional and they knew she was going out for a jog and they are checking on her and plotting the next thing they're going to do to her. what i can't say is ""gosh i'm sure it's just a coinicidence. why would they be out checking on you?"". instead what i said was ""that's awful. don't they have better things to do with their time. what is their problem? what kind of nut-case does something like that?"" i'm not sure if that's helpful or not. i wish i had better advice to give.",2217,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
are co incidences a part of delusional disorder? thank you so much for giving me assurance its not only happening to us . i know its very sad of me to say this . but your'e in a better position than me i guess . you can stay next to the person you love and give her assurance that its going to be fine. i am the root cause of all his problems . i want to help him so bad . but i can't because i am the ultimate villan. i wish it was something else. i wish it didnt play with the trust between us. i'd do anything to make him feel better if it was us against the world . but now its him vs me. and that really sucks. i hate it. i hate god for doing this to us. i just got an internship somewhere. now he thinks thats going to be my new place to talk to people. i dont know how im going to manage these two months with this internship. i see a million problems coming my way in the next two months . i hope i survive through it.,2218,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"i'm a ddj man, i'll talk with anyone who wants more insight i realized i was delusional but i’m not out of the woods 100% (i’ll explain below). i’ve always struggled with a girlfriend’s past, whether it was an innocent one or a more sexually active one. i would analyze over and over and over making them out to be “bad” no matter the past. i would ask questions about their past and then not believe what they told me and then obsess about it. after doing that for too many relationships i realized it must be me, there was no way all these women were that “bad”. up to this point cheating was not really a worry for me (a little but not too much). i definitely had a trust issue though. i then dated two consecutive woman (not at the same time, lol) who both cheated on me and i stayed with each of them too long after finding out they cheated which only added to my analyzing and anxiety if they were cheating or not (i should have left them immediately but i stayed). this added to my struggle with trust. i finally left and i then met my future wife and i went through the same struggles about analyzing here past. her past was conservative but i still analyzed it and made it “bad” in my head. this slowly lead me to think she cheating on me, it didn’t help that she lived an hour away when we were dating. she is not a big phone person so i would get very uncomfortable when she did not answer. my thinking went on and one but i hid it well and always seem happy on the surface. eventually it would surface and i would ask if she was cheating. i’d analyze her answers, body language, etc. she had a coworker that turned into what she called a “good friend”. she hid their friendship from me, i eventually found out and confronted her, she knew him for two years, they texted/talked 4 times/week at least. i fell into another dark place convinced she cheated. she says i’m over analyzing and that she hid it because she was afraid i’d over react. that was six months ago and i still struggle daily. the ddj mind is loves to analyze to the point that it seems like paranoia. has he been deeply hurt in the past? if you plan to be with him, 100% openness is ideal and it sounds like you have been. the ddj mind will find a reason to no believe almost anything, just like the lie detector test you took (i’m not surprised he doesn’t believe the results). my wife agreed to take one but i know it will only help me for a short amount of time. it’s like the ddj mind likes to focus on the slightest chance of something bad happening (i.e. cheating) instead of facts or evidence to the contrary. please don’t feel weak, you are very strong for dealing with this. one thing to consider is your own mental health. i’m sure you don’t want to look back and regret staying. he does need serious help/or medication. if you plan to stay know it will be a roller-coaster ride (as you already know). how does he react to misunderstandings? does he turn them into “you cheated”? i wish this sight was more active. google othello syndrome. there is a fb group for it. i hope this helps and that you’re doing better. i’ll check back soon.",2233,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"is my partner suffering with delusional jealousy? dear all, i need help with my partner..... is he suffering with delusional jealousy? here's my story!! background--- me and my partner have been together nearly 29 years. i was 14!! he was 15. we have two wonderful boys that are now young men. he didn't have the greatest childhood, he wasn't nurtured at all by his parents and his mum had 7 children by 4 different men. his mum cheated on his dad too. over the years he has always had jealous tendencies, i have lots count of the amount of times he has accused me of liking different men, including friends and family. he cheated on me when we were about 17, it was a difficult time but we managed to move on. he got into taking amphetamine for a couples of years when we were in our 20s but he hasn't touched it for about 19 years. he has suffered with depression for many years and takes anti depressants, about 10 or so years ago he was told he had bipolar and has been medicated every since. about 2 years ago, i suffered a devastating blow when i found out he had cheated again on me and had a son with another women!! the boy had contacted my oldest son to tell him that his dad was his dad too. i was totally heartbroken by this but i decided that i wanted to stay with him. i loved him and believed that he was a different person when he was taking drugs. 7 weeks after finding that out, i then found out that he was messaging a women who he was working with. i couldn't believe that he was hurting me again. he said it was because he needed attention and she had shown him it as i didn't want nothing to do with him as i had been shattered. what a selfish bastard!! but again i decided to stay with him. i ended up on anti depressants myself and had to have professional counselling. it was the hardest thing i have ever had to deal with but i am a survivor. i love this man to bits and never want to be without him, i don't know what it is as you wouldn't think i could love someone who has hurt me so bad. when he is my normal happy go lucky hubby, i couldn't ask to be treated better. he is good looking, sexy, funny, kind and much much more. present-- the last 18 months or so have been an absolute nightmare. i feel i am constantly watched, questioned, under investigation and he thinks he knows how i think. i am now at the point where i am ready to walk away from him. i have to put up with the following : - every time we go out, he accuses me at looking at men, he tells me i look at nice cars as there are men in them. - i wear my sunglasses in the car as he says he feels better as he can't see where i'm looking. - i look out of my passenger window so i don't get accused of looking at the drivers coming towards us. - he asked me why i don't use my sun visor, i told him i don't ever think of using it as i have my sunglasses on, he says it's because i want to be on show. - it is very hot at the moment so i have had my shoulders out, he says i am parading myself as i want attention. - he says that men smirk at him which he believes it's because i must of smiled at them. he thinks men do this to to say 'your woman has just looked at me' mugging him off. - i started a new job, he questioned me about the men that worked there? i took pictures of the four men that are there to ease his mind. - i had a training course, i ended up taking pictures of the people in the course. he didn't ask me to do so but i knew he would feel insecure. he even took the day off of work to take me and collect me. - if i don't call him within a certain time in my lunch break because i am busy and haven't started my lunch, i will be presented with messages asking me if i am ignoring him? - when he has jealous thoughts he is nasty with his words. - i text him when i am back in the village where i live everyday. - i get a lift down a big hill from a couple of different ladies at work. i have took pictures of them to show him they are women as he says i wouldn't tell him if i got a lift off of a man. i would never accept a lift from a man!! - he has accused me of pleasuring myself!! which i have never done. - i had a fete at work, i work in a school. when i got home, i was telling him about it and then he went quiet. he said he had forgotten about the dads of the kids at school. he said i might fancy them. - i had to go to an appointment with a policeman, my son came with me as he couldn't make it. when i got home, he asked if the policeman was good looking? i said he was an average looking man, he said that because i fancied him. when the policeman visited our home, i went in the bedroom and let him deal with it, i just couldn't face another load of accusations. i'm sure there are more i could list but i think you got the general idea...... life for me is draining, i feel so exhausted and stressed living day in and out with this. i am genuine, loyal and committed to this man. i have never cheated on him ever!! i have treated him with respect all throughout our relationship. i just want a normal happy life with him and to make happy memories but for whatever reason he just won't let us be. i am not interested in looking, smiling or getting attention from any man, i just want him to believe in me and trust me, but he doesn't believe any of it. he says everyone likes to looked at as it makes you feel good. i can assure you i don't want any of it!! i have done lots of research on delusional jealousy and i really believe he suffers with it. it is so painful to be viewed as a person i am not!! i'm just me!! don't want much out of life other than a happy home. it also hurts to see him when he is behaving like this as i know i am not doing anything wrong and he really doesn't need to be suffering. i have tried to help him but currently i feel like i have lost him. i feel empty and numb and at breaking point. i love him to pieces but i can no longer live with this constant strain. i deserve so much more. i keep telling him i am his wife and should be treated like it but instead, i am treated like a suspect and his enemy. i would be grateful for any replies to help me decide what to do. i want a life with him but not this life. thank you for reading my story....",2240,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

brother diagnosed with delusional & paranoid disorder look i'm not a doctor but i have bipolar one. i've had it for 20 years plus. i am extremely delusional and psychotic a lot. for me i have to permanently be on a antipsychotic. seroquel should mellow him out. mood stabilizers don't do $#%^ for me. you should really see a doctor. but for my delusions antipsychotics work. delusions are part of psychosis. risperdal is okay. but in my experience seroquel has been the best for me. when i'm delusional i don't seek help either. the reason it is called being delusional is he believes in his mind everything is real. that's why when you're delusional nobody seaks out treatment. they think they're fine. they believe everything they're saying or thinking. once he stabilizes he will realize how he was delusional trust me. happens to me all the time. give it a little bit of time and when he comes to he will realize how messed up his thinking really was. being that you guys caught it young at his age he might fully recover with medication. and never have another episode. i knew a guy like this. it happened one time. never happened to him again. but i have bipolar so it never goes away.,2244,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"spouse newly diagnosed. sad and confused...help hi, thank you all for sharing your journey's! my husband was recently diagnosed with paranoid delusional disorder persecutory type. this has rocked our entire world. we have had so many ups and downs due to his illness. i didn't know that many of the issues we faced in the past were due to his illness. there was a time where he ""knew i was cheating on him"" by the way i scrolled on my phone. has shown up to work functions unannounced. made a huge scenes about me going out with friends so i stopped wanting to go etc. now, we are dealing with police following him, phone tapped, house bugged, etc. this has been going on for about a year so he says. he told me about 6 months ago and he finally agreed to see a doctor and they prescribed 25mg of seroquel to start. i have a couple of questions if you all would be so kind to answer. 1. he keeps a lot of things from me, so i feel very unsure about what is really going on in his head. is this normal? i think he thinks im part of the ""network"", but he wont say. 2. are people with dd dangerous? he hasn't been violent with me recently but we have had some very terrible arguments in the past that got physical. 3. will he ever be free of the delusions? he believes them so strongly and i believe, from what family members say, he has been experiencing them for over 20 years. i don't feel like i can take this, but i want to try and be the wife im supposed to be. any advice would be greatly appreciated. thank you, ladyq",2248,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"is this considered delusional? so to start i have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, but i have a very intense fear of psychosis & schizophrenia. my father had major depressive disorder with psychotic features, but never schizophrenia or anything. with him things would get out of hand if his depression went unchecked. i don't really get much depression like my father did (just little minor episodes). but i do fear that i have delusional thoughts. to add to this its because of my past drug use (mainly pot, and psychedelics). i tend to get extremely deep thoughts. my thought process gets really deep. like for some reason i have the feeling of the universe just making sense. i'm not saying i believe i ""understand"" how everything works, but i get the feeling that things just click in a very un-logical way. like if us humans stopped thinking logically then we could begin to understand the point of life without the black and white filter of our own logic. before i touched drugs i was very over analytical. i'm a computer software engineer so its in my personality to think things are either ones or zeros. but after i tripped for the first time i saw things were not so black and white. things had color, and i felt kind of ""enlightened"" and felt there was something else to this life. this feeling of ""enlightened"" isn't always good either. i get really deep into thought and how the universe works that i feel it could be signs of delusions of grandeur which is a sign of psychosis. so i ask am i just a really deep thinker, or could this be signs of psychosis?",2249,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"my delusional disorder, cured rather instantly? i'm not sure if anyone can relate to this experience or help me understand what happened to me. it seems i suffered from some kind of delusional disorder for about a year from feb 2007 to feb 2008 before being cured by an anti-psychotic, risperdal. looking back now, i had no idea i was delusional (none of my family even suspected anything was wrong with me for an entire year) -- for many months i firmly believed that professors, co-workers, and friends were either secretly in love with me or were somehow plotting my demise. for a long time i had difficulty leaving the house because i thought that complete strangers were staring at me, trying to communicate with me through secret body language signals. i thought the footsteps of the people living above me were in fact coded messages directed at me, and i responded by knocking on the walls (in code) and hanging written responses outside my door that i believed they would understand. it became a full-blown psychosis by the time i got to the hospital -- i believed i had powers to move objects with my mind and that i could telepathically communicate with anyone in the world. the risperdal almost immediately ended all these bizarre thoughts and sensations, and that was the end of that strange, year-long experience. right now i'm on no medication. it's been like this since the end of feb. i'm wondering if it's possible to have had dd for only a short period of time in your life? like, i was completely normal before 2007, then came that tumultuous delusional year, and now it's back again to normal. i feel like this dd/psychosis bit me in the butt of nowhere -- i wasn't using drugs and i wasn't under any stress. i don't have schizophrenia and i don't believe i'm bipolar. is this possible?",2251,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"xiexieniii, from what you wrote i made an educated guess that you are rather young, maybe in your twenties, right? based on that and the content of your delusions (ideas of reference, thought insertion and other rather bizzare delusions towards the end) this doesn't sound like classic delusional disorder to me (this is not professional opinion, obviously). note that that's not necessarily bad - from what i have seen/read, even people with schizophrenia which is responsive to medication and well controlled are often better off than those with supposedly milder diagnosis of delusional disorder who are left untreated. i found literature references to psychotic episodes that were ""one time only"" and even to spontaneous recovery so i guess there is still much we don't know about how psychosis actually gets triggered. are you still seeing psychiatrist? imo it would be good idea to have some continued contact with psychiatrist while you are off the medication so that any signs of reccurence can be caught early. another thing you might want to investigate now when you feel well is whether your state has concept of psychiatric advance directive document - that could help ensure that you can get treatment if you get into another psychotic episode even if you lose insight. best wishes to you and feel free to post here as often as you like.i am always happy to hear from someone who came out of the tunnel, so to speak...",2253,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"sunny, i'm glad to know i'm not the only one haunted by the memories of my delusions. throughout the year i absolutely believed (at least) nine different people were in love with me or wanted to sleep with me, and i thought they were constantly conveying secret ""hints"" of their love -- by raising a coffee cup a certain way, by wearing a certain color shirt, or even by looking at me when passing by. what is devastating about this is that i actually started to develop feelings in return for some of these people. (it's a damn good thing i did not actually act upon my feelings, even though i was certain they wanted me and certain it was a match.) so when the risperdal hit me, and when i realized that not a single one of them was actually communicating any secret messages of love to me, i was heartbroken! the sense of knowing what they were trying to do to me was so incredibly real... now that i am sobered up, i hang out with some of these people (to this day they have no idea what i was interpreting from their benign actions) and sometimes, all i can wish is that the delusions had been real. it was a very foul trick my mind had played on me. i really thought they liked me back. i also had a delusion that a friend was trying to sexually harass me. even though i'm ""sober"" now, and the action of him looking at his watch means absolutely nothing to me (when i was delusional it meant he wanted to kiss me), i can still recall the feeling of being uncomfortable quite clearly. for me, i don't think these delusions will ever return so i've actually stopped seeing my doctor altogether. if i do relapse in the future, that's fine by me -- at least then i might be able to get a solid diagnosis. but for now, it's just a mystery.",2254,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"advice needed on delusional husband i just recently figured out that delusional disorder has been the cause of our suffering the last 6 years and is currently devastating this family. reading the descriptions it is shocking how it was like reading a detailed description exactly of my life the last 6 years. i never realized it was a mental illness until october when he had a breakdown. i thought “he’s paranoid” “why would you think that???” trying to reason with him or help him understand the truth about whatever circumstance but it never works. anyway so now on to describing the current situation and asking for advice. my husband has been convinced i cheated on him for years, he had specific people he thinks i cheated with, he thinks none of our children are his, he has particular people he thinks each kid belongs to, he’s had multiple paternity tests done and when they came back showing the kids are his he was convinced someone hacked the system and results. so we’ve lived like this for 6 years and it’s gotten very ugly. this past fall he got a gun out he was threatening to kill himself if i didn’t confess to cheating on him (i never did obviously or it wouldnt be a delusion). i’ve never been so scared. it’s not only that, he doesn’t trust anyone. he in the end cut himself off from every community or church group we’ve ever been in because he becomes convinced they don’t like him, he’s not welcome; he comes up with ideas about people like everyone is cheating on their spouses and everyone is horrible and doesn’t want to associate with all these horrible, immoral people who hate him and are out to get him. it’s like the whole world is a constant threat. he’s always on edge, like a constant fight or flight mode. when he had a psychotic break in october he became convinced that i was into witchcraft that i was cursing him at night and my lips were moving while i was sleeping and i was preventing him from sleeping and he would drive around all night not even staying in one spot because he was convinced people would find him and he wouldn’t sleep for over a week and then he called or texted like 40 or more people that i am currently or have been friends with in the past telling them that i was involved in witchcraft and please pray for me and don’t tell her i told you. when i found out about this and i was very very upset and i had to message everyone again and tell them the situation and after that he did actually realize he needed help and he went and got prayed for for deliverance which made a dramatic change and after that one day that he had freedom as a result of being prayed for but soon it was back to his same issues. anyways some really weird incident happened where he took off while i was at women’s retreat and drove three states away to see someone he hasn’t talked to in 20 years and when he got there he thought someone was trying to steal his stuff and he took off and said they were chasing him and he drove right back and i ended up filing a missing persons report and i was freaked out and thought he was in an accident and he finally showed up again at his aunt’s house... but he seems so normal so much of the time and when he sees a doctor or explains his issues nobody ever recognizes this because these are a lot of the time plausible things or he doesn’t even talk about his ideas about this crazy stuff. now the current situation is that he thinks that me and his parents and basically everybody else in his life is trying to kill him and wants him dead because we are trying to steal his stuff or maybe have a life insurance policy you were trying to cash out on. so he left the state 4 months ago that’s also a long story it was supposedly temporary but he just told me three weeks ago that he is filing for a divorce and he’s not coming back to michigan at all and we have four little boys their age is 3, 4, 9 and 10. he has been extremely resistant to any other possible interpretations of his beliefs like he thinks i poisoned him two times at least he says he has proof for all these things that he thinks and he is basically abandoning us based on false ideas and refuses to recognize has any kind of problem. his parents and myself and many many people are beside ourselves just not knowing what to do about this or how to get him to see he has a problem. i don’t want a divorce; i want to help him, i want him to get back to being the man i knew and married, i want my kids to have their dad whom they love and miss terribly...but i don’t know how to get him to recognize this problem or seek help. i wondered if anyone has advice!",2265,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"need an opinion writing on this forum seems a bit strange to me, but at this point i feel that i might need an opinion on what to do. my boyfriend and i have been dating on and off for a little over a year. when we first started dating, i wasn't aware of any ""delusional"" thoughts he might be having. but as time when on he told me that he thought i might have spies that follow him, his friends were drugging his cigarettes, that am cheating on him, and other things. the good news is, he never seems out of control. he never accuses anyone of anything, but these thoughts still affect his mental state. the thought of me cheating on him with several people seems to be the most problematic. he has said he can't take it anymore, it's like he had a dream that i am cheating on him and knows it's a dream, but still feels depressed and angry about it. i don't know what to do to help him, and it's and to imagine what he feels like. i'm not cheating on him, and i've told him that many times, but the conversation comes up often. i think that he should see a doctor and get diagnosed with something. he's been to a doctor before but they did not diagnose him with anything other than substance abuse (marijuana) and anxiety/depression. i'm confused to as why they didn't think it was anything else. it might be because he is good at controlling his outward emotions, but i'm not sure. we are both in college though, so i'm not sure how realistic it is for him to be able to see a doctor. i just want to help him, because i love him very much and i hate to see him in having to deal with these thoughts, because i know it is hard on him. if anyone has any advice, i'd appreciate it very much.",2269,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"need an opinion hi, i suffer from delusions as well of being watched (home, away, monitored at all moments). when i accepted this delusion as some form of truth i questioned if i should care about walking naked through my home to the laundry room for clothes lol. i like going out in public, getting ready to go out the door seems more fun than actually going out to a store or something out of exhaustion of looking over my shoulder. it has increased with a passing manic episode that lasted for quite a while. while i accept these as delusions i also accept these as possibilities. about a month ago i was standing in my driveway by the garage where a couple floodlights were mounted. it started humorously like hah maybe theirs a camera there that would explain a lot (probably not) so i'd shoot it the bird every time i was alone near it entering the house because of this hidden camera garage door conspiracy so it was in the afternoon and i just looked at it and said to myself well if it's in your head...so i ripped it off the fixture. the light never worked to begin with. turned out to be a sensor but it almost doesn't matter made me feel so stupid and relieved by the halarity of you just ripped down a bunch of wires because you think ""they"" are watching you. it somehow helped and put things into perspective and make me feel kind of me again. now i haven't ripped the dish off the house smashed the smoke detector and crawling above the ceiling for monitoring devices. but the delusion is still there. but like your boyfriend i've kept enough of a composure to not be worse off and it's good your concerned. these thoughts are intrusive and obsessive but like your boyfriend it hasn't gone away for me either. honestly i'm just waiting patiently for it to end (the delusions). i'd like to think it says a lot about someone's strength to walk through life for an extended amount of time without winding up hospitalized or in crises but to push through such misery is something to be proud of and remaining strong.",2270,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"delusional jealousy? firstly, it is not your fault. my wife had to put up with me doing similar things when i was acutely ill. so the next thing is to see it for what it is - an illness. it does not matter whether or not you are faithful - the issue is what his mind does with the possibility that you are that exists in every relationship. so, once again, it is not your fault at any level. it is very hard on the sufferer of the disorder, but also on their loved ones as you are finding out the hard way. firstly, get him to see a good clinical psychologist who can try some cognitive behavioural therapy. the advice i received was that the spouse's reassurance never works, but makes matters worse: if there was reassurance then it meant the spouse took the allegation seriously. other things that worked for me were that the 'checking' behaviour had to stop. there was a seemingly irrisistable urge to 'check' in many different ways, but if i resisted, then the urge passes. get help for yourself too. from your doctor and a clinical psychologist, who should be able to help you through this to wherever it leads you. get him to see a psychiatrist, too. i recovered from the jealousy, mostly. but then the illness found other outlets - such as persecutory beliefs. so therapy is unlikely to be the answer on its own. i took anti-psychotics for a while, but they did not really work. for me, this only resolved once when i took b-group supplements - blackmore's executive stress. i suspect the supplements work in me because i have a metabolic disorder that responds to the way the supplements inhibit ornithine degarboxylase and get rid of excess ammonia. but severe vitamin deficiency alone can cause these type of symptoms e.g. pellagric psychosis. if you intend to try any form of supplement treatment, discuss it first with his doctor to ensure it is safe for him. supplements are drugs like any other and have side effects and risks, and they are less well researched than many drugs. also, ensure his doctors investigates the possible causes of the disorder by carrying out appropriate tests which should be performed, subject to the doctor's advice, before he trys any supplements or drugs. to my mind, these tests should include but not be limited to in order of importance to my mind: 1. serum amino acids; 2. b vitamins, but particularly vitamins b6 and b3 and b12; 3. urine amino acids; 4. metabolic screen; 5. heavy metals screen; 6. fbc. your doctor may say that the serum amino acids are not likely to establish a treatable cause of the disorder. however, there is a lot of evidence that abnormal amino acid biomarkers may turn out to be crucial biomarkers of underlying metabolic disorders that cause psychiatric and neuro-degenerative disorders. there is a lot of good quality research that says that these disorders often present with patterns of serum amino acid abnormalities. when doctors understand what the abnormal patterns mean, the disorders become metabolic and are no longer regarded as psychiatric. there are likely to be multiple different metabolic disorder that cause psychiatric conditions. my abnormalities were repeat low serum amino acid ornithine and low serum amino acid serine, with high b3 intermediary and high b6. my doctors regarded these as being in effect meaningless results because they did not understand them, but after researching my abnormal results and my disorder (i do not recommend patients do this and do say that if they do this they should do so under the direct supervision of their doctor and only if their doctor does not advise against it), i established that my disorder may find expression in up-regulation of a cortisol up-regulated pathway that probably leads from proline to ornithine decarboxylase to polyamines. this up-regulation explains these and other abnormal results that i have and is currently being investigated by my doctors, so i could yet be wrong about this. your partner probably does not have my disorder, but his disorder may be caused by a metabolic derangement and he may or may not have different abnormal biomarkers. if he does have abnormal biomarkers such as amino acids then they are probably not currently understood, but it is better to know what they are so that when they are understood by doctors better targetted treatment can be provided. if drugs or supplements work, they are more likely to be targetting ameliorating symptoms than the cause, until the underlying cause of the disorder is better understood, so treatment can be targetted at the cause. i am mostly hapilly married with a young son, so whilst i am looking at life differently these days, there is hope it can turn out well. best wishes",2275,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"the nature of delusion notes. all delusions are objective and formulated through subjective reasoning. consensual validatable reality should be valued more than a projected subjective reality that can not be persuaded false to the delusional. delusional reality or manifestation would be projecting a subjective meaning and believing it to be the factual (objective)reality of what’s happening. a dual-subjective reality arises when an individual's mind interprets information and, instead of creating only one interpretation that the conscious mind can make sense of, creates several. these differing ""realities"" then cause conflict within that individual who may confuse what is actually happening around them with alternative realities formulated in their mind based on their own subjective experiences. the psyche, in some, resorts to a psychotic episode when it feels it is powerless and this is the only way to gain anything and triggers an episode that destabilizes the brain. this can be contributed to a variety of factors leading to the onset of psychosis, brain damage medication changes in those who are already diagnosed with mental illness. during this time the mind enters a psychotic process of disintegration down to its basic fundamental functions. however dangerous psychosis is, it can however lead into a much more renewed and refined reintegration of self that can promote growth .",2285,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"is it possible to break from delusions naturally? it slowly loses its hold, i’m still gripping with it myself. but what i mean by losing its hold is breaking with it. if your like me and you can’t relax find a place that makes you feel peaceful for me it’s a beach. i sometimes just think of that feeling from laying in the sand or playing a guitar alone on the beach or imagine looking into the mirror at the old rv my family had and going out to catch a hockey game it’s ironic but i wouldn’t have it any other way. i find a feeling like that can serve well. as far as breaking it is concerned, you ever have a repeating dream? something stupid like something you always wanted just there for sale but you go over to that area of the store and it’s gone so you spend an aimless amount of time trying to find it so you can buy it and that’s the dream. eventually, your mind no longer cares of wanting to possess and has different dreams. alter it. this dream has altered your reality and i say i don’t want your dream you created for me i’ll turn on it by (filling the blank) this is my dream! this is my ride! alright? you are wasting your time! i do this mostly by focusing on my family and career future endeavors projects etc. how i want to handle things: better said than done but it’s slowly being practiced some days harder than others but better days are seemingly coming my way and i’d like to believe it’s related to dreaming of something new. new dream is to leave for one i can control. i may be far off from any real point but thank you for one of the most engaging questions i’ve ever heard.",2286,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"jealous delusions i recently got out of a relationship with my partner who i think might suffer from delusional disorder (jealous type). before we started dating he had on several occasions made false accusations towards me. we met each other through a mutual friend whilst we were at university, he picked interest me in me and we talked for a while and lost contact. when he resurfaced back into my life shortly before i finished my course at university, he asked to take me out for dinner. i agreed to meet up with him, on the day we were to meet up, he called me and at the time i was in the library when the call came in. although i picked the call i had to whisper. fast forward to the date and he told me that when he called me and heard me whispering he thought i was with another man (hence me whispering to him on the phone). at the time i laughed it off and did not read too much meaning to it. on several occasions he would make reference to me being with another man for example, one night he rang me, and as we were speaking his tone changed and he said he heard voices in the background and again asked if i was with another man (i had to explain to him that the phone was on speaker and the noise he heard in the background was from my housemates who were in the living room (my room at the time was on the ground floor next to the living room) even with this explanation he was sure there was a man in my room causing the noise he heard in the background. he also went on my social media and saved images of me with comments from a guy he was convinced that i had had sexual/emotional relations with (he based his claims on the names the guy referred to me as e.g sweetheart, dear). bearing in mind this guy was in a different country and continent, we became friends via social media. when i told him i had to travel to go and see family, on my arrival he requested that i take a picture to prove that i was really with them. anyways fast forward to when i went to visit him at his place, this is where things took a turn for the worse and the false accusations tripled. firstly, it started off as him saying he saw how i looked at his housemate and he was convinced that i sexually desired his housemate. he would say things like ""i saw the way you rolled your eyes at him"", ""i saw the way you walked past him, flaunting your bum so he could have a look"". then one morning i woke up to a letter requesting that i get out of his house. the days and weeks that followed were filled with more accusations, apparently he said i woke up in the middle of the night and snuck to his flatmate's room and had sex with him, he even added that his flatmate confirmed that he had sex with me. when i requested that we confront his housemate to confirm these claims, he refused and made excuses saying that it was not necessary. he would send me messages asking me why i betrayed him by sleeping with his housemate, he said that i nearly drove him to suicide. for a while we had no contact and we later started talking again, but nothing had changed even as friends, he would bring up his claims of my infidelity when we talked and texted and even try to make me admit to his claims. he tried so hard to get me to agree to his version of events and would get angry and call me a lair when i refuted his claims and disagreed with him. he would say things like i cannot be wrong and i have facts that you cheated and when i would ask for proof, he would say the same things he always says ""i saw the way you looked at him, i am sure you slept with him"" i remember one night he woke up and woke me up and told me that i had been on the phone to his housemate. some of his other claims involved him accusing me of sleeping with my ex housemate who he was friends with, apparently he had spoken to my ex housemate and when he mentioned my name to him, he had a look on his face which was similar to how i look when i have orgasms. with this he concluded that i had intercourse with my ex housemate. at the early stages he had mentioned that he was a really jealous and paranoid person, again i did not read too much meaning to this until he started to exhibit behaviors that clearly confirmed his claims. fast forward to a few days ago he still messaged me trying to get me to admit that i cheated as well as laying other accusatory claims and insisting that i had a problem and needed to change my ways to avoid ending up in trouble and lonely. i am glad the relationship ended because the accusations were constant and he would find reason to question my intentions and motives towards him under the disguise of his claims that i gave him reasons to doubt my intents.",2292,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"what treatmant has been successful? hi, i have some strategies that work for me. 1. reality checking. i use my relationships with the people around me to confirm if what i think is happening is in fact real. i only tell my most trusted friends and family things. 2. i try to take my medication every day. i always relapse when i forget for more than a week. 3. i managed to form a language of my own to interpret ""messages"" that i get. it is a language of love and that has limited characteristics in it. it works for me, but i'm an erotomaniac, so it kinda turns me on and may in some ways make me more vibrant. 4. build your support network of people you can call and talk to. having social bonds makes it so much better when you need to figure out what is going on. even if you don't want to share about your symptoms, just talking with someone else can be theraputic. 5. do something you enjoy doing. it will help you stay positive, and it will take you outside of your internal battle. sometimes distraction is a good medicine (if you have gotten to the point where you can master the ""messages"" coming at you). 6. did i mention to set reminders to take the medication? i'm never sick when i remember the medication regularly. 7. it took me several medications before i found one that fit my chemistry. good luck. sunny ""i trust that if i start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -sunnyg",2295,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"delusion or not from theodor w. adorno, minima moralia 103 boy from the heath. – what one most fears for no real reason, apparently obsessed by a fixed idea, has the unnerving habit of occurring. the question which one would at no price like to hear, is asked by an assistant in a perfidiously friendly manner; the person, who one most wishes to keep distant from one’s beloved, will end inviting the latter, even if the former is three thousand miles away, thanks to a well-meaning recommendation, leading to precisely the circle of acquaintances, from which the danger threatens. it is an open question as to what extent one invites such terrors oneself; if one perhaps elicits that question from the malicious one by an all too eager silence; if one provokes the fatal contact, by requesting the mediator, out of a foolishly destructive trust, not to mediate. psychology knows, that whoever envisions the calamity, also somehow wishes for it. but why does the latter seem to eager to meet them? something appeals, in the reality, to the paranoid fantasy which distorts such. the latent sadism of all unerringly guesses the latent weakness of all. and the persecution fantasy is infectious: whoever encounters it as a spectator is irresistibly driven to imitate it. this succeeds most easily, when one gives it justifiable grounds, by doing what the other fears. “one fool makes many” – the abyssal loneliness of delusion has a tendency towards collectivization, which cites the picture of delusion into life. this pathic mechanism harmonizes with the socially determining one of today, wherein those who are socialized into desperate isolation hunger for togetherness and band together in cold clumps. thus folly becomes epidemic: vagrant sects grow with the same rhythm as large organizations. it is that of total destruction. the fulfillment of persecution manias stems from its affinity to bloody being [wesen: nature, essence, character]. violence, on which civilization is based, means the persecution of all by all, and those with persecution manias miss the boat solely, by displacing what is wrought by the whole onto their neighbors, in the helpless attempt to make incommensurability commensurable. they burn, because they wish to immediately grasp, with their bare hands, as it were, the objective illusion which they resemble, while the absurdity consists precisely of the perfected mediacy [mittelbarkeit]. they fall as victims to the perpetuation of the context of delusion. even the worst and most senseless conception of events, the wildest projections, contain the unconscious effort of consciousness, to recognize the fatal law, by virtue of which society perpetuates its life. the aberration is actually only the short-circuit of adaptation: the open foolishness of the one mistakenly calls, in others, the foolishness of the whole by its correct name, and the paranoid are the mocking image of the right life, by choosing on their own initiative to make it similar to the wrong one. just as sparks fly in a short-circuit, so too does delusion communicate with delusion truly like lightning. points of communication are the overpowering confirmations of persecution manias, which mock the one who is ill for being right, and thereby only push them in deeper. the surface of existence immediately closes up again and proves to them, that things are not that bad and that they must be mad. they anticipate subjectively the condition, in which objective madness and the powerlessness of the individual pass, unmediated, into each other, as in fascism, where the dictatorship of those who are persecution maniacs realizes the fears of persecution of its victims. the question of whether an exaggerated suspicion is paranoid or realistic, the faint private echo of the tumult of history, can thus be solely determined retrospectively. psychology does not reach into horror.",2309,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"does my friend have dd? greetings, i am new to the forum and would appreciate your suggestions/advice. i have a friend i see infrequently (she lives 30 miles away) but we communicate fairly frequently via text and facebook. for the past year or so she has been sharing with me her concerns about her being stalked by next-door neighbors (married m/f couple) who have allegedly hacked into her computer, phone, wi-fi and facebook account. her garage door opener has been messed with, her electricity has gone off at inopportune moments, strange cars have sat parked in her driveway, and her cable tv has done odd things from time to time. they have allegedly managed to get into her house. she changed her locks but reports that the key maker made extra keys and accidentally left them somewhere that her stalker could have easily gotten to when she wasn't around. she sent me a list of phone numbers she wanted me to call to see who answered. they were calls she had gotten and when she answered, no one was there. when she called the numbers back to see who had called she'd get a variety of responses (if any). i researched a few and called a handful. i didn't find out much. one call i made produced a recording that said the number wasn't in service. the red flag came when i told her my result and she later reported that she called the number again to see what would happen. a man answered so she blocked him. i called the same number again and got the recording. i said nothing to her about it but kind of dropped all my research once i realized it was probably a ""wild goose chase."" i had pretty much believed her stories (though i often wondered about mental health issues) until this experience because i really had no proof of any of it one way or another. she has security cameras on all four corners of her house but has never been able to produce any evidence of any strange activity via cameras because ""they know how to avoid detection."" (she claims they - or someone - has vandalized her decorations and plants outdoors.) she has spent, i would imagine, hundreds if not thousands of dollars on this equipment. recently she alleges that they have caused the camera on the side of her house that is directed at their house to malfunction. there are times when i have thought that she actually enjoys this drama because when i have made suggestions that i think are solid ways to stop the stalking, she will have a reason to not carry them out, or says she has but they didn't work. there is so much more that has happened to her according to her report. all strange and mysterious. yet i haven't been able to see any evidence of strange activity. all i have seen are photos of these neighbors on their deck barbecuing, smoking or just sitting, or standing by the glass doors leading to the deck. and she has shown me a couple photos of vehicles sitting in her driveway with license plates that can't be deciphered. but to her they are all suspicious. i would like to know if you think she is dealing with delusions, and if so, what suggestions you have as to what i should do, if anything. i don't know any of her family members or friends. most of her information on facebook is private. feel free to ask questions if you need more info. thanks for your help!",2313,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"when the body attacks the mind - autoimmunity in psychiatry i have not visited the forum for a while, so am not sure if this topic has been discussed. i'd like to raise the awareness of all who suffered from the effects of dd to the latest studies regarding autoimmune disease masquerading as a psychiatric disorder. my ex-husband suffered autoimmune disease which caused him to have diabetes and grave disease at a very young age. prior to his first delusional episode, he had a very serious virus infection which hospitalized him for a short period of time. after suffering from dd for 10 years, he eventually ended his own life. one of the studies estimated that 1/3 of the psychiatric disorder cases might be related to autoimmune disease and could be greatly improved after treating the patient's autoimmune system. i wish these studies were found 10 years earlier, but maybe they could help many of others on this forum. here are a couple of links, you can also search on line to find more. https://psychscenehub.com/psychinsights ... sychiatry/ https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/ar ... urce=atlfb",2316,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"ddj husband asking for divorce i am feeling so sad and down today. my ddj husband has been having an episode since father's day weekend, actually maybe longer, its hard to tell anymore as the episodes come closer together and last and last. we have been together 18 years, married 14 years, and i believe this disorder has affected him for at least the last 12-13 years. he was always very jealous and controlling, but i attributed that to issues we had before the marriage. he has been tossing around the idea of divorce off and on for a week or more now, not the first time for that. but it is only the second time that i have been so worn down by this, that i have not been broken down by the threat. i love him, we have 4 children, well two of them are from a previous relationship of mine, they are 19 and 18, and he has raised them since they were 2 and 1. our two children together are 12 and 4. i have tried and fought all these years to keep our family together. i have taken a lie detector test, offered to take more, dealt with emotional, verbal, and sometimes physical abuse, etc... i have prayed, begged, bargained with god to fix him and us. i feel like he has an illness which is not his fault, and if he had cancer, i would not leave him for that, just because of the stress it put on me. so, i have always felt guilty even considering leaving our marriage when he is obviously sick. he will not go get help. he has promised to in the past and has said he would a few times the past week, but i doubt he will stick with that. he had secret social media accounts where he talked to women behind my back. i am not allowed to even look at another man. these came to light last year after he contacted a close relative's ex girlfriend with the secret account and she immediately told on him. he was convinced that my family had a hand in that because in his mind there was no way she would have done that. i found a message that he sent to a young woman telling her that he ""would give anything for all of her love"". it was soul crushing. i screamed and yelled and told him to leave that i wanted him out but he would not. he blamed me for all of it, saying that i was a cheat and he deserved better. he ended up moving out a couple of weeks later, after discovering i had set up a new bank account and paypal account for myself and had applied for some credit cards in my name, in order to set up some type of financial security for myself (i only had $100 in the bank account and $7 in paypal.) but he accused me of stealing from him and decided that he needed to leave me and start a new life. so he was gone for a couple of weeks but came back home, made me quit my job that i had just started, because he will not let me keep a job, and made promises to seek counseling. he saw a therapist twice, and claimed the therapist told him he couldn't see a marriage counselor and him because insurance wouldn't cover both. but he claimed the therapist had agreed to see us together. i went to his third and last appointment with him. it became pretty obvious that he had been lying to me and the therapist and the therapist immediately came to my defense. that was the end of our counseling. i feel cheated. i have loved him all these years, sacrificed for him by having no friends, no outlets, and controlled and limited time with my family. i have given him 18 years of my life. i have not been allowed to dress nice or keep up my appearance. i have gained weight and not been allowed to diet without accusations and threats. he has worn down my self image and confidence by his many put downs over the years. everything we own is in his name. he controls everything. he has told me that he will leave me the house so that our kids will have a home, but that's it. he said he will make sure the kids are taken care of. he bought a very lovely piece of land right by a river, that was basically both of our dreams to have one day. he is going to move a trailer to it and live in that paradise while i am stuck in a neighborhood that i hate and have been begging for him to move us out of for years. we have another piece of land out in the country that we could have put a house on for years, but he would never do it. he says that will remain his as well. he has made statements to me before that he didn't want me to have anything nice. i don't even have a car. if i say anything, i am called a greedy, selfish, gold digger, plus many other expletives. i have never had anything nice that i could call my own, because i have not been allowed it by him. maybe its petty of me to complain about material things, but it is part of life and it is hard to function without a vehicle in a small rural community with no mass transit. i only complain about these things, because i could have had things on my own by now, had i been allowed to work and buy things for myself. i know that he did not allow me to do that as a control thing, but i didn't raise too much hell about it because i didn't expect to be 40 years old and having to start over. i really wish there was some way to get him to seek help. i have personally diagnosed him but he has never been diagnosed by a professional. he told me today that i just wanted to dope him up so that it would be easier for me to cheat on him. i am sad because i truly see no hope at this point. he refuses treatment, so what can i do? i know everyone will say, let him leave, good riddance, etc... but this man has been my world for 18 years and it is hard to just walk away from that. i feel

"what if it's not all delusional i feel like their's a plot thickening around me that i sometimes act on in a very vague manner that sort of eludes that's very vague and quite frankly creepy to those i'm eluding towards if not true that i'm involved in this sort of plot. i often feel watched and monitored that connects on a grander scale than it should which leads me to believe it's psychosis given a history of psychosis. i said some things in a group chat amongst friends which i believe to have been forwarded to others which is actually very plausible on at the very least a small scale when someone is mentally unwell. i referred to myself as a baby being put to sleep (not in a homicidal manner like actual sleep) to describe something when i was manic which i still am to a very small degree. i work in a busy outlet mall at a kiosk and i was busy with a line of customers and i guy walked by and said ""hey baby"" like mocking me. i just focused on work and didn't let it phase me because i can't afford to collapse but i could see it when he looked over he said it with that sort of purposeful intent. i've had a lot of anomalies happen a lot of suspicions. i looked up different techniques of investigating and stalking and a lot added up but i just tried to brush it aside and make sense of it by saying well i am in a battle with my insurance company over a major automobile accident. a lot of suspicious things, some supportive evidence that legitimizes my claims but everyone i talk to has said well maybe they weren't looking at you or i didn't see them and likewise. a lot of guys in veterans caps (one pictured looking directly at me with a grin with no child in a kid's muesam in a very small town. a purposeful photo bomb while i took a picture of my wife. i'll go into a store and the same people will be there shopping with little or no items. like picking up random toys and putting them back on the shelf at the dollar store while i'm with my wife and son. one guy also in a veterans cap looked suspicious in the motor oil aisle at walmart so i went down the aisle and pretended to be looking for motor oil and then said ""eh i don't want to get the wrong one"" as if i were talking to myself out loud. then i went and met my wife and child in the toy aisle where we were letting him pick out a toy and then he walks down there no item or cart in walmart. i go to the grocery store and the manager is pretending to straighten up a bread display so i move over towards the bread and he moves to the other side where i was originally standing now he's pretending to do another task, this continues and so forth. my wife and i were hovered over by a very large thuggish looking man picking out grapes so i turn around and he shoulder bumps me then maintains a clear visual of us throughout our shopping with 0 items in hand. manager races by frantically. (should have called 911 and pulled up surveillance but i didn't) wife of course doesn't notice these anomalies. the other night i pull up to a convience store and and old black sedan with a completely black tint (illegal outside law enforcement) and a barcode on the window pulls up and parks cady cornered at an odd angle. so before entering the store i pop out and pretend to check the air pressure in my tires while glancing intently in their direction i couldn't see in past the blacked out tint and then they took off like go, go! i don't know man a lot of anomalies but maybe i'm unwell.",2331,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"i know i suffer from ddj but now there a few red flags hi, i suffer from ddj and have for a long time in various relationships. my ddj was/is very strong but every now and then i’d usually have an idea deep inside that it was my imagination and my jealousy that made me so suspicions. i was always looking for evidence of some kind. unfortunately that changed recently when i found some text messages on my wife’s phone from a former co-worker. i could tell the previous message threads them between had been deleted. needless to say i concluded she was sleeping with him. i did not confront her though. all of the messages i saw where innocent type conversation, nothing sexual, although he offered her a massage on message and added a lol to it at the end, she did not reply. a few weeks later i eventually confronted her about the situation to which she said answered a few questions correctly but lied about his name. i told her i knew she was lying, etc and told her i was going to divorce her (did i over react?). after 5 days of no speaking to each other we eventually sat down and talked. she said she knows she was wrong and that she knows she hurt me (she knows i struggle to trust, i’ve been cheated on before by 2 other woman but also had ddj before that….ironic) but she was scared because she thought i’d have a jealous reaction and that is why she lied about his name and never told me about him. i told her i needed transparency and open communication and for us to get on the same phone plan, etc. she agreed and she told me that since the day we met she have never been with anyone else but me. however after our talk i noticed she google searched how to not have contacts show up on an i-pad and she did delete him from our i-pad contacts and it was not because she didn’t plan to talk to him again. i just recently started using the i-pad a few weeks ago, she’s used it for a year. so to my point, i read a post a few years ago about a guy who suffered from ddj. he said all the signs of a cheating spouse were there and he was convinced his so was cheating on him. then for some reason he realized it was him and he explained it in great detail. i keep looking for the post but can’t find it. also, i’d really like to hear from anyone who had a situation like mine above where something similar happened and the results turned out innocent. i know i suffer from ddj but i can’t over look this. thanks",2333,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"delusions of the past hi grandcyan11, welcome to psychforums, i hope you find this place as supportive and helpful as i have over the years. diagnosis in mental health are less important than you'd think, as long as you find an effective medication that reduces or resolves symptoms, therapy, support, and positive coping strategies... i think that is the part that is important. at this point in my history being ""diagnosed"" with mental illness, they have changed the diagnosis to include every diagnosis in the family. bottom line___ these doctors are using symptoms to define the illness rather than finding the real cause and diagnosing the way medicine should work. *even the nih has realized their use of the dsm in mental health research is wasteful... basically, for decades physicians have labeled symptoms - for billing purposes, and then treating mental illness using broad categories rather than finding the biological, social history, or environmental source of the illness. i understand mental illness is complicated, but generations of people have been labeled and basically dismissed by this. society gave up on trying to understand what was happening biologically because of this society's acceptance of the apa's flawed labeling system that doesn't have a valid scientific meaning based in biology. think of susannah cahalan in her book brain on fire where her parents didn't give up on finding a reason for her illness - her disease was cured. for the rest of us, as we fumble through the mental health system, the doctors use diagnosis to experiment on us with categories of drug classes until they hopefully find a medication that works. i mean, i guess the mood stabilizers are important for mood elements, and the anti-psychotics for psychosis, the anti-depressants for depression, etc... you get my point. honestly, i'm glad my diagnosis of severe mental illness was delayed with less severe sounding illnesses like you describe being used in my early days... like postpartum depression, delusional disorder, or psychosis with possible mood elements. i know it's hard to feel the weight of stigma from a mood illness when you feel more affinity to the delusional portions. i totally understand. i will say, on the positive side, the mood disorder support groups i've attended are more fun. thankfully with medication, therapy, and a wonderful network of supportive individuals in my life, i do well. i've been in recovery for over a decade. sunny ""i trust that if i start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -sunnyg",2337,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"delusions of the past hi , i read your posts and they have given me real hopes . my boyfriend is going through exactly what you went through. its a nightmare . its been just 4 months . you took 4 years . some take forever . i have realized by now its a long long way to go . unless my boyfriend makes up his mind to never talk to me like hes been doing almost everyday for the last 4 months and actually does it . so heres my story , we're 19 and have known each other for more than 6 years now and have been in a relationship for almost 3 years . it started with him accusing me of having an affair with all his friends . he accused me with them one at a time . and then when he couldn't find any proof he jumped to the conclusion that i along with his family and all his close friends are talking behind his back and are planning something for him or against him . its a nightmare of constant accusations and questioning. there are days where i feel like lying to him and telling yes there is something and make up a fake story and end this! but i know thats not the right thing to do and will just worsen things. the main problem in my situation is ... his friends talking about things to him which sometime coincide with something he has told me in private . for example , he told me about a weird dream he had with me and person . a in it around 2 months ago .. a few days ago his friend told him about him having a weird dream about person a .. person a and my boyfriends friend are friends . the blame is all on me now. i told his friend about the dream and now his friend is trying to tease him . there have been quite a few instances like these which can be mere coincidences which have completely strengthened his belief that weve been conspiring against him . i really love him and i know he loves me equally . all the important people in his life are the villans right now and since im the most important person to him . im his main target to get to know the ""truth"" . he thinks breaking up with me will be the best way out since hell have the toxic person out of his life and him not being with me will be punishment enough for me. he breaks up and then comes back asking the same question to tell me the truth . and when i tell him what bes thinking is wrong he gets aggressive and leaves again . i dont know what to do ! i dont understand what im being punished for . its very difficult to see him like that. he says im the only one who can calm him down and make him happy . i go to him everytime he needs me because i love him and that is why i cant leave him in this difficult time of his life . but again he thinks im taking all of the suffering because im guilty . he has been to several psychologists and psychiatrists but there has been no change in his thinking. he thought they were involved in the conspiracy too . he saw one recently on his own so that he could make sure hes legit. he doesnt want to tell me about how it went. but since his thinking hasnt changed im sure it was ineffective . i dont want to involve my parents in this situation and from whatever little they know they want me to stay away from him . it gets really difficult at home too . im swinging between my mother and boyfriend. i just need an answer to the question ' what do i do now'? he's been on some medication which calms him a little and helps him sleep . but the delusions are still strong as ever . could you please tell me from the point of view of the person with the delusions what would you have liked to hear and treated when you were ill. what medication helped you ? and do the delusions really go away? for does medication and treatment just stop it from happening further . please help.",2338,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"reoccurring jealous delusions held so i am a new member here, i came after searching ""my girlfriend is delusional"", and a thread here came up. i am just looking for any possible insight to what i am dealing with, and though this forum doesn't seem very active i think worst case i get to unload a little bit. it's not something i am really able to talk to anyone in my life about. so i have been in a long distance relationship with a girl i met online for about a year now, and she has told me that this christmas will be our last time seeing eachother. the main delusion she seems to have is that i am stalking one of her former friends on instagram. this one was probably the first red flag that came up, and has continued to be the most persistent and damaging idea that she holds regarding me. there is some girl who was at one point her friend on instagram, who for some reason i don't understand my girlfriend despises now. my gf believes that i am obsessed with this girl and thinks that i am spending all day looking at this girl's pictures. the truth is i never have looked once, not out of respect for my gf even, i honestly don't care about social media at all. it isn't really my thing. i'm not going to become infatuated with anyone on social media as far as i'm concerned, for it even to be possible i would have to know them. so i will spend hours arguing in my own defense over this, asking why she thinks this, and she will say that the things that me and this random girl tend to talk about and specific words we use are too similar to be coincidence. like i have had her turn on me for using the word ""good"". my gf says she knows when someone is lying to her, and that she ""knows what i'm up to"". sometimes she will just say that, that she knows what i'm doing, and refuse to elaborate. there are other times where she will be insecure and weirdly jealous, like when we are out she will get upset any time i appear to look at a woman, assume the worst, and think i only look at other women because i am not into her. to me that seems like normal jealousy though, because there is at least a grain of truth there in that i do look at other women. the main thing that seems to prevent her from trusting me though, and the thing that she has broken up with me several times over, is this delusion where i am stalking this random girl on instagram. like at best i will be able to get her to table it, and admit that she feasibly could be wrong only because there is no evidence, but that never lasts and that partial admission never makes me feel any better. before long she is 100% certain of it again and expects a confession, insists that i am a liar, and says that if i would confess we could work it out. i was planning to move to another country to be with this girl, and honestly nobody has ever made me feel happy and satisfied in my life like she does. after reading some accounts here i am really starting to believe that things are extremely unlikely to work, and it would be better if i cut ties. i think that some of this is relatively moderate, and we often just write it off to stress from being apart so often, but more and more i think that things will only get worse for us. i just wish i could help and am extremely frustrated, but it doesn't seem like there is anything i can do, and i can never realistically expect her to have trust in me. i feel like i am abandoning her, even though she is the one who keeps breaking up with me, but i don't know what else to do.",2349,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"painful delusional thoughts i dont really know where to put this post but for the past 4 months i've been suffering from delusional/irrational thoughts and feelings. in short: i feel like was supposed to die in august and feel like just a minor part of myself still lives. long version: r/suicidewatch finally lost my ability to think rationally u/nadosa hi, so basically what i was going through this year was just insane. first half derealization/depersonalization, second half depression/ocd but feels like psychotic, because everything seems so surreal. i was diagnosed with ocd and adjustment disorder btw. ocd and not psychosis because i know those feelings and thoughts are somewhat strange. so basically i recovered from depersonalization this year...but as the symptoms slowly vanished, i still battled irrational thoughts from day to day when suddenly my mind switched to: ur life is over. i was overwhelmed, suddenly paranoid of time/the date, feeling like i shouldnt be here anymore as the time went on and feeling like trapped in this concept of time. this feeling...it feels like i shouldnt be alive anymore since august, like i shouldnt have lived past august and should be dead until august. it just feels like it is wrong to be alive, when i go to the hairdresser for example, my mind goes like this: you are dead inside, you died, you dont need to do this, you are trapped in hell, you shouldve killed yourself as i told you! when i look in the mirror: ""why are u still alive?"" it just cant make sense why i am still alive, and i am super overwhelmed, feeling insane, because i know something is terribly wrong in my organism. you may ask yourself why ""august""? i dont know, i somehow wanted to be recovered and fine from mental health issues until august, i didnt know what would happen if i didnt recover until then, but my mind has adapted to my expectations and as the time went on without me recovering, my mind realized that and switched to this surreal psychotic limbo mode, so basically i guess false expectations triggered this mess in my mind. i remembered when these thoughts sneaked in in the last week of july, i felt like after this week i would pass like a strange ""threshold"", like my old self had to die (idk it felt so strange, i just got very depressed, nervous and obsessed with the future and thought if i couldnt cope i may commit suicide, but i wasnt suicidal) it felt like life after july was just black, i didnt want the future to come and felt like i was involuntarily pushed to experience this future pain, but then there was the 1st of august where i had these painful thoughts that i cant live anymore and got anxious. and this whole ""anticipation"" made me believe that this is destiny and i cant recover from it! furthermore i told my psychiatrist that i feared that i'll lose myself in time, which i know sounds strange but i definitely felt like there would be no future for me and honestly i keep questioning how i survived the last months, making me feel like i shouldnt be alive because the feelings were so surreal. i cant stop thinking that this $#%^ is something supernatural and keep questioning if people had already commited suicide if they would have been in my shoes, what freaks me even more out. but i have no clue how to get out of that hole at all. i am depressed and scared to death. i dont know, this is just a nightmare and i am 19. everytime i think about me as a person, i get a feeling of doom: who is ""i', why am i still alive? etc. it is terrifying. unknown mental illness?!",2351,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"emotional ""crossing?"" though, admittedly, i am not sure if this subject belongs in this forum but it seems to fit better than any other that i can find. the word ""delusional"" seems appropriate. i'd like to start by saying 'thank you,' for taking the time to read this. it is something that i find particularly bothersome and, as best i can tell, has be present for most of my life. the ""mixing"" came as a sudden realization, a few days ago, after getting off work. i have been following an exercise, in which, i contemplate my life as if writing an autobiography in my head. though, i cannot say exactly what i am looking for, it does often bring to light both positive and negative aspects of my life that i may have forgotten. one such aspect stuck out to me this time. the emotions that i associate with love are identical to those i associate with death. it's a strong feeling, hard to exactly put into words honestly. in dreams, fantasies, and past romantic experiences i have felt a warm peace. a strong vulnerability tied with acceptance and bliss. for me, this is happiness, near euphoria. but, while i've known this feeling for quite some time it has only recently occurred to me that fantasies and dreams of myself dying bring about the exact same response. the feelings couldn't possible be more similar. i feel it necessary to say that i do not believe that i am depressed, in any way. though i have ups and downs in life, like most do, i am a relatively content person. i have decent goals and ensure that i further myself towards them. the concept fascinates me, and i would very much like to learn more about the phenomenon. the ""mixing"" occurs with several other emotions, that i feel that i should feel in certain circumstances, but non as prevalent as this. i have read about emotional confusion, though it seems hard to find any legitimate literature on this in particular. if anyone has any light to shed on this situation, or has any information that might help me further understand it please share. i am more than happy to answer any questions that may help as well.",2354,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"i imagine people and talk to them continuously i don't know when it first started but for as long as i can remember i have talked to people ""inside my head"", so to speak. when i was in elementary school i would often imagine people i liked, maybe boys i had crushes on etc. whenever i was alone home or just wherever i would imagine them being with me and had conversations with them. as i grew older the people i would imagine often changed, and so did the circumstances. i would talk out loud, maybe a loud whisper when i talked to them. when i was in middle school i started imagining idols and people i looked up to or just thought that had really fun personalities. the people i talked with didn't even know i existed but in the situations i created we were often best friends or living together etc. i'm now 17 and i still do this, but lately i have been more and more aware of it. another thing that worries me is that my thoughts tend to get mixed with reality and well - them. they are with me constantly, even when i talk out loud to communicate with them or not. even when i'm watching netflix or youtube or whatever and not really focusing on anything else - for me they're still there, reading a book or maybe watching with me. if i'm having a conversation with someone (that actually exist) i sometimes blurt out something weird that has nothing to do with the context of the conversation we're having at all. for example - some time ago i was on a cabin trip with my (now ex) boyfriend, and we were under the covers of a bed talking about how hot the room was. and as he commented the heat i simply answered ""but shouldn't it be cold in la by now?"". i live in norway and have never had anything to do with la whatsoever. i said this without even thinking cause in my mind i was currently on a trip to la with the people i usually tend to imagine - this was how i imagined the whole cabin trip. normally people just brush it off and laugh or give me weird grimaces whenever this happens, cause i'm known to be quite the clumsy, outgoing person. when this first happened i didn't give it much thought, but now it kind of worries me. the situations i imagine now are often played out in the future, or at least a different now. i'm good friends with this group of idols i keep imagining since april now, and since i'm known to a certain degree, i'm often at interviews making people laugh etc. it sounds really weird and i tend not to think too much about the situations when i'm aware. personally i don't think it's unhealthy or whatever, i love communicating with them and being with them makes me happy. if anything, i'm quite happy about it, considering i'm always looking forward to being with them and so on. i'm not antisocial or anything, and have too many friends for my own good, so it's not influencing my social life. if i'm invited to a party or a cabin trip or whatever, i always imagine it being them who invited me and that's what i'll be looking forward to too. i don't really consult anyone at all about my personal issues or well, anything. in all my (soon) 17 years of life i have only opened up this last month. i talked to two of my friends about two different issues. one being my childhood and the other one this issue about the people in my head. the friend i consulted about the people and the situations i imagine said i should go see someone just in case this was something unhealthy which should be dealt with. she knows about my childhood, and said that it might have something to do with that. i am unsure if this has anything to do with my ""issue"" or not, but i'll explain it just in case. when i was younger i used to get beaten and scolded a lot by my parents. as i grew older the abuse would decrease. recently my parents divorced and now i only live with my mother. we have a really good relationship and i'm happy. i'm often left alone a lot at home, though. my mom is often at work or with her boyfriend, and my older sister usually stays at her boyfriend's apartment. when it comes to my mental health i'm usually happy but have periods where i'm seriously depressed. i've been diagnosed with winter depression so it's often that time of the year its worst. so i guess that was the most of it. i could consult a psychiatrist in my city but i'm just so unsure if i need to or not. so if you have any knowledge or experience about this or something similar, maybe even just some advice - please help me!",2357,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"i imagine people and talk to them continuously this sounds like maladaptive daydreaming to me, which is something i do frequently, and i've done it since i can remember, i'm now 26. i have a history of abuse and neglect in childhood, and abuse in adulthood as well. like ubinix800 said, for me personally, loneliness and detachment are major influences for how often and how intensely i engage in this. i've heard it's a form of dissociation. when i was younger, in my teenage years, i had such a rich imaginary life, that i would list important dates of my imagined friends i had relationships with and i would also draw the house i imagined i lived in, places i went, etc. on a couple of occasions, i contacted the actual real people (like celebrities) i had imaginary friendships with, imagining that we had such a bond that they would contact me back and this would begin the real friendship and save me from my current situation. recently, i had to make a point of being more mindful throughout the day, because i had been escaping my entire life through this daydreaming. i was irritated when anyone interrupted my time with my imagined world and could not accomplish anything. i think if it gets to that point, it can be unhealthy. but, if you're functioning well, still care for your other relationships, self care, and any responsibilities that you may have, then i think it's completely ok. maybe explore if you believe it is an escape for you. if it is, then what are you escaping from? “the best way to escape reality without running, is smiling even though, it is obviously fake.” devil’s little sister",2361,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"i have something i need to get out!!! hi, i am an 18 yr old man, i have been diagnosed w/ a mild case of psychosis, although i really think i just need to adjust my thinking in order to resolve it... that said i have become convinced that i am affecting the world's population with my actions, and i feel a very strong need to say something about it...i feel like saying this to everyone. if you care, if you want to help in any way, then please read all of it... everyone in this world, on this planet earth, especially in america, please listen to my words... i have, truthfully, become very, very, very stressed over all of this in the past few months. and i can tell other people felt that way, too... it isn't what i want. i'm gonna say exactly what i want, not what im feeling, not the anger or sadness that that i feel, not something crazy. i want people to disregard my past words and actions. i don't like vulgar, greedy, or arrogant people, as a matter of fact, those traits are without a doubt, 3 of the most disgusting traits on the earth. the opposite are some of the best... empathetic, not greedy, clean in their actions and their hearts, open to others' perspectives. people with those traits are already pretty good, worth while, model people. in addition, people who do hard work, solve problems instead of creating problems, and don't cause trouble for other people, are very deserving of respect; i will always value those traits in others, appreciate them, and feel respect for the people with those characteristics. people who make trouble for no reason are always sad, weak people, who can't achieve much in life. this world needs more of the good traits. on that same point, if anybody feels hatred, sadness, even happiness or anything else towards me because of my actions ""influencing your lives"" emotionally or psychologically, then stop. just stop, really. just stop-- don't feel this way. you shouldn't be concerned with me, or any of this, really; focus on useful information in life, critical thinking, working hard towards achieving your goals, and being happy. everybody has a right to happiness--especially the good people in the world. and the evil people--- the ones who are detrimental to society, who care only about themselves, who don't care about the suffering of others, who hold bad traits such as vulgarity, arrogance, greed, who hold hatred, anger, or violence--- people like that will be incredibly unhappy. people even similar to that will find only depression, and ultimate failure. the one's who act deceptive, use others, try to make the world worse, those people are the most worthless, and they will definitely falter, fall, fail, until they change. people who worsen other's lives, will suffer from sadness. and the ones who know they are bad people, but choose not to change, or are proud---they will never find happiness or satisfaction, or true success. they will suffer and fall even harder. the good people-- who desire to solve our problems, help others, love peace, the people that, really want to do what's right, they will be the most motivated, the most passionate, the most successful, and the happiest. and that's because they deserve success. that's what i want, that's what i believe! racism is evil, and i believe black people and those who receive prejudice should portray themselves in a better way and convey themselves in a positive way. that's very important in my belief, and there are singers these days that flaunt their vulgarity, their wannabe ""toughness"", their gross lifestyles and basically spread their unlikable personalities. people who represent themselves in a bad way have affected views towards their entire ethnic group, and those people need to stop. show you're good qualities, your human qualities, your kind qualities. and people will respect those things. the weird things that people show interest in today are truly sad... people talking about porn and drugs as if they are normal things just disturbs me...i find it disgusting. how can some people be so gross? pot, is not too terrible; it helps some people, and relaxes. but drug use overall is bad and so is marijuana. the media today would be much, much more entertaining if they didn't display those things and almost flaunt them as often as they do. i think it's sad, and those kinds of things are detrimental to society. people please respect the taboo things in our society, some things are not meant to change. i want the good people in the world to succeed -- i always have. don't misconstrue my feelings. for the past month i've tried ""following my heart"" but it's turned out to be somewhat similar to just doing what i feel. i feel anger and frustation at times, but i don't wish for others to actually hurt. please, don't misunderstand my feelings, instead, listen to my words!!! i have said many things this past year, but 99% have just been emotions that i feel, meaning little and not conveying my thoughts at all. emotions are fleeting but beliefs are more permanent. i believe those who want goodness to win, people who don't hold anger or violence in their hearts, who respect hard work and always consider the lives and emotions of other people, who try to do what's best in any situation, the people who hold any one or more of these traits; i want to see more people like that in the media, i want to see those kinds of values succeeding in the world. i want the people who have standards like those to value them, and find motivation, find happiness, find strength, and success, so they can rise higher in the world. that's something i want---for the people who want to the do the right thing, to succeed! to get what they need. to solve their problems, and win at life. i desire that more than almost everything else in life--- for those people to succeed greatly in the world. and it makes me depressed to see the opposite---to see good-for-nothing, problem causing, conflict creating trashy people winning; it's one of the worst things to see, truthfully. motivation and happiness--- if the good individuals in the world have more it makes me feel a lot better. i love to see those people succeed. thanks for listening. i see people today, and in the past i've thought that the people today don't feel as much, or are more cold hearted than before, or don't feel as much happiness or depth in their feelings. but i know now that that isn't true. i know there is just as much depth to the hearts of good people as there is in mine. there is great happiness in their hearts, with real meaning and persistence. there's a ton of fight left in good people's hearts, i know. and i know that people feel the same emotions that they always have, and just as strongly---happiness, peace, relaxation, satisfaction, and all the rest. that's the way it should always be; i would not have it any other way. the depth in their hearts is immense. and with that, i'm done. i felt the need to say these things to, well, everyone--- and there's more i want to say but it's too much for just this forum. some things i say, they appear to go against the things that i stood for in the past. people misconstrued my messages in the past, while i did not speak in a clear way. these words are crystal clear; they are my true beliefs, the standards that i hold, the same beliefs i held a year ago, years ago, possibly my entire life. i have always felt the same but haven't been able to communicate it as well in the past... now, please, listen to the words i said here. it's the truth.",2363,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

"living in mind i thought about how to develop a sort of coping mechanism today. let's say this false dimension to our being that we devote our unbalanced energy towards into trying to untangle like a net in front of us and something that sways around us, let's say this fantasy world exists simply because it feels alarmingly real to us. then we have to think about what exists in our physical reality. our family, friends, our job, who we mingle with, our dreams, who we are. these are in essense the reality of our lives. if their existed a realm in which we occupied that sort of position of influence but we lead normal lives then the question over these things being true or false are immediately irrelevant because this realm doesn't exist in our realm. we're not always around when we are discussed so we don't know what's said or was withheld at any level of communication but in our daily reality we exist with a purpose that doesn't call for rockstar. we can still understand ourselves as not being rock stars because we admit to having a problem, so we might as well ask ourselves the question of whether or not we even want to be a rockstar. my issue with this whole thing derives from a psychotic episode with many unanswered questions to which i began believing to have some sort of recognition. it's a paranoia of being leeched or monitored or something of that nature. it's psychotic and sick but it's not real. i didn't write commercials or come up with blue wildnerness's slogan, i just happened to say the exact same stupid thing about my cat having the soul of a panther. but the realm in which it exists is wherever the advertisement was created thousands of miles away. in my reality i'm just watching a hockey movie that is also not about me just appeals to my humor and tastes also with expressions and situations i can relate to but are in no way brought on by me. you get the just of where i'm trying to go.",2370,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"not sure what to make of this... well, i've had some traumatic (on some level) events occur the past few years and they have been really difficult to deal with. around 2 years ago, i was diagnosed with depression and was put on an anti-depressant and saw a therapist regularly. after a year i was able to taper off my anti-depressant with the help of the dr until i wasn't on it anymore. when i first went on it, i felt like for the first time in my life i had clarity. my daily life wasn't as painful as it normally was. the thing is though, before seeing the dr for the first time my mother was the one who insisted that i see him because i was saying things that didn't make sense. at the time i believed that: -because i cried in front of my kids, my husband will divorce me and take our kids away -that my husband wanted to divorce me so he could marry someone -i believed that i should leave him first so that he wouldn't take the kids i believed those things 100% and didn't want him to know if i had cried earlier in the day. recently, i brought this topic up to him and he was shocked as he had never thought any of that. more recently, i had a small problem with a close family member. it was nothing. a silly squabble. but i had extreme and inappropriate anger about it. i apologized and the other person still responded with anger. instead of just letting it go, i would get angry about it every once in a while. among the things i said/thought about the situation: -my family sees me as a bully that must be stopped -my family doesn't defend me because i would never be right -my family constantly defends the other person because they feel that i am a bully to that person -my family constantly makes excuses for the other person's behavior because they care about the other person more than me -my family never makes excuses for me- they always make me out to be evil i even called my mother crying to ""confront"" her about theses things. she hadn't even heard about the fight and started telling me that i'm imagining this perception of things and that no one sees me as a bully. i could hear her not even knowing what to say and feeling as at loss as she was when i used to tell her my husband was leaving me/hates me. a therapist i was seeing for the past few months wondered if my belief that my husband was going to leave me was psychosis of some form. it was really hard to say. at the time i was hardly ever sleeping and would take a long time to leave the bed so it was possible that if i did suffer psychosis it was a side-effect of the depression. after that ""confrontation"" with my mother, things appeared to calm down and i was able to be somewhat normal and saw the other person that i had the fight with and talked normally. then a week or so passed and we all gathered at a mutual acquaintance's house. that person and another person brought up a topic similar to the one we fought about. i immediately felt defensive and even started getting visibly upset. later that night, when i was at home, i started breaking down again. those thoughts started coming and i started feeling out of control. i kept crying and shaking and feeling like a worthless waste of a human. the next day, i felt blank. almost normal. as if i had a cup that at times gets full of all these negative emotions that overflow until it empties out and then there is nothing. i feel normal, but i have not felt ""joy"" in a long time. another thing to add is that this person i fought with, i am constantly paranoid of them. whenever they bring up a situation i feel like they are talking about me. i often feel like they purposely exclude me of things along with a few other people. i get very suspicious that they lock down on me and make comments that outline my weaknesses. even though ""logically"", that would be very weird and when right now i try to think back to what they actually said to make me feel that way, i just can't remember. so here's what i'm wondering. this internal monologue that occurs when i am in my ""bad days"", could it possibly be a delusion or hallucination of some form? i just can't tell anymore. and i don't feel like i can silently wait for another ""break-down"" but i feel like i know that it's coming. i know no one here is able to really tell me what's happening, but could someone maybe relate? does any of this sound familiar to anyone?",2375,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"new member, delusion qualification hi, first post so i guess i need to wait for mod. to approve it before it goes up, that's okay, and thanks. i have a question about p.d. i know and have been diagnosed as mildly paranoid and delusional. i'm okay with that, and most of the time i have a decent grasp of what is and what is not ""real"". i'm 40, i am a sober alcoholic, i recently moved in with my mother and her husband of 25-ish years, they got married when i was about 12-14?? i don't want to give too much history that it skews the question, so here goes; when i was younger i thought my step dad hated me to the point of intentional emotional abuse, but when i talked about it or accused him he played dumb, and was very careful about not doing or saying anything that would incriminate him. often i was told i was acting out against him because he was a new step dad and that was normal. i sort of accepted that, and moved away very young. years years i had a psychotic break in january 2017, got treatment-help-therapy, felt pretty good. was diagnosed as paranoid, and self diagnosed as delusional. moved in with moms and sd, now i have this feeling again, that he is trying to hurt me, trying to make me question my morals and what i do. i'm 40 and physically uhhhh not intimidated nor mentally either. there are some scenarios that are definitely not delusion, but again not enough to seem malicious to anyone except to me, of course!! and it is only him, other people do not get to me, my normal delusions are spiritual in nature and/or apocalyptic. so the question is due, how do i know if this is my pd or if this is really happening? can i test it somehow? thanks, r",2376,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"new member, delusion qualification it can be confusing when a person has a diagnosis of something like persecutory delusion, paranoid delusion, schizophrenia. it can also amplify the problem if not dealt with correctly. i had a breakthrough on this topic. one thing we the sick need to know is that we are not the only ones out there who are sick. and as most of us know or should know; hurt people, hurt people. with that said, what i realized was, that it wasn't a delusion, but it wasn't as personal as i had suspected. i thought it was all well thought out attack against my self. (so a contribution to my already existing condition) what it is, is that this person is severely passive/aggresive, and is unaware of it. it comes across as personalized because i live in self pity right? but in actuality it isn't meant that way at all, it is as a result of someone else not dealing with their issues, and inability to communicate. he is sick and that is okay, we all are right. thanks, ill hang around a little if that's okay, r",2377,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
"delusional husband? any professionals on here? i am not trying to diagnose my husband, but reading this forum has been the closest i can see to what i believe he's experiencing. this is an email i have just sent to a private psychiatrist as i appear to be running out of options. i wondered if anyone on here had any luck getting professional help or had any advice for me? dear sir/madam i need some urgent advice and i do not know where to turn. my husband is becoming increasingly paranoid and i believe he is experiencing delusions of persecution. six months ago it started with him believing cars were following him and watching our house, since then it has spiralled and has included but is not limited to him believing the following: 1. 'they' have been planning this revenge on him for at least 20 years 2. he is the victim of community mobbing, gang stalking and work place gas lighting 3. everyone is 'in on it' and let him know this by coercive conversations 4. i have been recruited 5. he has been poisoned with arsenic 6. it is linked to the freemasons 7. i am emotionally abusive... or he is possibly 8. 'they' have plotted to let us build up our lives and then every 4 years they destroy it 9. 'they' are responsible for my brothers and mums deaths 10. we have been bugged and they are most likely monitoring our internet usage and emails 11. he has been to the police 12. the doctors can't be trusted 13. they are either going to come and hurt him or they are going to make him look like he's gone mad or they are going to set him up for something bad there are many more, this has resulted in obvious problems within our relationship and he has threatened to leave several times now. it has also resulted in him not working properly (he is self employed) and we are now really behind with all bills and have serious financial issues. he is also now suffering with physical symptoms due to anxiety and stress. he will not listen to reason. it is not him, he is not ill, it is everyone else and he simply does not trust anyone. i have been to my doctor, i have called the doctor, i have called my local crisis team, i have called and emailed mind. i emailed a local private psychiatrist. i have spoken with his family. i have looked online for advice. the only information i have is that i should neither agree or disagree with his delusions. i shouldn't argue and i should get him to a gp. how do you get him to a gp? he did go last week, because he had headaches, high blood pressure and liver pain. despite me telling the doctor in advance and him telling me to get him to go there urgently, the doctor just dismissed it when he said he thought he'd come in to contact with arsenic!!!!! so what do i do now? i am very scared and could really do with some advice from a psychiatrist who has had experience with this. if i can't get him to get help how can i talk to him? how do i get financial help for my family if he won't get signed off? if i talk to other people i feel like i'm betraying him. if i just sit and wait i panic that it's going to get worse. what's the prognosis with this kind of thing? i just feel so stuck and overwhelmed and really would like someone to tell me something other than i need to get him to gp.... which is obviously not working for me. are you able to assist or point me in the direction of someone who can? ps. there is no history of mental illness in him or his family. we have been together since he was 16 (25 years) and there has never been any indication of this happening before. he is now 42. thank you in advance",2378,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"delusional husband? any professionals on here? these kind of conversations can be hard because trying to figure out what to say is hard, knowing he's only going to dismiss any 'logic' and twist it around. as someone who has been delusional, and someone who lives with her father who believes the neighbors are listening to us through the vents, are moving things around in our house, are stomping upstairs just to mess with us, i know this isn't always rooted in just ""oh, he's sick"". for me, isolation is a huge one. i'll start of semi-isolated, get deeper in my thoughts, and isolate completely, at which point i'm stuck until some miracle happens or something yanks me from it all. trust is also huge. not being comfortable in myself, around others, having constant feelings of being threatened as a result of trauma, it fostered ill trust in people. that ill trust, over years and years, developed into ideas people were controlling me, telepathically, just so they could ruin my school career and my work as a counselor. i thought jobs/bosses were framing me, were creating clones in the basement of the amusement park i worked for, and setting me up to get arrested and fired. i quit a lot of jobs because of that. so there is a lot involved here. trust, you mentioned, and that could be a huge one. in fact, it could be a root in all this. when i speak with people with these kinds of beliefs at work . . . well, i'll just give an example. if someone walks up to me and says ""you know what, my roommate keeps stealing my thoughts and he keeps poisoning my food"" i say ""you really don't feel safe right now, you feel targeted"" they would continue on, and i would continue to reflect back the feelings i'm hearing, not exactly the thoughts. so the fear, the lack of trust, the anxiety, the pain. that's the only way you can get to a place where you can say, well, what would be helpful for you, or maybe we can do this, e.t.c. in your case, going to your husband and saying you're not thinking straight, you need to see a doctor or trying to deny his thoughts as real and logical . . . well . . . it's more of an attack and that can only worsen the trust. obviously that's not how you mean it, but because he is where he is, he will only see it as a force against him. you could work the conversation to a point where you can ask him what he thinks you two can do to help this situation, and ask him if he would feel comfortable talking to someone about trust issues or his fear or his anxiety. sometimes a change in environment and a change of the people around us can make a huge difference, with or without doctor involvement. i know it's a lot and it takes time and patience. i'm not saying be his new counselor, i'm just saying try and see past the ""unreal"" side of what he says, and see the real feelings behind it. whether or not the feelings come from something that exists or doesn't, they're still there and they're very real, so they need to be attended to and treated just like anyone else's feelings. i hope things go well for you two, it's a long road. i like living in the world in my head because i'm in charge half the time.",2379,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"fear that i'm becoming delusional maybe this sounds odd. but here's the story. my best friend is someone i met online. we've been friends for 7 years. but sometimes, when i get in a fight with my mom, and the fight gets really bad...well, if i text/message my friend and she doesn't reply soon or quickly enough, i start thinking she hates me. i never told her about my worries...until last week. my mom had been really difficult. i got in the car and started driving just to get away. so then i started texting my best friend and it was fine at first. but then i'd look at my phone and see a hurtful text from my mom. i would ignore the text and then another buzz would come. it'd be my mom again. every time i saw a text from my mom, i started believing my best friend didn't want to talk to me. i don't know why. but by the time i drove back home (4 hours later), i sent my friend a text. then i went inside and my mom yelled at me. i went back to the car and my friend still hadn't responded. i really didn't know what to do, because my car is super old and is not designed to drive around for that long. it was started to overheat and i was freaking out pretty badly. but eventually i went back inside again and went to my room. after some heated exchanges, my mom finally stopped yelling for a bit. i was so angry and convinced that my best friend didn't give a crap about me. then she texted me back. i have since deleted our conversation, but i responded with something like, ""nevermind. i know you don't care anyway. you don't have to pretend anymore."" she was extremely surprised by that. i said, ""i know you hate talking to me. i know that you sigh whenever you see a text from me. you're always hoping the next text will be the last. i just wish you would stop pretending. i wish you would stop lying to me."" i truly didn't mean to hurt her feelings when i was texting these awful things. at the time, i really believed what i was saying was true. i was mad because i was convinced she hated talking to me and stopped wanting to be my friend years ago. i then went to bad and texted her the next day that my sanity was getting lower and i would try to explain what happened later, but for now i'm sorry. we have since worked it out. i'm now able to look back on the situation and i believe her. i believe that she cares for me. and i'm disappointed in myself for doubting her. and i'm extremely grateful for how understanding she has been. i don't deserve a friend like her, and i hate that i took my frustrations out on her. but i am now worried that these times where i convince myself she hates me will become more and more frequent. i almost ended our friendship that night. i'm a lucky son of a gun to have a friend who doesn't even get mad at me for behaving like that. but how could i prevent it from happening again? why did this happen? - - - - - here are some ""highlights"" of the conversation that happened the day after the texts: friend: if i didn't enjoy your company anymore i wouldn't tell you you're one of the most important people in my life & regularly try to reaffirm how much i care about you. why do you call me a liar? why do you accuse me of pretending? what would i gain from this? what incentive do i have for what i say or do, other tha, sincerity? is that really what you think of me? a liar & pretender who is a fake friend & only sticks around because- what? the views? the lols? i'm sorry i haven't been able to convey my appreciation for you. i'm sorry i'm so bad at words & feelings & at getting up in the morning & holding conversations. but i can't think of anything i've done that has earned the accusations you launched at me yesterday/today. me: part of what drove me to write such extreme texts is because i couldn't stand it anymore. i couldn't stand not knowing and i still can't stand not knowing. i can't stand being unsure of what relationships are real and which are fake. i can't believe that anyone cares, not even you. and it's nothing you did. i just hate this hope that feels so false. i hate the feeling. when i originally read this message, i was happy. i was happy that you said ""i can't think of anything i've done that has earned the accusations you launched at me yesterday/today."" because that means i really am being unreasonable and that means that my insecurities are not justified. that there really isn't any reason for me to feel the way that i do, and that maybe my worries really are for nothing. if i made a false accusation, that means maybe you don't hate me. or at least you haven't done anything that should make me think you do. it's not worth it.",2384,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

"practical advice erotomanic delusion disorder hi sister's keeper, i agree with herculeanhercules, medication is essential, and for me the longer my delusions went untreated the harder they are to rebound and recover from. it is impossible to forget the memories of the delusions that set in when i got sick after the birth of my daughter in 2005, that were treated long enough to clear a break, but then slowly crept into my memory bank. for me, medication is essential. the only type of therapy that i believe in other than taking an antipsychotic is love based community oriented therapy where people who love you share their truth. this is extremely hard to overcome - erotomania. sometimes even 11 years later i still have emotional feelings in response to the deeply seated memories i developed in my postpartum - i believed my physician loved me an was sending me secret messages in the form of wrong number phone calls. it took writing my truth in the form of a book that is ""fiction based on a true story"" i mean, how can you write a delusional memoir without calling it fiction? it also took releasing it into the world, years of continuous and rational choice to take medication and live in the reality people say is true, and the love and support of my friends and family to share their perception regarding my story. they couldn't understand my story when i tried to explain it in conversation, it was too challenging. so i learned to write. i spent 10 years crafting my story. i still take medication every day, and will probably need it for the rest of my life. today, i understand that the physician will never love me, and that my experience was a natural response to the trauma of an exam during childbirth, and the isolation i felt in a rural community. for me, learning to accept my illness was heart breaking, realizing you are delusional is very upsetting. the disillusionment of it is devastating, but i lived through it to live in recovery which for me is the desire to stay in reality with the people around me. the people who love me read ""i'm not sick and i don't need help"". they joined the national alliance of mental illness, and took the family to family course (which helped them learn how to help themselves and me). as for how you decide to live your life, that is a decision only you can make, because you have to be able to live with whatever you decide is best. hugs, sunny ""i trust that if i start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -sunnyg",2387,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"are these dd symptoms... i've been accused of cheating since marriage and at first, i chalked it up as normal jealousy like all of my buddies talked about but they are all divorced now and ironically, i'm still the one married that never cheated and puts up with all of the accusations still because i love my wife for better or worse. i've thought about leaving and i decided to move out for a few months to see if a break would wake her back up to reality but that just led her into depression until i returned. since then, she promised to get help and do whatever it takes and acknowledged she has a problem. i never knew to how pervasive her thoughts were because she acts so normal until we go out and have drinks. she can't go out without drinking or she is anxious and bored and if she has one too many, the night goes from fun to accusations and conspiracy theories over anything i do! then i find out all about the thoughts she has been having all month that make her believe i'm cheating. anything can trigger these accusations and her logic behind everything never makes any sense and the next day she breaks down and cries and apologizes and realizes her story is so far fetched! then i forgive her..we make up and go on with our life until the next time we go out. the problem is, she can't stop these thoughts from entering her mind throughout the day but she doesn't react to them until we go out to a bar, club, party or even on vacation where we are around other people. it doesn't matter where we go, it could be all the way to cancun and if we meet some random nice couple and start to socialize, out of no where, i'm accused of personally knowing them and setting up this whole trip in order to meet them and make her look stupid. i've had to cancel trips and make up excuses why we leave friends parties or events as soon as i get accused of something. at first, i thought all girls were like this that are insecure but we've been married 25 years now and it's obvious to me not everyone is going through this much. so basically, we have no friends left because i've pretty much given up on trying to salvage any types of relationships. i've been living in a bubble like her, only focusing on work and family. i go straight to work and home and have gotten off facebook. no one knows or seems to care why because they think we are probably stuck up by now. no matter what i have done to prove my innocence, the issue still persists but we are now trying everything possible with natural remedies instead of prescription drugs. she is totally on board to try anything because she realizes now more than ever when others and our own kids have had to correct her accusations about me. one time, she thought i was up in a vip section of the club laughing and mingling with a group and when i showed up behind her after returning from the restroom, she was totally shocked how i could go from upstairs in the vip right behind her!! she thinks i'm a magician!!! she still tells me it's not rational but her mind still tries to figure out how i did that trick! another time, i decided to wear my punk rock ring i haven't worn for over 10 years out to the club and she thought some sort of mistress at the club gave it to me as a message to her and got so upset! she said i never owned that ring and thankfully, we took pictures of ourselves before leaving the house that night and when she saw the ring on my finger in the picture, she broke down crying and felt stupid!!!! but guess what!! soon after she still tried to figure out if i pulled another stunt to trick her!! like i wore it on purpose to make her think that way! i don't really want to give up going out, having friends and having a social life and we both enjoy traveling but it's like playing russian roullette planning, getting all excited, buying tickets, airfare, etc just to end up fighting and leaving, losing the money and feeling frustrated once more. i know one thing is for sure, alcohol does not help with this problem! she does not react to these thoughts all month, but when we go out and drink, she has no power over them and everything comes out and i never know what the trigger is going to be so i'm always on egg shells and can't be myself but then it's not right because it's perfectly ok for her to talk to others and laugh but if i do...something is up. no one knows she has this problem i'm dealing with because she covers it up really good in public but will start accusing me in my ear or with a look or pinch and that's when i know it's time to leave because i've tried reasoning with her and it just escalates. she doesn't trust me or anyone else when these thoughts occur and thinks everyone is laughing at her. is this delusional disorder or is there more to them?",2412,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"my first post hi everyone! this is my first time finding this site and finding out about dd. i was researching online just trying to understand what my wife is going through mentally so i can be more helpful and this really sounds like what she might have. we haven't seen anyone about this but 10 years ago we did try a marriage counselor and all the female counselor did was reinforce her beliefs that i must be cheating because her beliefs sound real. we got married at 18 and have been married over 25 years. we were h.s. sweethearts and everything was good except the occasional jealousy and insecurities i thought was normal. it's kept getting worse over the years and it's been hard dealing with the jealousy, conspiracies, panic attacks, anxiety and isolation from friends and family because of it. i guess the warning signs were always there but i always thought her jealousy and insecurities were just normal so i tried to do everything possible like setting up gps on my phone so she knows where i am at all times! going to the gym at lunch so i have no life outside working hours! i will even give her my phone in a moments notice if i'm accused of anything. we do practically everything together! i mean, if you saw our life on facebook, you'll see that we are inseparable and always doing stuff together which would be great if i didn't also have to isolate myself from everyone. i certainly love being with my wife and all of the fun activities we do, but the problem is whenever we meet others, it triggers her jealousy and conspiracy thoughts against everyone. for example, we can travel all the way to cancun and end up meeting a really nice couple but somehow i know them and planned this entire trip to meet them and didn't tell her! one time i signed us up for a party bus tour in vegas and the hostess recognized my name over the phone and came over and said ""hi, i'm the one you talked to on the phone"" and the night was ruined from the start! all of the sudden, i knew her personally and it's all a setup and she felt stupid thinking we are trying to fool her so we end up in a big fight and ditch the tour. i keep trying with my wife because i love her but it gotten to the point with money and accusations that i'm at a breaking point. i'm damned if i do and damned if i don't because no matter what i give up, there's always a new accusation. i must have a secret phone she doesn't know about! i have spent so much money on vacations that we cancel as a result and have to be so careful and refrain from talking to any strangers or it's a conspiracy! it's been hard on me and i know that she literally can't help it. she is suffering with these thoughts and will break down crying and apologizing the next day and it hurts me because i can't help her and i suffer from the frustration and pain i feel with the one i love not being able to trust me and the frustration i feel having to give up a life outside of our relationship too. no one knows about this struggle because we both hide these issues and just conveniently leave parties and events by making up some other excuse but the real reason is that my wife just came over and questioned my whereabouts when i had to go to the bathroom. i've learned that it's better to leave without fighting by getting her out of there asap instead of things escalating into more serious accusations that i upset me even more. we've had too many nights where we were lucky to make it home so now we just show up and leave just to make our presence known. sometimes i think the night is going so well we stay later but all it takes is one too many drinks for her to bring out everything shes been holding in the entire week or month i had no clue about! i have left her once for a few months just to see if a break would help and that just put her into depression. since then, she has acknowledged her problem and has opened up to me much more about it and i've been shocked and hurt to find out some things she has been thinking about she deals with these conspiracy thoughts on a regular basis but i never notice until we go out. i like to have fun and socialize and drink, gamble, dance, etc but that's when the real problems come out because i never know what the trigger is going to be tonight! she is the type that can't have fun without drinks or she'll just be bored but if she drinks one too many, her conspiracy thoughts spiral out of control and we have to leave before it gets worse! anyways, we are trying natural remedies because i seriously do not want my wife on drug care. has anyone ever found any natural remedies that actually work?",2413,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"delusional jealousy - so tired of it i've been dealing with delusional jealousy with my wife for almost 3 years. we have 3 kids (17, 15, 8 ) so it's been stressful trying to maintain a sense of normalcy for them while living with the chaos of this illness. we've been married almost 24 years. we have been through both counseling and psychiatric care. the counselor and psychiatrist both agree that my wife has delusional jealousy and she was given medications: risperdal - seemed to help a little but caused weight gain so she quit taking it. seroquil - turned my wife into a zombie. the doctor never could find a level that didn't almost make her catatonic. she couldn't function as a parent in this state. she hasn't been on any medications for about 2 years now and refuses to attend counseling because in her view the last counselor was on my side because i paid the bill. i've encouraged her to find a different counselor but she refuses and it won't do any good if i find another one. all of the counseling in the world won't help if she just adds each counselor that doesn't agree with her to the idiot list. there is at least one difference between our problem and most of those i have read here (and elsewhere). my wife's delusional jealousy does not involve accusations of infidelity. she doesn't accuse me of sexual relationships with other women but instead accuses me of looking at other women. now, mind you, when my wife says ""looking"" it sounds like a sex act. it's hard to put down in words just how debilitating this issue is. i've made major changes to my life to reduce her stress as much as possible like dropping my ymca membership (women there), tv (women), woodworking magazines (a few women there), the newspaper (yep, women there too). when i drive to work (3 mile residential type driving) she calls me on the way and asks me how many women i have looked at. she picks out women we see regularly in the neighborhood as my ""friends"". she's not accusing me of having sex with them, just leering at them. she even picks out women at church that i am supposed to be leering at. and to really twist the knife she usually points out some other guy (just like me) and says ""joe, wasn't looking at other women"". my most cruel experience with dj was when my father was in the hospital last summer close to death (end stage alzheimer's) and i had to stay in the hospital with him. in addition to the stress of my father being near death i had to hear constantly from my wife about ""what women are you looking at"". i also was expected to drive the back roads from my city to my father's so that i wouldn't see any billboards with women on them. our families have been of no help. my family believes that ""i let my wife behave this way"", even though she is mentally ill. her side doesn't know at all and even though i think my mother-in-law would understand and help my wife doesn't want them to know. i'm reaching the end of my patience, my wife seems to be getting progressively worse. i have stuck around in what is a toxic situation for me to allow my children to live with both parents but it's getting to the point where i think the children would be better off with us apart. i would love to hear from anyone who has had experience with delusional jealousy not involving accusations of infidelity.",2414,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"delusional jealousy i have been in a similiar situation, and am brokenhearted. i met the man of my dreams over two years ago after being a single mom for years. he was everything i had dreamed about - tall, goodlooking, tender, hard working, family oriented. we became engaged, and right after that problems started. he accused me of looking at men no matter where we went or what we did. i would reassure him that i looked at everbody when we were out - men, women, children. normal to do when out in public - you look at the world around you! he would say i stared at them, and they stared back. he said some would look at him and smirk or wink. he mistrusted everone, and analyzed to the nth degree everything everyone said or did. it became so bad i was afraid to lift my head in public. even that was not enough. we started going to counseling, first him alone and then us together. when the counselors just talked to him, they seemed to think he had a legimitate view. but when they heard the other side, they started to see things differently, which made him angry. he was convinced i somehow had dazzled them to my way of thinking. he has absolutly no insight to the condition, and refuses to even consider it. he never accused me of actually being unfaithful, only looking at men. but he carries it to the next step inside and thinks that i will someday. i love him with my whole heart, and could never think of another man. but i don't think he will ever get that. we have been living like this quite awhile. he has left a couple of times before, and left again this week. even though this relationship has caused me so much anguish, i can not seem to let go. i keep chasing the dreams i had when i first met him. i think this leaving may be different though - he has been out of contact and very cold. so maybe that is what it will take - for him to end it. i don't think i am strong enough to - no matter how much i read about it, and the negative prognosis, i can not seem to believe it.",2420,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"is this psychosis? i have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and i've read that people with this disorder can have psychotic symptoms. i've been briefly part of the tumblr community, but from what i've read of those posts, none of those people seem to have psychotic symptoms; or, if they have, they don't talk about them. i find that a bit weird, because i struggle a lot with psychotic symptoms. i've had four psychotic episodes in the last three years. to summarize: i was certain i was a dead famous personality; i was certain i was a completely different person that travelled in time from the 19th century; i was certain i had multiple personalities and i showed signs of personality dissociation, according to my therapist; i was certain a person in my life wanted to harm me. aside from that, i also have hallucinations. they are minor, just shadows i see and sometimes when i look back when i'm walking i see people that aren't there. occasionally i have terrible hallucinations of monsters jumping towards me and i hear things that aren't there. i've never heard voices in my head (except for the time when i thought i had dissociative personality disorder). my therapist and my psychiatrist never told me if this is psychosis. i've never really discussed these episodes with them (except for the third one), and they never gave me a diagnosis for these symptoms. they only gave me the borderline diagnosis after i pushed them for it, because i fit the entire criteria for the disorder, but, while my therapist diagnosed me, my psychiatrist was reluctant because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. i'm asking this because i was wondering if i should get a separated diagnosis for psychosis. these episodes are frequent, they last for months and sometimes i have delusions even when i am on medication.",2433,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"am i delusional? belief in a religious concept does not make you delusional. what you have described so far seems typical and commonplace among witches. however, such a thing could easily turn into a delusion sinply because religous beliefs cannot be proven with hard facts. here are aome helpful stepa i follow to check my religious beliefs against delusions: 1. if you can find scientific facts to prove any part of it, do it. be mindful, however, of hindsight bias. once you've researched something it is easier to convince yourself you knew these things in advance (past life memories). 2. ask yourself if what you believe has any logic to it. what are the moat unbelievable parts? does your religious community as a whole also believe these things? are they part of a core doctrine or just specific to you. how did you decide to believe this? if it seems illogical what experiences have you had to confirm your beliefs? how possible is it that these experiences are imagined? did they happen here and now or in another time? is there any physical proof of your experience? 3. how do your beliefs affect your life? how do they affect the world around you? since you atarted believing these things have you or your peers been negatively affected? 4. the last suggestion i have is something you won't want to hear and probably won't believe. having come from a history of witchcraft, i find that the beat way to ward off major symptoms of mental illness is through prayer, worship, and study of the bible. it has helped me greatly. might be worth a shot if you feel yourself slip too far into the dark.",2440,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"how to achieve a realisation in a delusional disorder person i need advice on how to care for my mother who has been diagnosed with delusional disorder. she is confused and does not understand that she is mentally ill. the head psychiatrist told me that people with this illness can't realise that what they are experiencing is not reality, although some can achieve it if they are on medication, undergoing therapy and are 'lucky'. we were also told we can't tell her she is unwell or it will break up her relationship with that person, and she will always resent them for it as she will probably always believe it was real. to be honest, the health system that are helping us have been extremely unhelpful and we are really struggling. my mother has not been eating or sleeping well for a while and is under constant surveillance from the family. although she is not panicking like she used to about the voices she hears and the facts that they tell her are true, she is adamant that she is not unwell. unfortunately her social worker included me in the conversation of persuading her to take medication. however she has not turned her back on me as a result so far, which she was doing if we said that something was what it was-and not what she thinks it is. as she is not a danger to herself she has to come to some sort of realisation to accept psychotic medication or accept going into the hospital ward again. she did agree to medication when faced with the social workers persuasion, but then quickly went back on it because she doesn't think she is ill. does anyone know if they can come to realise that they are ill? the head psychiatrist said it as if it is brain chemistry but i can see some people in this community know that it's not real by themselves. i'm wondering if it is chemical or psychological. it's been about a month and we haven't had any evidence or any proof that these 'stalkers' planting things and posting things online exist and are doing what they say they are doing, to her. our assigned long term planner won't get back to us on a plan for my mother and the social worker hasn't got back to us after my mother said she would take them. which now she decided she won't. i don't want to loose the bond i have with my mother and i'm scared that while my family are seeking advice on how to deal with this situation, and not tell her she is ill, something will go wrong, and i might loose that bond. any help would be appreciated. thanks.",2447,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

(he destroyed his phone in a fire). he said that he found my card heartbreaking because he needed me to be honest about the ""barriers to trust"" and never wanted to talk to me again. i don't know, but i'm guessing that he wanted me to confess to things that i didn't do. that was almost 2 weeks ago and i have not heard from him since. i feel so heartbroken and am at a loss as to what to do. it seems like reaching out to him makes things worse but i'm having such a hard time letting go because i love him so much. does he really mean it when he says he never wants to talk to me again? will i really never hear from him again? will the distance from me help to dislodge me from his delusional system? is there anything i can do to offer him my support when he has cut me out of his life like this? i'm already doing everything i know to do to take care of myself but am still having such a hard time. i would greatly appreciate support and any words of wisdom because this really is so difficult for me.",2452,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

[note: this post is lengthy because it provides background information and clarification on the question at hand but please take the time to bother to read it anyways.] hello i am new to this forum and have decided to join because i would like advice from other people pertaining to delusional disorder. i suffer from both bizarre and non bizarre delusions including believing in telepathy(bizarre) and believing people are out to get me (non-bizarre). i have not been officially diagnosed with delusional disorder but i have been having delusions for about 4-5 years. my delusions include believing people can telepathically read my thoughts which would be classified as bizarre delusions as they are considered impossible and unlikely to happen. my other delusions have been thinking people are out to get me,have ill intent,or have said things behind my back which are considered non bizarre as they have the possibility to happen... i do not know if my symptoms truly mean i have delusional disorder as i may be misinterpreting the information of delusional disorder incorrectly but it appears i have it... moving along...the reason why i am so self aware despite my psychosis is due to my rational mind and belief in science which assures me that telepathy is not possible since there has been no proof of telepathy being possible.the only ""proof"" that has ever been given on telepathy has come from pseudo scientific studies.meaning people who claim to be scientists and who claim to have proof which in reality isn't proof at all. so thanks to my highly rational scientific mind i am able to realize i am delusional. however the delusions have made my brain develop a pattern of irrational thinking which causes me to be very psychotic despite this realization.basically the irrational pattern of thinking caused by my psychosis overpowers my rational personality which is why i'm self aware yet psychotic. thankfully thanks to my rational mind i am at least capable of realizing i have a problem and despite not being able to cope i have decided to go to therapy to unravel my irrational thinking or at the very least get anti psychotic medication... which brings me to my next statement...i have to wait a couple of years until i can get therapy and antipsychotic medications...i have a hard time making social connections due to my paranoid persecutory paranoid thoughts and due to my overall psychosis which means i lack a support group... whilst i wait for the ability to go to therapy and take my antipsychotic medications i want to cope,in a relatively healthy way,with the delusions i have so i can socialize and be a regular happy person. so i have thought about drinking when i am the legal age for drinking in my area. as i plan to self medicate for the social anxiety i have by becoming a social drinker whilst i wait for therapy i am left wondering if healthy,controlled,self medication with alcohol is possible for delusional disorder... i am not stating in any shape way or form that i plan to become a alcoholic or refuse therapy/treatment for my delusional disorder. i fully plan and intend to get therapy and medications for my mental illness so i will not harm myself or others and so i can live a healthy happy life. i also plan to drink responsibly as it is my responsibility to do no harm to myself or others. however i am stating that i am considering self medicating with alcohol in a responsible manner to cope with delusions whilst i wait for therapy.not now but when i am legally allowed to drink alcohol. i would drink responsibly and have no intent on getting excessively drunk only enough to ""take off the edge"". with my background and intentions in mind now clarified that leads me to my actual question. can i use alcohol,responsibly of course,to cope with delusions,in a safe controlled environment,whilst i am waiting for the opportunity to gain enough money to get therapy and/or anti-psychotic medications? meaning... will alcohol be able to help me cope with delusions? i am not sure if it would help but i would like some opinions from other people...please and thank you",2462,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
"coping with delusional disorder? hello since for some reason you are unable to get psych help from a professional i would recomend going to support groups for depression or anxiety, you stated that you have some social anxiety. the groups are free and you could probably find something in your area. also you could call the suicide hotline and ask for free mental health programs in your area if that is something you would be able to do. as for self medication with alcohol, i dont recomend it. it can make the delusions worse and when your not intoxicated you could become depressed. also even though you have the intent to not get drunk, when you are out with friends it is hard to stop and know your limits, especially since you will be new to drinking and social drinking. if you start relying on alcohol to control your anxiety then it would be very easy for your drinking to get out of hand. remember no one has the intent to become an alcoholic the drinking just gets out of hand. i have some similar issues with persicutory delusions and social anxiety and i found that when i drank i would just be more likely to talk to people about my beliefs and be more openly passionate about what i know is true and what everyone else knows is false. that could get you into trouble socially, people will most likely not be kind when rejecting your viewpoint and then when your not drunk or under the influence you will have to address what you said and how you acted and try to back peddle to try and convince that person that you are not crazy if you would like for them to still accept you into their social circle. i commend you for reaching out on this forum and for having such incite into your beliefs as such a young age. i feel that professional help would be the best option. you can always talk to me whenever you need.",2463,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"any suggestions on how to help someone who thinks they are normal??? my husband was recently diagnosed with delusional disorder (after years of wierd behavior and me and my family knowing something was way off) he never can see how odd his behavior is and thinks it is all me and not him. about 3 years ago he started in on researching a ""plot"" my dad and i were in on since before my husband and i were even married...he insists we did a ""real estate scam"" on him...and that my dad is a pedifile (or however you spell it) and has been abusing me since i was 5 up until current ...it is so disgusting the things my husband comes up with. he has outbursts and out of control anger - thinks it is totally justified because of ""all the things we have done to him"". he is up all night long on the internet compiling his ""evidence against me"" - he was up all night thursday and still on he computer when i got up. other times he goes to bed at 5am and gets up at 2 in the afternoon. a few mos ago he was having chest pains. i figured it was anziety or depression. after 4 days he felt a bit better. in the middle of the night he left to go to tucson to visit a friend. on facebook i saw him post that he felt like he was going to die due to sever chest pains. i told him ""well, if you had told me you were going i would have said to wait - not a good idea to make a long drive when you are having chest pains"" and he got all mad at me about it. i told him to go to the hospital (which he did 2 days after getting to tucson) he had a lot of fluid around his heart which was drained (they said 2 more days he may have died) so i drove out there and arrived at 5 am - his surgery was at 8. he started yelling at me and they had to give him valium before the surgery to calm him down. 5 days later he told me to get the ""f"" out of his room (he was yelling about the real estate scam he thinks i did) and then later that day on the phone he threatened me and the nurse heard it. they involuntarily admitted him to the mental hospital which is where the phychiatrist told me they diagnosed him with delusional disorder. any suggestions on how to get him to see he needs help?",2464,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"any suggestions on how to help someone who thinks they are i totally agree that having a diagnosis is such a relief, even if it is like a death sentence for a relationship. my now ex was diagnosed with ddj back in 2003. it began with the accusation, out of nowhere, that i was having a lesbian affair, then the accusations spread to my co-workers, friends, and ultimately to almost every female i came in contact with. i kept patiently asking for his reasoning saying, ""please help me to understand why you're thinking these things?""... his response was, ""i can tell by the way you look at them""... i asked for an example of ""the look"" and what i got was the most rediculous example, it was a look you'd see an actor having in a movie where they come upon a beautiful oasis after spending a week in the middle of an arabian dessert. get the picture? the sad part is that this is what he saw in his mind. he even accused me of possibly having our new born artifically inseminated by the brother of one of my alleged lesbian mates in order to have a child close to her dna. yes, i had just given birth to our 4th child 3 months before this craziness was dumped on me. over time i became somewhat callous, and perhaps a little cynical, it was my only defense mechanism for the emotional pain i was feeling. i was beyond pissed, i was bitter, just plain bitter. why did my loving husband become a monster? this was the first and only man i had ever been with.... we met when i was 17 and he was 20 back in 1980. i didn't know anyone who had this sort of situation to talk to, i only wish i had come upon this site back then. at the time i felt so alone. what hurt most was that he believed all his accusations beyond a shadow of a doubt. i remember telling my counselor how i'd like to trade places with him so that he could feel the pain he was causing me... he quickly interrupted my thoughts and said, ""don't ever say that again, there is no greater pain than what he's feeling as a prisoner of ddj."" as for help, good luck in convincing him that he needs it... like you, my then husband was 100% sure that i was the one that needed help. in his mind, the only reason the psychiatrists we saw suggested he needed intense therapy for his delusions and meds for his paranoia and depression, is because i paid them to say that... so unfortunately, if your husband truly does have a delusional disorder, you're probably in the same boat... which is why i am now divorced and raising four children practically on my own. through the grace of god, i've grown accustomed to my ""new normal"" life. at first i thought i'd never be happy again... don't get me wrong, i still miss the beautiful, loving, man i married and loved with all my heart, but holding on to the past doesn't let me appreciate all the wonderful things i still have. through faith, i know i'll see his beautiful smile and sweet eyes again.... but not in this lifetime. i hope your situation will be the exception to the rule. if you do find a way to get through to him please let the rest of us know. god bless and good luck. ~ beautiful mind",2467,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"how can i help a delusional person? i can't quiet belive it has taken me so long to finally accept that my husband is suffering from some type of delusional disorder. his behaviour has been odd for years ranging from the the bizarre to the ridiculous. he firmly believed the police, or people connected to the police were following and harassing him for years. the phone , house and car were all bugged . people driving cars with high beam lights were part of the conspiracy. according to my husband we were followed around the supermarket, by the family and friends of police officers , we were even followed on holiday. when i tried to address these beliefs he got angry and accused me of being naive and stupid. it finally came to a head after about three years and i tried to talk to him about dd , he went wild , shouting , aggressive accusing me of wanting to get him sectioned. he flatly refused to get help or talk to anyone about his problems. however following a visit to jamaica some months later, he told me he had spoken to a doctor and he was feeling better. i asked him if he still held his beliefs about being followed and he said no. i wasn't entirely convinced but gave him the benefit of the doubt he refused to discuss the issue again . now another year later it's started again. this time the paranoia appears to be about me. he says i'm playing a game , trying to trap him but the things / signs that alert him to this attack are just strange and seemingly have no logic whatsoever . here are three recent examples that show him i'm conspiring against him 1. me showing him a dog related video on you tube 2. me wearing my rucksack on both shoulders 3. me pretending to have a slight knee injury and limping slightly ( in my defence this last accusation follows a 13 k run i did yesterday as i'm training for a half marathon). he won't or can't explain the significance of these things , but they make him anxious and angry and i'm the lightning rod for all the delusions. i just hope they don't escalate , he has never been violent but i worry that he's getting much worse. i'm at the end of my tether i've had enough. nothing i say or do seems to help , he either refuses flat out to see the doctor or screams and shouts at me. he says i have a mental health condition because i cry and i'm down and depressed. well yes i suppose i am depressed about living with him and his delusions for so many years. i am finally giving up on him , the house is up for sale and i want a divorce after 22 years. my life is not my own and i'm on edge all the time , i now need some respite from all this pain and misery his condition has brought to our family. i do still feel for him and i know living with his condition must be hard and a daily struggle , but i now feel like it's either him or me .. and as irvine welsh so profoundly wrote ' i choose life' . this board is lifesaver by the way, i thought for years this was my fault , or something to do with me not being kind or loving enough , but i now realise my experience is not unique and i'm not to blame it's just a horrible , destructive illness. thanks to everyone brave enough to post your words have helped me immeasurably.",2475,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"interview with psychologist lloyd ross about delusions psychologist lloyd ross and i just put together this interview about working with delusions, hallucinations, and other issues commonly labeled ""schizophrenic"": https://www.madinamerica.com/2017/02/un ... loyd-ross/ lloyd has a particular approach which he described in this way: quote: ""over the last 40 years i saw approximately 150 people who could be considered schizophrenic because they were having delusions and hallucinations, i.e. they had a serious break with reality. some of these therapies were very brief because they didn’t accept that i don’t use medication, which i always explained in the first session... now out of these 150 people whom i saw over 40 years, probably about 100 of them accepted my non-medication approach. the large majority of these stayed in treatment for at least one year, and many stayed for between three to five years or more...most of the people i consulted with chose to try working without medication, which was often because they or their parents didn’t like what the medications were doing to them... with somebody who was experiencing symptoms that the profession labels schizophrenic, such as having hallucinations, delusions, or being very paranoid, i would usually see them 3-5 times per week over a period of at least two years. many of these schizophrenic clients were young people undergoing life transitions — these life transitions, like leaving home and going to college, often cause a stress that brings up earlier trauma and can cause a break with reality in a vulnerable person. but i also saw some older clients whose life stresses had precipitated a break. i worked intensively with them because psychotic conditions are very serious and require intensive help. "" we also discussed his success with the group that stayed over the longer term: quote: ""the large majority of them get much better. i’d say 85-90% of the schizophrenic men and women who stayed in therapy at least two years got well to the point of being able to go to school, to work, to function in a meaningful, personally satisfying way, and to be involved in relationships. probably a majority of these got married and had families. sometimes their functioning was a bit awkward but they still functioned. for example, a young man who had been psychotic might date or marry the quiet, shy girl rather than the girl who was the life of the party. but they could still have a meaningful intimate relationship and become good parents. so yes, for most people diagnosed with schizophrenia, if they get effective help they get better. they go out into the world and function, and most often they don’t become severely psychotic again. in the early part of the work, what happens a lot of times is that as a psychotic person starts to function better, the voices reoccur; but they’re not as disturbing anymore, they’re okay. later on, if the person more fully works through their issues, these symptoms can completely or mostly go away. or they still occur but don’t bother the person much at all, because they’re much stronger emotionally."" and then we discussed many other issues like the biogenetic model, how to understand hallucinations as meaningful phenomena, some trauma in lloyd's own history, lloyd's views on nami and the business of psychiatry (may be controversial). etc. i hope you will check it out.",2480,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"what is litmus test for delusional disorder or schizophrenia well, i'm not quite sure what the difference is between delusional disorder and schizophrenia. i thought that they could all be classified under schizophrenia. what i'd like to know is if there is some way of identifying, some way of testing someone in some casual conversation to find out if they have a major psychotic problem. like example if i said, what would you do or think or feel about such and such a thing. the idea being, can i find some general loose connection in her circuits. the purpose of which would be to help her cure her problem or prove to her that she has a weakness and should go see someone. here are the circumstances. my friend seems so absolutely normal in so many ways. she has many problems in her life and seems to be busy solving them, though in a different manner than i would, but she does solve her problems. at the same time, she strongly advocates conspiracy theories, that she is being monitored, that she has devices planted in her and that the government is harboring aliens from another world, that so much of everything is psychic and numerous other types of thoughts of what appear to me to be competely delusional. and she could tell i'm skeptical and asks me why i don't believe her. the thing is that so much of her seems absoutely normal and then there's a part of her that seems completely psychotic. if anyone here met her, the first impression would be that this is a wonderful woman etc. but when she starts going into all this crazy stuff then you'd think different. it's no use getting her to see someone because she is tremendously proud and strongly arrogant in what she believes and even finds it an insult that i question her beliefs in these things. then to prove that she is right, she goes to youtube and shows me the lying conspiracy assholes who put up nothing but false information. i constantly tell her that such broadcasters never give true facts but take only circumstantial facts and incorrectly draw them together in wrong conclusions. these youtubers also have no one to answer to for the truth of their facts. at least the standard media have bosses to answer to and other media organizations to answer to when they are wrong and will be publicly humiliated or fired if so proven. well, she doesn't really get it and says that she won't believe a word of what the standard media says. in the old days, people used to call this type of normal and abnormal behavior monomania where you could seem so normal and wonderful on one side and totally psychotic on another side. later on psychologists and psychiatrists realized that if these types of people were further tested you would find out inadequacies across the board and the term monomania was stopped and i guess schizophrenia or other names were used. so is there some way that by casual conversation i can do a litmus test and get to the root of her disorder to find out what circuits are loose for the purpose of helping her or getting her to see someone.",2484,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

(asset inventory was my idea based on my previous dealings with lawyers for my parents) the extended family wants to convince my parents to get an independent legal guardianship. they came down to visit them on the auspice of taking care of my mother during what should have been a routine cataract surgery but due to her senility and mostly her personality it was a mess. i first stormed out on them. they brought it up again and i was really raw due to caring for my mother so i must have agreed i would consider it. sister is wealthy and she paid for some in-home care over the weekend until my interview. she was already asking to speak to my doctor and i won't allow. i have not left my parents yet since mother's surgery but i am not proud of this, i blocked my mother's sisters phone number on her phone because what i am reading about legal representative for seniors scares me. >in most cases the process will start with a determination whether the alleged incapacitated person is actually incapacitated. there will often be an evidentiary hearing and determination of whether guardian is necessary and who guardian would be. >in some cases a guardianship dispute could become quite contentious....essentially a pre-probate dispute over parents' wealth. my mother's personality at this point is really also that she wishes someone would run her life. i am currently executor to parents' estate but as mentioned estate planning is really slim for them. i'm in a catch-22 because rather than keep outplaying money to me my family may only be convinced to set up a trust, for example, if i use extended family as a mediator, but they are also being sneaky about their intentions and i would have to accept their ""help"" of ""get a legal guardian for them"". one relative involved probated a distant cousin's will for their money. so i guess to continue along this line of rational? thought, first they will want to say my parents are incapacitated and next they come after me!? also why should my parents assets be any of their business, but also since my parents have few contacts and trust few people it's their ""worst best hope"". i rarely belly ache woe is me life's not fair anymore. (i used to runaway a lot as a teen) at some point i believe you quit blaming your parents and live your life. but it seems like every time i try to make a foray at something they are in crisis and i have to help, see lawyers, accountants, estate planners for them and it messes me up. i'm still young. lately i've taken to buying things to cope. i don't know what to do it's not a medical issue, it's legal but if i can't get a handle on myself and i succumb to this i'm worse off i just kind of want to avoid this and wish it weren't happening.....",2509,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"alzheimer's with grandma hi people, i just wanted to share a bit of my experience with people who have had alzheimer's. my grandma had it, and she lived with us. over the course of about 7-10 years it kept getting worse. at the end, she was mute and bedridden. before she got so bad she used to argue with me and my parents about everything. she despised me though, since i lived in the room right across from her. she told me i was stealing from her, when later the stuff was found in her closet and she denied it being there. it's very difficult to work with an alzheimer's person, especially when they're not on medication for it. my grandma would throw away her medications. mum and i found them in the trash. right before she died she was in a nursing home. then one night at about 2am they called telling us that her lips were turning blue and a lot of other things - and they asked what to do about it. mum said ""get her to the er now!"". we got there soon after. she was in horrible shape. i cried for her. mum went to work at about 7am while they were still waiting for a ""room"" to put grandma in. dad and i left too. then mum gets a call at work saying that grandma died. she died in er waiting for a room. she had many illnesses, but what i heard about how she died was that her lungs filled up with phlem because she didn't know to cough. when my great aunt died, she went downhill fast. once while she was still able to get up, she ran away and her son had to go find her. she would also smoke cigarettes and when she was done she'd throw them in the trashcan, not the ashtray. what got her down was falling down the steps and breaking her hip. from then on, she was bedridden too. when we went to see her, the doctor said she was brain dead and would go anytime. when my cousin got the call that his mum died, he cried, balling! i'm so glad he got it out. i'm glad we were there for him. he almost passed out a few times. i cried with him and hugged him and told him that it will soon pass and be easier on the mind. (i recently lost a dog, so i know how bad it feels to lose something or someone you love). please know this - when a loved one gets alzheimers, they need the love and support more than ever. i wish there was a cure for alzheimer's. well i hope i've helped someone by my story. i know it's a sad thing to go through with a loved one, but remember when they die that they're not suffering anymore, especially if they know the lord. take care guys, rock of ages ""assuredly, i say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will by no means enter it"" (luke 18:17)",2549,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"question about alzheimer hi, my name is michelle. i have a question about alzheimer's. i read that there is a new product for alzheimer's which is based on the results from the nun-study. they say it does not fight plaques but inflammation of the brains, which is, according to the nun study the root cause of alzheimer's. the medicine is called ocw for alzheimer's. does anyone has any experience with that? did someone try this ocw medicine? the website where they sell it and the film documentations there convinced me a lot but before i buy the product i want to ask whether someone has any experience with that. thank you so much for your response. kind regards michelle",2583,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"question about alzheimer michelle, do you mean the website http://www.nun-study.com ? i have found that when i made a search on ocw alzheimer, so i think it must be what you are referring to. i would not jump on this anti-inflammtory bandwaggon immediately, eventhough the movies there look very much scientific and are convincing. i also made a seach on ""anti-inflammatory theorie pat mcgeer"" and there is lots of information coming up with tons of scientific reports and testing. also wikipedia has pat mcgeer listed as the father of anti-inflammatory alzheimer scientist - so i guess these things about the product ocw are true. but still i am hesitating to purchase this product for my mom since it is quite expensive to take on a monthly basis and as far as i read about it you must take it regularly in order to succeed. maybe if money is not your concern then i would give it a try. warmest richard",2585,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"are hallucinations common in people with alzheimer's? hi, i can imagine that it is very common, because the brain 'pathways' in a person with alzheimer's become rather garbled (for want of a better word), and therefore memories can become crossed. so, whilst it might not be an hallucination per se , it is a pseudo-hallucnation in that it's a number of different memories being joined into one, and that makes it seem weird. think of it as a dream, where many different memories are brought together. kevin",2587,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"husband obsessed with having alheimers my 68 year old husband has had memory and cognitive problems for as long as i have known him. he had a couple of traumatic events in his childhood and has very low emotional/social intelligence. he takes meds for add and depression. a year or so ago, he became obsessed with the idea that he had alzheimer's. he finally went to a mental health professional (whom he had had no previous interaction with) who talked with him for an hour and said ""yeah, maybe you have the beginnings of alzheimer's."" and gave him scrip for a couple of meds, including aricept. i scheduled a complete physical with another physician who referred my husband to a doctor who specializes in cognitive problems. he gave my husband a battery of tests and, after evalutating the results, said that he had a terrible memory but that the tests did not show alzheimers. however, the tests are not always conclusive and my husband thought the aricept might be helping his memory so the doc indicated he could continue to take it. as a result, i cannot get long term care insurance for my husband - but that is another long, sad story. anyway, my husband continues to believe that he has alzheimer's. he is obsessed with it - and i fear that it is a self-fulfilling loop. all of the ""symptoms"" he exhibits are of long standing but he now interprets behaviors he has engaged in for 30 years or more as evidence that he is has alzherimer's. adding fuel to the fire is the fact that he has long eaten a very unusual diet, which he believes to be healthy and he is addicted to supplements. he reads selectively and believes anything that fits his paradigm. i have always been the bread winner - he has never contributed to our support. i am now working about half time but instead of bringing me stress relief, the reduced hours mean more time with my husband and i am going stark raving mad. any suggestions?",2588,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"husband obsessed with having alheimers hey, perhaps munchausen's syndrome is more applicable here, if you genuinely think that he's only doing this for attention. munchausen's is where the person feigns illness just for attention at first, but then it bciomes an addictive cycle. i am only 26 but i believe that older people are much more set in their ways than younger people, and therefore it might be tough to get him out of this way of thinking. if you perhaps present him with an official list of symptoms of alzhimer's, then maybe he will notice that he doesn't have it. an alternative approach is to simply ignore him when he mentions that he has alzheimer's - i.e. pretend that he didn't even speak. kevin",2589,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"obsession at my dad's former care home, the owners had a lap top computer my dad found interesting. the owners talked me into getting him his own, saying they would help him with it, maybe he could get emails from grandkids, etc. i gave it to him for his birthday. he got obsessed with it, insisted on trying to carry it around (he uses a walker, so that was dangerous) and refused to be helped, insisting he could learn to use it, lots of cussing & frustration. it turned into a big hassle & eventually i took it home with me, hoping he would forget about it. it has been several months, he's living in a new care home, but every time i see him he asks for his ""typewriter"". he wants to write letters (old friends write him letters occassionally). he does not have the dexterity to use the lap top, or ability to write a coherent letter (last letter he wrote was a couple years ago & it was complete nonsense). i have told him the lap top was too difficult for him & i fear if i brought it to him, he would react in the same obsessive, angry way he did before. but every time i see him he asks, now more like insists, i bring him the lap top, essentially accusing me of stealing it from him. i find myself avoiding visiting him, because it just turns into him begging for the ""typewriter"", and me, again, telling him it is too difficult for him. i've offered to take dictation from him and write any letters myself, but he refuses and just gets angry with me. i am at my wits end about this. does anyone else have experience with this type of obsessive behavior in a person with alzheimers? any suggestions?",2591,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

"my granny hello. i didn't really know how to title this post. i introduced myself in the 'intro' topic. i am the 34 year old granddaughter of an 89 year old woman with alzheimer's. she is my mum's mum, and she now lives in a nursing home which specialises in alzheimer's. i'm writing this on behalf of my mum really, as she would like to know more about other people's experiences, but she doesn't want to be a burden and she's not confident enough with computers to be able to use this forum. granny was in sheltered housing, with a flat to herself and a warden. this was about 5 years ago. she was first diagnosed with alzheimer's after she lost the following: ability to tell the time. ability to recognise the values of coins and notes. became forgetful (would leave the stove on, etc), and confused about things. began to wander around town at night, until she was found by a good-natured member of the public or a police officer. regualrly insisted that people/neighbours were coming into her house and stealing/moving things around. she would have arguments with the neighbours, accusing them of all sorts of things. mum and dad tried to take her on holiday, the journey was taken by car with frequent stops. dad had a sattelite nav system in the car, which was switched on. at the end of the journey (a few hundred miles) granny leapt out of the car and ran away accross the road, in a distressed state. she had got the idea into her head that the sattelite nav computer was controlling dad (because it was telling him which way to go and he was obeying), and that he wasn't dad any more but some imposter ('bad' dad) who meant to harm her. she also thought that this 'bad' dad had done away with 'good' dad, and had convinced mum to be with him instead of 'good' dad. after mum went after granny and explained to her the real situation, granny didn't believe her. she would not let dad into the holiday cottage, so he had to wait down at the local pub until mum phoned him to say that granny was asleep and it was 'safe' to come back. in the morning granny still believed in the 'bad' dad, and would not accept food or drink from mum or dad, as she believed that they were trying to poison her. they had to cut the holiday short and bring her home again. they contacted the doctor immediately. after that, granny was put into a residential assessment centre where she stayed for some months until the progression/level of her alzheimer's was established, then a suitable place was found for her to recieve residential care. the care home is only 10 miles away from mum and dad, and mum goes to see granny every day. nowadays granny talks mostly nonsense, but she does have short periods of lucidity (ie: only a sentence or two at a time, 5 minutes on a good day). i live over the other side of the country to mum and dad, so i don't get to see them or granny very often, but we are in telephone contact regularly. a couple of weeks ago i went to visit her with my mum and my sister, who brought her baby along to meet granny. that went well - in amongst the nonsense granny understood that this was her great-granddaughter. she was very proud and pleased to have her family around her, she was able to hold the baby for 10 minutes with no problems. baby needed a feed, and my sister and mum left the room. i said i would catch them up, and stayed talking with granny for a little longer. she seemed to be more lucid with me than with the other members of the family - we spoke about grandad (who had died when i was 17), who she has not mentioned for years and years to anyone else - mum had thought that she had forgotten about him! but then mum called me to leave - i didn't really want to as granny seemed to be having a good time with me, but i had to go - mum can't spend too long with granny as it upsets her and she finds it very stressful to see her mother deteriorate as time goes by. mum has manic depression, and has been told by her doctor that she would not be able to look after granny, which is why she can't spend so much time with her. i wish that i lived nearer so that i could visit granny more often, but money and time are short (i work in the community support area, which means low wages and long hours). i speak to granny on the phone, but she is rather deaf, and refuses to wear a hearing aid, so i know that she doesn't hear much of what i say, even when i raise my voice. sorry about this, i'm rambling - here come my questions soon.... 7 days ago granny fell over in her room while mum was visiting. an ambulance was called, and luckily granny had not broken anything. after mum and the ambulance left granny fell again, this time she broke her hip. she was on the floor for 30 mins before staff found her (luckily, as if it had been a different time of day she could have been lying on the floor all night!). she went straight to hospital and her hip was pinned. the doctors' plan is to give her physiotherapy to get her back on her feet, and then she can go back to the nursing home. the trouble is, granny is not sure where she is in hospital. since the operation she has had no lucid moments at all, and is increasingly confused. she is very suspicious and thinks that people are trying to poison her again. so, she is refusing all food, drink, and medications. she has another urinary infection (she has always been reluctant to drink for fear of wetting herself, so she gets loads of these infections, which don't do her mind any good) because she will not drink. doctors did put a drip in her arm, but she kept pulling it out, so they won't put another one in. she also tries to pull out her catheter. she has become violent with doctors and nursing staff, trying to bite and hit them. i'm very glad that she was able to see her great-granddaughter before she broke her hip and took a turn for the worse. i am wondering if there has been anyone else who has had similar experiences of: being told by doctors that you can't look after your loved one because you have a mental illness. alzheimer's patients taking a turn for the worse since being under anaesthetic for a major operation. i think that's about it really, thanks for reading. sorry it was so long, but it all sort of flooded out!",2593,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

"investigational medications my father had alzheimer's, but it was cancer that killed him. i just wanted to metion a couple of medications that are not yet approved in the us for use, but that seem to help. they can be obtained with the help of a sympathetic doctor. one is called clioquinol. it is an old drug that was banned 30 years ago because of side effects, but it seems to be safe if used in moderation. it seems to redude the amount of plaque in the brain by flushing out some of the copper and zinc that is in the plaques since it is a chealating agent. it is still used in african counties as a traetment for ameobic dissentary. i found a compounding pharnacist who was able to get some from a us company. there is a nerve growth factor called cerebrolysin whcih seemed to help my father also. i had it shipped from austria. the big problem with it is that it needs to injected intravenously five days a week for a month. it has been used in germany for years and it known to be a safe medication.",2595,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"dear faithful, my mother died a few months ago after a long decline from parkinson's. she was similar to your dad in that she eventually could barely speak, just make little grunts, so it was really hard to know what she was thinking. her facial expression was also rigid, so reading emotional content was impossible. we tried as much as possible to relate to her as though she understood us. it was sort of like having a baby, but without the expressiveness infants show. very difficult. my heart goes out to you. if he still can recognize you, i would think going to see him alot, and providing him with familiar objects, like a favorite blanket, ect. might help him cope. i often felt that my mother was lost in a big house she used to know her way around in. she would look out the windows so to speak, but not recognize the neighborhood. very lonely. so like i said, go see him alot. go sit with him and don't worry too much about feedback. just pet him and hug him.
