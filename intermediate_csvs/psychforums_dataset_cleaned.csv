"How are you feeling today? I had a fight with my son a couple days ago and have been feeling worried and anxious about it. A lot of childhood memories flashed to my mind, ones that I haven't thought about in decades. Lots of shame for both of us. My anxiety tends to sneak up on me, and it's usually worse than I realized by the time I realize how profound it is. I had that realization today. Overcast/rainy day didn't help, not just for mood, but I could use some exercise and fresh air, but I'm stuck inside."

"How are you feeling today? not good, but not bad either (compared to other times) before i have a panic attack i have a creeping feeling like its about to come. so i do whatever i need to do FAST before it strikes me and then im completely immobilized and unable to think"
"How are you feeling today? I usually recognize the onset of a panic attack first by a change in breathing. Like a tightness or mild suffocation. The problem is I would hyper-ventilate, get all numb and tingly like I was having a heart attack or stroke. Too much air still felt like not enough. Recognizing the onset can help divert or diffuse the attack. It has been a while since I had one that just took things over. How am I feeling? Somewhat stressed because of the Thanksgiving holiday and coming Christmas. Family expectations and pressure. Work asked me for overtime, but I declined. I feel a bit guilty about that.

"How are you feeling today? I've been struggling emotionally with filing for SSDI, and asking myself about how people will treat me if I get it. My family is often denying I have problems to me which only makes it worse. If I get it, I plan to live away from them very permanently. They definately have contributed to my triggers during my whole life. I feel like disempowered so much of the time being in their lives. It hurts a lot and they have no idea how they contribute to it, or my cycles of fearful behavior. I may move in a week or so to the state and area I would prefer. I am glad that is on the table and may come to fruition soon. I'm listening to a lot of spiritual type of supportive videos online and that is helping. I will see old acquaintances tomorrow morning and Friday I think too, so that is very helpful."
"Desensitise yourself [Good information] Desensitise yourself Developed by Wolpe in the 40's, 'systematic desensitisation' is a very effective, tried and tested method of becoming less sensitive to the stimulus, or subject, of your phobia. Although normally applied by a therapist, you can use this as a self help method. It is a rather slow process so you will need patience and the determination to stick with it for weeks or even months. Use desensitisation only on mild phobias Mild or severe phobia? Self help using desensitisation is not suitable for severe phobias because the emotions are likely to be too powerful for self help methods. A severe phobia is best resolved with professional assistance. It is likely that you will know instinctively whether your's is a phobia that will respond to this self help approach. However as a rough guide check where your phobic reaction lies on an intensity scale of 1-10. Imagine that 10 is the highest intensity - virtually being overwhelmed at the thought of the stimulus - and 1 is a mild 'ho-hum' uneasiness. If your response to even thinking about the subject evokes an intensity of 8 or higher you would be well advised to seek professional help rather than attempting to do it by yourself. Below 8 indicates that self help methods are likely to work - with a systematic and persistent approach. 'Complex Phobias' You can use desensitisation on 'complex phobias', such as fear of flying, and on 'social phobias'. However do prepare thoroughly as this will make the difference between success and disappointment."
"Desensitise yourself [Good information] eduardo wrote: what good & relevant information can you recommend about desensitisation ? If you want to look up information on desensitization, you may want to look into a process called ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"" (or CBT). This is the process by which people with phobias are systematically desensitized to whatever they fear. They use this very often with people who have phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other anxiety disorders."
"Desensitise yourself [Good information] Desensition means learning how to see something from another perspective. Let's say you are afraid of snakes. My Mom is still afraid of them. If she opens the front door and see's a gradener snake basking itself on the stoop. My mom would be so scared, she would stand still until that poor lizard decided to mozy along and disappear in the brush. Desensition. This is an aexample but just in my mind. 1. Therapist show you lizard pictures...all types but no snakes. 2. Snake pictures 3. Lizards moving around in a tank 4. Snakes in a tank. 5. Snakes on the floor. That's it. They start with something small...like #1, and gradually with patience go to number five."
"Desensitise yourself [Good information] Hello, my name is Alana...Please advise how or if I could use desensitization in this situation....... I have this irrational fear of going to the doctor, started years ago when I had serious anxiety problems. My blood pressure was high because I was anxious. I have this fear of them finding something wrong with me. I am the opposite of someone who wants to get every test done in the book, I don't want to go to the doctors at all. I hate pills, and hate tests. Now I associate my doctors office with fear and can't even go for a regular check up. The minute they take a BP, BAM, its high. I get dizzy and shaky right away and no matter how long they wait it is still high. At home it is always low and I check it several times a week (I am a nurse by the way). I don't know what to do. I am 49 and cannot constantly avoid the doctors. I need to battle this fear once and for all. Alana"
"Desensitise yourself [Good information] Hi Alana, I know your post is from 2011, but I wanted to chime in and let you know that you are not alone. I too have high BP when at the doctors, but at other times it is normal or close to. I used to get anxious over this and didn't want to go to the doctors for fear that my blood pressure would be high and they would find something wrong with me. It was a vicious cycle, but then I read about ""white coat syndrome."" White coat syndrome is a condition wherein the individual demonstrates elevated blood pressure in a clinical setting, and not in other settings. This phenomenon occurs due to anxiety and apprehension some people feel during a visit to the clinic. This knowledge has helped me immensely and sometimes now I am so relaxed during a doctor visit that I have ""normal"" BP readings. Hope this helps you like it helped me"
"Desensitise yourself [Good information] This is great! Exactly how I got over my phobia driving on highways. Seriously taking baby steps is the best way to get over something. I would start with just feeling relaxed driving on side roads, then I would take VERY short highway trips, then a little longer, etc etc."
"Desensitise yourself [Good information] Desensitisation is basically controlled exposure therapy, whereby someone is exposed to mild forms of the object of phobia and allowed to accustom themselves to its presence, then the severity of the form of exposure is increased a little and the process repeated. I think this allows the person to see that nothing bad happens (ie what they fear) as a result of the exposure and it is deliberately mild to ensure the person can use their brain to rationalise against an immediate avoidant response. This technique seems to work best when exposure can be rigidly controlled (ie no surprises) and the patient is in control with someone providing encouragement and enhancing cognitive reasoning. The reason why it is so difficult to address phobias is because the primitive brain is quite powerful to react instinctively to danger to protect the organism and thus overrides the cognitive process to a certain extent. By starting with a mild form of the phobic object, the patient can better cognitively reason against the instinctive response, but it is still not easy. I have deeply entrenched phobias that aren't amenable to desensitisation in a controlled environment because they are not really subject to control. Despite this, the medical profession refused to acknowledge the impracticality and suggested desensitisation. Of course it didn't work but increased the phobia. It took many years before a psychologist stumbled on some of the causal factors and I was better able to treat myself. Part of the treatment issue is often the rush to diagnose to a known condition, even if it doesn't fit right (the shoehorning approach), through expediency and not spending enough time to really understand what is going on. I think Desensitisation works best for irrational object orientated phobias, but is less amenable to phobias resulting from repeated bad experiences that may continue to recur. I have a fear of needles resulting from a particularly bad experience when a nurse tried to draw blood 13 times for a test and witnessing young colleagues suffering with vaccinations and blood streaming down their arm. It's not helped by pain experienced from any subsequent needle as it reinforces the initial phobic experience. It's the same with going to the dentist or a medical practice: I have entrenched negative experiences that are difficult to ameliorate when they keep getting repeated. IMO, we are acutely sensitive to negative events and avoid those circumstances in future as a defense mechanism that evolved for our survival. Correspondingly, positive experiences carry less weight. That is one of the reasons why desensitisation is so slow, because it takes many positive experiences to start to outweigh a single negative experience. If we do experience another negative experience, it generates a severe setback and may overwhelm any future desensitisation approach: that is why desensitisation must be rigidly controlled so that a negative reinforcement does not occur to derail the process. At least, this is how I view the process."
"Desensitise yourself [Good information] Very interesting. As being someone with Social anxiety and Generalised anxiety disorder, I feel tremendously bad when watching that videos of pick ups, when a guy approach random girls on streets to get their number or whatever. I somehow puts myself in the skin of the guy in the video and start to feel all the anxiety. I also feel anxious when people talk about travels or such, because I'm very affraid of going too far away from my home..."

"The Power Of The Mind The Power Of The Mind example: 2 researchers were walking through the jungle, they were near the equator where they set up came for the night. It was scorching hot that day and night that one of the researchers woke up in a cold sweat and couldn't get back to sleep. All he wanted to do was get some air and cool his body down so he could go back to sleep. He heard a zipper and instantly felt cool air coming into the tent and was able to fall back asleep. The next morning he turns to the other researcher and says, thanks for opening the tent last night so I could sleep better. The researcher replies, I didn't open the tent, zipped down my sleeping bag. The power of the mind, maybe that is what you were expierencing. There is a situation that i've expierenced with this, my psychairist told me about this, and I've posted it. Maybe I will share mine in time. It's weird."
The Power Of The Mind http://www.ted.com/talks/vilayanur_rama ... _mind.html Here's a fantastic video you should watch when you have a spare half hour. It's from the TED conference and it's a neurologist named VS Ramachandran talking about the crazy stuff he's doing trying to figure out how our brains work. It's an amazing talk and he's very nice to listen to (his accent is fantastic!!) Hope you like it :)
The Power Of The Mind Great post. No doubt the mind creates our reality. Sometimes we get so caught up in the craziness of things we forget that our negative thoughts are creating a negative reality. We must remind ourselves to come back into the present moment and just relax.
"The Power Of The Mind Great post. The mind can create any type of human reality you want. I've been listening to a lot of Tony Robbins's mp3 and used some of his stuff and it's absolutely true. Whatever you really focus on starts to reflect on reality. it's always the mind and what he learned during the years that trigger fears & anxiety.... ‎~ ~ A Coward Dies A Thousand Deaths, A Courageous Man Only Once... http://www.freementalhealthinfo.com"

"SYMPTOMS Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is much more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It's chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint. Simply the thought of getting through the day provokes anxiety. People with GAD can't seem to shake their concerns, even though they usually realize that their anxiety is more intense than the situation warrants. People with GAD also seem unable to relax. They often have trouble falling or staying asleep. Their worries are accompanied by physical symptoms, especially trembling, twitching, muscle tension, headaches, irritability, sweating, or hot flashes. They may feel lightheaded or out of breath. They may feel nauseated or have to go to the bathroom frequently. Or they might feel as though they have a lump in the throat. Many individuals with GAD startle more easily than other people. They tend to feel tired, have trouble concentrating, and sometimes suffer depression, too. Usually the impairment associated with GAD is mild and people with the disorder don't feel too restricted in social settings or on the job. Unlike many other anxiety disorders, people with GAD don't characteristically avoid certain situations as a result of their disorder. However, if severe, GAD can be very debilitating, making it difficult to carry out even the most ordinary daily activities. GAD comes on gradually and most often hits people in childhood or adolescence, but can begin in adulthood, too. It's more common in women than in men and often occurs in relatives of affected persons. It's diagnosed when someone spends at least 6 months worried excessively about a number of everyday problems. Specific Symptoms of this Disorder: Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). The person finds it difficult to control the worry. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children don't need to meet as many criteria). restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge being easily fatigued difficulty concentrating or mind going blank irritability muscle tension sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep) Additionally, the anxiety or worry is not about having a Panic Attack, being embarrassed in public (as in Social Phobia), being contaminated (as in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), being away from home or close relatives (as in Separation Anxiety Disorder), gaining weight (as in Anorexia Nervosa), having multiple physical complaints (as in Somatization Disorder), or having a serious illness (as in Hypochondriasis), and the anxiety and worry do not occur exclusively during Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism) and does not occur exclusively during a Mood Disorder, a Psychotic Disorder, or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder. Treatments"
"Generalized Anxiety Disorder With generalized anxiety disorder, panic is not the predominant feature. Many of the panic symptoms are present to a lesser degree. Instead of brief moments of intense anxiety, the person feels symptoms throughout most of the day. Although the specific manifestations of anxiety vary for each person, this chronic state of tension can affect 6 major systems of the body. 1. The cardiovascular system, anxiety increases the blood pressure, which causes tachycradia (rapid heartbeat), constriction of the blood vessels in the arms and legs, and dilation of the vessels surrounding the skeletal muscles. These changes produce symptoms of palpatations (an uncomfortable awareness of the heart rate), headaches, and cold fingers. 2. In the gastrointestinal system, anxiety leads to reduce salivary secretions, spasms within the esophagus (the hollow muscular tube leading from the nose and mouth to the stomach), causing spasms, diarrhea and/or constipation, and cramplike pains in the upper stomach. 3. In the respiratory system, anxiety leads to hyperventilation, or over breathing, which lowers the level of carbon dioxide in the blood, the symptoms of ""air hunger"", deep sighs, and pins and needles sensations. 4. In the genitourinary systems, the anxious person can experience the need for frequent urination. Men may have difficulty maintaining an erection during intercourse; women may have difficulty becoming sexually aroused or achieving orgasm. 5. In the musculoskeletal system, the muscles become tense. Involuntary trembling of the body, tension headaches, and other aches and pains may develop. 6. Through the changes in the central nervous system, the anxious person is generally more apprehensive, aroused, and vigilant, feeling ""on edge"", impaitent, or irritable. He/she may complain of poor concentration, insomnia, and fatigue. There is often a fine line between the diagnosis of panic disorder and agoraphobia and that of generalized anxiety disorder. Three features distinguish them. First, the symptoms themselves: if an individual is chronically anxious (he/she weould be with generalized anxiety disorder) and also experience episodes of panic, then panic disorder and agorphobia will be the more likely diagnosis. Second, defferent kinds of fearful thoughts are associated with the 2 problems. In most people with generalized anxiety disorder the worries are about the kinds of interactions they will have with others: ""Will I fail in this work setting?"" ""Are they going to accept me?"" ""I'm afraid he's going to leave me."" ""What if they discover how little I know?"" ""I'll never perform ujp to their expectations."" With panic disorder or agoraphobia, the imagined response of others is secondary to the fear of personal catastrophe or loss of control, and the person's internal statements and questions reflect this apprehension: ""What if I faint [become hysterical, have a heart attack, cause a scene], and have people see me?"" The panic-prone person focuses more on her/his ability to be in 100% control of all her/his physical and mental capacities. The anxious person focuses more on her/his ability to cope with the expectations and responses of thos around him/her. POSSIBLE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS DURING ANXIETY Cardiovascular System Tacycardia (rapid heartbeat) Palpitations (uncomfortable awareness of the heart rate) Headaches Cold Fingers Gastrointestinal System Dry Mouth Difficulty swallowing Butterflies in the stomach Gurgling sounds of gas in the intestines Colon spasms Diarrhea and/or constipation Cramplike pains in the upper stomach Respiratory System Hyperventilation symptoms Genitourinary System Need for frequent urination Difficulty maintaining an erection Difficulty becoming sexually aroused or achieving orgasm (women) Musculoskeletal System Muscles tense Involuntary trembling in the body Tension headaches Other aches and pains Central Nervous System Apprehensive, aroused, and vigilant Feeling ""on edge"", impatient, or irritable Poor concentration Insomnia Fatigue The third difference has to do with the person's response to her/his fears. The anxious person thinks about withdrawing from the situations that increase her/his anxiety, and may procrastinate on performance tasks. The person with panic disorder or agoraphobia, on the other hand, is quick to use avoidance as a way to diminish discomfort. In a matter of days she/he will begin to identify the situations that are associated with the symptoms and determine how she/he can steer clear of them, immediately viewing avoidance as the single best solution to the problem."
"Symptoms Of Anxiety nervousness/tension sweating rapid heartbeat feeling unsafe insomnia trembling, twitching, or feeling shaky fear of going crazy fear of dying choking sensation/lump in throat irritability dizziness/faintness overeating Chest pains/tightness tingling/numbness sensation nausea numbness of lips, fingers, toes frequent urination trouble swallowing restlessness or easily fatigued dry mouth clammy hands hot flashes difficulty concentrating shortness of breath smothering sensation muscle aches, soreness or tension fear of impending doom feeling out of control/terror guilt-filled memories self-doubt and ""what ifs"" diarreah, other abdominal distress fear of doing something uncontrolled sharp pain weakness fear of embarrasment or humiliation self-medicating with drugs and/or alcohol"
"Social Phobia Social phobia is one of the more common anxiety disorders. It involves fear of embarrassment or humilitation in situations where you are exposed to the scrutiny of others or must perform. This fear is much stronger than the normal anxiety most nonphobic people experience in social or performance situations. Usually it's so strong that it causes you to avoid the situation altogether, although some people with social phobia endure social situations, albeit with considerable anxiety. Their concern is that they will say or do something that will cause others to judge them as being anxious, weak, ""crazy"", or stupid. The most common social phobia is fear of public speaking. It is the most common of all phobias and affects performers, speakers, people whose jobs require them to make presentations, and students who have to speak in front of their class. Other common social phobias include: * Fear of blushing in public. * Fear of being watched at work. * Fear of choking on or spilling food while eating in public. * Fear of using public toilets. * Fear of crowds. * Fear of taking examinations. Sometimes social phobia is less specific and involves a generalized fear of any social or group situation where you feel that you might be watched or evaluated. While social anxieties are common, you would be given a formal diagnosis of social phobia only if your avoidance interferes with work, social activities, or important relationships, and/or it causes you considerable distress. As with agoraphobia, panic attacks can accompany social phobia, although the panic is related more to being embarrassed or humiliated than to being confined or trapped. Also the panic arises only in connection with a specific type of social situation. Treatment for social phobia is often best carried out in a group setting."
"What is a panic attack? A panic attack is a discreet period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes. The attacks are unexpected. We who suffer from panic attacks have great concern about having having additional attacks, about the implications of the attack or its consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, going crazy, dying) Because the physical symptoms of panic attacks are so intense, many people who suffer from the attacks feel that the next step must be death. They often end up in hospital emergency rooms and are usually sent home still wondering what was wrong! We fear that the attack will last indefinitely, that we will never recover. In reality, most panic attacks peak within 10 minutes, and then subside. However, we feel so overwhelmed while in the midst of the attack that the few minutes it lasts seems to be forever. After, we ask this question, ""Will it happen again?"" That thought haunts us. It's a horrible experience. We develop anticipatory anxiety, also known as FEAR of the FEAR. We fear not only the actual panic attack, but also anticipation of it. We think ""What if it happens again?"" The slightest physical symptom can set off waves of anticipation and cause FEAR of the FEAR. Here are some fearful thoughts some people have during a panic attack: • Fainting or collapsing in public • Losing control of their body • Becoming confused • Having a heart attack or other physical illness • Being trapped • Causing a scene • Going crazy • Being unable to breathe • Being unable to get home or to another ""safe place"" Never forget there can be a recovery. Effective treatment can eliminate much of the disorder, but it may be susceptible to occasional temporary relapses when you experience stress."
"Anxiety Attacks If you haven't been given a diagnosis of either panic attacks/anxiety or an anxiety disorder it is important you don't self diagnose. This must be done either by your doctor or by a medical specialist. It is very important to discuss your problem with your doctor. After you have been evaluated throughly, your doctor will be able to tell you if your anxiety attacks are related to anxiety disorder or caused by another problem. Many people who have anxiety attacks don't seek medical care because of embarrassment or fear of taking medications. Anxiety disorder is the most common of all mental health problems and can start up in a number of different ways. If untreated it can lead to Panic attacks. Anxiety attacks come up out of nowhere. If we have a anxiety attack in a certain place we may become afraid to go back to that place where we had the attacks. We start to avoid places where our attacks seem to have happened at. We go through great lengths to hide our symptoms hoping it can't be noticed by others."
"Agoraphobia The actual fear is of being unable to escape, whether you're locked in a mass of people at a football game or stuck in an elevator or a dentist's chair. Many of us can't travel alone, particularly to new places, and many find it impossible to take public transportation. Agoraphobia is often related to claustrophobia - feeling surrounded often makes us panic. Sometimes it can happen after a prolonged illness where you had to be home or in a hospital, or it may come upon you with no warning at all. It is the most severe form of all neuroses. Although it is the most commonly treated phobia, fewer people suffer from it than from other phobic disorders. Because they fear having a panic attack in a public place, true agoraphobics have great difficulty going outside of their homes. Agoraphobia can range from mild to severe. In extreme situations, the sufferer ends up confined to just one room of their home or even to a ""safe"" chair or their bed. We feel we can't hide the feeling inside of us any more and fear that what we are feeling at that point where we will be noticed by others. We worry, ""What if I run across the room"", that we would cry or do something foolish or embarrassing. We are afraid of the way we feel and where it could take us. The thought of ""Will it happen to me again?"" haunts us. We become afraid of being afraid. It's such a horrible feeling to have and some of us become housebound. We lose our friends, our life, everything. Nothing in our life seems to be going well. But there is good news. Agoraphobia can be treated with professional help."
"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can be a debilitating disorder with the following two anxiety-related essential features : Obsessions : undesirable, recurrent, disturbing thoughts Compulsions : repetitive or ritualized behaviors People with OCD experience unwanted obsessions, which cause anxiety. Severe anxiety produces feelings of dread, worry, fright, and apprehension (see generalized anxiety disorder GAD). Certain behaviors are performed compulsively in an attempt to lessen this anxiety. Although they realize their obsessions are excessive and their behavior is unreasonable, they feel powerless to control either. In fact, their symptoms can overwhelm them and result in severe impairment and dysfunction, which can begin at an early age. Incidence and Prevalence The National Institute for Mental Health reports that about 3% of people in the United States have OCD. Typical age of onset for boys is 6 to 15, while for women it is often later, between 20 and 30. Risk factors like genetic predisposition and environmental stress contribute to OCD. Also, OCD is more common among people of higher education, IQ, and socioeconomic status. Men and women, however, are affected equally. Though its course is chronic and usually lasts a lifetime, it is treatable with medication, behavioral therapy, and, in extremely rare cases, brain surgery. Risk Factors Risk factors for obsessive-compulsive disorder include the following: Genetics Postpartum periods Environmental stressors Although there is no clear genetic evidence, obsessive-compulsive disorder tends to run in families. A person with OCD has a 25% chance of having a blood relative who has it. Like other mental illnesses, it is more prevalent among identical twins than fraternal. There is a 70% chance that identical twins with share it, and a 50% chance for fraternal twins. Currently, researchers do not understand OCD’s genetic mechanisms, though they suspect multiple genes are involved. Women with OCD may experience a worsening of symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum . A recent study suggests that fluctuating hormones may trigger symptoms during pregnancy. The same study reports OCD in 30% of women observed. The arrival of a baby brings new responsibility, a new set of concerns, and changes in routine. While normal reaction to a newborn may include some anxiety, postpartum OCD features disturbing thoughts and excessive behavior regarding the baby’s well-being. The following obsessions and compulsions are common: Obsession Fear of contaminating the baby Compulsion [ Repeatedly washing the baby Obsession Need for reassurances Compulsion Repetitively calling the physician Obsession Recurrent fear for the baby's safety Compulsion Incessantly checking the baby Obsession Recurrent thoughts of bad mothering Compulsion Incessantly checking the baby Obsession Recurrent thoughts of harming baby Compulsion Avoiding or neglecting the baby Obsession ""Thoughts of disturbed order"" Compulsion Ordering and rearranging baby's crib These feelings and behaviors may occur immediately, but often begin 4 to 6 weeks after giving birth. Treatment is necessary to control symptoms and to ensure care of the baby. Environmental stressors that can worsen OCD symptoms include the following: Abuse Changes in living situation Illness Occupational changes or problems Relationship concerns School-related problems Causes Biological factors involving brain structure and activation are associated with OCD. Abnormalities of the frontal lobes, basal ganglia, and cingulum are common in people with OCD. Basal ganglia are involved in routine behaviors, like grooming, and the frontal lobes in organizing behaviors and in planning. The cingulum consists of fibrous bands that assist in communicating the brain’s behavioral and emotional messages. Support for its role in OCD is the fact that surgical severing of the cingulum has relieved and even cured people with the disorder. The Serotonin Hypothesis An abnormally low level of serotonin is perhaps the most well-established link between the brain and OCD. Serotonin is a chemical neurotransmitter that transmits information from one nerve to another throughout the brain. It is released by one synapse(nerve ending), crosses a gap, and is picked up by another synapse. After a message is sent, enzymes in the brain clean serotonin out of the synapses. Drugs used to treat OCD, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), increase and sustain serotonin levels and reduce or eliminate symptoms."
"There are over 275 types of Specific Phobias that are listed according to some sources. In order to qualify for the diagnosis of a Specific Phobia, the person must have an excessive and unreasonable fear due to the presence or anticipation of a specific object or situation; exposure to the stimulus causes an anxiety response; the sufferer realizes that the fear is excessive or unreasonable; and, the avoidance of or distress due to the stimuli causes impairment in functioning. (Isolated) Phobias These are phobias restricted to highly specific situations such as proximity to particular animals, heights, thunder, darkness, flying, closed spaces, urinating or defecating in public toilets, eating certain foods, dentistry, the sight of blood or injury, and the fear of exposure to specific diseases. Although the triggering situation is discrete, contact with it can evoke panic as in agoraphobia or social phobias. Specific phobias usually arise in childhood or early adult life and can persist for decades if they remain untreated. The seriousness of the resulting handicap depends on how easy it is for the sufferer to avoid the phobic situation. Fear of the phobic situation tends not to fluctuate, in contrast to agoraphobia. Radiation sickness and venereal infections and, more recently, AIDS are common subjects of disease phobias. Diagnostic Guidelines All of the following should be fulfilled for a definite diagnosis: the psychological or autonomic symptoms must be primary manifestations of anxiety, and not secondary to other symptoms such as delusion or obsessional thought; the anxiety must be restricted to the presence of the particular phobic object or situation; and the phobic situation is avoided whenever possible. Includes: acrophobia animal phobias claustrophobia examination phobia simple phobia Differential Diagnosis It is usual for there to be no other psychiatric symptoms, in contrast to agoraphobia and social phobias. Blood-injury phobias differ from others in leading to bradycardia and sometimes syncope, rather than tachycardia. Fears of specific diseases such as cancer, heart disease, or venereal infection should be classified under hypochondriacal disorder, unless they relate to specific situations where the disease might be acquired. If the conviction of disease reaches delusional intensity, the diagnosis should be delusional disorder. Individuals who are convinced that they have an abnormality or disfigurement of a specific bodily (often facial) part, which is not objectively noticed by others (sometimes termed dysmorphophobia), should be classified under hypochondriacal disorder or delusional disorder, depending upon the strength and persistence of their conviction."
"My personal Anxiety Survival Guide Hello, I have never been to therapy but just wanted to share the methods I've come up with over the years for managing my anxiety. Maybe they can help someone. My anxiety manifests in what I call ""episodes"". An episode usually lasts a number of weeks and always has a ""focus"" - a thought or worry that's actually causing the anxiety. This state of ""being anxious"" is so distinct to me and feels so different from any other of my mental states that I can pinpoint the moment an episode begins usually to within a few seconds, and I can pinpoint when it ends to within a few days (the recovery is more gradual than the onset). The most obvious symptom is the obsessive thought, the focus, that just will not leave my head even for one second. Sometimes this thought ""mutates"" over time, almost like a virus evolving to get past your immune system, keeping me feeling anxious even when I thought I'd come to grips with the original problem. I think these methods help me limit the duration of my episodes, and also keep me feeling less anxious during them. 1. The anxiety is unproductive If you're anxious over something that you can do something about, like a deadline or a decision, the best thing to do is to tackle the problem. But otherwise, remember that the anxiety is useless. There is no reason to feel guilty about wanting the anxiety to stop. You're not ""running"" from something. 2. You are not running, you are putting it away temporarily It may well be that there are some decisions that need to be made about whatever you're anxious about, or some genuine thinking that you need to do. But now is not the time! You need to put the fire out in your kitchen before you starting trying to redecorate it! Trying to engage with this thought in your current state will be a net negative in the extreme, for every 1% of genuine progress you make on the issue you will suffer 99% setbacks in your overall productivity and well being. You are simply putting this thought away until a time where you can think about it without it triggering panic - that will be the correct time to deal with it. 2. It's not your job to stop being anxious The immediate problem you have is this thought bouncing around in your head constantly. You cannot stop thinking about something by sheer force of will (quick! don't think of a blue elephant). It has been on your mind a lot lately, and so it will continue to be on your mind a lot for a little while, because that is how the mind works. You have to treat this like having a cold. When you have a sore throat, you don't think to yourself that you have to find a way to make the pain stop right now. You just say wow, this sucks, and get on with it. Your job is not to stop feeling anxious. Every minute that passes that you still feel anxious is not a failure. Each time the anxious thought pops into your head again even though you promised you'd stop thinking about it is not a failure. 3. Your job is to continue to be productive and live your life Just like when you have a cold, all you can ask of yourself is that you continue to be productive in whatever sense is meaningful to you. You are not trying to ""make it stop"", you are trying to respond to it as healthily as possible. 4. Ease off the gas, but don't take your foot off the accelerator You are allowed to drop certain responsibilities to make your life easier! Just try to do so in a somewhat disciplined and controlled way. If you go to the gym, continue going - but maybe drop your least favorite exercise, or cut your routine down to a ""maintenance"" routine. If you normally avoid snacks, let yourself pick up a chocolate bar on the way home from work every day. Drop some of your less urgent chores. 5. Soothing, not distraction Try to distinguish between things that merely distract you and things that soothe you. Distraction keeps your brain occupied but ends up making you feel worse. Soothing makes you feel genuinely better, if only a little. The two main things that are soothing for me are taking a walk in daylight, and talking to someone who loves me (about anything, not necessarily the anxiety, although it helps if they at least know you're feeling anxious). Repetitive video games, say, are only distracting (to me). One sign that something is actually soothing is that you may find that, while doing it, although your thoughts circle back to your anxiety, they are sometimes tinged with a little more hope and positivity than usual. 6. Just stop thinking about it When you notice that you're thinking about it, don't feel guilty, don't feel like you failed, but do stop thinking about it. Switch to something else. Of course, it will still be in the back of your mind as you try to do this. That's fine. Just focus on something else. 7. But sometimes, thinking about it is okay Sometimes, your brain finds an angle on the anxiety that it may genuinely be useful to let it pursue for a little while. A good sign that this is the case is if (1) it's genuinely a new angle that you hadn't considered before, and (2) it makes you feel better, not worse. Often I find I stumble upon these new thoughts while walking. If it feels okay to you, let yourself pursue the new line of thought until you've exhausted it or it's starting to degrade into negative thoughts again. 7. Don't hate your anxiety Hedgehogs are anxious too, and it's served them well. Evolution creates anxious individuals for a reason, you just need to learn how to harness it productively."
"3 months after stopping an antipsychotic (Zyprexa) Hi, I used to suffer from acute anxiety and panic attacks. I tried various anxiety medications, but none provided relief. My psychiatrist suggested trying an antipsychotic (Zyprexa), which finally gave me 100% relief from anxiety. I continued taking Zyprexa for 4 years, but it also caused emotional numbness. After 4 years, I couldn't tolerate the emotional numbness anymore, so I decided to stop the medication. With the help of my psychiatrist, I tapered off it slowly. It has been 3 months since I completely stopped the medication, but my anxiety hasn't returned, and the emotional numbness persists. It feels as if I'm still taking the medication. Does this mean that Zyprexa caused permanent changes to my brain? Can I ever overcome this emotional numbness? Could you please provide some insight into this situation? Your help would be greatly appreciated."
Fear of relapse I am afraid of a relapse at anytime..I am getting mild panick attacks from time to time when thinking about that scenario.. it's taking away my attention and bringing a tug of war inside me that's between me and my sinister black shadiws .each time I relapse I am left with anxiety scars that never get healed for some days.. the shock creates a anxiety and this anxiety episode will keep me worried for the next two three weeks unless t I experiance the shock again... Don't know anything else .. The usage will make my situation more panicky like addicing extra anxiety elements to it.. but the delusion or fallacy will make me think different..
"Fear of relapse Stay strong! Anxiety is a beast that grows when you feed it. Every time you have a panic attack, you have the opportunity to choose not to feed the beast (to continue living without reacting to the anxiety - and the feeling will eventually go away). This is INCREDIBLY hard, but if you react to the anxiety / hide away / reassure yourself / ruminate / etc, it will only feed the beast and you will subject your future self to an even greater panic attack and it will only get harder to not feed it. You have to create the conviction that you're not going to react to it when you're not in it, and then when it happens, stick to it. It will get easier in time. But it's very difficult to do and a slow climb out of it. It's the only thing to do though. The alternative is a downward spiral. In time you will be able to look back and see how far you've come, and be proud of yourself and shocked at how much better your life is. It takes courage and discipline, but anyone can do it. All the best and hope you're doing well."

All the best and hope you're doing well. This seems to be the general advice for anxiety-type problems, and it's expressed quite nicely here (I sometimes find the advice patronising or even insulting). In reality, things are a bit more complicated. I used to get a lot of anxiety before going out with friends. ""Don't avoid going out with them, keep going out and the anxiety will go away!"" would be the usual type of advice. However, it turns out that it was a toxic group of friends! Sometimes taking another kind of action - cutting the ""friends"" out of my life in this case - is the right thing to do. In other cases it may be appropriate to take small steps and not rush things too much and get overwhelmed, if possible."
"Fear of relapse Thank you for the insight floatingtree! You're right that sometimes it's more nuanced than that and for everyone it's different what will work. So thank you for sharing that. I also feel bad for implying that not reinforcing the pattern is the ONLY thing to do. I didn't mean it like that, just that it was the right choice to make in that situation. There are lots of things that can help; therapy, meditation, living a healthy lifestyle, medication, etc. Also, like floatingtree stated, sometimes changing something in your life or environment is the key. Maybe there's something else in your life that's causing all this anxiety that you need to address? Maybe changing your environment can help? There are a lot of options for improving your life that can affect you in more ways than you realize, and go deeper than you realize. For me, there were times when I changed something in my life and felt a weight lift afterwards that I didn't realize was there, or had told myself I didn't care about at the time -but after realized how much it actually weighed on me. I hope you're doing well and I hope you've been able to find things that work to help alleviate your anxiety. All the best."
"Not sure if this is related but... Is there anyone else feeling anxious just by looking at everyone else's posts? Like I really want to help, but every time I read a post or see a disturbing title my body temperature goes up and I start shaking and I sometimes sweat. Specially with the bullying ones-"
"Not sure if this is related but... It's totally normal for specific things to trigger you. There are certain things I fear that causes a reaction in me when I read or hear about them. I do believe that over time these reactions eventually become less strong, but it's ok to feel anxious at times. I think there is a tendency to think everyone else has it together, whereas in reality I've found that almost everyone has something they're dealing with."
"anxiety and sugar diabities hello, i just want to tell anyone about my situation after being off for awhile. i always had anxiety real bad, but last year i was diagnosed with sugar diabities and was put on insulin. i am a whoule different person now and have few bad days. i was also put on closipene for schitzoaffective and bipolar. i am doing great and havnt been in the hospital in a few years."
"anxiety and sugar diabities I know other people who seem to spike when they eat a lot of sugar. I've cut back on my sugar intake some, but it's hard to pass up quick energy, I have a rough job. Which is a source of anxiety, so it's hard to parse between what might be my environment, and what might be things I'm consuming. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Feeling panicky all the time when thinking about withdrawals I am so anxious about possible withdrawal pangs that may happen at any moment throughout the day. I am living eith this anxiety and it's making me so restless and agitated and I am showing all signs of mild panic attack from time to time. Like shortness of breath , muscle tension, feeling my surroundings are foriegn or not related to me and sometimes feeling blind.. so this is a big priblem for me .. I can't focus on work but feels like this all the time .. even though there is no real threat i am obsessing about a percieved threat.. and out of anxiety I am lashing out at peoples as well.. it's like a phobia of things places and events that relates to my drug usage.."

"Feeling panicky all the time when thinking about withdrawals I have no real experience with coming off drugs. I do know that just something like nicotine, which I've only used sparingly over the years, sometimes really hits me and I miss that tobacco. When we're talking about something that was used as a way to get high, or escape one's life, or whatever you took drugs for, well, it's going to be rough, and it's not surprising that you'd feel anxious about not having that, yes? Not even including any fears of withdrawal. I'm more the addictive behaviour kind of person, and I have found myself seriously addicted to things on the internet more than once. Chat rooms, Second Life, things like that. Second Life was particularly pernicious, because a virtual world for me is such a wonderful escape from reality, it almost might have been a drug. So even though I've never been a drug user, I can relate to an extent to really really really really did I say really? because I mean really crave something and think I need it, that if I don't have it I'll go crazy.

"Panic attacks I have panic attacks coming on and off and it happens everytime when I am under a commitment or routine.. This time I think it happened because of a job related thing and I don't know what to do.. I am always feeling my brain is blind and my heart is constructed.. I also feel I lost memory of many things around me like my house , my friends, my belongings, my room and everything.. I blame my job for it but it was not that.. It feels like I am unable to connect with myself no matter how hard I try when I try hard I feel depersonalized and more disconnected like a voice saying myself don't try hard or don't act hard you will never feel natural.. It's so stressful and frustrating to not be myself and feel like I am in the edge of something and will fall down at anytime. I am scared of everyone and hypervigilant about surroundings I feel I will be kicked out from my house for losing job and or shamed or humilated for being unemployed or even the family may call cops on me for being a Burden.. I am so panicky right now.. that my deep fears are turning on and I don know what to do.. I also feel afraid because my face appears so uneasy, stressed out, and afraid or painfull all the time which is giving me very down vibes. All and all I feel like so uncontrollable and this all is so big... I also feel little bit chest pain.."
"Panic attacks Well, I find work particularly stressful also. I constantly have to take a mental step back, and try and back off my anxieties. They can only fire me. That is the worst thing they can do, and then I will cross that bridge when it happens. Until then, I have to try and make myself understand that my anxiety can and will find the worst possible outcome and scream that at me, no matter how unlikely it is that worst thing would ever come to pass. If it does, then I'll deal with it then. Until then, I have to try and remain at least a little calm, lest it drive me insane. Are you currently taking anything for the anxiety?

"Panic attacks As far as a proper panic attack- that is to say, the out-of-nowhere racing heart, feeling of impending doom, desire to be Anywhere Else (or the place that you feel safe in) with no apparent reason ... well, as a young adult I got panic attacks. I managed to grow out of them when I learned what they were (this is much pre-internet), then I treated it as a mind game between the devil and myself, and I would ride the panic attack out and stand my ground. I was able to beat them, eventually. Not that my anxiety hasn't manifested itself with just about every possible physical symptom over the years.

"Akathisia I've suffered from Akathisia for at least a month and a half after an involuntary psychiatric hospitalization, and intake of anti -psychotic medications ( such as fludecate injection and Haloperidol). Essentially in Akathisia you cannot sit still, sleep, lay down or stand around because of a feeling of internal restlessness. This is a nightmare. I'm trying to sit down and write and can barely sit for a few second before I have an urge to move around. Anyone else has had any luck overcoming Akathisia? Reversing akathisia?"
"Anyone wonder if their anxiety...? if their anxiety comes from just feeling flat out ugly? or is it body dysmorphia or what? Allow me to elaborate... Throughout school I always felt like the ugly duckling and was told as much. I did get boyfriends after I dyed my strawberry blonde hair brown and started wearing makeup. When I got to the point where it was time to start working I felt so much anxiety about being around people, because I felt I was being judged on my looks. It caused me a lot of stress and suicide attempts. I wish I could explain the stress, but I can't. When people see stress, they just think ""oh, stress"". But it's way more intense than that, to the point where I drop things, break things (because of clumsiness), make proper eye contact, get uncontrollable shaking. I always hated it because people would say, that other people have it worse because it's so ""shallow"" and ""superficial"" to obsess over beauty standards, and so I felt crazy and rejected by most people I told. ""You're overreacting"" ""You're too sensitive"" ""omg, you're so stupid... I think I felt a little better once I started comparing myself to other celebrities when I was like 12 or 13. Like when Nicole Kidman got with Keith Urban. He was my celebrity crush, and she was an actress who I really liked and I felt I resembled (not as beautiful, but similar characteristics). I always said my crush throughout school looked just like him, and when they got together, I felt relieved like somehow ""my kind"" wasn't completely hopeless lol Of course a lot has changed since then, life and trauma ya know? But I remember how exciting that was for me as well as probably them. Even though I never got with my crush (an later it went away), I was so happy (weird I know). Not ashamed to admit I hated being what people call ""ginger"" lol It seems stupid to most, but it's more than that. My hair was more strawberry blonde than red, but it had more to do with my skin being ""pasty"" and ""sickly""...and I had bad teeth (maybe genetics or the fact that my depression caused me to let myself go sometimes). I was always very envious when other girls could tan and cover up all their ""problems"" (stretch marks, under eye bags, etc). I hate aging because for me, it happens so fast compared to other people because due to my skin tone the signs of it are very obvious when it happens and no tan to cover it up. Nothing wrong with aging, but premature aging (feels like you lost half your life and confidence in your youth). Not to mention I'm very sensitive, so when my mother took me to the dentist when I was 17, and the dentist told me I had 8 cavities, I had a meltdown and thought I was losing all my teeth and refused to go back and pretty much gave up on them. It was nice the dentist told me the truth, but also made it to where I ""abandoned all hope"" lol After that there was no dental care for adults, at least not the amount for what it would cost to properly fix them that I could still afford. I was however able to get a student loan a couple years later for classes at an online for-profit university ($20,000 for like 6 classes) that there was no way I would be able to graduate from because I was a jr high drop out, but everyone said we needed to go to college and get a better job....so. I have dentures now so it doesn't matter anyways. Just wanted to share because I hoped someone would see so they could understand how maybe not just I feel, but other people like me possibly younger are going through. What's it's like, ya know? This is not to make anyone going through the same things, feel worse about themselves, but I keep hoping if I spam enough, maybe someone will care lol BTW ""ginger"" women are very beautiful when they are taken care of, and their health considered just like other people's, and hopefully other people who feel that way who aren't ""ginger"" lol I just want people to see from my point of view about how self esteem correlates to paranoia and stress...anxiety issues. -- Wed Sep 07, 2022 8:20 pm -- So is this GAD or is this body dysmorphia or what? I'm diagnosed GAD and Bipolar. But most of my anxiety really stems from not feeling attractive or feeling ugly or inferior. Like ""why bother"" if the world is the way it is? How do you get over this kind of anxiety? Because I really don't feel there's a doctor on earth that could fix it lol At least not with some weird vaccine or microchip that controls my thoughts like a robot. -- Wed Sep 07, 2022 8:21 pm -- I also have severe anxiety about intelligence and other things, so it's not just looks...It's everything lol"
"Anyone wonder if their anxiety...? Back to the dentist stuff. I did go to the dentist later of course or I wouldn't have dentures. I got them two years ago for $3100 (no bone grafting because i couldn't afford it meaning I can't get implants in the future). they are extremely big and don't fit right (ruined the shape of my face and mouth), but at least I have something lol. Part of the reason I didn't get them for so long is because I had hoped that I couldn've gotten my teeth fixed without them, but the cost was like $16,000 or more (way out of minimum wage pay) and veneers and implants like the celebrities get are like $2000+ a tooth. Before I got my dentures 2 years ago I had major holes in about 8 of my front teeth, so do the math, and that was not for implants...would've been lots more for implants. Anyways, I'm psycho nuts so... lol"
"Anyone wonder if their anxiety...? I turned a little narcissistic maybe recently or possibly most of my life, because after being excluded for such a long time or feeling like everyone hated me, why not just love myself and live inside my head a little?

Because I know they never liked me because I talked to much and was annoying...that's why. -- Wed Sep 07, 2022 8:49 pm -- don't have fish but this is how I feel when interrupted from my inner world to deal with the world that hates my ass...lol https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2mOQJl2Nzfo -- Wed Sep 07, 2022 8:54 pm -- https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6w10v6nn85c Last edited by Snaga on Fri Sep 09, 2022 4:48 pm, edited 1 time in total.

"When you're on antidepressants do u feel emotions normally? Speaking generally, the idea of an antidepressant is that it should make a person feel less depressed, so if it doesn't change how you feel then it wouldn't be working... I can't speak to other people's experiences of taking antidepressants but in my experience, they made me feel the depression less extremely. So I felt like lows were less low. This made it harder for me to identify my emotions generally because it seemed like everything was a bit more ""muted"". For me personally, this made it harder to do my therapy because I couldn't work out as easily what I was feeling because emotions seemed a bit less extreme. Eventually after 7 years I came off of them. What has spurred your question? Are you considering taking antidepressants? In a way, I am not defined by my dissociation. In a way, I am.

"When you're on antidepressants do u feel emotions normally? it depends on the medication your given, some are designed to activate various receptors to make you feel giddy others are designed to turn down diferant receptors to make you less effected by various hormones then there are meds designed as supplements, to increase dopamine,serratonin or other hormone/brain chemistry levels so, no, they are intended to alter your mood, therefore you should be in a differant state of mind however, the emotions you feel and express, should in theory be the same as if you were naturally in the state the meds place you in."

"When you're on antidepressants do u feel emotions normally? This is an old thread, but a very good question. My way of fixing things wasn't working, so I entered detox and rehab to 'break the chains' and learn new coping skills. It was intensive therapy at first and trying different meds to find one that worked the best. I was inpatient for 60 days, so I was off the streets and in a controlled, safe setting. It would be irresponsible for me to give a yes or no answer to this question as we are all different and react to different meds, stimuli and therapies differently. Some don't react favorably to chemicals and they may try alternatives like ECT with success. I asked my doctor about hypnotism and acupuncture, but those are questions outside of the medical realm and she was not qualified to give an answer. I respected that. I began on Buspar and Imipramine about 30 years ago. I am on Sertraline (Zoloft) now. Attending therapy while undergoing medication is very important. You can't just take a pill and hope for a better place. Monitoring moods and adjusting meds is part of the therapist/doctor job. I was asked if I felt any desire to self-harm or harm others at every session. I didn't, but I think they have to ask that if it is listed as a possible side-effect of the med. There are so many different meds nowadays, the suffering must have been horrible in the old days without them. You would just be locked away in some (in)sanatorium somewhere and the family would try to forget about you. I didn't notice a change in myself as much as those around me did. It was heartening that they saw and heard an improvement, where I really didn't feel much different. The Zoloft keeps the incessant self-chatter inside my head to a minimum. This helps me to focus and concentrate on what I need to do. I still write myself lists on priorities and keep it with me. I cross them off as they get done and transfer some to a new list as the paper wears out. Before, I was all over the map and clueless on what I had to do next. It takes time, but it should get better. Dreams may be intense at first, but I was told to think of it as my brain getting better. I didn't remember or care about dreams much before. It was as if I didn't even have dreams. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

He's a GP and an older guy he seemed to know his stuff but as far as OCD goes I don't know that I trust talking that kinda stuff unless I know someone knows a lot about it. It's like with Harm OCD I get intrusive thoughts of harming myself or others free with my breakfast cereal. Pretty sure if I haven't killed myself or someone else after over forty years of that crap, I'm not going to. I mean when I was eleven I was convinced I was going to shoot my cat and drink transmission fluid, in that order, because my brain was screaming at me to do it. Didn't do it. I was probably 50 before I finally figured out hey my thoughts have never made me do something I don't really wanna do, how 'bout that!

"When you're on antidepressants do u feel emotions normally? The chances of wanting to do harm is infinitesimal. Those that have this problem probably have other issues going on as well. Like I said, we are all different. Depression and anxiety can't be cured, but we can hope to manage it. I was assured that BuSpar and imipramine had been around since the 1950's and I was on a mild dose. If I wanted to take more than prescribed or attempt an overdose, it would likely be unsuccessful. The chemical takes a while to build up in the system and takes a while to leave. There is little danger of the 'instant gratification' that makes some drugs very addictive. You have to realize that about 11% of the U.S. population is taking antidepressants and a very small fraction have any noteworthy problems with it. I had dry mouth as a side-effect. The statistics are on Google. Many of the meds used to treat depression are also used to treat anxiety. It is almost if one is the flip-side of the other. Due to liability, doctors must ask this. Lawyers would love to go after entities with money. It is prudent to ask as well, I would feel awful if someone snapped while under my care. The doctor has to recognize a problem and hopefully prevent it for the sake of the profession, the pharmaceutical industry, the patient and the family.

"Does Anyone Else Sigh a Lot? I have general anxiety, social anxiety, OCD, and depression, along with Asperger's. Lucky me. A few years ago, it was pointed out to me that I sigh a lot. Some people take that as me being angry, annoyed or bored. I've had to tell some people, ""I'm not mad, I'm just breathing."" It actually became a running joke for a while. I'm not sure if I do this due to anxiety or because of GERD/acid reflux. I find sometimes that I tend to hold my breath while awake. I don't know why I do that either. I suspect that the sighing is me actually taking a breath again. Does anyone else do this? I ask because my father is angry with me for doing this. I cannot control it. It's so normal and automatic to me. I suspect GERD may play a part, along with anxiety but I'm not sure. I guess I want to know if my father has a right to be mad about me doing this? It offends him. I'm an adult and live with my parents. He only notices it when he enters the same room as I'm in. I suspect I was probably holding my breath while focused on whatever I was doing, then he enters the room and takes my attention away from what I was doing and this leads to me taking a breath - which appears to him as me sighing in frustration. I'm just breathing. From what I've learned over the years, I'm unusual. Most people have not encountered someone like me before. I recognize that I'm very odd. I've found that many people take my normal behaviors the wrong way. They think I'm mad when I'm not. Or they think I'm upset/sad when I'm not. Basically, most everyone misinterprets my body language, probably because of Asperger's. I didn't know I had that until I was 30."
"Does Anyone Else Sigh a Lot? I've never heard of that- I can understand the misinterpretation, but surely your family ought to know how it is with you, by now. They know of your issues, yes? And how many times do you have to explain it's just something you do without even realising it? I've had severe acid reflux, by the way, and I don't ever recall doing that. Only if I have the sensation of not being able to breath- or worse- going all OCD about semi-autonomic functions, which I have been known to do... **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Does Anyone Else Sigh a Lot? Same. I especially do it at jobs when I'm working with the public more, mostly because I get worn out so fast. There's usually no other meaning to it. And I'm really bad about when a customer asks ""how I'm doing""...I'm usually on autopilot to say ""tired"", because it's usually how I feel the whole time I'm there. But yeah sighing and responses that are on autopilot, repeated phrases, responses etc. It's no really necessarily out of boredom, but too tired to think of anything creative to say, so I sigh or repeat things."

Anxiety about age Since having ocd and social anxiety agoraphobia since I was 17 I’m 35 now I’ve missed out on the years that were supposed to be the best. Now I feel like even if I get rid of my anxiety it stop late since now I’m too old. I hate the this society is obsessed with youth in women even more. If I wanted to do things I’ve missed out on I would be laughed at as someone trying to be young. I hate the others my age think that we are old they might want to feel old for most of their life but I don’t just cause your not a kid doesn’t mean your old. I hate reading about how in your 30s supposed to age real fast like really I doubt you just she quickly. I’m tired of it now I have to think about all my anxiety and about my age it feels horrible to think my dreams are gone cause I’m 30 something. I want to get in shape but I guess it’s not possible since I’m now elderly according to society and my muscle are all weakening and all this crap. I’m sorry for ranting but this age nonsense pissed me off and I hope to get help on here way to stop feeling like this
"Anxiety about age hi! (this got so long sorry... I hope it makes sense and can be of help) I think that being 35 is not old at all! And there's nothing wrong with aging. I agree with you a lot, society is just obsessed with youth, especially with women (maybe because it's convenient to make them insecure and sell them products?). I think that considering teenage/twenties to be the best years is kind of overrated and any years can be the best years. Maybe one could be the happiest ever or follow their dreams at 70! Why should the fun stop at a certain age? 30s is young. There's still so many things that can be done! And surely one doesn't become old so fast after turning 30. I think that if you have the possibility you should definitely do the things that you missed out on, you deserve it! If people may laugh thinking that you're ""trying to be young"" they're probably stopping themselves from living too because they've been convinced they're too old for certain things, or they should just learn to mind their business (because they're just plain mean and wrong!). If you're not hurting anyone, what's the problem? Making people feel like after their 20s life is already over is truly horrible. Also being an adult should not mean being always serious and only being allowed to do certain things and that it's too late to pursue what you wish. It's so unfair. There's so many hurtful, untrue and unnecessary beliefs that get pushed on people Your dreams are not gone, you can also have as many more new dreams as you want and deserve to follow them. I think that if you start to ""get in shape now"" your muscles can only get stronger B) I wish you all the fun in the world, and that you can do everything you want! Yes!!"
"Anxiety about age Well, you're not decrepit just yet. I've known women who waited until their 40s before finding a man. One thing when you do start getting old, is that you stop giving a crap what younger people think. Don't listen to the younger set. We all think we're where it's at when we're young. Then the older you get the less that you care what the younger set thinks of you. Yeah I'm old (I'm rather older than you). So? Just means I'm right more often. Ain't no point in being anxious about age, we can't avoid it and the alternative is not something this old fart is ready for just yet, much less when I was 35. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"What do I have, I have never seen somebody with my issue? Since i'm young, I have that thing where whenever I have somebody's attention, if i'm talking, I lose complete concentration on what i'm saying, start stuttering, my mind kind of goes blank for a few seconds, and usually that brings a little panick in me. I fixed so many things in my life and this is the biggest issue that if I fix, i'll become the best version of myself, but this is a big challenge. I don't know what it is. It's like whenever I think of the thought itself of my mind blanking, my mind can go blank. But some situation can trigger that thought to pop up such as when i'm having lot of a attention from somebody ; when i'm talking to somebody when I gotta use my logical thinking basically (studying with a teammate can do it too). I'll do anything possible in life to fix this, because it ruined such a massive portion of my life. I have not seen nobody with something like this on the internet and i'm really wondering what that is."
"What do I have, I have never seen somebody with my issue? I have had the same issue. I start talking to someone or a group of people and then in the middle of my speech, I just draw a blank and struggle to find the words to continue my thoughts. It’s really frustrating and stressful, and the listeners often get impatient with waiting for me to finish. You said you have this happen when “you have their attention.” That could be a key element in your stress to be able to speak. Someone, the listener is your “audience.” They’re paying attention and they have expectations of you. That could be stressful. Usually I have this happen in social situations, but not work situations. I’m a teacher so I prepare my speech beforehand. I really think preparation helps to solve the lack of fluency. But when you’re in a social situation, you can’t prepare. Thus the stress."
"anxiety over bothering others I have schizophrenia and ptsd. That comes with major anxiety. I am terrified of emotionally-hurting, disappointing, bothering, or even angering the people I love. If I make a mistake, no matter how kind or gently someone tells me their feelings are bothered...my heart races, my mind tangles, and my stomach hurts, and sometimes I faint. This morning, I was trying to help someone I was worried about, but I was stupid, and ended up really bothering him. They assured me it was all right, just to not do it again and not to exaggerate. I didn't show him I was upset other than profound apologies, but I'm sure he knew. I don't want to show it either. It would make it all about me, instead about him. It should've been just about him as he was the one hurt by my actions! Still, how I wish I didn't try to help at all, because now my body/mind just feels like it should hide away forever. I don't like to do that to my friends or family. Sometimes I wish I could tell them how I feel, but that would make it impossible to be in any sort of ship with me. My friend certainly knows it though...he has to walk on eggshells with me, which I hate! I tell him not to, and try my best not to get upset when he's being so, so reasonable in his direction. That's just one person, but he has a whole world of his own, and I don't want to badly affect that. If anyone has any tips on how to reel in the anxiety, how to focus on the other person when one has made a hurtful mistake, and how to learn and get over it, I'd be so, so grateful! Anyone?"
"Scared of needles I have a friend who just turned 30. He has a lot of social anxiety issues he's working on getting over. In the past year he has had some health issues that need to be diagnosed via obtaining blood samples. But he will not allow anything needle like near him, so he's never had bloodwork done. I live too far away to be there in person for him, so I have to deal with this long distance. How do you get someone over this fear so he can get his bloodwork done? Is there an alternate method of getting bloodwork?"
Scared of needles If your friend still hasn't had his blood work done I would recommend he get a small prescription of Klonopin or other Benzo just for the blood draw ahead of time. I absolutely hate blood tests and have nearly passed out on more than one occasion. Taking a Benzo beforehand will calm him down. Also lying down will help rather than sitting in a chair. If pain of the needle is also an issue you can put a numbing cream on the vein beforehand as well or ask the office if they have a cold spray that briefly numbs the area. I havent had a test since 2016 but know I probably need to get updated bloodwork. I hate it too but it can be bearable.
"Scared of needles I take it they don't have tattoos.... just a wry observation that having a tattoo addiction gets you rather more used to needles, unless ofc you're having them stuck in extremely deep, or in places you'd much rather them not be stuck, such as eyeballs. The run-of-the-mill shot/blood draw/IV drip doesn't bother me much at all, whereas once they would have been more bothersome- getting a lot of tattoos cured me of that. In fact, that's the most exciting part of getting inked- the moment just before they place the needle gun on your flesh, the anticipation. Having said that, I still can't actually watch myself get so much as a flu shot. I agree that getting a prescription for something to 'take the edge off' would be in order, as long as it's not something that's going to screw the results up. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

Scared of needles I also hate needles. The best thing you can do is drink lots of water beforehand and if you don’t like the feeli g get numbing patches for your arm. If you feel sick or faint after tell them and you should lie down with your feel up against a wall so the blood stays in your head.
"School stresses me out way more than usual TW: S**cide, self-harm, anxiety, depression Hello. I just found this website and thought it might be good to get my feelings out. I was not sure where to put this post since it fits under several different topics so I put it here. Anyways, the title. School is stressing me out way more than usual. Like, to an ""unreasonable"" degree. Given, it's not just school stressing me out, but that's usually what I tell other people because I don't want to get down into the nitty-gritty. For example, if I have a bunch of homework one night I'll get a big panic attack or suicidal thoughts and usually break down in my closet so not to be in front of anyone. I'm in 10th grade, btw. This sort of stuff has been going on for more than a year (ever since COVID started) and it's still not better. In fact, I would say things are getting worse. I now have delusions too, like how my thoughts might be controlled by some outside force or that nothing is real. I sleep way longer than I used to, but often my sleep is interrupted by nightmares. I thought things would get better, because about a year ago I also started seeing a therapist, then taking anti-depressants. My dosage has been increased three times and I still don't feel better. I also take an as-needed anxiety medication that I barely use because it makes me feel even more exhausted. I would tell my counselor about all this but I feel that her advice isn't really helpful and I have trouble talking about sensitive things. My throat tightens and I can't speak. I have had several ""bouts"" of suicidal thoughts in the past, and self harmed occasionally as well. Although, I'm not sure if I should contact the text line because I am suicidal, just not sure if I actually will follow through, but it wouldn't take a lot of convincing either way. If you have read this far, thank you, and please give me some advice if you have any."
"School stresses me out way more than usual Welcome to the forums, kitrit! since 2020 I hear things have been particularly distressing for young people- which surprises me not a bit. I'm a pretty old fart- and from my perspective, there's been a lot of 'the sky is falling' pushed at young people these days. They tried to do the same with my generation- none of those bad things came to pass. The point being is that I think for a lot of people, 2020 has just pushed us over the edge. So much bad has happened, I find myself on an maintenance dose SSRI for anxiety, and all it does is take the edge off- for which I'm thankful, but it is what it is. I mean, it's not hard to work myself up, if I go out of my way to do it. I can sense that I don't care as much anymore about my fears, and that's a good start, anyway. This post could fit several places, but I think for the time being we leave it in GAD. But I sense some OCD style obsessions and behaviours, particularly the suicidal ideation. I have OCD as well as general anxiety- both undiagnosed but I've been this way only over five decades so I'm pretty sure I know what I got- and between my own life experience, and the stories in the OCD forum, suicidal ideation is common as dirt for people with severe anxiety spikes. I've learned to mostly disregard mine- I have no real desire to die, merely to find 'a way out'. And death is no solution. You can't do backsies if you don't like Dead. And, being an old fart, I can tell you that Life is way too short already, without ending it prematurely. Not saying it never happens, but if severe anxiety often ended in suicide, we'd get a whole lot more turnover in OCD... thankfully, that doesn't happen. If I thought this was a serious desire to end your own life, we'd be talking about this in Cutting & Self Harm. But for now, let's not. I've also self-harmed as a result of overwhelming anxiety- a little as a teen/young adult, which I put down to general angst- it's hard to see it from where you are, but even at the best of times, pre-2020, teenagers are angsty . That's not meant to trivialise it- I was very, very angsty as a teen/young adult- it's just how it is. Rites of passage. Growing up is hard. What I'm getting at is it's really hard to see things from a more balanced perspective at that age. Everything is like, so incredibly overwhelming sometimes. And it feels like well that's just the end of the world, when it's really not. And again, 2020 is just one straw too many, I think. I think this past year and a half has been hardest on young people. Actually however, most of my self-harm has been done in my fourth and fifth decades of life. I'm not sure if that's so much of an OCD trait as something else- self-harm throws self-testing and self-administered test results into a bit of a quandary, I think- the usual paradigm seems to be that self-harmers are Borderline to one extent or another. That's a discussion for another thread, however. If your antidepressants aren't seemingly having any effect, might you be able to broach the idea of changing them? Are you still seeing the therapist? If not, can you? Sometimes pills just can't do it all on their own. If you seriously consider suicide, you should definitely reach out to a hotline, or just show up at ER and tell them you're feeling suicidal. I'm hoping this is more the anxiety talking- but if you're getting strong urges, then talk to someone! You have nothing to lose, and your life to gain. I'm old, and still too young to die. You don't wanna do that to yourself, you have your whole life stretched out in front of you. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Prescriptions and Supply Chain Problems I get anxious in a car. That anxiety escalates when I'm sandwiched between two vehicles, or we are in a left-turn lane, and I'm sitting on the right side of the car. I can remedy the second situation by sitting on the left side of the vehicle behind the driver. That way, I'm next to the center medium, putting a bit of distance between me and other cars. I'm in a no-win situation if we are in the left turn lane and there is no center medium. I take 0.25 MG Clonazepam four times a day and 10 MG Propranolol twice a day, sometimes three times if needed. I've also been taking Lorazepam as needed. Dosage varies between 0.5 to 2 MG, depending on the severity of the situation. If I'm in heavy traffic, I will take 2 MG of Lorazepam, 10 MG Propranolol, and 125 MG of Simethicone (OTC anti-gas). I live in an area where good psychiatric care has been hard to find. Therefore I had to go to the county psychiatric facility (which does not prescribe controlled medications such as Clonazepam and Lorazepam) for my other psychiatric prescriptions and get my Clonazepam and Lorazepam from my primary care doctor. The powers that be have been cracking down on general practice doctors who prescribe both Clonazepam and Lorazepam. I had to find a psychiatrist who would prescribe controlled medications. In addition, I've experienced a particularly rough spell since around May or June in which I needed to eat into my reserves. Found a new doctor who I first saw on the ninth of this month. She gave me 10 MG Escitalopram once a day and will either reduce or eliminate the Lorazepam. For the road trip to see her this coming Thursday, she told me to take 1 MG of Clonazepam instead of the 2 MG of Lorazepam. The Escitalopram, which I will have been for two weeks, should already be doing its job. I know I have established a lot to get to the problem, but here it is. I keep my ear to the ground to know what will happen. However, what was once theoretical is happening as I speak. We have inflation that is being downplayed (in other words, it's worse than what the powers that be are revealing) and a supply chain problem. What do I do when it's hard or impossible to get my medications? I already mentioned that I had to eat into my supplies during my current rough spell. Also, I just started on a new prescription, meaning I won't have a reserve if the current problem manifests sooner than later. I can get some of my medications overseas at an affordable price, such as Propranolol, but there is no way to get controlled prescriptions, and the Mirtazapine is too expensive. I haven't checked the price or availability of the new medication."
"Prescriptions and Supply Chain Problems I'm on escitalopram 10mg, and I take a Trazodone at night to help me sleep. I don't know if two weeks is enough time to know if the escitalopram is working yet or not- the average time for it to begin to take effect is two to four weeks on average. And I didn't really notice a change, myself- it's my partner that told the primary caregiver who prescribed it, that my anxiety seemed to be less than before. As far as availability, I think it's fairly common; and as far as pricing- I'm assuming you're in the US- I see on Good Rx anywhere from under seven dollars from Publix for 30 10mg tablets, with a free coupon, to 35 dollars at the likes of Walgreen's and CVS- which totally doesn't surprise me. Wally World's retail price is fifteen, and I think with insurance I pay around ten dollars at an independent pharmacy. I suppose I ought to do the coupon thing; but I'm lazy. Arik wrote: We have inflation that is being downplayed (in other words, it's worse than what the powers that be are revealing) and a supply chain problem. What do I do when it's hard or impossible to get my medications? Well I do the easy thing- I don't think about it. Nothing you or I can do, will change anything. I decide to defer worry for the future. Or maybe that's the escitalopram talking. Probably is, a little. Even I can tell I'm more 'whatever' about stuff than I used to be. So, whatever. Or as Spock told Valeris in Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country , ""You must have faith that the Universe will unfold as it should"". Maybe the preppers will be telling me 'I told you so' before it's over, but I'm not in a position to live in a bunker stocked up with MREs and drugs- so... I don't think about it. It is, what it is.

"Feel weird being alive itself? Severe anxiety because of it? For some reason, 4 months ago, I started thinking about life's existence. Like why we are here, ect. I would continue to deep think, and then that caused really strong Depersonalization and Derealization. Then, every day I would wake up and start thinking about that weird feeling, and I got into this cycle where I felt weird so much that I felt strange *being alive*. I started feeling super-conscious and super-aware of my own existence, and I started asking myself these weird questions like am I really a human? Is life all a game? And then, I became a Solipsist! ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism ) I became this for a week, and I had to pull myself out of this. I continued to think about these weird questions, and I got into a loop of: Feel weird, ask questions, freak out, feel upset because I am questioning life itself, feel weird, repeat. I feel like I have two lives... One life is when I'm distracted from these feelings and I feel normal, and the second life filled with anxiety and self-awareness. I feel dread when I think ahead, and it's almost like I hate being alive! But that's crazy! I feel trapped in my own body! But all of this goes away 100% when I'm distracted. It's insane because I feel like I have to be distracted from my own thoughts in order to live. Sometimes I am able to let these thoughts be... But that only lasts a day or two. No matter how much I tell myself that these are just thoughts, I can't STAND feeling afraid of being alive. I can't relax because I know that I have these problems to be worried about. Are these anxiety symptoms? Thanks for reading. I needed to vent. Anyone else feel this way?"
"Feel weird being alive itself? Severe anxiety because of it? Hi there I don't think you're alone in getting lost in these thoughts- they can be pretty overwhelming. I'm not a professional, but from experience, obsessing over things like that sounds like anxious thinking. I often get lost questioning things and it really makes my head spin when I get stuck on something. The depersonalisation/derealisation worsens the more anxious I become. Have you ever thought about talking with a professional about things at all? Spending so much time worrying doesn't sound healthy. Feel free to vent as much as you need.

"Anxiety causing spitting while talking I'm 32 years old and work in an office job that requires me to constantly talk with people face-to-face in meetings. Over the past 12-24 months, I've developed a speech impediment whereby I spit while talking. Almost without fail, everyone I speak to starts wiping their face while I talk. Its incredibly embarrassing and I feel horrible. It makes me think twice before speaking up in a meeting and its really affecting my job and professional relationships. It happens whenever I speak to someone who is closer than 2-3 meters from me. If they are 3+ metres away I feel more confident and I speak more normally. This also happens with my close friends. The only people who I don't spit on while talking are my absolute closest family members (wife, daughter, mum, brother). Everyone else cops it. I've done the typical google searches and people say to slow down your speech etc. However, I've tried everything from speaking slowly and speaking quickly, loudly and softly. Nothing works. This has started happening at a point in my life where I actually know what I'm talking about at work. I've got a good 12 years experience in the industry. However, this impediment is really holding me back. It seems to be a vicious cycle of spitting while I talk, so I talk softer and appear less confident. Feeling less confident makes me struggle to speak properly. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?"
"Anxiety causing spitting while talking Hello I have a very very similar problem. My job requires me to speak face to face with alot of people. It is a high orifile job and about 2 years ago started noticing this oriblem though now in the last 3 months it has gotten way worse. Now I do it allbthe time even if speaking slow. I have noticed when im relaxed my tongue is not dry an db I dont do it at home. Has anything worked? Do you have the same job? Any treatment, or therapy done? Please PLEASE answer! This is ruining my life"
"Anxiety causing spitting while talking If anxieyt is the cause, treat the anxiety. if it's not the anxiety, you might need to check with a doctor of the mouth or speech therapist (I don't know the term for this professional in english, sorry). He corrects the movements you do when you speak, like a physical therapist would with your posture, so to speak."
"Anxiety causing spitting while talking You could not have described my symptoms more exactly, no offence but it was comforting to hear someone with the exact same problem and same stakes at hand. I am 34 years old and my issue with spitting while talking has begun taking over my life and certainly over my professional work. Like you I have worked my way up in my job and now manage a large staff of professional employees. We talk with our clients one on one every day in close quarters and every time I hold eye contact with either a client or employee for more than a few words the face wiping begins. It seems to be the eye contact that brings on the spitting the most. This has essentially paralyzed my professional growth and has been more than devastating considering the years of hard work I have put in. It started one year ago and I have no idea why, it is slowly getting worse and worse. I have read every voice projection/improvement book I can find, have talked at papers and mirrors from close range to work on softening hard syllabus that may be spitting, and have cut out all sorts of things from my diet in hope of improvement. Sorry to say I can't offer any solutions but can only offer empathy, this situation may very well force me out of my job in the near future. Like the folks before said ANY ideas would be greatly appreciated. Otherwise I just thank you for sharing your story so I know I am not the only one!"
"Anxiety causing spitting while talking I know that this is years later, but you have described my current (and three year long) issue PERFECTLY. As soon as I am aware that I will need to talk someone who is closer than a few meters (receptionist, bank teller, friend at a bar, stranger at a bar, being a passenger in a car), I will have the thought ""oh no - I'm going to have to talk to them and the physiological response is going to start"". And without fail, within seconds, my shoulders will cease up and my mouth will start producing saliva. I try to slump my shoulders, stretch, breathe deeply... I usually have to excuse myself, and try and force body to calm down, but it doesn't work for long. I spoke to a psychologist but it didn't help - I was prescribed mindfulness, however I'm unable to identify how to 'acknowledge the thought while not acting on it', considering as it's physiological response. How do you treat the anxiety when it's the physiological response that brings the anxiety on? It's a feedback loop. The only time it doesn't occur is when I'm drunk or emotionally distracted (such as being super mad or upset) - but even that doesn't hold it at bay too long, because as soon as I realise that it hasn't happened, it happens. I wondered if you'd found a solution?"
"Anxiety causing spitting while talking Hello everyone, My fight or flight happened so many times a day because of this, that I was constantly getting colds and have a general weakened immune system. I went to the doctor, and she prescribed me some medication to help bring my anxiety levels down. The first one didn’t work, but the second one is helping. She then referred me to a cognitive behavioural therapist, and it’s been incredible. She has helped me understand that a past relationship I didn’t want to be in anymore. caused me physical pain during intimacy. This pain kicked off my body to reject him (via stomach cramps, and as it may happen, increased saliva. So close proximity = painful = saliva. Very slowly over the past years, if I ever felt threatened, self conscious, not good enough etc, it would trigger this feeling of danger, and my body’s learned response was to spit (as well as go into fight flight). While I’m in no danger of people being too close, the result is the same. So, the plan. Cognitive behavioural therapy helps me break that learned response. When I first “get too close” to someone, I immediately distract myself mentally in whatever capacity I can (count backwards from 100, count all the money in my wallet etc) to start re-wiring my brain, and teaching it that too close = normal. I hope everyone has already found their own solutions, but if not, give this a go. Find a therapist who is holistic and looks at all angles of anxiety rather than just this one symptom. Good luck everyone."
"Anxiety causing spitting while talking Finally found my community and I got y'all with answers. I'm no qualified mental health professional, but I realized that this (personally intense social anxiety) is a manifestation of obsessive compulsive thoughts. The intrusive thought that we are obsessing over (involuntarily of course) is that we're going to spit whenever we talk, compelling us to do whatever we can to prevent it from actually happening. Naturally. But then it *feels like it does anyway, feeding into these eventually obsessive fears and creating endless thought loops. For an ex. if you focus on each breath u take, does it make it easier or harder to breathe? For me, it makes it harder. Recently, I saw a speech therapist who said my speech was perfect, even better when I enunciated my words. I truly thought so too, surprisingly, but couldn't figure out why I struggled so much talking to literally anyone else. She said to me that the real problem wasn't my speech or even hypersalivation; it is instead a mental and emotional battle. I was basically in the wrong kinda therapy. Instead of enjoying my teen years, this overwhelming fear took over my life. Avoiding conversations as much as I can, whether it be classmates, family members, teachers, friends - everyone! This crippling anxiety ruined my self esteem, making me isolate so badly that I missed out on so many potentially great relationships and life experiences. Even work and money, given the humiliation. I truly did have poor saliva control at one point, but the way it was brought to my attention triggered some deep stuff. I have a therapy consultation this weekend! This isn't forever, wishing you all well!"
"Anxiety causing spitting while talking Thank you so much for your response. Over the past few years since my last reply, my psychologist and I also dig deeper and came to a similar conclusion that you did. It was a thought that triggered an anxiety response. We’ve spent some time getting to the bottom of my feelings of low self worth, how they started through childhood (I had a great childhood, and my parents never meant any intentional harm, but not being behaviourists didn’t know how to meet my needs and so I learnt to cope with their inconsistent emotional availability in whatever ways I could at the time). For those still with this battle, look up generational trauma and start working through it (working through Schemas with my psychologist was a crucial first step to understanding feelings of abandonment which possibly led to low self worth which possibly led to social anxiety). There is absolutely a way through this. We tend to hone all of our intention to the one symptom of anxiety (spitting) and the thought directly before it (“oh no I’m going to spit because they’re standing too close to me) and miss the much broader picture that it’s potentially life long coping mechanisms that have been unnoticed and untreated for most of our lives which thus worsened to symptoms we do finally take notice of. Good luck everyone, you’ve all got this"
"Citalopram withdrawal I’m wondering if anyone has experienced more than 3 weeks withdrawal from Citalopram? I’ve been on 20mg for around 7 years, and Effexor before that. I’ve been on and off antidepressants since I was 13 and I’m now 41. I decided to stop because I was sick of feeling tired all the time, being apathetic, and getting the occasional panic attack even when on the med. I felt fine at first but now it’s week 3 and I’m losing weight because I can’t eat much. I also feel like I’ve become way more energetic and focused, but not the ‘happy’ I felt on Citalopram. I’d love to hear everyone else’s experience because I’m tempted to start taking it again but really don’t want to. Feeling really stuck but just want that happy feeling again."
"Citalopram withdrawal Hello and welcome! I don't myself have much experience with this, although I've been on an SSRI (Escitalopram) myself since only about June. I have noticed that while I'm not as anxious I'm also not as peppy as I somehow expected to be. So your post caught my attention. I started reading about SSRI induced indifference, and wonder if you could go on a reduced dose. Or switch meds. I was also looking at Citalopram vs Escitalopram and I think I read that the latter may be more effective- I wonder if a lower dose of that (I'm on the standard maintenance dose of 10mg/daily which I also read is the equivalent effectiveness of your 20mg Citalopram) would take the edge off without as severe side effects such as tiredness and apathy. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

Commitment phobia Hi guys I'm 27 i am currently on 150mg effexor. I have been struggling with anxiety for almost 10 years when i was 18 in a relationship i suddenly felt uncomfortable and unsafe so i left her broke her heart. Then a few months later i overdosed and i woke up with panic attacks every day and for years it went on different meds etc while i got my anxiety under control i tried to date but everyone i saw i ended up hurting and backing off one guy even came into my work starting a fight apparantly he was her new bf. I didnt do anything intentionally i never had sex or tried. It was just dating. After that i have not tried anymore i came close to someone i really liked but that didnt work out. I don't know what to do anymore i tried talking to my psychiatrist when i was there but i think he just wanted to discharge me for my anxiety and forget my other problems. Fyi basicaly i get close to someone then i get the living $#%^ scared out of me from going on a date or meeting up. Forever to be alone i think

"Commitment phobia Hi, thank you for sharing your problem here. So, You fear getting into relationships, you've also mentioned that you've been seeing a psychiatrist for anxiety. Have you ever tried to question yourself about what it is about relationships that you fear. if you really like the person you are in a relationship with, why does time become such a matter of concern for you? you can try journaling your thoughts and ask yourself the questions that haunt you when you are with a person. what is a commitment to you and do you think every person you are with is asking for a commitment? You broke a girl's heart 10 years back and I think you are still not able to come to terms with the fact that you broke her heart. So once sit with your therapist and try to reflect on why that happened and are you still repenting that? do you fear that you will do the same with the next important person you meet in your life?"
"Checking emotional response anxiety- can anyone relate? I don't know whether this is due to my pure OIOCD, but it’s something I have struggled to understand why I feel this way. It also feels so insignificant compared to other OCD worries that I even feel a bit silly to say it out loud. I have always loved following England at football. Some of my best memories are watching them in tournaments, and the trials and tribulations that came with it. Something odd occurred in 2010 where I think I subconsciously checked how excited I was when England scored. I didn’t think anything of it, until we got through to the latter stages of the tournament. We were paired with our biggest rivals Germany. What would normally come with excitement and anticipation came with some sense of anxiety about not feeling that way about it. The following years watching England, for some reason when England came to nearly scoring, I would feel slightly anxious about how I will react, which would make me not enjoy the moment. I would check others response and feel a bit jealous how they reacted. Roll on to 2018 world cup. I think for the first time in that period of time, I over thought it less, and enjoyed the tournament more. I got the feels back big time. However, for one of the games I was ill and couldn’t go out to watch it. When I watched it at home I felt like I was missing out, so when England scored I celebrated, but it felt a bit hollow. I was better for the semi-final and went out to watch it. When England scored first, I had that slight anxiety feeling, which made me not enjoy how I would normally. We eventually lost that game, and where I would normally be gutted, I didn’t really feel anything. Roll on to this tournament and it feels rife. Every time England look like they’re going to score, I feel a bit anxious, which makes me not be how I would normally be at a game. It makes me feel sad that I am not enjoying the moment how I should be. This has been off the back of a bit of a relapse in some other OCD related issues. I just want to relax and enjoy the football and not have this weird anxiety about checking how I should be feeling when celebrating. Against I am feeling jealous of seeing how others are reacting. It feels so irrational, but I am struggling to break out the habit. Obvs having OCD means I am questioning and doubting whether I even really like watching England now. However, I know this not to be real. I understand in the grand scheme of things this feels very inconsequential compared to other themes, however because this means so much to me, it really affects me. Anyone relate to this? I have read somewhere about a type of OCD where you check your emotional response to events, and this can affect how you feel about things."
"Panic Attacks While Meditating Hello all, I tried meditating again last night, it is something I have been trying to make a routine of. Every time I do it I end up with worse depression and panic attacks. I also end up not sleeping. Why might this be? It does not relax me, I end up in a hyper-vigilant state when I do it. It was something I was hoping I could do before bed to help me sleep."

But as you said, you can't comprehend what's going on in the present. How can you enjoy one thing when you have to choose all the time? Life's full of distractions, but you can fight them with small steps. Stop the thoughts going on in your mind and your electric gadgets for a few seconds. Try it, it's hard, I know. But just do it once. Thoughts of past anger, the scary future, the awful news on the internet now, turn it off for a sec and just notice the moment now where you are sitting or standing. These precious few seconds of your life where you notice things right now in real time? Things are probably not too bad."
"Severe Anxiety about being alone Hello, I was diagnosed with GAD back in 2006. I have regular anxiety attacks, especially in the evening before going to bed. Especially, I am very anxious about being alone. I am 35. I live with my mom (I don't like living alone)..I have no partner or boyfriend, I have no other family than my mom. And I know that one day my mom will be gone. I have severe anxiety attacks about this.. about staying completely alone without anyone.. I am worried what if I lose my job or not be able to have a job and I won't be able to pay the mortgage and I'll be in the street.. what if something happens to me.. and nobody will be around to help me! Is it normal to be that anxious? Do you think I can overcome this anxiety? Do you think I can live alone without a man and without anyone and be ok? thanks for your advice!"

Advice needed Hi so I don't have anxiety disorder. My anxiety is tied up with did. Snaga can vouch for this ( hi snaga) . I know SOs arnt normally allowed to post in forum but this is an emergency. Bf had a breakdown at work yesterday but they didn't offer time off and he has to go back in today. He is so anxious he had to take knockout drugs to get to sleep last night. His ex is coming round Tommorow to supposedly drop off some possessions of his that she had been holding hostage ( including childhood toy) combine that with his useualy worry about not getting Christmas perfect and being a burden to his parents etc I'm worried another breakdown is on the cards. I've never been in support role before so I'm hoping you guys could give me some advice. How do I help him through this?

"Advice needed *waves* Hey! Judging by the time stamp, I assume he's already gone back in to work? How did it go? And..... wow keeping a childhood possession as hostage is about as low as it gets. Gosh I don't know- when someone with an anxiety issue is on that spike, it's awful hard to mollify us. I mean, OCD forum. Does he see someone about anxiety? Is he on anything to help take the edge off? I really am not sure what I could say, except remind him Xmas doesn't have to be perfect, and as far as his situation with his parents, I really don't know the backstory, but just remind him that he's human? We all need help from time to time, and worrying about it, isn't going to make it better.

"Advice needed Glad to hear that! Work... drove me here to PF, anxiety in a roundabout way (I was self-harming over something work-related, and found PF on a search engine about self-harm). For me, my last place of work I often found my body in fight-or-flight mode, as I walked down the long entranceway to start a shift. Intense, crippling, and unrelenting. So I definitely empathize. And, well, sometimes, co workers sure did add to it. A LOT. I've worked with careless partners, I've worked with lazy partners, I've worked with partners hopped up on alcohol and drug cocktails. When you're afraid to take a break, because you literally don't know what absolute insane, you're going to get us FIRED $#%^ you're going to come back to, well... oh yes, I know exactly how it feels to have work sap the life from you, one rapid heartbeat, at a time. I've come home and drank; or self-harmed; or just rode around before going home so I can scream my throat raw. Or just come home, sit in the car, and think of all the nice ways I could off myself. Meh. Some nights I'd just dissociate to the point of I'm just watching as the body does what was expected of it. Once my 'others' began to emerge as distinct personalities (Sam was the first) it was.. both scary, because I'd never been aware of another fronting before, and a blessing, because once enough cooperation had been reached, Samantha took over driving to and from work, and I was just along for the ride- my anxiety then, most of the time, anyway, could turn on when I walked into work, and turn off, when I walked out, and stayed at work, and came home with us, a lot less. I digress- point is, I really empathise with the BF. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
Uncanny Valley Anxiety I can't open doors anymore due to this fear that I will open it and something foreignly familiar will be staring back at me. I had an operation done on Monday and woke up during the operation and I think it has shaken me severely. I've been having nightmares and I am really scared to be on my own.
"Anxiety with family Hey all, Ive always had anxiety but ive noticed for quite a while now that its so bad when im with my family/group of people, in case an arguement starts. Im nervous the whloe time that someone will say something that will end up in an arguement. I hate conflict/confrontation so this is really affecting me. Ive started making excuses not to be with family. I take benzos but they dont help with it. Any advice on how to get over this? willow ps sorry for rambling!

"Anxiety with family Hi weepingwillow, I don’t really know if there is a way to become more comfortable with conflict & confrontation & accept it as inevitable. I’m a book person, so if it was me, I’d search out books that may help, but that’s just me. Some people aren’t book people & that’s why there are audiobooks."
"Anxiety with family Hey, Thanks for the reply. Im a book person too and it didnt even occur to me to look for a book about it but i will give it a go. Thanks again! willow Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you. ~Nathaniel Hawthorne"
"Anxiety with family I try not to get involved in family conflicts that don't directly concern me. It would probably only escalate things. I let then speak and hear them out. I try to stick with safe, non-confrontational discussions. I also have an escape planned if needed. I will leave if it gets too bad. So far my fears are pretty much unfounded. The recent holiday dinners have been more relaxed than some in the past. The family is getting smaller. Mum and my brother have passed. Dad is 91 and I still try to enjoy his company when I can. There will come a day when I don't have any of this. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"Anxiety with family Hey, Thanks for the reply! Yeh i would tend to stay out of any conflicts too but i just hate being there if there is any. There hasnt really been any that i can think of, i think its mostly just my anxiety. I grew up in a house with a lot of conflict so that could maybe have something to do with it. I want to make the most of my family while i have them too. willow Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you. ~Nathaniel Hawthorne"

"Anxiety with family Well, it sure can be uncomfortable, when there's a family squabble, and you're not in the thick of it yourself- I know it can be awkward when extended family is concerned.... now, immediate household... I found leaving the house, and slamming the door on my way out, to be a good option for that. Just saying. Vents off some steam, and lets them know you don't enjoy that $#%^.

"Feeling like a horrible person. For the last few months, I have had this horrible feeling that I am pathetic. That everyone hates me. That I'm worthless. That I'm just a child. It does not let me concentrate because it is all that I think about. It does not let me socialize because I think everyone hates me already.It does not let me do the things I enjoy because I think they are a waste of time or something I should not be doing. It does not let me work on my personal projects because what if I make something bad? It completely takes over my thoughts. I know these fears are irrational. I know that I should just ignore them. But I just can't get rid of it. I cannot function like this. So... Any tips on how to deal with it?"
"My Therapist Tried To Brain Wash Me I knew something was wrong with the sessions. I mentioned on a previous post some red flags. I feel betrayed. I am worried I am still under some sort of ""Brain Washing"". He did a lot of the things mentioned hehttps://science.howstuffworks.com/life/ ... ashing.htm Can I ask the people on the forum, is, ""noticing"" a form of brainwashing, like making me notice lots of things, such as colours, signs Tree's sounds etc when I am out and about. He would tell me to notice things and repat the thing I am noticing in my head, or even say it out loud. When I do this, I find myself getting anxious and can't think. I become hyper-vigilant like a solider on high alert when I ""Notice"" things. He would do inaproprite things like lick his lips when I talked about some sexual things that happened to me in the past, constantly check the time, yawn when I talked about something I found interesting etc. A.D.D, Anxiety, Depression Dissociation"
"My Therapist Tried To Brain Wash Me I'm not a professional but here are my thoughts. There are some similarities between brain washing and behavioral health therapy, in my opinion. The idea a lot of the time is to get you, or whomever is in therapy, to change the way they think. For example, if you are like me and have harsh negative thoughts about yourself and want to change the way you treat yourself, if that makes sense. Also, noticing the things around you is a common way to ground yourself during an anxiety attack, taking you out of the attack and back into the world by way of taking note of your surroundings. Licking the lips could be an unconscious response to your recounts of sexual experiences, as this, along with such things as biting the lip are consistent with body language present when thinking about sexual things. Granted I think your therapist should probably be aware of those behaviors and how they make you feel, but they are sometimes unconscious behaviors. And I do think it's rude of him to check the time constantly and yawn when you speak, but you never really know what is driving a person and their actions. Perhaps he is anxious about an upcoming event or didn't have time to grab his morning coffee. Does this happen often during your sessions? I have anxiety as well and I know it is very easy to look into stuff like this. I am not in your shoes and will not tell you that you are wrong, but things are not always as they seem, especially with anxiety. If you feel that you are being brainwashed, perhaps look into seeing a different therapist."
"I’m scared my boyfriend will kill me He just applied for a gun and since he has no criminal record + is employed, I think he’ll get accepted. I don’t know what he’s planning to do with it, but he signed up for one after an argument between me and him. I don’t know if he’s planning to kill me or himself. I don’t know why people want to own guns anyway when they’re only killing machines. we just argue all the time even though I love him and want to be with him, he just keeps twisting my words and accusing me of bad things I just can’t fight anymore. I want out but at the same time I really like him and don’t want to be alone again."
"I’m scared my boyfriend will kill me Seek a therapist now and strongly consider ending the relationship under your therapist’s support. You do not trust him and communication is absent or toxic, it seems. Being alone does not have to mean lonely. Couples therapy may help, if you are both willing to go and want to salvage the relationship. Ask about the gun...why he is buying it, will he be taking safety lessons, will it be kept in a lockbox, etc. People own guns for various reasons but your relationship sounds unhealthy, at best. You may be jumping to conclusions, but communicate with him about this, the gun purchase. What is your plan of action? For your own safety and your concern he is suicidal? Ball is in your court. Stay in or get out. Take care."
I’m scared my boyfriend will kill me If this is your first thought when he is buying a gun I would probably leave the relationship as soon as possible ... it doesn’t sound Heathly at all and for those thought to come in to your mind there must be something there

I’ve done all the social distancing except 2 times ...sun I had to run in and get groceries and wore a mask and then Tuesday it was a neighbors birthday and some neighbors hung out and had some drinks ... well now since then every time I have a scratch in my throat or cough it kind of feels Me out ... I have no fever at all ( I keep checking ) but I know it sounds redicioulous but what would be some good ways to get over it ...sorry for ranting but it really affected my sleep last night and I know it isn’t logical but I still give in to it

"ADA request Hello, I go to the VA. I've been diagnosed with General Anxiety for a long time. They did an assesment and more popped but I have done ADA request before through them for wfh. I'm a computer worker and half of my team, including my boss is remote. I have trouble getting things done. I want to do more for myself. I would like to do an ADA that'll let me work from home but they tell me it'll make my anxiety worse and I don't understand that. I've had anxiety all my life. When I get stressed, I get bad. Working from home is less stress/more time. I can take usefull breaks/lunch where I can't in the office. Less noise...less distractions... I was hoping to get some understanding here, because I don't understand their latest response."
"Weight/Texture Related Anxiety Hi all! I'm Evan. So, all my life, as long as I can remember, I've had this intense, strange kind of anxiety/panic. It would wake me up in the middle of the night in panic attacks, give me this feeling of intense sheer terror, give me nightmares, and it sounds absolutely absurd when I think about it. It's triggered by the feeling or sight of something being too light, small, or thin, or intense size differences, such as (TW if you experience this) being pulled through the eye of a needle. (TW over) I've never found out what it was. I've only met two people, my father and my friend, who experience this same thing. For all of us, it's given us nightmares and panic attacks, it's a terrible feeling. Does anyone know what causes this? What could be the root of this? I bring this up now as I'm wondering if, and I could be totally wrong in this, it could be connected to trauma somehow. Or, it could be something completely different. Please let me know if you also experience this, or have any idea where this does/could come from. Thank you <3 Much has changed, we are multiple, call us Rory please"
Healthy ways to relieve anxiety? I've been having all kinds of anxiety lately due to work and other things and I'm increasingly using porn and sex to alleviate it. It's starting to become dangerous legally and personally. I can't drink and I can't take psych meds because of my job. I really can't even go to therapy. Does anybody have any good healthy alternatives? I've tried riding my bike with my friends but that just doesn't satisfy me the same way.
"Healthy ways to relieve anxiety? Hi jilall78, For me, my anger & my anxiety go hand in hand, so I’ve found a pinned thread in the anger management board here extremely helpful: it’s called how to manage anger & reduce stress, I think. Riding your bike is good. I also have been riding my bike lately too. There’s a hill behind my house, I can barely breathe by the time I get to the top & it gets my heart rate way up. That calms me. Good luck."
"Healthy ways to relieve anxiety? Hi Jilall78, Anxiety for me is an issue too. I wish i could tell you exactly how to reduce your anxiety but there are soo many ways to reduce it. not every solution works for everyone. For me (sometimes) depending on the situation I'm in I simply practice breathing exercises where i inhale through the mouth hold my breath for as long as I can without passing out then slowly exhale. That however does not work in every situation. Another thing I like to do is work out. I find that deep exercise lets out all the negative energy and gives me a renewed positive energy. Again please give these a try maybe one of these things will work for you. Good luck!"
Anxiety & Depression?? Can anxiety & Depression co-exist or rather rotate? I am not big on dxs. I guess I just never follow the symptoms listed. But had a revelation in therapy & spent days in a I-don't care-about-anything mode. Then suddenly woke this morning & realized the neglect that has caused. Correcting everything. The familiar anxiety is back. Realized this same thing happened a week ago. Depressed for days followed by anxiety & accomplishing things. Keep saying this will even out when work thru therapy revelation. By that I mean get back to the anxiety that's familiar. Is that wishful thinking?
"Anxiety & Depression?? Anxiety and depression often go hand-in-hand. The same meds can be used to treat both at the same time. Combined with good therapy, recovery is possible. Each case is different. I hope that you can achieve stability. I was treated with BuSpar and Imipramine years ago. There are many newer meds out now.

"Anxiety & Depression?? I have both. For me, it can be like how you described; periods of emptiness and depression, and a sense of relief when it subsides because it feels good to just care about something even if it's rooted in anxiety. Most of the time for me it's more like, I can't do a thing because I'm too anxious to, then I feel useless and depression sets in."
"Anxiety & Depression?? It is an evil wish, but sometimes part of me almost wishes for depression to the point where you feel nothing, so I will escape my anxiety... mind you, I know I do not really want that, that is a horrible state of being, I had a close friend on here who had that kind of depression.

"Problems in speaking to people Hello, I wouldn't say that I have social anxiety but I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks from time to time . I get really anxious before family gatherings or any outing or gathering where I'm not familiar with most of the people. Which I guess is normal . But the problem is that there's a speech barrier that I face while talking to people I don't talk to on a regular basis and new people in general. I fumble alot and its like I just forget English or any other language that I'm speaking at that time . I wouldn't say I'm the fluent in all the languages i speak. But I'm a decent speaker . I just talk really really poorly while talking to new people or acquaintances. Which is something i need to tackle because it comes in thw way of my career . As someone who is studying marketing making calls to unknown people is going to be life . While I was interning at a firm in the marketing department I had to make a lot of calls and I tried everything possible way to avoid it . I mailed and texted and kept delaying . And a simple call took a lot of practice and breathing for me to do . Campus placements start soon and I'm afraid I'm going to mess my interviews and Group discussions because of this. Could someone please tell me how to overcome it or if you experience the same how do you tackle these problems . Thanks for listening. ."
"Problems in speaking to people I took a Speech Writing elective in English class. It helped me think about what I was going to say, prepare what I was going to say and then say it in front of people at a podium in front of the class. I'm generally an introvert, quiet and shy. This would have been terrifying for me before this and my mind would have gone blank. I was also treated for panic attacks/anxiety and depression in the past. The same medications normalized both. I also had to dispel the 'shame' that kept me from who I really wanted to be and kept me drunk for many years. It is about gaining self-esteem and confidence. It is about organizing in your mind what you want for an end-result and then how to get there. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"Problems in speaking to people I have a fear of speaking to people at work. I am afraid I am going to miss a promotion, new job, or being comfortable at my own desk. I started taking anxiety medicine to keep calm at work. It really helps a lot. I have to usually write a script before I call someone for customer services. I never remember what I am suppose to say because of my anxiety. It does suck, buy I think that you can get through it. Just continue to watch videos and practice in front of the camera. I even went out and bought a headset and pretended I was at a job. Do not get emotionally attached. They are only customers or employees that you are trying to talk with. Try putting yourself in their shoes. They only want to know your professional side. Good Luck...!"
"OCD and negative thoughts Hi, I just found out from my therapist that I have OCD. Dealing with the negative thoughts is hard, but I'm wondering, how else does anyone deal with that? We were talking about starting a medication, and possibly sending that recommendation to my doctor, but we haven't talked much about it yet. Has anyone had good experience with that? I'm just wondering, as I'm just learning I have this."
"Constantly in Fight Mode Been thinking about this lately. I suffer terribly with anxiety and it's mainly because I live in fear of losing my job. This might seem a bit odd to some people but I find it really difficult to get along in mainstream society. Anyway I feel that because of my anxiety and the whole ""fight or flight"" thing, I'm constantly in fight mode. I see a problem and I have to deal with it head on. This is an issue because I'm misunderstood as being aggressive but I don't know any other way around it. What do I do? I would love to change this way of being. England's Glory"
"Constantly in Fight Mode I used to live in near-constant fear. I told myself that I didn't care anymore, just so the feelings of vulnerability wouldn't get to me. It was a stupid defense, but was all that I had at the time. Apathy didn't help me, it wasn't who I was and I don't think that it ever worked to my advantage to think in this way. I did get mental health treatment after I quit alcohol. The doctor put me on an antidepressant that was also an anti-anxiety medication. Alcohol no longer quenched the panic. It had stopped working for me. The meds did stabilize me so I could listen, decide and act (mostly) appropriately, instead of always reacting to everything by first instinct. It did take awhile to work on my brain chemistry. There was no instant relief. I had to change both my perceptions and behaviors. I had to retrain myself and choose a fresh identity from bits and scraps of the old Wally. I tried to hold on to the good bits. Fear of losing irreplaceable things is still a very real fear, but I have to trust the Creator and Her plan for me while I am here. I tell myself that if Plan A doesn't work, try a Plan B. You can't totally be prepared for every contingency, but it helps if you have a seamless compromise or back-up Plan in mind. In the stress of today's world, having a 'fight or flight mode' really isn't such a bad thing. It just shouldn't consume us or have us in a constant state of war. Breathe deeply. Trust the system. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"Constantly in Fight Mode I find anxiety really hard because I never had anxiety until a couple of years ago. I think it's my age as well sometimes. Like I've spoke to a few of the lads (it's always men) at work who are about my age and they describe going through a similar thing but for different reasons though. Sometimes I also say to myself ""###$ it"" but it doesn't work because I have to keep going and as long as I keep on going the I have to keep on fighting. Maybe this is what's normal Wally. Thank you for your help. England's Glory"
"Constantly in Fight Mode Anxiety is hard for me as well. One thing, and I hope this might help, that I've started to work through in therapy, is trying to replace negative thoughts with positive ones. It's hard when you go through anxiety, and having OCD myself, probably makes it harder."

"Intense Muscle Lock, During a Panic Attack Hi, I'm wondering if anyone has any idea what this means. I often have horrible panic attacks, where I feel like I'm in the electric chair, and my body completely seizes up. Electric chair is the beast way to explain it, because of the amount of pain flooding through me, during this time! It feel like that, or as if there is fire, and razor blades flowing through my bloodstream, along with a billion volts of electricity. My whole body goes completely stiff, eyes roll into my head, hands into claws, and I'm stuck, for a long time. Much like a person, after they've been hit with a taser. I'll be stuck like this for up to 30 mins, at times. My consiousnous does fade, for the most part, but I'm still about 10%. I can recall some things, sometimes. For example, I can remember one occurrence where my boyfriend was patting my face with a damp cloth ( because I sweat so much), or I can remember hearing people around me freaking out and wondering if I'm having a seizure. My body is usuall really dead tired, and in a lot of pain, after that, for a while. It takes a lot to bounce back, from those episodes. They start as panic attacks, and turn into what feels like a seizure, although I probably don't actually know what a seizure feels like, but it's the best description I can come up with. They last anywhere from a few to 30 minutes. It depends on how stressed and stimulated I am, or the severity of the preceeding panic attack. However I occasionally have mild ones, that will come out of nowhere, with no panic or warning, first. Does anyone else have this, or know what causes these episodes?"
"Intense Muscle Lock, During a Panic Attack Hello and welcome! Let me ask you this: how do you know they're not seizures?

"Intense Muscle Lock, During a Panic Attack Snaga wrote: Hello and welcome! Let me ask you this: how do you know they're not seizures? They seem an awful lot like what I would imagine one to be like. Honestly, I don't. I always worry if that's what it is, and it's what I call them, sometimes, ""panic seizures"". I have done some reading on the symptoms of a seizure, and they seem to be kind of similar, but not really. I've talked to my doc, who doesn't take anything I say seriously, and likes to look things up on Google. I'm currently looking for a new one. My last pdoc told me it was just a panic attack."
"Intense Muscle Lock, During a Panic Attack Well, if your physical doctor discounts it, and your pdoc leans towards panic attack, then that answers my question.... I have severe anxiety at times, as well as OCD, and I have experienced many symptoms that will plague me for a while, then go away. I've been dizzy, palpitations, muscle twitches, disassociation, tight muscles in this spot or that, etc etc. Never have I done what you describe, but I've found anxiety can be very clever in coming up with something new in the way of physical symptoms. So for me, anything is possible- it just sounds so extreme, that I wanted to make sure you'd had it looked into. And again, like the post I maneuvered into being seen in BPD and DID, some of what you described in this thread, has a disassociative feel to it. So that may be factoring into things. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"anxiety, texting, boundaries. help plz. hi. i don't really know why i'm here, if i'm being honest. i don't want to bother anyone close to me, i guess. plus, it feels like such a stupid thing to struggle about right now... idk. i broke up with someone a few weeks ago. it was messy, but i made it out and did as much damage control as possible -which was,,, hard. i panicked, went into a downward spiral and all that jazz... some of you certainly know the feeling. anyway. i had moved on already, and i over them. completely. that's not the issue. but they came back a week ago, to ask me how i was doing and for my address so they can send me something/stuff. and i just... i panicked? i still do? it freaks me out and exhausts me to text people so it was already difficult, but it just got worse. i left them on read a week ago and i have no idea what to say because it feels like the more time passes, the worse it is. i don't know how to say no and i have an anxiety attack/am on the verge of tears every time i try to answer, and it's horrible because it feels like my overreacting but i have no control over it? lately my anxiety(&depression) has been getting worse, and i'm so scared of alarming others that i either put on a mask, sleep or stay in my room. texting and even just talking is bad, with everyone. i say random #######4 and then go through breakdowns throughout the day. i'm shaking all the time, my heart beats so fast all the time too. everything is too much and i go into overdrive for the tiniest things. i don't know what to do. i don't know what to do, i feel like i'm about to explode"
"anxiety, texting, boundaries. help plz. Well it kind of sounds like you are dealing with quite a bit. I think you are the only person who can truly know the real you but likely if others knew they would totally be ok with you doing what you need to do to take care of yourself. I can tell you that if you were anyone in my circles, my family etc... that I would definitely want to be helpful and I would really want to know so I could do my best to be helpful. Its not a burden to help people who are important so I'd really encourage you to talk to a parent or sibling or close friend that you think may be helpful. I wish you the best and hope things get better soon."
"Strange anxiety/panic I can't put a name to? So ever since I was born I've experienced a type of anxiety/panic that no one but my father has been able to understand. I believe I got it from him. The best way I could describe the trigger is something too big going into something too small. Sounds weird, right? I know it does, which is why no one takes this seriously. This has caused me countless horrible panic attacks and gives me a complete wave of terror that puts me in extreme fight or flight/panic mode. It has screwed up my life a lot and I have never been able to put an exact name or explanation to it. I've also been too afraid to write it out. Does anyone have any idea what this could be or what could cause it? I just really need to know, for the sake of me and my dad. Thank you! <3 Much has changed, we are multiple, call us Rory please"
"Strange anxiety/panic I can't put a name to? Well, the first thing I think of is childhood sexual abuse. Coming from that angle, it doesn't sound so weird, if you ask me.

"Strange anxiety/panic I can't put a name to? Amazing what seemingly innocuous thing can set us off. One person's silliness, is another's terror. Well that all would be stuff for therapy, methinks... Except yours is a bit soggy on 'repressed memories, are they not? But memory can be such a plastic thing.... 'since you were born'... is there not time you can lay a finger on? I used to say that I was afraid of this, or afraid of that, all my life but, when I started to really think back, a lot of mine come from one instant in time that, I can, after all, remember. Although apparently even as early as three or four, I can remember (barely) instances where I possessed a dark imagination that I'd wish on no child. A lot of mine though, can trace back to a mystery infection that was bad enough to trigger a house-call (which by my time, was a rare thing to see- I'm old but I'm not Norman Rockwell old) where I ran a wicked temperature. I.... don't know, can't say, but I suspect it triggered a now know autoimmune source of anxiety/OCD behaviors. PANDAS I think it's called. Not the cute zoo kind, more the demons from Hell kind. Even though it may have been very early on, I can't help think there must be some point in time, young enough to make it casually seem like forever, that brought some of these odd triggers, on.... but I'm just thinking aloud. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Terrified I’m some kind of sicko When I was around 13 I discovered I had a fetish, it’s a fetish that is pretty tame but rather uncommon, I like to see girls get wedgies, so on Instagram I found a bunch of people (male and female) anywhere from 13-20+ and some of the people posted pictures of them giving themselves wedgies. Now over the years I saved pictures to my iPod. Now as a got older I had so many pictures and videos (most of them regular completely legal porn) but I still had some of the wedgie pictures from over the years that’s I didn’t even realize and when I was 18 I found out how strict cp laws are, so I went back and deleted anything that even looked under 18. I was completely shocked when I found that out and it has terrified me ever since. It makes me think that I am some kind of perverted pedophile because they weren’t 18. I cant talk to anyone because they would think I’m a sex offender and I can’t stop wondering if they would be right. It just keeps tearing me up inside."
"Terrified I’m some kind of sicko Hey scaredoflifee! Growing up, a lot of people find things about themselves they might not like, or seems strange to them, like a certain fetish. Having an interest in things like that is natural as you get older, and I will say most teens with access to the internet will find things like this and sometimes even keep them. It happens. (Though viewing it underage is illegal it still commonly happens) I think it was a good idea to delete ones that were underage. Since you're 18 (correct me if I'm wrong),that could count as a crime of some form. Since you were younger before then, having attraction to other people around your age is also, of course, a normal thing. Honestly underage people should not be posting things like that in the first place, but your attraction to it wasn't sick or creepy. Just beware from now on of the ages and everything of things like that. Since this isn't a direct attraction to minors specifically, but rather the act itself, you probably shouldn't worry at all. I'm no professional, just want to clear your conscience a bit and let you know you're definitely not a ""sicko"". Hope this helped <3 Much has changed, we are multiple, call us Rory please"
"I have burning questions that require extinguishing Dear PsychForumers, I've been having a lot of trouble and, I know this is not a place for a diagnosis ... but I'd like to at least narrow down what my problem may be. In the interest of time, here's an itemized list detailing in chronological order my history of issues. [*]I began experiencing symptoms of OCD at a very young age - one incident involved me having an intrusive thought about breaking something expensive of my mother's that she treasured. I didn't want to and it caused me a lot of distress wondering why the thought crossed me mind. I was eventually convinced - with a little help - that it must be the chatter of demonic persuasion. [*]When I was thirteen, my dad had a heart attack in front of me at Six Flags and was in a coma for a week. Two years later, I began having severe panic attacks (the kind where I thought I'd been poisoned or was dying - I didn't know what panic attacks were). They've all bun subsided, at least the ones with that level of severity. [*]Recently, reflecting on my life, I've come to the conclusion that I've been manipulative and self-serving on a lot of occasions. When one incident or another comes into my mind, my stomach sinks like a stone. I feel I've treated people in some pretty heinous ways as a means to and end. A lot of the time - not all - I was unaware that the thing I did was inappropriate. [*]I'm twenty six now. I have no job and hardly ever have had - two weeks was the longest position I've held. My education was arrested in the fifth grade because I ""performed poorly."" I was supposed to be home schooled but that never materialized. I've never kissed anyone. Well, I've never kissed anyone and not ###$ up enough to leave myself unembarrassed. I have trouble talking to people of my own age. Trouble maintaining friendships. Don't know the first thing about flirting. I'm gay so that makes it a bit more unclear how I'm suppose to interact. Oh, yeah, and all this has led me to self-medicate (weed... alcohol... Y'all know the drill). I've tried to spare as few details as possible. Based on what I've told you here, did anything stand out to you as, ""oh, it's probably this?"" I can't seek counseling at this time and I'm not using this as a substitute. I just want to get a little closer to finding some answers. Any help along that journey would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading my message. I look forward to hearing from you all."
"I have burning questions that require extinguishing I don't think forum members are allowed to suggest or offer potential diagnosis. I think it's okay to do research and self identify with certain disorders, but if you want to know for certain your best option is a therapist or doctor."
"I have burning questions that require extinguishing I think it's okay, within our own experience, to say what something sounds like... I have no qualms at all, for example, of telling someone with HOCD that they sure do seem OCD to me and that sorry, my gaydar isn't pinging.,, which isn't the same, as telling someone Yes, you definitely have OCD! That would be pushing the forum rules, yes. And anybody 'in the business' who comes and starts telling people what's wrong and exactly how they need to fix it, soon feels the banhammer, if they don't stop it. Professionals are expressly forbidden from posting as such, only as peers. As long as it's a 'well I have ___ and that sure seems like ___ to me, I'm not going to look askance at a YMMV kind of response. This is peer support, and it is expected that peers will compare a poster's issues to what they know about the malady, and about their own experiences. And will offer feedback.

Crashes my quality of life and I don't know what to do. I don't know what caused me this because several years before I was not like this. I think something in the past connected to criticism of myself caused it.

Fear and Anxiety When Talking To People @Snaga It can be one person and a group of people. Group of people is worse. Talking face to face is hard and talking on the phone is hard. Texting is the easiest for me as if I didn't have the problem.
"Fear and Anxiety When Talking To People Hi HotPepper. It sounds to me like your anxiety is connected to the traumatic event/s you described with your previous employer. It’s great that you have already introspected and found part of the problem. In your conscious mind, you understand that he was a poor people manager. You said that he expected things from you without proper explanation, and when you did the correct thing of asking for clarification; he yelled at you and made you feel useless and inferior. This reflects on his poor management skills, and not in any way on your ability or worth. The next step will be to convince your subconscious brain of this, i.e., to genuinely recover your self-esteem. *mod edit* is an interesting article I found on the way we talk to ourselves in our minds, and the impact this has on our self-esteem. Take note of the conversations you have with yourself before a social gathering. Are they positive or negative? Are you reinforcing these anxious thoughts by criticizing yourself even further? If so, make it a habit to speak only kindness and love to yourself (even if you sometimes feel you don’t deserve it). When a negative thought enters your mind, combat it with something like: I am confident, smart and worthy. Only good will come from today’s interactions. As I embrace socializing, I will learn and grow every single day. In time, your brain will start to give you these messages and healthy thoughts automatically. I hope this helps and all the best with your journey! Last edited by Snaga on Wed Dec 05, 2018 10:26 pm, edited 1 time in total. Reason: link removed"
Fear and Anxiety When Talking To People There can be many reasons to feel anxious to talk to people May be you could be nervous of what they will say or that you will say something wrong. I would say don't be afraid . You have to talk to get to know others and you could even make some new friends. Also do meditation in the morning which will give you inner peace and confidence.
"Electrical feeling? Anxiety related? When a social situation gets especially intense, like someone is angry, yelling, or showing extreme emotion (crying hysterically) I get this feeling I can only describe as being overloaded with electricity. I feel like I’m an electrically charged tuning rod that’s literally crackling with energy. It makes me feel like I’m going to explode and I start to shake all over. Then—this is going to sound like I’m loony—it feels like what I can only describe as an “other” takes possession of my body and responds to the situation in whatever way necessary to return the emotional intensity into equilibrium. For example, I feel this electricity when I am in a group and someone starts talking and everyone else ignores the person. Then, even if I don’t want to, I respond to the person being ignored. Another example, recently, my friend was road raging on a group of construction workers to their faces. I started smiling at them and waving even though I knew it’d make us look weird. After we drove off my friend said “you’re too nice you just made me look insane!” And I didn’t want to do that! But the electrical intensity of her outrage was so intense for me I had to diffuse it somehow. What the heck is this? Am I insane? When I google about this all I keep finding are web MD articles about social anxiety zaps. This is not the same. It isn’t a zap, the intense electrical feeling flows throughout my entire body."
"Electrical feeling? Anxiety related? When was your last physical exam? Blood pressure, circulation and nervous system issues, chemical/endocrine deficiencies or imbalances can show up as physical symptoms under stress. My breathing changes when I am headed into panic or distress. I used to hyperventilate without being aware of it. Then my arms, legs and lips would begin to tingle, vibrate and fall asleep. It felt like I was having a heart attack, which made the panic avalanche. After this was pointed out to me by a doctor during an attack, I learned to keep tabs on my breathing. Deep, slow breaths and distraction usually brought me back to normal. It is good to stay in touch with your body if it is trying to tell you something. I would start with a visit to your personal physician. Describe what is happening. They may want to start with a blood test. They may refer you to a specialist for further diagnosis. Rule out any physical things first. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"UNUSUAL TRIGGER - PLEASE HELP! Hello. Something has been weighing heavily on my mind over the last few days, and it's triggered my anxiety. This is based off of something I recently read. I have a fairly high IQ, and I know it's ridiculous, but it's a worry nonetheless. Maybe someone here can help. My concern is that our consciousness dies in our sleep and is replaced by a copy. At first, I thought that couldn't be the case due to dreams and brain waves that are recorded during sleep studies. But then I read that's not enough evidence for consciousness to continue while we sleep. They said that dreams could just be memories with the illusion of consciousness when we awaken. So on to my question. Are brainwaves and dreams proof that our consciousness doesn't die during sleep? Help is much appreciated. Thank you."
"Severe Anxiety Welcome to the forums. I was in treatment for anxiety attacks some time ago. Many anti-depressant medications will also help stabilize anxiety, so anxiety and depression are treated together in many cases. It was bad enough where an anxiety attack could slip into panic. I used to medicate it with alcohol, but that caused another slew of problems. One thing I have trained myself to monitor, is my breathing. If my chest tightens up and I feel like I'm suffocating, I can easily hyperventilate. My arms, legs and lips tingle and it can feel like a heart attack. This can make the runaway panic even worse. Deep, slow breaths and a distraction usually help me get back to normal. If you haven't already, I would go for a complete physical exam to rule out any chemical or endocrine imbalances. If all look OK, ask your physician for a referral to a counselor or therapist to find help and relief from this. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"Severe Anxiety Thank you for the information. I have been to my doctor several times over this. And do you have cited to apply a new medication to my daily regiment. I feel like it is working sometimes... And I know what the stressors are that caused me to have anxiety / panic attacks. Unfortunately I cannot do anything about them. As they are brought on by an individual and sell them by circumstance. I as well tend to enjoy a rum and coke at the end of my work shift and when I get home late at night. But one has turned into 2, two entered into three... So on and so forth ... I can smell the darkness in the path in front of me because I have been on it before, and I don't know how to get off of it or turn around"
"GAD & Emotional Flatness. I'm 17 & have suffered ongoing anxiety since I was 12 (diagnosed w/ GAD at age 5.) I worry about stuff like dying, the world ending, etc. I've had problems with emotional flatness since I started medication when I was 14. It got worse when I was on Risperdal. The medications did not make my anxiety go away; they just made me less reactive & affected by my emotions and more emotionally flat - but still generally miserable. I haven't taken any medication in a year, but continue to feel emotionally flat. I don't seem to care about anything anymore and I can't cry or feel sad. I've also developed problems with memory and thinking & life feeling unreal. I'm wondering if there is a way to get rid of this problem, because medication obviously didn't work."
"feeling very sick Hello...I have never posted in a forum before, but I am feeling that I must ask questions that I have in my mind in hopes someone can offer feedback. I'm nearly in tears so here goes. I have been on and off with Benzos, Xanax, Valium, and Klonopin. I have always been so nervous that I would take them nearly every day, sometimes more than I'm suppose to and would often gain a tolerance. Recently, I was placed back on Klonopin after discussing with my doctor my feelings about my Xanax no longer working... I felt as though after an hour passed by I would start feeling sick and anxious. I thought maybe I had developed a high tolerance and was going through withdrawal... So I was back on Klonopin. I haven't been taking it for about a week, and started up again 3 days ago. I know that Klonopin is longer lasting, so withdrawals wouldn't begin right away, however, after about an hour I would feel anxious and break out into a sweat. I started to increase the dose until I was calm, and still an hour later I would feel those horrible feelings... Is it possible that I am feeling klonopin withdrawal so soon? I have never went any higher than what I was taking... I really don't know what's going on with me and I'm so miserable. Maybe its something else? Please, if anyone has any advice I'm all ears... Also, I was wondering, I'm prescribed Seroquel. I have been off it for a few days (it makes me hungry) could that be causing these sick feelings? If I start taking it again would they subside and would I be able to take Seroquel and not rely so much on the Klonopin? I’m also prescribed Adderall, a very low dose. 10mg but I break it in half for 5mg. I noticed when it wears off I don’t feel well and when I take the klonopin it doesn’t help. When I use to take Xanax it would relax me more. Would my doctor put me back on Xanax if I asked him before if I could go on Klonopin, because the Xanax tolerance went up? Maybe it went down? I don’t know how it works Thank you so much for allowing me to share my feelings and ask my questions. I would appreciate any feedback."
"feeling very sick Welcome to the forums. Everyone has different levels of tolerance and different side effects. Some have side effects that are atypical or unpublished. It is not advisable to start and stop prescribed medications or change dosages on your own without consulting your physician on your plans first. As a peer, I think the people who are most familiar with this situation would be you and your doctor. Your doctor or pharmacist should be able to answer your questions, make suggestions and adjust or change the class of medication you are on if it is causing you issues. Contact them. As a recovering alcoholic, I must abstain from sedative-type drugs myself. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"GAD, MDD or ADD? A therapist that I was seeing with my wife for marital suggested to me that I might have ADD, based on some of the problems I told her I was facing at work. I did some research, some reading and answered a few online questionnaires, and had some discussions with my family doctor and with a local psychiatrist. Based on those discussions and on my reading and personal research, everything points to me having ADD or Inattentive type ADHD (I don't have much of the H symptoms): I have difficulties staying engaged in work discussions and meetings, keeping track of tasks at work, as well as paperwork and bills at home, I am very forgetful, I get distracted very easily, always start grandiose projects and plans but never seem to finish them, and I am very disorganized at home, my car and at my work desk. At work (I'm a developer), I'm often capable of figuring high level conceptual problems and discussing complex abstract solutions, but I do poorly and get into frequent trouble because I am slow and sloppy, and frequently get blocked on small details and simple mistakes. Many of these symptoms I remember struggling with since my late teens, but they have gotten much worse in the last couple of years (I'm 40). Several people have told that for some people medication really helps. In fact some described it to me as ""It's like having your glasses off, and then putting them on: Everything becomes very clear and obvious."" The psychiatrist I was seeing didn't want to put me on medication before I had a formal psychological test. The psychologist who tested me said that I definitely don't have on ADD, based on my results. He tested me for math skills, memory and vocabulary - basically he was saying my IQ was too high for someone with ADD. But instead that I likely have General Anxiety Disorder or Major Depression Disorder (He mentioned the word 'Anhedonia'). The thing is, I don't usually feel sad, or suicidal or anything like that - although I do feel down from time to time, I feel it is mostly driven by my failures at work and my constant underachievement more than anything else. He insisted that my test results were not consistent with someone with ADD, and that moreover ADD improves with age, whereas in my case my symptoms seem to be getting worse. He also mentioned that GAD and MDD can have cognitive and functional consequences similar to what I have, and that most likely I will need CBT, not medication, to address my problems. Am at loss. My problems at work have always been there (since my days in school) and they are now getting to the point where they are endangering my job. Every single second hand and first hand description of ADD I've had describes my own life perfectly, and I thought I had finally arrived at the root cause of my perpetual underachievement. I thought all I had to do was seek treatment and I would be able to get it. Yet the psychologist disagrees and now it seems like I am headed for several more months of therapy and discussions with psychiatrists before I know what to do. What can I do? Is the psychologist right? Does high IQ and math ability contradict an ADD diagnosis? If so, why do I identify so squarely with the symptoms of ADD? What can I do? I am getting desperate"
"GAD, MDD or ADD? AlexBird wrote: What can I do? Is the psychologist right? Does high IQ and math ability contradict an ADD diagnosis? If so, why do I identify so squarely with the symptoms of ADD? What can I do? I am getting desperate High IQ and math ability do NOT contradict an ADD diagnosis. They can help a person compensate for the difficulties presented by ADD, which probably explains how you got this far without medication. And the kind of discouragement you feel, because you know you aren't achieving as well as you could without the ""static"" caused by ADD, is also common. (That's another analogy I've heard: with medication, it's like the radio station you're trying to broadcast is suddenly tuned to the right frequency and you don't have a lot of static to try to get past.) Did you have symptoms as a young child also? They may not have interfered with school, but were you a daydreamer, forgetful about chores, etc? I think you need to have had symptoms before age 12. And it's also not true that it improves with age. It can improve, but plenty of adults have enough symptoms to cause impairment. I read somewhere that after one's teens, one third of people with ADHD get better, one third stay the same, and one third get worse. The diagnosis isn't made by psychological testing alone--self report measures and reports from family members (your wife, for example) are a key part of the assessment. As long as you meet the criteria in the DSM V and there isn't anything else going on, that's how the diagnosis is made. Did this psychologist have expertise in adult ADHD? Based on what your account of what happened, I would be very surprised if you said he did. A psychiatrist with experience in treating ADHD can make the diagnosis (usually these are psychiatrists who also have training in child and adolescent psychiatry)--it often isn't necessary to have formal testing done unless you want accommodations and need ""proof"" that you have it. That's my understanding, anyway. I would say to trust your instincts and your research, and find a professional with the specific expertise that you need. They are out there. (Maybe that sharp marital therapist can give you some referrals?) Dx:DID/OSDD First post Our journey thread"

You can get better or worse from time to time, it depends on the use of coping strategies. ADD can cause great distress and anxiety, but also an anxiety disorder can cause ADD like symptoms. In the end it sounds like you should see a specialist for ADD to really make sure what's up with you."
"Panic attacks When I mow the lawn I hear thousands of little chidren screaming causing panic attacks. Friends & family have suggested that it's the weed-eater that I have. I have tried various methods to block out the sounds to no avail. 1) does anyone know if this is a thing, 2) is there a weed-eater that has helped. earbuds & loud music doesn't cut it."
"Can someone tell me if this is general anxiety or social? I met a man on a dating app a few weeks ago and we were supposed to meet for a date this weekend. Everyday he texts me in the morning and a little bit throughout the day, but we mostly talked at night. Today I texted him this morning and he never responded, which is not normal. All day I was really worried, nervous, anxious, on the verge of tears, even my stomach felt like it was in knots and I had no appetite and had to force myself to eat lunch (usually I’m starving), and I felt like I would puke or had to constantly use the toilet even though I knew I didn’t really have to. (These physical signs are brand new to me, usually it’s just the negative thoughts and emotions.) In the past, I’ve been ghosted without warning so that’s what I thought was happening today. These were the thoughts I had: What did I do wrong? Why doesn’t he like me anymore? Will I ever find anyone who will like me? (I’ve never had a relationship before and I’m almost 31 so that’s why I was thinking that.) Why is he ignoring me? I’ve never ignored him... Finally in the late afternoon, I couldn’t take these feelings anymore and I texted him. I saw he was active on social media throughout the day so that added to the anxiety. I was upset at this point, I felt like it was rude to ignore someone that long, especially when I don’t ignore him. So I said that was immature. And he responded with: What are you talking about? Now my brain just can’t understand his point of view. Didn’t he see the text? Didn’t he know he ignored it? Didn’t he know that he’s never done that before? So now it feels like I’m the wrong one here, although I wasn’t the rude one, he was. Now I feel like I need help for anxiety. I shouldn’t have to feel this way all day long over someone who might not care anymore. Is this social anxiety because it’s about a “relationship” and communication or is it general anxiety? And do I need medication or therapy?"

how well i've been doing with work and school. i have three amazing jobs in a very competitive field and have a great gpa. this has become such a huge part of my identity, my ability to do well in those areas. it has come to mean EVERYTHING to me. but now it's all falling apart. every part of my life has been tainted by this horrible mental anguish and exhaustion and anxiety i feel every day lately. i stopped going to classes this semester because i just couldn't leave my house anymore. started to isolate from my friends, telling them not to talk to me, ignoring their pleas to connect. now we're talking again, but every interaction just makes me want to cry. the more i talk to people i love, the worse i feel, and the more i break down and push them away with my crazy ######6 behavior. and for a while, even all of that was okay, because i thought i was still doing well at work, still doing okay in school when i went for tests. but at some point, even that stopped. after years and years of dedicated, non-stop school work and professional work, it's all falling apart. i've started to get terrible, failing grades in all my classes. zeros from absences, and from not handing things in. terrible test grades. i've gotten second chances from so many professors, and still end up failing because i don't take them. i just cant do anything i want to do anymore. every time i go into work, i can't do anything. i can barely get anywhere on time. i'm always rushing around at the last minute, or arriving late, and have been spoken to about my bad attendance at one job recently. i have never been spoken to for *any* disciplinary reason at *any* job before. last week, i went to work and had to leave early and had to have my coworker drive me home because i was so depressed and anxious and generally out of it (dissociative?) i could barely understand where i was or what i was doing. when i didn't feel like i was going to pass out, i felt like i was going to break down and sob hysterically. i felt so out of it and confused that i genuinely thought i may have had a focal seizure or something. my brain just stopped working all of the sudden. at another job, i straight up did not do something i was supposed to do.. and i don't even know why i didn't do it. i have no clue. it was an important thing, and i just didn't do it. and then this week, at that same job, i put something off for three days, and every day i was asked to do it, i said i would do it. and then, i didn't. and i didn't even explain why, or asked to put it off. i just didn't do it. and finally, at the job i care about the most, i slept through my ######6 shift this morning. i woke up 10 minutes before i had to be there to *teach a class*, and had to call and have someone there stop what they were doing to, at the very last minute, teach for me. cover me. because i can't even wake up on time anymore, when people really need me. i'm a ######6 disaster. i'm ######6 garbage. now, it's 3:00 AM, and i have a final at 9:00, and i just can't do my ######6 work. i can't. i can't do it. i'm so scared. i'm so panicked. i am failing and i don't know what to do. this class talked to me about my attendance WEEKS ago, and yet i still have not gone in since spring break. i don't even know if the final is actually tomorrow. i just think it is, based on the schedule. but i don't know for sure because i haven't even been in ######6 class. i don't know how to handle this. i am so ######6 scared. i have fallen so far behind in everything that i don't even know how to fix it anymore. the idea of sitting here and studying for this exam i have in 5 hours feels so overwhelming it makes me want to cry, because studying means i'll have to face exactly how much i've ###$ up and how much i've fallen behind. and how little i can do to fix it. i don't know who i am anymore. i don't know who i am or if i'm worth anything at all. my life was nothing for 95% of the time i've been alive. then, at the very last second, everything changed. everything got better. people said i was worth something. people cared about me, and were proud of me, for the first time. because i did well in school. because i got these great jobs. because i didn't ###$ up. even when i was really overwhelmed, i never ###$ up like this. never. i powered through. i got through every shift, and did well. i got through every class, and did well. and now i can't even submit ######6 homework. i can't even get above a 50 on a test. i was supposed to transfer to my dream school this fall, and now i don't think i'll be able to. i think this is going to ###$ it all up. i was supposed to graduate this summer. i don't think i can now. i think i'm ruining everything i've built for myself these past two years. i think i'm ######6 myself over in every situation. i think the people who used to be proud of me, used to praise me, used to trust me, are now being failed by me. i don't think i deserve any of the things i have. i think they're all going to go away. i think i'm going to be worthless again, and i'm not going to be able to rebuild this time. i'm so scared. i'm so scared. i don't want to ruin this. i don't want to break this. i don't want these people to abandon me. i don't want my bosses to be ashamed of me. i don't want them to get rid of me. i want them to be proud of me. i want to be proud of me. i want to know that i'm doing things right. i just want to do things right, but i never can, and this is so ######6 scary. it's hitting me so hard that i'm not good at anything anymore. at least before, when i was struggling, i could cling to this idea that at least objectively, superficially, professionally, academically, i was keeping afloat. i was preserving a good future for myself, for when i would feel better. but i can't even do that for myself anymore. i'm letting everything i love crash and burn all around me and i'm doing nothing to fix it, except screaming at myself as i lay down in my bed, screaming at myself to get up, screaming at myself to fix my stupid ######6 mistakes, my easily fixable mistakes, and watching my body fall asleep instead please help me. i just want someone to help me. i keep trying to go to therapists but it never works out, we never click and my schedule is always too crazy for me to justify seeing people who i don't have a good theraputic relationship with. i have a lot of trauma related problems and it makes it really hard to see therapists. unfortunately their attempts to help me can often be inadvertently triggering, and i leave. my last therapist i left earlier this spring because she tried to force me to talk about that trauma, she refused to continue seeing me unless i started to talk about it so i just stopped going. and now i'm supposed to be studying abroad this summer and moving in august so it feels like if i try to see someone again i'm going to have to leave the minute i get my first appointment with them. i'm on my own for all of june and i don't even know if i'm going to survive at the rate i'm going. everything is so scary. life is so scary. i am so scary. i am so scared of how capable i am of ruining my own life. i am so ###$ up. this is so ###$ up. please help me"
"fear is ruining my life - please help Hugs to you Ascella , if you want some . It sounds so overwhelming . I feel like we get so caught up in day to day stuff that it can be impossible to see anything beyond what we're going through right now . But I think that's what you need to try and do . Nothing is going to get better until you get this addressed , even if it means taking a hiatus from school , putting off your trip abroad , quitting your job ( or taking a leave of absence ) . Because you need to focus on what's causing this crippling issue . Have you had a physical check up lately ? School can be gone back to - nothing you've done to this point will be ""erased' , studies abroad will always be there , jobs will come and go in your life . Your priority is to get help now . Is there anyone in your life you can reach out to ? Friends , family , school counselor or mental health resources ? It's OK to put everyday life on hold while you try to get yourself out of crisis . More than that , it's essential . Please be safe and be gentle with yourself . You've taken a positive step in coming here to let it all out and that takes strength ."
"Question about my mental health. Hello People! I'll just start with my story. I am a 24 year old male. I have what you can consider a happy life, got a good job, a loving girlfriend and family, no troubles whatsoever. So around 3 weeks ago, a friend came over to my place and we smoked some Marijuana (I am not a regular smoker, I maybe smoke once every 3 months.) It felt alright, but soon after I experienced what is called a horror-trip. In my head I had a feeling, that I couldnt explain to anyone, my body never felt that feeling before, it was a feeling of helplessness, fear, sadness and shock. After that night, i felt horrible the next day. The day after that I started feeling better, until some days ago, when that feeling came back. Immediately after that feeling hits, i start feeling really sad, and scared, it happens at random moments or before it hits. It is like a feeling, that i know something is wrong in my head, and I can feel it at the back of my head, my muscles start to shake, it is really uncomfortable, it kinda makes me want to cry. I've tried to search the Web, to see what it might be, the closest it gets to is anxiety. So I am here asking, is it true, does it stay with me forever, or is it just a temporary thing, my body trying to cope with it, since it never experienced that feeling before. I have no medical records of mental illnesses, I was fine, before I smoked it. Thank you for your answers in advance!"
"I cannot leave my parrot Hi all. I'm new here. I think I found a great community here. I'd like to say hello to all of you. The main reason I join this group is that I can't handle an issue in my life nowadays. I work from home with my husband in our home office. And we have a lovely African grey parrot since 2013. So we really got used to our parrot. She is with us day and night. She's our child especially for me. I have strong bonds with her. And on these days I feel these bonds very effectively, may be as strong as causing harmful effects. On these days we're planning to move to another country. This is a very good opportunity for us to have a better job. But unfortunately, we will not be able to take our parrot with us. Because its species is in the endangered species. And we have to prepare so many documents for her. Passport, health report, report from CITES and more. So maybe we can take her with us after one year when we settled there. Until this time, our family accepted to look after her. But I am very worried about that. Even they said us they can look after her, I don't feel better. I am very sorry that I leave her. And I constantly think about disaster scenarios. Like, she is falling into depression, she is thinking that we left her forever and we'll not get back to her, she's plucking her feathers and many more. I'm worried about her for 7/24 and I can not deal with it anymore. When I told that to my husband he said to me that we cannot take her with us. And he did not promise that we'll take her after one year. So that means there's not hope to take her with us. But I think I cannot live without her and I'll try to do that one year later. The thing is that I can't give her responsibility to someone else. I cannot trust someone else. I think our family cannot look after her like me. If something bad happens to her if she becomes ill, how can I blame them? They told me that they can send me pictures, videos and I can make video calls to see her but that's not relieving my mind. Do you have any suggestions for that? How can I do? Thanks and I appreciate any answer."
"Husband is obsessed with my past. I'm not sure where to post this, and I feel odd coming here and writing this, but the problem isn't going away. Brief History: Husband and I have been married for 7 yrs, been together/lived together for 10 yrs. Very happily married, 2 kids, couldn't ask for anything more, except maybe winning the lotto. I've never cheated on him, or even flirted with other guys. I am quite the recluse, not many friends, don't get out much, stay at home mom. The problem lies in my 'relationships' before him. For some reason they really bother him. It's not a constant thing. He can go a long time w/out thinking about it, but then something (don't know what) will trigger the thought, and he obsesses about it. Sometimes (like now) it gets so bad he has trouble functioning because he can't get the obsessive thoughts out of his head. Technically, he is the only man I have ever dated. My past 'relationships' that bother him consist of: When I was 17, I met a man off the internet, he was 28, and had sex with him. I went back 2-3 times. It was a low point in my life, I have self-esteem issues, and I didn't think it would matter. I had no feelings for the man, wasn't even attracted to him. The second guy, was a friend, and we didn't have sex, I just spent the night with him, and yes, we fooled around a bit, but both decided we didn't want to go any further. That's the extent of my sexual relationships before my husband. At first, years ago, when he mentioned it bothered him, I thought it was the circumstances of the first guy, but now I don't think it would matter who it was, or what the circumstances were. Sometimes when he obsessives about it, he doesn't want anything to do with me. Other times, it's like he's marking his territory (which trust me, I don't mind) where he's pulling me aside to have sex 3-4 times a day. I kinda like the possessiveness of it, but he told me it bothers him becuause we should be making love out of love, not because he's trying to 'erase' any other guy that's been there before him. How do I help him deal with this? I try to be supportive and just remind him that I love him, but it's not enough. Most people would just say get over it, it was before you, but I can't do that, I can see how much it effects him, and I love him too much to belittle his feelings."
"Well, at least he's recognizing his issues, and appears to want loving, intimate sexual encounters. Either that, or he craves that ""possessiveness,"" won't come out and say it, and is manipulating you into it. Hard to tell. Does he give you any other guilt trips? And are you a recluse by choice, or as a way of appeasing him? While I am, at times, bothered by the fact that my (male) fiance had other women before me, I subscribe to a nice quote: ""I love you now, so why would I care how you got that way?"" (Never mind how many people I've been with before him, lol.) Your man seems to have some unresolved issues. You guys should probably shop around for a counselor. I say ""shop around"" because it seems to be a delicate matter, and not every therapist will ""click"" with a client. I'd also recommend that YOU see a counselor, preferably a separate one, and get an objective opinion on your relationship. I don't mean to say that there is anything wrong with taking care of your loved ones, but it shouldn't be done at the expense of your needs or your self-worth. Do not take my advice before talking to your doctor/counselor/other professional. Depending on where you live, you may be able to find free, confidential care. Most importantly, sometimes your shrink can be wrong. Get a second opinion."
"I always ask a girl how many guys she's been with. It's just a natural curiosity. I remember one girl who rattled off so many names that I didn't have enough fingers and toes to keep up with the count. But in the end, it really doesn't matter. As long as she takes a bath and cleans them away, it shouldn't be an issue. In my opinion, your guy's behavior is a little beyond normal in regards to this. I agree with Frayed that he should seek counseling, as I don't see this sort of behavior going away on its own."

He tries to get me to out, make friends, do stuff, with or without him. There are no guilt trips, not even about this. He just shares with me when and how much it is bothering him. I don't feel guilty, I just wish I could take away his anxiety over this."
"OK, I had to check. I apologize if I came off a bit abrasive or callous. I saw a few potential red flags, and I wanted to clear them. That said, I think it's pretty admirable that you want to help your husband. I wish you and him the best of luck in finding a counselor that he clicks with. Also, there's a difference in wanting to help, and letting someone's emotions become your own. I hope that you can continue to be supportive of him, but not at the cost of your own happiness. As much as you want to, you can't take away his anxiety. Please, please don't tear yourself apart. You sound like a fabulous wife and mother. Be good to you. Do not take my advice before talking to your doctor/counselor/other professional. Depending on where you live, you may be able to find free, confidential care.

"Husband is obsessed with my past. I just wanted to write to you - and any one else who ever sees this post who has the same issues- this condition that our partners has, has a name. It’s called Retroactive Jealousy and can be thought of as kind of like an OCD condition. My husband is also suffering - and making me suffer - from this condition. For 10 years of our marriage he has every so often bought up my past and called me horrible names. The particular event that he is obsessed with happened about a year before I met him. I was horribly drunk to the point of being unconscious and was taken advantage of by 2 men (boys really at the time). I didn’t report it to the police and instead internalised the blame and shame for it. One night when I was really comfortable with my one day to be husband I told him of that event and how awful I felt about it. He shared secrets with me too. But ever since then he has tried to blackmail me into having a threesome because apparently I did it with them why not him? And lately it has come around to me wanting it, not a sexual assault. I have only just come across this condition, and if you google it it will explain what is going on in their heads. I have been put on trial by my husband for years, with any previous information I have given him being held against me. He calls me names and says horrible things to me. But now I know why. If you are in this situation please google retroactive jealousy and if you are unsafe, leave. And for gods sakes, see a counsellor. We shouldn’t have to be defending ourselves for things we did well before we met our partners. It’s not right."
"Frustrated For some reason after suffering a stroke about 8 months ago, stress turned into anxiety. I have feelings of some anxiety most of the time and more intense anxiety during stressful situations. It seems like the stroke took away some protection from anxiety. I have been on Wellbutrin off and on for years, taking 100mg twice a day with no side effects. It has generally helped my mild depression. I went to see my doctor about the anxiety and he had me take 7.5, mg of Buspar twice a day. I experienced dizzy/faint feelings for the whole three weeks I was on it. I went to see my doctor again and he took me off the Buspar and gave me the 300mg Wellbutrin hoping that would help with the anxiety, it made it worse. I called in and they suggested taking the Buspar once a day with the Wellbutrin . I think this has helped with the anxiety a little but I still have it and the dizziness/faintness has returned. I am wondering if I should go back to 100mg of Wellbutrin and take 1 Buspar and see if that helps. Any thoughts on what to consider. I have been on the curent mix for a little over a week."
"just some thoughts First time user so bear with me. I don't know where to start so I'll basically start with how I am feeling right now. I feel like the whole is too depressed. I am not very social but I hang out with friends every day. And I feel they are all depressed, the are continuously trying hide their depression. Is everyone like this, is it normal? I feel like I can pick insecurities too quickly, and it bothers me. It gives me this control over them, I can make them tick. This feeling is too uncomfortable. I cant even try to explain. Maybe some other time."
"Severe anxiety and depression here's what I've tried... I'm coming here because quite frankly I'm getting beyond desperate. I have just recently started therapy, and I'm hoping it will help but right now the anxiety and depression are extremely bad. I'm taking several medications: Klonopin and Budpirone for anxiety, Trazodone for sleep and Cymbalta which I hate and am hoping to get off of. I've been having suicidal ruminations, severe anxiety and paranoia about my job, and I'm losing interest in everything. I'm withdrawing and I just can't deal with any other stress at the moment. I m trying hard to get a handle on this. What can I do."
"Severe anxiety and depression here's what I've tried... I'm not sure, except to remember that, 'this too shall pass'. I'm unmedicated, save for the case of beer I've been working on. I'm in the same general boat as you, anxiety about my work is not only justified at the moment (for a change, I'm also very paranoid) but extreme. I don't know what's going to become of me, atm. Suicide ideation... I mentioned that in the OCD forum, just a little bit ago. Having a lot of that, yes. A desire to escape. I don't really wish to be dead. I think. It just seems like a nice escape, at the moment. You're taking meds, and going to therapy. Something I envy, right now. I think giving those a change to help, is the best thing you can do at this time- just stay the course. I... am very tempted to try and get some professional help, myself. Like you, I don't know how much more I can take. One thing I've found, however, is that we can take a lot more than we think we can. I think because a lot of times, we don't have much of a choice about it. I remind myself, or try to, that it could always be worse. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Not Quick on My Feet Hi, Feel free to direct me somewhere else. The issue as I see it is that I am not quick on my feet in discussions or social situations. Or a better description is that I sometimes speak quickly but without thinking sufficiently leading to gross inaccuracies. I am effective though in problem solving but typically by myself. Grades back in school have always been very good. Thinking before I speak in group or tense situations has always been difficult. Some anxiety exists. I am not sure how much additional focus is needed versus just being able to access information based on shortterm or general memory that I need to tap. 5 to 10% of the time I am fine based on state of mind, but mostly not. As an incidental, I get along slightly better with foreign language speakers. The goal is to be better in these situations. This can be a real provlem in many situations. Ideas or additional questions welcome. I realize more information may be needed."
"strong intrusive thoughts over tv show scenes I've seen Hey, I've had this on and off for a few years now and it really is quite difficult to explain so basically sometimes after I've finish a tv show I'll have this thing for a week- to a month depending on how long it stays it for where my mind turns into a sort of picture house of scenes from that tv series and it really is intense at times. So i finished this one last Wednesday and from Thurs-morning to now I have these really strong thoughts I think i just need to know what happened in certain scenes exactly so i end up going back and watching those scenes over and over but it doesn't help too much because probably an hour or so later I'm trying to picture that scene or several how they were displayed in my mind but i'm guessing this is an impossible task. So this time around it's quite intense allot more than the others i have about 10 scenes from all sorts of episodes flicking through my mind thing is it's weird because sometimes I don't really want them to go in case i forget what happens in those scenes. I have an intense urge now to check through them again which would require me to go through probably 3 episodes to find them again so I'm wasting allot of time in the day at the moment and if i don't go to check them I have insane anxiety untill i do. I don't know if it mainly gets triggered from a good story or something because it doesn't happen all the time but only sometimes on certain shows."
how to get rid of anxious thoughts? I’m just so fed up of being anxious for no reason. I always doubt the talents I have. I get anxious about EVERYTHING and it’s taking over my life. I hate it. It’s like my anxiety is an obsession. Everything has to be negative in my mind. Any personal advice on how to conqueur this?
"how to get rid of anxious thoughts? Are you still seeing a doctor or therapist? Have you discontinued the Sertraline for good? Have you tried any other meds or different classes of drugs? When was your last full physical exam for blood chemistry, etc? Whenever I felt the tightness in breathing, crawling skin and the growing panic, I had to quickly distract my thinking and divert my attention elsewhere. I had to train myself to do this when I felt the onset of escalating panic. It worked pretty good along with the anti-anxiety/antidepressant Imipramine and Buspar. A 12-step program like EA (emotions anonymous) and AA also provided the ways that others deal with anxiety and I learned some good techniques from them. Best of luck to you.

I discontinued the sertraline because it was making me manic. All of the medications I was on were making me much worse so I’ve come off them in hope that i will be able to fight this without medication. Thankfully the anxiety is much better recently, although my mood has dropped quite a lot. Thanks for the advice."
"I dont know if this is the right sub but I need help I'm afraid that I am now a sociopath. I digged too deeply in the reality of the world and now I have seen the truth. About a week ago i started having a series of disturbing thoughts regarded the world and how it is a ###$ up place. Thoughts on random fears and thoughts that life is suffering filled my mind and I could not stop or refute them. One thing led to another and now a new thought has absolutely broken me. I am agnostic. I do not believe in religion or their gods. But I never fell into the trap of nihilism that without a god that there is no point.in life. I used to strongly believe in right and wrong and why life is valuable. But I have now lost that thing that kept me falling into the abyss. As I sat ruminating over my thoughts trying to find counter arguments to the thoughts about life was suffering and stuff, an new thought came into my head, that aliens will probably not have the same emotions as us. This led me into a downward spiral of if aliens didnt have the same emotions as us than emotions are not universal. If emotions are not universal than emotions are nothing more than evolutionary adaptions to help our species survive. And then finally if emotions are nothing more than evolutionary adaptions, then then things like love or value does not exist. Human life is not special or important. Love isnt because you actually love a person, its because evolution is trying to pass on your genes. Emotions are illusions. Humans are nothing more than machines of evolution. There is no reason for emotions or caring about other people. I never thought this way before. I always believed in humanism, that humans are special and deserve to be treated well. I believed in love, happiness and morality. Now those concepts have been dragged out from underneath me. It doesnt matter if someone gets murdered or raped. Human life isn't special. Just evoutionary robots. I was already pretty emotionless because I was dealing with the thoughts before coming to this realization but when the thought popped into my head it's like something inside me died. I feel nothing anymore. No emotions. Nothing. Life is worthless and so are emotions. I have become a robot. For the past few days I have done nothing but read philosphy books and books by a philosopherscientist named Raymond Tallis. He has what I think are convincing thoughts on why evolution, while true, can not account for human behavior or emotions. That humans are more than their biological roots. But no matter how many times I read and read, while I agree with his statements, the thoughts don't care. The thoughts don't believe it. I still believe that life is worthless. If an asteroid came and destroyed the planet tomorrow I would not care. I realize how horrible that statement sounds but I can't help. It won't leave my mind. I am constantly searching for evidence against these thoughts but no matter how much I can logically agree with the counter arguments, I can't force my self to believe it. I am constantly reading stuff on the internet to disprove these thoughts but nothing works. I hate this. Why am I like this? I am worried that I will be a sociopath for the rest of my mind. That I will resort to acting like the animal I believe we all are. I want to reset my mind, or rewind time to a time I did not think like this. I have OCD but I don't think this applies here. I have no emotions anymore. I am just an evolutionary robot. Please someone read this and slap some sense into me. I'm so scared."
"I dont know if this is the right sub but I need help ALL humans are sociopaths. ALL of us. It's just a matter of where you are on the scale. It seems to me you are one of the rare occurrences of an intellectual epiphany. From what I understand from reading your post, you are prone to being highly intellectual, always thinking, always wondering, always analyzing. This is what makes those who make this world and create all that we have. In other words, you aren't one of the billions of sheep on this planet. You have a working mind, and an aggressively questioning intellect. Welcome to the club.....been there, done that, bought the T-shirt, went home. LOL Actually, I'm STILL there. My mind has never stopped. And yes, I too have had the same type of thoughts passing through my mind over the years. It can be very demanding on your psyche', and it can be very strenuous on your personality and emotional state. And even though you may not ""feel"" like you have emotions at this point, you still do. Your just overwhelming yourself with all of this new information, and it's buzzing in your brain without any conceptual connections to anything at this point. You're becoming more sentient of the world and the universe. You are seeing reality and truth in nature, instead of continually believing all the BS, lies, fantasies, and other sanctimonious garbage you've been brainwashed with all your life. What you have to start doing at this point is sifting through it all. Take it one piece at a time, analyze it, research it, get the information you need on it, in order for it to make sense to you and be content with the answer or outcome of your research. Then go on to the next piece of information rattling around in your brain and do the same. If you start organizing all of this into categories in your head, you can better filter the crap from reality. You have to discover what the lies are, and what the reality is. Logic and reason. The two BEST research tools anyone can ever use in life. You cannot hide logic. It's there in your face, whether you want to believe it or not. It is an absolute. Reason will help guide your research to a logical state of understanding and comprehension. To para-phrase Mr. Sherlock Holmes..........When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. For this situation, all the ""impossible"" is all the lies, BS, and fantasy that people have created to live in their own little worlds, with their heads up their butts, refusing to see or admit to any sort of reality. You've got to sift through the BS to find the logic. You've got to sift through all the lies and fantasies you've been brainwashed with since birth, in order to get any reasonable understanding from it. This is how humans are. They ignore what is harmful to them. They refuse to see reality because it is hard fact, and most all humans cannot fathom fact, truth, or reality. It scares them. They hide from it with platitudes, witticisms, phony feelings, fake emotions, and plastic personalities. Aliens aside......all living things have different emotional states. If you are of the more scientific persuasion, then ""feelings"" and ""emotions"" are nothing more than chemical reactions in your brain, giving you different outcomes from the different sources crossing your daily path. Food is another source of chemical reaction that can have a lot do with your ""emotions"" and ""feelings"", as food is nothing but chemicals arranged in a different manner, which have different effects on different humans. As a concept, this would mean all living things never have the same feelings or emotional states, as they all have different environments and are fed different foods to live. Hmmm, does that make any sense? Sometimes it's hard to put this stuff into words. What is truth? Logic would dictate that truth and logic are one in the same. Both are absolutes, which cannot be disproven by any means. It just IS. It is undeniable fact. Example: The rock is hard. You can fantasize, theorize, and scrutinize the rock all you want and wonder about it all you want.......but the cold, hard, undeniable truths are, it's a rock, and it's hard. Hopefully thats not oversimplifying the point too much. Your brain and intellect are waking up from the cold, sour encasement of lies, fantasies, and BS that's been pounded into your mind and psyche' all your life so far. And instead of burying it deeper and becoming more sheep like, you are wondering and contemplating. WOOHOO!!! Alright!!! This will take time. But your first step is to find a way to organize all of these thoughts in your head. It's now time to find your truths."
"Cuts all over me but I have no idea how they got there? Lately I’ve been finding lots of cuts/scratches on my body that look like self harm. On my arms, thighs, stomach, butt... basically everywhere. At first I thought I must have been scratching myself in my sleep because I had (and still have no idea how they got there) but they started appearing at the same time as my panic attacks. Is it possible I am doing this to myself while I’m having a panic attack and just not remembering?"
"Cuts all over me but I have no idea how they got there? In your other post you were wondering about out-of-control anger possibly being due to an alter. This sounds like it's along the same lines. A dissociated part taking over and causing self-harm for which you have amnesia when you return. Some people report that switching feels like a panic attack to them, so that might be something to consider. Dx:DID/OSDD First post Our journey thread"
"Sex anxiety or erotophobia Hi! One of my major insecurities is low number of sexual partners. It just makes me feel incapable of doing anything and usually I lie the count to be bigger than it is, cause in case I get in bed with someone I can just blame them for bad sex or usually just get wasted. But usually when someone approaches me in a sexual way I get this feeling of anxiety that I have no idea what I'm doing and since I'm a guy it's rather a major concern. Usually leading to a situation where I rabbit out with an excuse, cause I don't want to get embarrassed. Also the high performance stress that spikes in usually makes me incapable of enjoying sex yet the amount that I desire it just grows by year by year. Actually I just grave it so much today that I might flirt to random strangers and touch of other people, but yet usually this leads to other people find this creepy or rabbit out by themselves and if it leads to sexual stuff I usually again rabbit out at the last moment. I think I've done the rabbit thing now over 10 times ( like pass out or just I can't do this or ). Also have commitment issues cause I strongly belief that if other people knew how screwed up I am they'd leave me on the spot so I rather just not get too close with anyone. I've thought of using sex worker services, but I'm not sure would that make my self-esteem even more worse since I could rabbit out even with them so I thought I'm going to go with the traditional way. But it's rather hard since I'm already 26 and only had like sex three times where I kinda dissociated from it and saw it as a mechanical performance and yes I have never had an orgasm. Thanks. Feel a lot better even by now."
"How does your Anxiety/Panic feel? At the age of 17, I got my first panic attack - I felt like I was dying, I was shaking, I felt out of place, brain fog, and that I wasn't ""there"" At 21, same feeling but not as bad. Was doing fine throughout these years, minus the usual mild brain fog and worry/nervous. It wasn't until recently in October where I was playing a game on my cell phone and out of nowhere I felt odd/dizzy looking up from my cell and that resulted in the feeling that I felt when I was 17 - A week later, I woke up quickly and felt a dizziness that I never felt before, which resulted in a mild panic feeling. I went to the hospital because I couldn't shake that dizziness off - I'd lay down and felt dizzy, I'd walk and feel dizzy, and with feeling, not ""normal"" it made me anxious. They ran some test, everything in my brain is fine and they said I had vertigo. Gave me medication for when I'd feel dizzy and ignored the whole anxiety/panic aspect. I still have brain fog these days and by not feeling ""here"" and ""cloudly"" it puts me in a bad spot. Now, what I want to know how do you guys feel during an anxiety or panic attack? Is what I go through a feeling associated with anxiety or panic? Could it be something else? What medications do you guys take that work without feeling like a zombie? I've known people that have been on medications and they go into a different world without noticing. I'm on a search for a good doctor, sadly my insurance is full if very poorly rated doctors and I would like to educate myself before speaking to a doctor. Thank you guys"
"Terrified of winding up all alone? Hello all, ever since I was a young child I have been acutely aware of my status as youngest in the family. That is, I've always had this recurrent, intrusive, thought/fear that someday I will wind up all alone because my parents and both my older brothers will die before me. As a kid I had rather bad separation anxiety, and now I wonder if I still have it? Like I said, I'm terrified of someday being all alone because my parents and probably both my older brothers will pass on before I do. I have friends, but we've all been pretty distant since we graduated from high school and now only see each other a couple times a year, except for my closest and longest term friend, whom I see at least once a week when we hang out. I'm in college, but I haven't really made any friends, even though I'm in my fourth year and already thinking about graduation and the possibility of further education. I made a few friends I guess, but you could hardly call them friends and we don't really talk much if at all anymore. I did make one friend in college whom I do see as an actual friend and used to talk more to but he took a year off, and since we haven't been talking as much. I have bad social anxiety, so it's extremely difficult for me to make friends. Besides, even if I were to make friends that's no guarantee that they won't also die before me or move away. I've been on a few dates but I've never really had a boyfriend, though I would like to someday get married. Still, no offence, but men don't usually live as long as women, so I would probably still wind up alone... The thought of being alone terrifies me, if I'm all alone who will I turn to for reassurance or comfort when I have a bad panic attack or other bad things happen to me? I also have a phobia of vomiting, so I'm terrified of being somewhere/in a situation where might be ill and there is no one there to help me. (I'm also terrified of getting so scared that I throw up and there's no one there to calm me down so I won't throw up.) Suffice to say, I'm terrified of many things. Besides that, just being alone in general seems like such an awful thing. But, ironically, I think my fear of being alone had contributed to my being alone now. I avoid getting close to others, don't really take care of my personal hygiene, and, I admit, probably spend more time than I should surfing the internet or playing video games just to avoid facing the reality of getting rejected or growing close to someone only to lose them later on because I just can't stand the thought of losing the ones I care about. I do these things to avoid the reality that I am alone, I think, because it's easier. But if that is the case then... what can I do? How can I change this? The thought of losing the ones I care about is almost too much to bear. Picturing my parents, especially my mother (who has always been there for me and helped me calm down from panic attacks), is almost too painful for me to even think about. I've always preferred fantasy to real life because fantasy is so much safer and real life is so dull and boring and too painful. I often feel unworthy of others' time and affection, I feel like I have nothing to offer others, and besides that I often find it difficult to be vulnerable around others and when I do open up and reveal potentially embarrassing/intimate things about myself I always end up regretting it. This is why I just avoid making friends. Sorry for the long, rambling post, but if anyone has any experience with this or ideas, please, help me."
Terrified of winding up all alone? I can relate to a lot of things you write. I also have the fear of being alone. İ have aspergers on top of anxiety so i can't find a job either. I've long since accepted that there won't be anyone beside me when i die so i'm thinking of commiting suicide when my parents die. I hope you can manage to find a job after you graduate. Best wishes

Best wishes Ah, please don't commit suicide, although I know how you feel. I'm sure you can find some sort of job! There are people who care about you so, please don't end your life, even when your parents die. Have you considered seeing a professional? If you're already seeing one, does he/she know about this? You should tell them if you haven't yet or find a professional. I'm seeing a therapist myself. Anyway, thanks for the encouragement and I really hope things get better for you as well! Heh, I guess, if nothing else, we have each other, right? We could form a lonely club, lol."
"About To Fail 25 yo male, BS degree, only part time job experience haven't had real job, location: europe. Only child. Still live at home. Middle class, never had ""real"" money problems, spoiled throughout my life. LONG STORY. NO TL;DR. HELP A BROTHER OUT. Parents: Mother: Overprotective. Not severely, comically so, but enough to matter. Scared that something will happen to me pretty much always. Pretty sure this has damaged my self esteem in some way. Is not terribly happy herself. Actually, her happiness is too much depending on my happiness. She does tasks / chores for me sometimes before I even have a chance to do them myself. Has not taught me to do these things myself. Has no clue how to help properly support me so I can turn into a functional, competent adult and instead will just get angry when things turn sour. Also, because my mother cannot talk to my father properly, she would sometimes talk to me instead as a ""replacement"". This wasn't healthy either. She also made my father look bad on purpose at times. Father: ""Absent"" (not physically) after age 14-15. Realized he is not to blame. He simply cannot engage with people on an actual meaningful level, only sporadically. Keeps himself busy at all times. Very non judgmental however (at least towards me). Cannot understand the viewpoint of my mother and my mother often provokes him and he consistently falls for the same traps. His defense mechanism is to become extremely stubborn. He can also be manipulative but he doesn't to a good job of covering this up. Also diagnosed with ASD, which makes sense, but then there are some things that don't fit that picture (I guess that is normal?) Other family: I hardly have any other family. In the past a bit more. But the amount of people really influencing me in my life has been quite limited. Of course friends / school did play an important role (early on). My main problems aI cannot find something I want to study or do for a career. The reason for this is complex, not due to one particular thing. On the one hand, I probably am a little bit of a special snowflake if you will. I do not care about how people view such a statement, I am only interested in laying out the facts. In primary school I was the smartest kid in my (small) class. I felt good about myself at that time, despite being shy in nature. I had interactions with lots of different kids and had a couple of friends I would see fairly regularly also outside school. First three years of high school were pretty much decent too. After that there was puberty and I had various bad experiences with some quite awful people that made me extremely socially anxious. I did not focus on my grades much during this time, more on survival. My family tried to help but they failed to do so in a way that actually helped me. I really had to fend for myself. I was super scared to admit many things I thought and felt, which is common with the disorder. I desperately prayed that someone would see through my various smokescreens, but they did not. Since puberty I have had some problems / behaviors that to this day I have not been able to deal with. I feel horrible about this fact, actually, rather before I felt horrible about this fact. A few months ago I experienced something fairly intense which made me re-feel the importance of love. This has reduced my tendency somewhat to destroy myself inside because of my shortcomings. Anyway, my most severe problem or symptom rather is severe chronic procrastination. I can guarantee it is the worst case in existence (I should be studied by scientists no joke). Goes back PARTLY to the point above: I do not know what I want. I have always been interested in the technical, computers, cars, somewhat engineering in general. But I am not naturally drawn to academia. In fact since puberty, I do not like studying anymore. Or rarely. There are a handful exceptions. No I have to be honest. I do not like studying. The whole concept seems unreal to me. I still feel like I am in high school. Jeez. 25 and still taking tests, sitting in class I have had enough. But I am not educated enough to get a tolerable job that makes little more than minimum wage money (ok it might be a bit better than that but not by much). Ok what I mean by PARTLY: at some point, when stress is low, I do enjoy studying certain topics. Even more difficult math type stuff (not a natural at math). But it does not last. And when the point of no return is reached, that is now, meaning I have procrastinated too long, I start hating everything. I probably conflate these two things. But like I said I REALLY do not have the ability to properly govern / control this behavior. It is a deep problem. I cannot get myself to commit myself like a normal person to studying honestly 3 - 4 hours a day without #######4 or excuses. IMPOSSIBLE. I enjoy doing my own thing. Heck, I enjoy living in my own little world. No restrictions. Get to do what I want, by my rules. As a kid, playing with lego, these were the most satisfying experiences for me. Hours would pass by in minutes. I love taking computers apart and upgrading them. I love flashing ROMs on Android devices. I love obsessively tinkering with $#%^ for no reason, for no purpose. See, it will never make any money. But it satisfies me deeply. I don't care. Nobody is telling me to do it, only me. And yes, I have realized I DO enjoy this. I love artists who create music in this way. Klayton of Celldweller, Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails. They seem like musical tinkerers to me. They think like me. I love those guys to death, for real. I do not have the dedication to creating music that they have, at least not now. I wish I did though. So college. I did / do not like it (just like school, but one huge upside is that there are not ""politics"" or cliques and bs social rules). In college, you can work with teams, for instance on building a racing car to compete against other teams. But I never enjoy this. I can never do what I want. Always restrictions. Fixed rules, fixed dynamics in place that stifle my freedom. That's why I prefer to stay inside. I enjoy this. Some would say this is wrong but it is really my nature. Goes back to playing with lego. Or video games. Oh god, video games. I can't really play them, because then it has to be full time. It is either full time or very little to nothing. I used to be embarrassed about myself all the time. And my god, do I NOT measure up to what I should be. What kind of pathetic, weak excuse for a man am I??! Except I do not care. I do not care about such judgements anymore, and it has been freeing. However, I still cannot for the life of me figure out what I should do with myself career wise. Currently have no friends or girlfriend. Everything is in my past. I am considering rekindling a friendship which goes wayyyy back, I owe this person an explanation. But not right now, when the time is right. Oh, and never had a girlfriend before either. Zero experience with women. But my mindset has shifted. I am giving myself all the space and time I need. And worst case, if it never happens, I will still accept myself. I will try to do what I can. If I can help just one person, just one in a genuine way, I feel like my life is justified. My procrastination is the reason I do not have friendships, because I constantly have to lie to people about where I am really at or where my head is at. And I hate doing this so much, especially for the other person. That's why I have finally decided to not involve other people in my $#%^ anymore until I have this a little bit more figured out. The desire to help people makes me think of Psychology, but in my mind, I am not convinced that pursuing Psychology, and then becoming a therapist for instance, is truly going to make me feel like I genuinely help people. I imagine such a situation to be very difficult. Some people I could help really well, while the majority I would honestly not feel I would have much to offer to. Maybe I am wrong. This also what draws me to music, because music has saved me in the past. That feeling is overwhelming. Peak experience in life I would say. To give that to others would mean much more to me than owning the latest smartphone, having a 700 hp car (ok that's pretty awesome) or a large house. I imagine that to be deeply satisfying. Closing thoughts. Am about to fail what I am currently studying because I have two weeks to catch up on pretty much everything. Which is suicide. Only a miracle could save this. So basically I should open my mind to new possibilities. PS. Some bad character traits that seem to be constant over time: I get frustrated fairly easily, give up fairly easily. If something doesn't interest me, it is extremely difficult for me to do it. In primary school this was never a problem, as everything was super easy. So I just finished everything as fast as I humanly could, so I could start the fun times!!!!! Which was goofing off with other kids or hacking the school computers to change the high score in a .txt file and putting my name at the top of the list with a score of 10000000000!!!! Good times."
"I need a job but anxiety is preventing me from getting one Hello everyone. I am a 24 year old woman with GAD, depression, and bpd. My boyfriend and I moved into our apartment about a year ago and we're struggling to pay rent. My boyfriend is working really hard as a landscaper, but we are still struggling to pay bills and rent. For a while I was thinking of going on disability but I'm not sure anymore. It seems impossible and time consuming to get and I want to start earning money as soon as possible. I'm trying my best to work up the courage to get a job but I honestly don't know if I can do it. The last time I worked was about 3 years ago and I had a traumatic experience where my ex/coworker harassed me at work every day and I had to leave my job. After that when I moved to a different store I started having panic attacks so frequently that it prevented me from doing my job. I stopped working with customers because of frequent panic attacks and agoraphobia and social anxiety and started stocking shelves instead but one day I took a bottle of aspirin off the shelf and just went to the bathroom and took the whole bottle (my second suicide attempt). That was about 2 years ago I believe? I would like to believe I am ready to hold a job now and I desperately need one so I'm trying to remain positive. After that happened I've been extremely reclusive, moreso than ever. My social anxiety and agoraphobia has greatly increased and I believe I'm developing an eating disorder (or an obsession with food and my weight at the very least). I don't leave my apartment often unless I'm with my boyfriend or if I know I won't have to talk to anyone. It's gotten to the point where I can't make eye contact with anyone. I can't even wave to strangers or say hello. I'm riddled with guilty and anxiety over not having a job. I can't take feeling like a failure and a waste of space much longer so I asked my friend to help me get a job where he works. I'm supposed to call today and I didn't sleep last night because I've been so anxious about that alone. I want to believe I can do this, but I just don't know. My boyfriend is very kind and understanding when it comes to my issues and my not having a job, which only makes me feel even guiltier. Does anybody have any advice? How can I make myself do this? Thank you guys"
"I need a job but anxiety is preventing me from getting one all you can do is take the smallest possible step you genuinely feel you can manage. doing anything more is setting yourself up for more failure. i still don't have a job only a bs degree myself.... im a guy so im an even bigger failure as society would say lol...... luckily i dont care about what society says anymore i wish you the best of luck, and it is good that your bf is understanding, hope to find an understanding gf myself one day but we will get there eventually 25 yo guy without any labels but a very long list of problems... byee"
"Alternate reality creation stemming from anxiety?? I was diagnosed with anxiety over 2 years ago, for around the past 3 or 4 years I have been creating an alternate reality that only exists in my bedroom. I lost my dad almost 5 years ago to illness which is what my anxiety is related to and stems from. This alternate reality is filled with people I look up to, mainly youtubers I admire and wish I was friends with. They have changed over the years but have been consistent for the past 2. They all have specific spots in my room that they 'sit' and I talk to them all out loud. In my daydream I am older and have a whole elaborate backstory for myself. This includes moving to Canada and picking up the accent, so when I'm in my alternate reality I speak in a Canadian accent. All the relationships I have created in my little world are long term (like 6-7 years), and it makes me wonder if part of the reason I do this is to fill the emptiness I felt after losing my dad. Being in this daydream feels so good, I am more confident, I still have anxiety but I talk about it a lot more freely in my own world, and whenever I feel anxious or any other intense emotion, thats where I go. more recently I've started to feel ashamed in the middle of my daydream or when I come out of it, because I take a step back and realize how crazy I must look since I'm literally having a conversation with different patches of air. its not as though I actually see the people I want to see sat in front of me, I just imagine them and talk to them as if they were actually in the room. I am very strict with myself about where I do this, as I said it only really exists in my room. Sometimes if I'm home alone I'll use the accent around the house just to talk to myself, and during long car journeys I fantasize about it but thats as far as it goes. I realize how insane I must sound, but its bothered me for a while and I'm too embarrassed to talk about it, so as always I'm turning to the internet for some reassurance and some answers. does anybody else do this or something similar? does anybody know why I do this? Thanks"
"Alternate reality creation stemming from anxiety?? Moved to Living With Mental Illness to reach more people, this sounds a lot like a stronger form of maladaptive daydreaming. But I've left a shadow in GAD so it can be seen there and followed here. I used to have elaborate daydreams, and have touched on the fringes of daydreaming such as that, in real time as it were, pretending someone was there with me or something. But not to that extent. It sounds as if it's an escape mechanism to me, yes. I find online activities have replaced the elaborate daydreaming for me, but I used to have very elaborate imaginative lives. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Alternate reality creation stemming from anxiety?? Okay the move. Thankyou for your reply! I think I’ll see if I’m brave enough to tak wothnmy counsellor about it. I have learnt a lot of coping strategies recently from my current counsellor and am currently putting them into practice so I’m hoping that once I get good at managing my anxiety as a whole, this will subside more."
"Alternate reality creation stemming from anxiety?? If they're all people you look up to, it may indeed be connected to losing your father. Do they act like father figures? There's no need to feel crazy or ashamed about it. The fact that you're self-aware about it means you're still firmly in touch with reality."
"Alternate reality creation stemming from anxiety?? I don't really see anything wrong with that. Many people would probably say it's weird, but there's no shame in being weird. There would be various factors involved, but I'd say a large part may just be that you're an imaginative and socially-oriented person, and that's the platform you've found to express those tendencies.

Thanks for the reply! I’m definitely imaginative, I’ve always been told my imagination is sometimes too good! I’m quite introverted and always have been, I’ve always been a pretty shy person and to have anxiety piled on top of that was difficult at first and I would agree with your idea that I’m expressing the social skills I wish I had through daydreaming. I enjoy being around my friends and family, and have found that if I don’t do something social for a while the daydreaming becomes more frequent. However, I’ve also found that if I overdo it with social activities I find myself wanting to escape. It’s all about balance lol"
"Alternate reality creation stemming from anxiety?? I hope you read this because your post really helped me. I go into a kind of alternate reality when I’m feeling down. I imagine that a person I know—someone I look up to—always male—cares about me. I fantasize about this. When you said it was related to the loss of your father, I immediately felt better. I lost my father through divorce and never had visits with him until I was old enough to go find him myself. He was the most important person in my life. He died when I was 25. I never understood that the fantasizing is about loss of my father."
"Alternate reality creation stemming from anxiety?? I have done this since childhood. I think for me it was escapism from bullying due to developmental delays (since birth). For me it took many forms. As a young child I'd create characters/persona's based on popular kids who didn't get bullied. As a teen it would include favourite celebrities/pop stars and I'd be their hero. (by saving their lives or doing something heroic). Up to this point it stayed exclusively in my bedroom. In my late teens was when my first 'persona' became a full blown alter and existed in the real world, based on a deaf kid I met on a visit to a deaf school who signed who I got obsessed with. I had a phobia of public speaking due to a speech defect and being bullied for it and was already an elective mute in some situations so this 'becoming deaf so no-one expected me to speak' seemed like the perfect solution to me. (I'd explain here I also have autism and dissociation was my 'coping strategy, though I did not understand this at that age). In my 'imaginings' as I used to call them I was also deaf and signed fluently by learning to sign songs. Again my TV heroes would be in my fantasies and of course they'd think I was amazing and learn to sign to communicate with me etc! This continued to my thirties when a sudden 'shut down' causing (at the time) temporary mobility issues triggered an obsession with wheelchair users after being treated like a celebrity in hospital when I couldn't walk.

"Anxiety in the morning Hi everyone, its hard to admitt but lately I have developed some sort of anxiety disorder. Every morning after I wake up and realize that I need to get up soon its ... horrible. As soon as I wake up I think about all the things that I will have to do that day - and it frightens me to get up snd get going. I imagine the stress and the responsibilities of the day and I almost start shaking. Its really bad. I try to imagine the good things that might happen, too...but it doesnt help. Its been going on like this for a while now and it gets worse over time. After I get started I get a lot of stuff done everyday - but I stay stressed and nervous until I get back home and feel safe again. What is this? What can I do?"
"Anxiety in the morning That is anticipated stress. I had this for months and it was terrible - feeling with you. Got better with an antidepressant (Venlafaxine 150 mg) and relaxation exercises (autogenic training) early in the morning. Do not give up, be kind to yourself, there surely can be done something about it."
"Anxiety in the morning You are very welcome! I wanted to add, if you do relaxation exercises in the morning (Jacobson is another esy-to-learn method), choose a sitting position to avoid falling asleep again. I forgot a very important aspect: stress management can surely help, but of course you better find a way to reduce your workload. It seems you are overcharged. If you go on medication, better avoid all the substances that cause addiction, like benzos. You would just change problems in the long run... My best wishes to you!"
"Experiencing intense anxiety when at work Hi this is my first post here. I’ve been previously diagnosed with GAD and Major Depressive Disorder; Recently I’ve been experiencing intense anxiety while at work. I feel as if people such as supervisors and coworkers are watching me work and this causes anxiety/tension. I feel like I have to not mess up and this causes me to feel like I lock up, when I try to ignore the anxiety I feel it just makes it worse and I feel like I can tell they know I’m acting differently which makes it worse. It causes me to self isolate to feel better; This doesn’t happen all the time but recently it has kicked up again and I’m afraid to tell my doctor because I’m afraid he will tell me I’m paranoid or something. Idk if it’s just me worrying too much and my mind just building on the worry creating the anxiety. I’m finding it hard to interact with people as my social anxiety recently has skyrocketed Any thoughts if stress at work could be causing me to become paranoid or does this just sound like excessive worry? I see my dr in a week but am having a hard time bringing it up to him."
"anxiety about perception of money and its importance Among my GAD symptoms is an anxiety about money and paying bills . I've been doing everything possible to be prosperous and I always seem to have enough, but when it comes to paying bills the anxiety builds. Everything today seems to be about money and how much you have or want. I remember simpler times when credit scores weren't how you describe yourself. Or what's in your bank account was just what was in your bank account. I'm not a materialist. I do like having a reliable and newer car and I like living in a safe and secure neighborhood. But it's seems now like even those two things have price tags on them that are creating anxiety for me. Could use some advice or support. Thanks"
"anxiety about perception of money and its importance I'm sorry, I'm not really being much help here. However, don't feel as though you're alone. Finances are definitely a trigger point for me. I obsess about finances and seem to be in a constant quest to not see that zero in my back balance. I have a formulated spreadsheet on excel which can tell me to the penny how much money is going to be in my account this time next year, I update it daily. It's the best and worst thing I've ever created. It is constantly on my mind"
"Anxiety and medication - any thoughts? Hi all, Since 2012 I've been experiencing cyclic changes in my mental health - usually for periods of around 2 months of positive experiences and 1 month negative. Almost clockwork. Negative symptoms include such things as insomnia, suicidal ideation, reduced productivity, impulse spending, distancing from friends and family, weight gain and irrational thoughts. My concern is, what would generally last around a month, is now approaching 5. This resulted in me seeing the crisis team on Thursday and a subsequent trip to the GP to collect my first lot of medication since 2012! The crisis team feel as though my initial diagnosis (2012) of EUPD is no longer appropriate and that I need further intervention from the complex care team to further ascertain a new or revised diagnosis. They are leaning towards a suggestion of severe anxiety, however they have stated that the cyclic nature of my problem is throwing a spanner in the works so to speak. Anyway, moving on. The GP has given me a short supply of 5mg Diazepam to help with the initial hit of anxiety and insomnia. Running parallel to this I've been given the usual dose of 50mg Sertraline SSRI so that by the time I get to see the complex care team, I'll have a level of meds in my system. I only started the Diazepam last night, took 5mg in the afternoon and 10mg before bed. I'm quite disappointed, although it has certainly taken the edge of the anxiety initially and gave me a general level of clarity - it has not helped with my insomnia. I am also mindful that it is a short term fix due to the tolerance and dependancy levels. So, my question is, after this rant, long term, what medication are people having fortune with in terms of severe anxiety, depression and insomnia? I'm hoping they will allow me to keep the Diazepam 5mg as a PRN alongside a proven SSRI but I know GPs can be hesitant to script the benzos. Anyone have experience with this also?"

"Fear of my children getting sick Hi everyone, I'm 40 years old and have two boys, 18 and 12. I had a pretty miserable life post marriage. I was married at 21, had my first born at 22. I was exceptionally good academically and had a very happy childhood and very supportive, loving parents. However, my in laws are from hell. My husband was a total mama's boy and simply never stood up for me. He was raised as a total slave to their whims and commands. His father is clearly a narcissist and his mother a manipulative emotional wreck. I got sucked into this whirlpool mess of a family. His brother and spouse are extremely selfish, greedy people who have used us and betrayed our trust. Yeah, lovely family right? I don't know when exactly it started but I developed severe anxious thoughts, fears and health issues. I had witnessed as a teen my older cousin's erratic behaviour as he had schizophrenia but it didn't bother me then. I was pretty strong emotionally and could handle such expeeiences. Or so I thought. After marriage and two kids, I moved to another country and I started feeling lonely. I actively avoid close friendships although I used to be a social butterfly in college. I started becoming fearful every time my kids fell sick. It didn't help that successive vacations to my in laws' place were miserable, filled with conflicts and my kids witnessed it all. Now I'm wrecked with an unimaginable amount of guilt, it eats me day and night, that I screwed up my kids. I yell at them one minute, am loving and repentant the next. It's a rollercoaster ride and as they're growing older, they are feeling the effect. I always worry that my confusing and unpredictable behaviour and parenting, coupled with my personality and family history (although not direct) will cause my kids to get some mental illness. I'm particularly scared out of my mind about schizophrenia. I don't know so many intrusive thoughts full my head from the time I wake to when I crash at night that some horrible mental illness is lurking around my family. On top of that, I read these new agey stuff that what you think manifests as the energy is attracted to you. Now I'm double scared that I'm responsible for all these possible scenarios. On the outside people think I'm smart, articulate, capable, strongand a great mom, on the inside I'm an absolute wreck. I keep looking at my older son watching for any abnormal ""signs"". Once I caught him saying something in the bathroom and I froze. It turned out he was just speaking to someone on the phone. But this suspicious way of thinking and living is definitely something they'll pick up on as its getting too obvious. I hate feeling this way. I know I'm lonely, far away from my family and can't talk about these years even to my sister or husband as they sound really irrational. I have cut away my social circle, lost my motivation in my career and multiple talents, and just worry all the time. It used to be sporadic when the kids were younger but now it's getting worse as my older son approaches his adulthood and I'm anxious that I may have screwed him up. I feel he can sense my anxiety and I know it's really unhealthy for him. He also gets agitated and thinks I'm nagging him, when all I'm doing is making sure he's ""ok"" and all ""normal"". This is a horrible way to live and I can't even enjoy my children or their lives as I'm monitoring every behaviour of theirs, to satisfy my fears. Please help with some perspective on what I should do."
"Weird mental associations making me feel very uneasy Hello everyone, I have a very strange problem and I have had no luck so far trying to find out what it could be because it's very difficult to describe it, but I will try. Let me first tell you that I have always had a thing for mental associations. I can look at something or listen to a song and experience strong feelings towards it or have vivid associations, be it with real-life things or fantasy places in my head. It's never been a problem for me, I've had it all my life, and it actually helps me with my creative work and I think I am able to paint abstract pictures because of my abilities to ""feel"". However, recently I started experiencing very bizarre associations. It al began about 4 years ago when I was on the internet and saw a particular artwork on an artist's website. It was an interesting, comic-like protrait of someone and I felt intrigued by it. It had many details and I started looking into them, and then suddenly I started feeling very uneasy. It was as if the picture was emitting bad vibes, so I closed the website didn't look at it again. Since then, I've started getting these exact same ""bad vibes"" that the picture had from other things as well (but not always): street lights throwing light at snow, graffitti on brick walls, some of the 80s synth-pop music (bizarrely) and so on. Every time it sends chills down my spine. From what I could find on the Internet, it kind of fits the description of PTSD when certain things can trigger traumatic memories. The problem is: I don’t have any traumatic memories that could fit into this! I have no idea why these random things keep triggering me, even though it does feel like I have a personal connection with them. A friend jokingly suggested that I could be experiencing memories from my past life. Well, I’m not really buying this theory, and I want to find the psychological explanation behind this. Oh, and the most bizarre thing about this is that I experience these ""bad vibes"" only in late autumn and winter , when it is already dark outside. In summer, I almost forget about these experiences and struggle to remember what the fuss was all about. However, today I had my first confrontation with this feeling again, so I guess the season is opened again. I was listening to some 80s music and suddenly had a strong the feeling of dread. These attacks usually last for a few seconds but can leave me anxious for minutes or hours, depending on how much I focus on it. Does anyone have any clue what it could be and how I could cope with it?"
"Panic Attacks Waking Me up at Night Hi, For the past month I've been waking from a dread sleep to what I feel is a stroke because my left side of my body is tingling including my face. so I go to the bathroom to check if I am having a stroke. Is there anything I can do to stop these panic attacks at night. Thank You"
"Panic Attacks Waking Me up at Night That sounds a bit concerning. Do you think maybe it's how you're laying in bed? How long do the symptoms last? Do they go away quickly? Do you feel normal afterwards, and the rest of the time? **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Help with symptoms Does anyone feel like they will fall over face first when walking outside at night. I don't know if this is part of derealisation or some kind of vertigo, basically my whole body will feel weak when it happens. I also get a sensation like my brain is wobbling about inside my head. I don't feel anxious nor do I feel panicky its almost like I become disconnected from where i am walking and I don't know where my feet are or where my body is going."
"Help with symptoms Well if you're an anxious person in general, well, I've learned that panic attacks, disassociation, other things that can be attributed to stress and anxiety, can happen at the darndest times, and seemingly out of thin air. I don't know about the face first thing, but a lot of times, esp when leaving work which is my main source of stress, I'll feel as if my legs aren't communicating with each other- each leg will not really seem to be aware of the other one walking beside is. It's very hard to try and put into words. But then I wonder why I don't just fall down unable to walk. I have to purposely put it out of my mind. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"Hello, I'm new. Hello, this is my first time posting here, i have a question relating to something that happened to me recently, The question: Is it rude to not speak first? My reason for asking: A few days ago, my mom asked me if i ""couldn't speak"" I'm assuming her boyfriend was upset that i went three days without saying anything to him, so he told her about it (i dont see him often since my room is in its own little area, I speak to him if he says something to me, but apparently me not speaking first is a problem for him, even though he is aware of my anxiety; we have had issues in the past with him being sensitive when it comes to these things.) My thing is, I do this with everyone, because speaking is such a weird thing for me, most of the talking i do is through text, i avoid people at all costs and this is one of the reasons why; people tend to misunderstand me, or just not hear me (which is what started this, he said something and i replied, and he didnt hear me, so he stopped talking to me for those three days, which if you ask me comes across as ""just leave me be and I'll speak to you when im ready"" so that's what i did, a big mess ended up happeneing from this and i spent 3 hours having a crying fit trying to calm myself down, and i just cant stop thinking about it now) we currently aren't speaking, which I'm okay with, my mom made some comments that made me feel weird because she has never spoken to me the way she has started doing since being with him. Sorry for the long-ish all over the place rant-post, but it just seems so odd; for me when i speak to someone and they dont reply i dont get upset and say they're selfish or whatever else, i just automatically think they either: have a lot going on, just don't want to speak, are as shy/awkward as i am, or just didn't hear me; i dont get upset, then sic my friends on them making a big fuss about it all, i just go about my day being worried about if my tone was rude or weird or if i made a mean face or if my body language was wrong, not if they're stuck up and rude, etc. Now, to me i feel like this would all be justified if he spoke to me and i ignored him, but i didn't do that, and my mom is saying that i ""walk around as if i expect everyone to just talk to me"" but that's what he does, he has a little fit when someone doesn't speak to him, but he can do it to other people whenever he wants. Lastnight, i said goodnight to everyone and he was the only one that didn't respond. So at this point, i don't want to waste any of my energy trying to hold a conversation with him to make him happy, this year hasn't been the best when it comes to the two of us, so i feel like it's just downhill from here."
"Hello, I'm new. I'm also a fairly quiet person. I know that not talking can be viewed as being 'unfriendly'. Are we all supposed to be chatty and bubbly all the time? Generally after I get to know someone better, I get more talkative. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"Hello, I'm new. Hello, I am thinking there is more at issue here besides you not being able to ""speak"", and that is not your preference. what I am reading and hearing) is that your mother's boyfriend is expecting you to behave in a certain manner and you are be pressured by both him and your mother. I am suggesting that you don't like your mother's boyfriend and he is living in your home and in your space and you don't really have any way to avoid him. I sense that your mother wants you to like him so that she can justify the relationship and him living in your home. I suggest that you don't want him in the home and so not speaking to him is your way of communicating that to him (and your mother). Unfortunately I am not a counselor so I can't necessarily give you advice on what you should do about this. But there are resources. If you trust your mother, you may want to open up to her and let her know how you feel about this man in your house and how you wish to have the freedom of movement in the house without having to respond to his demands (to talk, or whatever else he is expecting). Otherwise, you may be able to talk to your school counselor and find out if they have resources. Perhaps your mother has insurance and you can seek counseling, if you are uncomfortable telling your mother it is about the boyfriend, perhpas you can say because you all believe I have an issue because I don't talk, or feel I can speak."
"Anxiety therapy Many therapists will try to train you to use relaxation/mind-clearing techniques to still the raging waters. Eastern religions are big on meditation, centering and breathing techniques. It really works. The thing that helped me the most was to remember to breathe (but not too much). There was one time that I was hyperventilating without being aware of the fact. I thought that I was suffocating (not getting enough air) when I was, in fact getting too much air. My arms and legs went numb and fizzy. I felt faint and detached from reality. I thought that I was having a stroke or heart attack, which made it even worse. The anxiety became a panic attack. When I got to ER, they had me breathe into a brown paper bag. After about 10 minutes I was fine. Just being aware that that can happen, helped me to make sure that it wouldn't happen again. My breathing is the first thing that changes when I get anxious. I always have to be in tune with that. Breathe slow and deep, like a sigh. Tightness of the chest and heart palpitations can be another sign of anxiety. As long as I know what it is, I can usually diffuse it when it starts. Eat and drink right. Avoid sugar, tobacco, alcohol or other substances that may work against you and increase hyperactivity. The doctor prescribed mild medications to 'take the edge off' my anxiety. The same medication was also used to treat depression, which often goes hand-in-hand with anxiety. The meds were slow to build up in the body and slow to leave the body. It was important for me to take them as prescribed and not as needed. Taking then during a panic attack would not help as there was no 'instant relief' which might have made them habit-forming or addictive. After the initial evaluation, a treatment plan will be drawn up for your consideration. I would follow through with what the doctor suggests as they are the expert. There may be some med adjustments and changes after you get started. The biggest side-effect for me was dry-mouth. We are all different and may experience different side-effects and degrees of side-effects. Dry-mouth was pretty easy, I just carried a bottle of carbonated water with me. If you notice anything unusual happening, contact the office or pharmacy right away. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"Anyone have any luck coming of ssri’s? I’ve been on a few different medication, klonopin, tried Zoloft that didn’t agree with me now I’m on lexapro 15 mg and I don’t have the same sides I had with Zoloft and the anxiety is pretty much gone but I’m completely flat, no motivation, don’t want to go anywhere do anything more so than usual I haven’t been exercising or watching what I eat so my health is going downhill (and I’m getting fat). It’s like I’m in a lifeless depression with no emotions at all other than my irritability and that’s probably because I’m not burning off any frustration like I’m used to. I’m done with this already told my therapist she didn’t look like she thought it was a great idea but I’m done listening to them, gonna talk to my DR next week. With all my ranting aside, what sort of side effects can I expect from coming off, will my anxiety be worse that it was before? I’d like to hear your experience with quitting medication."
"Anyone have any luck coming of ssri’s? So maybe I wouldn't give up on medication just yet. There are different classes of antidepressants and AFAIK they also work on anxiety. So far you have tried one class, SSRIs. There are also SNRIs, SARIs, Tricyclic, Tetracyclic, atypical, etc. Not all will be right for you but I want you to know there are more options out there. Also if you don't have depression buspirone is an anxiety only medication that may work for you. ZombieZ wrote: With all my ranting aside, what sort of side effects can I expect from coming off, will my anxiety be worse that it was before? I’d like to hear your experience with quitting medication. Ok, so I am not exactly med compliant and will routinely go off of my antidepressant if I think my depressive symptoms will stay away for a while. When I go off of it two things usually happen; I always get rebound anxiety during the withdrawal and I usually get headaches. I've discovered if I taper slow enough I can mostly avoid the headaches but the rebound anxiety is still there. My anxiety does seem worse initially, but that feeling eventually fades. Oh and a second argument for a slow taper is you increase your risk for brain zaps if you go too fast. They aren't harmful but they aren't fun either. When I'm off my antidepressant my anxiety rarely gets as bad as it was several years ago in college. This is because I have worked on it with my therapist and also because I removed certain things/people from my life that were making my anxiety worse. My guess is that even if you haven't done anything besides take an SSRI to help with your anxiety there is no reason to think it would be any worse than before you started it unless you have environmental triggers that have become worse over time. So yes you should be able to get off your SSRI without too much trouble but your anxiety could go back to where it was at before.

"Anxiety reared its head for me at 31 Before late December 2016, I didn't really experience anxiety that was out of the norm. I had an unusually high heart rate the day if starting a new job. I went in to get checked because heart issues run in my family. Everything checked out so they insisted I was on drugs. I have never done drugs. Things got better quick. Then October 21 rolls around. I get a call at work that my 4 year old daughter had an accident at home and was seriously burned. She spent 3 weeks in the hospital, my wife stayed with her, and i stayed with my son, and newborn. I would make trips back and forth every over day (150 miles one way) to see her and pick up breat milk for the little one. I started getting this heavy weight feeling on my chest, my breathing would change, and I'd get this awful tingle feeling over my entire body. Once she was home and doing well it subsided some. Three weeks after she came home, my bestfriend and his daughter died in a house fire. I would get these episodes off and on all day, heart rate at times would be well over 150. I went in and was diagnosed and giving some medication that seems to have helped a lot. Earlier this month I lost my Mom, I held her hand as she passed away.. and the episode started, but it only lasted 5 minutes. I haven't really felt much after that, and we where very close.. either the meds and kind of teaching myself to calm down is working OR something is brewing?? Seeing as this came on how it did, can it also ""go away""?"
"Anxiety reared its head for me at 31 I must stay in touch with my own breathing. It is the barometer that I use for determining my well-being and the onset of an anxiety or panic attack. That numbness and tingling is likely from hyperventilation (too much air) when it feels like you are suffocating (not enough air) and having a stroke or heart attack. This can feed into full-blown panic. I went through this before and now have to constantly monitor my breathing. I was on an anti-anxiety/antidepressant medication along with therapy for a few years that helped. I didn't even realize that depression was a part of it. I did self-medicate with alcohol, which worked great in the beginning (I had thought), but then it stopped working and actually made the anxiety worse. I did wear a heart monitor for 24 hours and kept a diary of my activities throughout the heart-rate test. I passed and and the tachycardia has not returned since, AFAIK. I have cut back on caffeine, sugar and salt/nitrates. No alcohol. 'Situational anxiety' feels unpleasant, but I have learned to deal with it. Just head into it and know that you will survive and come out the other end of it OK. It is one day at a time. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"Anxiety reared its head for me at 31 Thank you for the reply. I do not drink normally, maybe once a year or so. Even then it is just some wine with my wife. I had the heart monitor for 3 days, also had ekg etc. Thankfully they all came out good. The first time I had that insane tingling feeling with heavier breathing was terrifying. This kind of stuff is all new to me personally. If I keep busy, that seems to help a lot. Sitting idle let's my mind wander all over the place."
"Worst i've felt in years, any help would be major appriciatd So, i'd like to start this with a synopsis of my past and why this situation is so extremely stressful to my already bad anxiety. Sorry for the rant, but i really don't know what to do any more.. When I was a kid I had such major anxiety that my mom took me out of school, and home schooled me. The only problem was that she was an in denial opiate addict who had no place doing so. I ended moving constantly due to her not being able to hold out a house or job and ended up teaching my self using the internet when it became an option. She has apparent mental health problems and threatened suicide multiple times to me as a child, barely came out of her room to make food so I very early developed the habit of poor eating, or not eating at all at times. Later, during my teenage years, I had basically raised my self and lived in a drug fueled haze, lots of opiates I had stolen from my mom, prescription stimulants I had convinced doctors to give me strong doses of, tons of weed, was on probation, constantly anxious, wondering where my next meal would come from or if I would have a roof over my head because of the constant fighting in my house and lack of care in that aspect. When I was 20 after lots of pain and self abuse and ignorance to a lot of it, I met a women who changed my life for ever. She taught me how to eat properly, how to cook for my self, the difference in local and organic foods, and many other small life skills I never even knew I was missing. She was a semi recovering opiate addict, we got along great and found love in each other I don't think either of us really knew existed. Eventually we both got into psychedelics, they really changed my perspective and opened up my eyes to a lot of things in my life that I had not previously seen before, and helped me to make many drastic changes that I needed to start moving forward in my own life. She got off the opiates and got into college, I moved forward in a career path I had recently chosen, but picked up a extremely dependent hidden opiate addiction to mask the pain I had shoved away in fear of hurting my new found relationship that was going great in for the most part. Skip forward 3.5 years. We move from her/our/her dads/ condo to a bigger house, we get a dog, plan goes to $#%^ about 2 weeks after moving, move back to the condo with the dog, dogs crazy and doesn't do well in a small apt, all the stress of all of that and the stress is causes my relationship causes me to dive deep into the opiates which I had been trying to fight off for years unsuccessfully at this point, which in turn ruins my relationship....My anxiety if off the chain, I'm having panic attacks multiple times a day, can't eat for $#%^, can't sleep..It's awful. . Along with on and off opiate withdrawals and mood swing from the drug caused chemical imbalances which do not help at all either.. So around November of last year I move back in with my mom who is now remarried as a last resort hoping that I might be able to use it as an opportunity to get my $#%^ together. Because of how desolate the area where she lived was I was able to get away from the opiates and only have went back twice since then but never actually relapsed which i'm insanely proud of my self for. My life perspective Is so different now, I don't even feel like the same person I was back then. I am much more thoughtful, and have made lots of progress in many ways and greatly respect my self for that. During this time, the emotional abuse from her has been extremely taxing though and as a now much more conscious adult I really see the extent to which it is/was... Constantly I am reminded of times during my childhood that were extremely difficult for me, am belittled for not having previously made good choices that would have ended up with me not having to stay with her, calling me names, being told that no wonder my ex left me, etc, etc, etc, Even though I am trying to be an adult and talk our problems out, but am met with hand gestures, lots of what evers, yelling, passive aggressiveness and narcissistic abuse, and am left feeling so hurt disgusted, and angry that often I will end up yelling at her, and even at other people sometimes if they catch me in a bad moment, and this has caused major problems for me at work and in my once flourishing social life recently....I would just leave and be homeless and go figure it out of my own, but I need to think about my dogs well being as well as my own now... During of the emotional struggle from all of this, I have lost a lot of weight that I had gained after quitting the drugs, can't sleep for $#%^, am worn down emotionally and physically, smoking way too many cigarettes, angry, emotional, depressed, and overly tired during the day, and keep thinking it's almost a better idea to just start doing the opiates again and then i'll at least be able to put on that mask to avoid how I'm feeling right now... I really don't want to do that though, and am getting very afraid that i'm not going to get out of this situation in a healthy way... Any kind advice would be very helpful. Or just a empathic reply of some sort.. Please help. Thank you for taking the time to read this long, unorganized, $#%^ show that my life is :/."
"Worst i've felt in years, any help would be major appriciatd My biggest issue was alcohol, but I did dabble in recreational drugs as well. They seemed to work at first, but did eventually turn against me. Drinking used to relax me, weed just made me paranoid (which I confused as a high). I was able to manage my stress levels then. The building anxiety could break into panic attacks. I had no idea where they came from. I placed my life and the lives of others in danger when they consumed me. Asking for help was difficult for me. I felt that I could solve my 'personal' problems, but it kept lapsing back into the same old, same old. Asking for help takes great courage. It is a sign of strength, not a sign of weakness. I was licked. My problem was too big for me alone against it. I was able to enter detox, rehab and aftercare. The doctors gave me anti-depressants, which also worked as anti-anxiety. I was able to work and function again as I became more stable. The doctors could do nothing for me until the drugs and alcohol were removed from my system. Only then, could prescribed medications and therapy work. If you haven't already, I would go for a thorough physical exam and bloodwork with your primary physician. Rule out any chemical/endocrine imbalances, hormonal, etc (which can be treated) first. Have them write a referral to a specialist for a further evaluation with other issues as necessary. Usually health insurance companies are cool if you have a doctor's referral for further treatment first. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"Worst i've felt in years, any help would be major appriciatd I'm sorry you're feeling so unwell. In addition to finding a doctor who will help you uncover any thyroid or other physical challenges with your body, and an effective therapist, it sounds like you could benefit from supportive friends and a structured schedule. These will help you bring your body and mind into balance. Your schedule needs to include more physical exercise, more healthier food at regular mealtimes (actually sit down at a table, put your food onto a plate, play some soothing music, and enjoy eating, a bedtime and a wake-up time. I think you will find these helpful. Good luck!"
"Foods and Anxiety I'm interested in knowing whether or not anyone here has noticed feeling less anxious when cutting out certain foods? Soy escalates me into panic attacks, causes me to miss work, creates arguments with my spouse over insignificant things. The nightshade family of vegetables causes similar symptoms. Nightshades are potato, tomato, eggplant, peppers, tomatillos."
"Anxiety & Depression from Sibling Sexual Experimentation Hey everyone, So I've come across some posts on here as well as other sites about sexual experimenting between siblings and cousins. I wanted to share my own experience and what I’m about to write is the worst regret of my life and I’m starting to feel really anxious, suicidal and depressed as a result. I'm 27 years old now so this happened 10 + years ago I myself had my own embarrassing and shameful experience when I was a very young teen with my younger brother too (both males, approx. 5 yrs apart). As kids we would play with each other all the time like we were attached at the hip. Despite the fighting, we’d love each other’s company. Long story short we were wrestling or playing around one day and somehow I ended up starting this game where I dry humped/rubbed my body against his in somewhat of a sexual way, plus a little touching/groping. What worries me is that I was the one who initiated it. He did consent but was probably too young to understand what was going on. It only happened once or twice and then the urges went away and only after it happened is when I started to realize it was awkward. We're both straight and never been attracted to the same sex but for some reason this happened. The last time it happened he got a little bothered by it so that made me realize that I should stop. Ever since then I've been regretting it so much and feel really depressed about the situation. Over the years its been coming back slowly to haunt me more and more. Nothing but shame, regret and disgust. Sometimes suicidal thoughts come to me as well. I hate myself so much for it and for while I convinced myself that I was some sort of monster that sexually abused his brother. I’ve been a good person my whole life to everyone I know and I always treat people with the most empathy and sympathy. This once incident is the one thing where I wish I had done different. I honestly don't know what prompted me to do this but at that age I probably wanted to know what being sexual/having sex felt like due to puberty and hormones, yet I was never sexually attracted to my brother. I wasn't even watching porn or masturbating at that age yet and I didn't even know what masturbating was (very socially underdeveloped and sheltered at that age). I'm guessing serious urges through puberty, experimentation, curiosity and lack of control of hormones. My brother and I were very close, and always around each other playing physically so that might have also led to doing it with him rather then anyone else. Now, I don't remember physically forcing him or threatening him in any way and there was no malicious intent behind it but I get these “what if” thoughts that I maybe might persuaded him in a playful way but even that is a very vague fuzzy memory which worries me. Looking back at it I wish I never did it but at the time I guess wasn’t able to fully understand the “rights” and “wrongs” of sexuality and the potential consequences. Now I've heard this kind of stuff is somewhat common amongst siblings at a very young age but I'm a little concerned and worried because technically I was not a 'child' anymore. I could have technically been considered a young 'teenager' at the age (can't remember due to how long ago it was). I think I was maybe 14-15yrs of age. My therapist said that this stuff is somewhat common and that although I wasn't a child, mentally and cognitively I was still acting as a kid. Also, because my parents were extremely overprotective, sheltering and neglecting that that could have been another factor in my delayed development. I also rarely had friends and I was very attached to my brother which could have brought us closer to age in terms of development. The regret is absolutely terrible and it feels like a completely different person that has done this when I was that age. I’ve never molested, sexually abused, harassed or touched any child or even had the thought of doing such things for that manner. My questions a1) Is this considered abuse or experimentation ? 2) Should I bring it up with my brother to apologize and to see if I can help him if he is negatively affected by it ? Or will that do more harm then good ? Thanks in advance for any insight you guys might have. I appreciate it !"

"I Think My Anxiety Is Eating Away At Me Hello, I’m new to this forum and don’t know if this is the proper place for this, but I feel that I need to talk to someone about this. I have lived with depression for as long as I can remember but it was only a few years ago that I started going to therapy. I tried group therapy and one-on-one therapy, but none seemed to really help. I switched therapists but they didn’t help either. Now I have a new therapist and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. However, I feel like these don’t begin to tackle the things I’ve been experiencing. I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing or if I even have a problem to begin with. I worry all the time that I’m just making things up. Maybe my problems aren’t as big as they seem. I feel empty most of the time. I can’t bring myself to feel good things or even bad things sometimes, it just feels like nothing’s there. If it’s not emptiness, it’s sadness..I go through life detached and feel as if though I’m looking at everything through a TV screen or as if though I’m in a “first-person” [point of view] game. Recently though...I’ve been feeling a little different. There are days where my hands start shaking and I can’t sit still. My throat starts to close up and when I feel that I’m choking I start to panic. My therapist has now diagnosed me with a panic disorder along with the depression and anxiety. Along with that my anxiety has been getting worse. At times I feel so unstable. I feel like I can’t take it, like if everything’s too much and my head starts racing. During these times, I start hyper-focusing on sounds and feelings. They become so overwhelming that they trigger panic attacks. I’ve lived with depression and anxiety for so long that I learned to work around it. I thought that if I could just keep folowing the routine of life (wake up, shower, work/study, eat, sleep) that I could be ok and continue to “live” (not be a burden to others and not turn to worse coping methods). I was wrong though. I find that the more time I live like this the more unstable I get. Lately I have started seeing things. I see spiders crawling on the floor, on other furniture, and on me. I even feel them sometimes. All of this makes my anxiety and instability get worse, I don’t know what to do about it. My therapist strongly feels that I need medication but a part of me can’t go through with it. I feel like my problems aren’t big enough to take medication. I was always yelled at and scolded for being sad. I was always told that there was nothing wrong with me and that others have it far worse, that I simply need will power to feel better.. I know I have problems, but I can’t help but feel that they aren’t worth enough to go as far as medication. They are nothing compared to others and maybe I’m just putting too much attention to small matters. I don’t know how to measure the weight of my problems and don’t know how to convince myself that going through with medication is a good thing that can help me..I feel very lost. Sorry for writing a lot and thank you for reading. Please feel free to share your opinions, thoughts, and experiences."
"I Think My Anxiety Is Eating Away At Me I would really try the suggestions of the doctor. They are the experts for treating these things. If the meds cause problems, you can always stop them. The depression and anxiety went hand-in-hand for me too. The same med treated both. I did try to self-medicate with alcohol, but that became a disaster and I don't recommend it. They also won't prescribe meds to active alcoholics. A clouded mind isn't receptive to therapy either. After sobering up, I was able to give my full attention to my recovery. Life is great without the hopelessness and fear that I lived with each and every day. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

True, they are experts and they are probably suggesting medication for a reason. My therapist says that too, that there are options with medication and if it doesn’t work I can stop them. It’s a good point and does ease some of my worries, but I just can’t shake the feeling that my problems aren’t “big enough” to get medication. However. Today has made me feel tired and defeated. I ended up having a conversation with my sister about the topic of depression. I never really talked about it with her, but even she repeated the same thing the rest of my family says: you just need more will power to get over it, others have it worse than you. Hearing that again made me go into another wave of depression and anxiety. I wondered why my family wasn’t accepting that mental health is a real issue. I wondered why even though I have asked them to help me and try to understand, at least inform themselves about mental health, they continue to ignore me. It’s been this way for so long, I feel that they have abandoned me in a way. Maybe I’m being childish about this? I know that I’m old enough to take care of myself, but I simply want their support. They’re my family...Anyway. I felt like something in me is done. I looked for a psychiatrist earlier today. I feel like I’m unstable for most of the week now, it’s hard. I hope trying medication will help. Of course, I will still work closely with my therapist. Thank you for reading and sharing your experience, I really appreciate it!"
"I Think My Anxiety Is Eating Away At Me You say that your problems 'aren't big enough' to warrant taking medication. If they are big enough of a concern for you to getting therapy and posting here, then that seems 'big enough' to me. I also didn't think that I needed help and that I would 'deal with it'. I told myself that if it got worse, then I might do something more. Ask yourself, 'how bad does it have to get?' Can you imagine how much better life might be if you could simply 'take the edge off' of depression and anxiety that may be holding you back more than you think it is? Finding the right med and the right dosage might take some adjustments. The doctor will monitor you to see how they are working, or not. Be patient. I don't think that I would have recovered without the help of medications. They don't have to be forever and you may realize benefits from them. I would explore this more with your doctor at your next appointment. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"My mother stresses me out? How can i move forward? Im sorry if this is not the right forum! (i also apologize about my weird English) My mother has always been quite controlling and that stresses me out a lot and it always influences my decisions. Decisions such as what to eat, how to dress, where to go.. I dont have a lot of freedom in what i get to choose for myself. When i try to choose what i like, she puts me off and starts to emotionally abuse me whenever she gets the chance so that i will regret not doing what she wants me to do. I never was allowed to go out with my friends alone, although it became a little easier since i joined university (im turning 22 in a few months) and that too, i gotta take her permission a week before meeting my friends. I started working as a freelancer artist and i make some good money every weekend, i get to buy myself whatever i want online like make up, clothes...etc but she starts telling me how ugly they look on me and that i should only wear a long black gown. Now the thing is, im planning to lie to her and tell her that my classes will start at 3 on tuesdays (it actually starts at 6) but i want to lie so that i will be able to go to the mall next to my university alone .... but again, im afraid that a relative of mine will see me and will tell her and that's gonna put me in trouble. What shall i do? Im trying to seek some more freedom"
My mother stresses me out? How can i move forward? You have to stand up to her really. If this is difficult can you get someone else on your side to help you? I'm having issues too. I'm at the point where I feel I may have to cut my mum off completely. The more I distance myself from her for breathing space the more angry she gets. It's impossible to have a reasonable talk with her about it.
"Bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder Hi all, I'm a young woman in her early 20s. I like to think of drugs as a way to expand my consciousness. I consider myself intelligent and I am very curious about our world, especially regarding how we perceive our realities and what reality actually is. We only live once, you know? I have never used drugs as an escape, just out of curiosity, and I don't drink or smoke cigarettes, at all. I'm not depressed, I don't cry, or have anger issues. My mind is always questioning, processing, and trying to see every single angle of things. I'm just this way- I'm a calm analyzer who likes to figure out how, and most importantly- why? However, this curiosity got the best of me last year when I had the chance to try LSD for the first time with my boyfriend. I have dabbled in MDMA and cocaine, and smoked marijuana regularly, so I was absolutely no stranger to drugs and the effects. I am not sure that it was actually LSD though- because of how horrifyingly long it lasted. The trip also felt ""dirty""- a lot of how the trip felt did not sound or feel ""right"". I can go deeper into this if you wish, but I'm pretty positive that it was not actual LSD. We took way too much due to the time it took to set in, and boy do I regret it. The trip was so intense that I suffered ego death. I'm sure that this is why I have such severe anxiety now- I thought I was going to die during the trip, which is ridiculous, because I've done COCAINE which is much more dangerous than LSD and suffered NO anxiety and kept a rational mind. Tripping will do that to you. At the most intense point of climbing up, I kept screaming in my mind all of these things... Imagine a spinning galaxy, this is what I saw through my mind's eye. I literally could not keep my eyes open due to how intense it was. My body was in tremors for hours due to a very intense anxiety attack that would not end but my mind was so far gone that it turned into pure fear. Being the trooper I am, I just soldiered through it. Spinning and spinning and darkness, just my voice screaming and echoing, inside my own head. It was so vast and amazing and full but full of terror. At the point I last remember (before the trip started to decrease in intensity) I made peace with my deceased mother and was screaming in my head that I love everybody and forgive them for everything. I'm glad that this happened, because I don't hurt over her anymore. I began to let myself go at that point, accepting my death, but not fully before the trip started to decrease. I think that if it kept going a bit longer at that intensity, I would have fully allowed myself to let go and the fear would have been conquered. It didn't work that way though. Even typing this is making my hands and face tingle with anxiety... even though I logically and rationally know it's over, and I should get over this already. Now, I have anxiety and derealization. I don't have depersonalization- my personality and bodily sensatations have remained pretty much intact. Functioning has become a task, though. I have anxiety about DYING!!! If my heart palpitates, which is out of anxiety, my mind immediately snaps to the thought that I'm DYING, time to PANIC! I logically accept that we will all die someday, there is no god (sorry- belief in god won't help me... I'm way too hippie to ever believe anything like that) and we're all a part of the natural way of things. However, the fear still grips me. This is my main issue. I'm becoming a bit depressed because of how my reality feels now and the thought that it will always be this way. Normal life seems so much harder because it feels like my external world has been turned inside out, and now I'm living from inside my head to the outside... if that makes sense. It's very frustrating. I also have very paranoid ideations- that my boyfriend is cheating on me- i.e., he's at work, or when he doesn't text me back right away, my mind immediately jumps to thinking horrible things and it begins the cycle of obsessive paranoid thoughts. I can psyche myself out of these, but that sinking feeling usually remains until I completely distract myself. I've never been like this before, and I KNOW he is not doing anything to hurt me- he does not have the capacity to. It's all in my head and it all began after the trip. On the other hand, I have a lot of childhood trauma that I THOUGHT I had dealt with- with the years of therapy and all. I don't remember much of my childhood. I'm sure it's all buried in there and I have no interest to dig it up... really. I feel scared and see no point to it, what is the past is the past. I saw this today: ""As far as the cause of your distress; At worst it may have unlocked some buried emotional/psychological crap that has to percolate out"" and it really comforted me- and for 5 seconds, the first time in nearly a year, I felt a break into reality. However, it's gone now. I can't afford therapy quite yet- but have any of you had a similar experience? Any advice, or coping skills? Thanks for reading and I'm excited to read your replies."
"Bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder Hi, waterlilies! How about asking your doctor for something that might help you, after explaining everything to them, since you can't afford therapy? How are you? forum-rules.php I am sorry I am not on the forum as much as I used to be, if I do not reply to you quickly, please contact another moderator/supermod/admin as well."
"Bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder Hey there waterlilies, I totally understand you. I've experimented in my time too. But mine is due to lots of stress and past issues of when I was a child. So going to a therapist has also helped me. However there are other things you can do: There are lots of POSITIVE things you can do: A nurse practioner has told me and I researched my self online that when you do aerobic type excercise like walking fast or a jog or joining a aerobic type class at a gym or some sort of dance form for 15-30 minutes will lower your cortisol levels which will then allow you to have more seratonin to your brain. It gives you the same calming effect as taking a benzo type medication minus all the negative side effects that those evil meds can give you. And it lasts for about 6 hours. And if you continusly do excercise at least 4-5 times a week. You will build steady cortisol levels and be able to be free and live again and be unstoppable You have to be brave, courageous- use positive affirmation daily, post them around your home in your car. Positive talk your self that you are well, healthy, calm at peace, trusting and everything will be ok. I do aerobic excercise 4-5 times a week and do yoga twice a week. Yoga also helps ALOT. It helps you stop thinking about worrys and fears and just have that hour to think of nothing but your breathing and being at peace. So anytime I'm feeling anxious I go for a run for 10-25min then come back home and put on a relaxing yoga song that plays for 7 minutes and do deep breathing (breathing in all positive thoughts and exhaling and letting go of all negative thoughts.) Also take magnesium its suppose to be caliming and a B Complex vitamin with folic acid (B3, B6, inositol, folic acid.) I also hear passion flower ( natural herb)tincture drops - 3 drops- 20 drops- everyone's body is different so I would take 3 drops with water and see how you feel and take 5 more drops if that isnt doing anything. Chammomile is soothing also. Also try aromatherapy. Cinnamon candles, lavender bath etc. Massages are great. Try accupuncture too. AND STAY AWAY FROM Weed- that will just make you even more anxious. Once in awhile having a glass or 2 of wine at night is relaxing and soothing. Not sure from what part of the area your from but in the US there are qualified therapists that can help you if you are low income. I think its like any where from 10-30 per session. Also read the book, ""The Secret"". It has a lot of positive type thinking and how to manifest more positive to you. And lastly but definitely not the least its actually number one for me is I have GOD in my life and he guides me and is always there for me helping me through this."
"Bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder Hey Waterlilies, You might find it interesting to type 'Serotonin LSD' into google. LSD mimics serotonin and links into the same pathways in the brain. My own experiances were much like yours. They lasted way too long, were not enjoyable and changed my perception. After much reading and inner searching I realized that my experimenting was my quiet way of trying to 'fix' myself. That wasn't the solution. I recall that feeling of disassociation for months after. I felt as if I'd been re-wired and spent a lot of time over-analyzing everything. I felt like I was missing some basic, all encomposing answer to everything. The best way for me to describe the feeling was 'I ghosted' through that time. I had lost substance. Thankfully, time, knowledge, a good doctor, friends and family have given me substance again. Oh ya, there's nothing like long walks in nature to help 'ground' yourself. I've begun waking up early to watch the sunrise. I find it inspiring and soothing. Then I go back to bed. HGT"

"Bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder Hey man, im kind of with you on that level except my anxiety started after years of drinking one time i went through alcohol withdrawal and had a bad panic attack ever since that I had crazy anxiety that lasted for months I used CANNABIS as a way to relax and relieve anxiety until i smoked the bowl from hell. I was the highest I have ever been off weed in my life except I was left alone in my house for about 6 hours and I totally lost it and started questioning reality and my own sanity. Anyway the next day when I woke up I still felt out of this world like i have been given new eyes or some $#%^ like that. soooo after that my anxiety kicked in more I started to think I was totally loosing my mind i went back to alcohol and THEN i started to use oxycodone. after drinking and feeling more depressed and detached I was looking for anything besides SSRI to help me so I turned to opiates. Now 6 months down the road I have a drug addiction to opiates but everytime I use one unless i use it real heavy i feel so much relief from dp that I almost feel normal again. so yea I would have to say your anxiety is caused from the drugs. But not trying to be a bad influence if you can get your hands on some OC let me know how it works for ya any adivice for me would be great!"
"Bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder Your trip sounds a lot like mine, although I went into the trip with not so great set and setting. The LSD I took was very bitter upon taste, was speedy, dirty in its effects, and I felt after effects for a week. Pretty sure it was a research chemical in my case, some people think it's a DO(x) or 25i nbome, but I just don't know for sure. Couldn't have been that intense at 150 ug of acid, plus my body felt #######5, heard true acid has no body load. Whatever it was, it was a hellish experience, unlike my mushroom trip. I came to many realisations that day though. However, It triggered high anxiety, panic disorder, depersonalisation, derealisation, mild hppd, and I also have disturbing intrusive thoughts. I experienced ego death as well, but I wasn't prepared for such an experience. I can relate with you so much. I hope you are feeling better."

Hi, I've had great experiences with LSD before, but the last I could get to had this incredibly bitter taste and acutally didn't lasted as long as when I had a good one. But the anxiety was terrible and for everyone who had it as well. I've wondered if it would be speed on this bitter acids or some other kind of stimulant. Most probably its NBOMe, that shows increasing ""bad trips"" among other things by LSD users. But I'm not sure the higher toxicity of NBOMe is related to what waterlilies describes. The effects waned slowly for a week, but all the comments posted before are great and I'm sure they're helpful, staying away from weed and actively thinking that this will pass is important."
"Bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder Just an aside for anybody that stumbles onto this thread: It is really difficult to find real LSD in the United States, and even if you manage to find it, it is usually low grade and full of impurities. Most LSD you find on the street now are European research chemicals being sold as LSD, and often times those that are selling it use imprecise dosing. This, combined with the lack of information on the effects of these research chemicals, can lead to all sorts of bad trips and disasters. If you want to be safe, don't even try to use LSD in the US, at least until there is a revival somehow of pure LSD. When you buy LSD on the street you are inviting all sorts of dangers.

"Bad trip unlocked anxiety disorder So I had a bad trip but it was off a street drug called Molly I was also drinking and smoking lightly ... I don't know if it's because I would abuse my prescription drugs this happened to me but it was the scariest thing ever and worst night of my life , I remember I took a pill then took some of the pill broken up into a monster energy drink then moments later ... I sense of fear like BIG fear came over me and I told everybody in the room "" something isn't right "" then my eyes started going back and fourth really fast from side to side about like 2 times I think ... Then I had to get out of the room I started walking outside I was freezing my heart was pounding and I was shaking because I was so cold ... I was totally not there I could feel people talking but I wasn't completely there then everything got worse I got very sweaty and hot and HORNY I was saying crazy $#%^ like the devil was in me . I kept saying "" I'm going to hell "" "" God is real God is real "" it felt like all my worst fears are happening i was saying crazy $#%^ I felt embarrassed then I would apologize and say "" you guys are never gonna hang out with me again "" it felt like I was possessed i wAs doing and saying the craziest $#%^ my moods would go from "" ###$ you "" to "" I'm so sorry idk why I said that "" things were moving so fast to like my trip everything was in fast motion , I got angry ... I had to run around I streaked jumped on cars . It was just very scary and crazy like I've never experienced that before I don't know what happened but it changed my life forever .... I was only 16 at the time , idk why it happened but I know I was overdosing as well but never called 911 ... I also had a fear that I was dieing I kept telling everyone "" I'm dieing I'm going to hell "" I kept saying crazy $#%^ . Eventually it worn off I stopped trippin I was in shock as to what happened I think I blacked out durning some of the trip as well . So after I couple days I couldn't sleep alone I slept with my mom everything was so different , I was so scared I thought that like the devil was after me I thought I wa shearing voices at one point. Every time I would close my eyes in the dark I would make out scary images . Then eventually I developed a anexity disorder and panic disorder and I'm convinced I have PTSD . My panic attacks are about that I died that night and I am in hell and I'm going to keep going through what I went through that night because that is my hell . Like I said before I blacked out so it convinces me that I might have died . Plus everything seemed so dream like to me felt like I was in a dream everything looked unreal . So eventually I got over the hearing the voices and not being able to sleep alone or sleep in the dark . Where I'm at is with my panic attacks and anexity I can't even get in a car or anything I pretty much just stay home I can't live my life I live in fear. I have heart palpitations from all this and a high heart rate . I won't take any other medication because I'm traumatized that I will have a bad trip . I will physc myself out into having a panic attack on the medication . I don't have any fiends because all the people I used to hangout with were the people I did all the bad stuff with and partied with . I completely changed I don't drink I don't smoke or anything anymore I just sit in my house all the damn time . I feel like I need help I have bad depression from all this because I don't wanna live like this it's sad and scary I wouldn't wish this upon anybody . I also have some hate for myself because I did this to myself . I just don't know what to do I can't live myself and there's so many things I want to do in life ... Nobody understands my mom things I just over react she gets mad that I miss my dentist appointments and extc all because of my anexity I'm scared to have an anexity attack or panic attack while I'm out. I just have so many problems now I don't know what to do I want friends that know what I go through or go through similar things as me so we can get through it together.. Be there for each other and extc I don't wanna feel so alone. Certain things freak me out to like loud noises or if I hear a noise and can't figure out what it is I HAVE to find out or I'll freak out. Fast forwarding stuff freaks me out the ceilings fans that move fast freak me out , seeing people in fear or freak out makes me freak out. I have all these new problems that I never had before .. I have a little bit of OCD, i get panicky when my mom doesn't answer her phone and I don't know where she's at I'll freak myself and think the worst . I over think EVERYTHING and always end up freaking myself out which leads me to a panic attack . $#%^ is just crazy now I can't live like this I don't know what to do I need friends I need someone there for me who knows ... Idk what to do ...."
"Effects of Anxiety on Memories of Past Hi all, I just had a general question out of curiosity, What kind of effects does anxiety & OCD have on memories of certain events in someone's past that might affecting them negatively in the present day ? I'm currently dealing with regret and shame of a past memory over 10 years ago and I'm worried my anxiety / OCD might be twisting it into something much more then it is ? Thanks all for any insight you might have"

"Where is this awful feeling coming from? I can’t pinpoint it I just woke up and I feel terrible. I don’t know what exactly I feel. It’s a combination of extreme dread, pain, and especially fear. But of what? There’s nothing that can hurt me. I didn’t even have a nightmare last night like I always do. There is no real life danger, but I have this awful feeling that something horrendous is about to happen and I have no idea what. In my teens, I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety multiple times by various psychiatrists so I know that my nerves are out of whack, but I just can’t shake this feeling off even though I’m 100% certain it’s irrational. I’ve been feeling the same “sense of impending doom” every time I wake up for many years now. Anyone know the cause and how to prevent it? I used to believe alcohol was the cause but I haven’t drank in more than a week. The feeling goes away the longer I’m awake but still lingers throughout the day. Hate living like this."
"Where is this awful feeling coming from? I can’t pinpoint it MarkP wrote: It may be irrational, but the feeling is real. You say you were diagnosed with social anxiety, but did you get any therapy for it? But anyway, it sounds like you need some now. It’s usually only very strong for a short period of time after I wake up. Now I’ve been awake for a few hours, I feel moderately okay."
"Where is this awful feeling coming from? I can’t pinpoint it ijustwannabenormal wrote: There is no real life danger, but I have this awful feeling that something horrendous is about to happen and I have no idea what. Hi! So I don't experience this but I think its safe to say you aren't alone. I have to take depression screening tests for my pdoc every so often and the sense of impending doom question is on them. Again I don't experience this so I don't know how it relates to depression (I believe its actually an anxiety thing) but they do ask about it every time. I would talk to your Dr. as they may be able to help you. ijustwannabenormal wrote: The feeling goes away the longer I’m awake but still lingers throughout the day. Your subconsciousness is most alert to things that are wrong when you first wake up. In your case for some reason it has decided that you are not safe. Its an error, but thats what it believes and it wants you to know it which is why you feel something bad is about to happen to you. Your body can only maintain this heightened level of alertness you feel for at about 40 minutes. After that it will fade. Dx: Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder"
"Where is this awful feeling coming from? I can’t pinpoint it i have this too but i don't think mine as irrational,like i can pinpoint it.i am afraid always that something bad is going to happen ,i think maybe is a kind of trauma because i don't feel safe,when i grew up often something bad happened and now i expect it but also is fear of the future. but i don't find it so weird like i can't pint point it,i feel it as something rational,like bad things always happen and i don't feel safe.but it makes me more depressed. i feel like there is real danger,i think too many things can hurt me and not that there is nothing. same with depression this is why it confuses me because they say people who are depressed are for no reason but i feel there is a reason. sorry that i don't have advice how to get over it,i hope you don't mind me sharing that i feel similar. i guess one way is i repeat to myself this moment you are safe and is ok.but the feeling is generally ligering always but not so intense"
"Klonopin + Gabapentin Hi, in case no one knew about this. They have a synergistic effect on each other. And it tends to make the benzos stronger. No should I continue doing this mix if I'm only taking it for anxiety. But it's like, now my anxiety is almost none. Has anyone else heard of this?"
"Klonopin + Gabapentin You are taking these medications together as your physician prescribed them? Or is this something you are doing on your own? There have been reported side-effects, like mania. I would proceed with caution. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"Klonopin + Gabapentin Hi! Could you site the source of this information? I am on both Gabapentin and Clonazepam. While you are correct that being on both does decrease anxiety somewhat more that Clonazepam alone (at least for me) AFAIK the drugs do not interact with each other in any meaningful way. I checked drugs.com and it doesn't show any interaction either, but I know that is not a 100% guarantee that they don't. Thanks! Dx: Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder"
"Fear of everything going wrong(health) I'm 25 years old. When I was a kid I was exposed constantly to family dramas and fights between my parents, sometimes violent. Growing up I developed a strong character, always calm and honest with myself, a strong physical constitution. Thanks to this I've always been healthy and fully recovered from 2 car crashes, 3 neck vertebrae disks fractures, internal throat bleeding due to glass splinter in food losing 1.3 liter of blood, multiple head physical traumas from childhood, almost losing a testicle when little falling from a tree, bipolar episodes 3 years ago when my father died and more. For the past 4 months or so up until now, I feel like something's wrong inside. At start I thought it was something casual as always, but it doesn't go away. Especially when I try to fall asleep, I can feel muscle spasms a lot more and sometimes I wake up due to my own body jerking, shaking the whole bed, waking up scared. Also when in bed sometimes I feel like my heart stops beating and I'm about to pass out, and that's where anxiety starts eating me. I'm saving money for a full blood check-up which is really expensive where I live. I also live alone and have to pay for a lot of things and saving money isn't easy, not on the best of terms with family so asking them for help is not an option. My mother says it's all in my head and that I should switch to a healthier lifestyle and I'll feel better but I know it's more than that. I've never felt this way, even in the worst conditions I've ever been in the past, this is different. I smoke a pack of cigarettes daily, drink lots of beer during weekends with friends which is actually the only time I'm not anxious. I don't do drugs, I also have a pretty chaotic sleep pattern and I workout 4 times a week. I'm starting to be scared, afraid and feeling weak. I don't feel like myself anymore. How do I deal with this?"
"Fear of everything going wrong(health) Ofc we can't say that it's absolutely nothing, but nothing you've said can't be also explained by anxiety and poor habits, like smoking and chaotic sleep. Jerking when falling asleep is common- irritating, but a known phenomenon. I've gone thru bouts of my heart racing when trying to compose myself for sleep. I've felt weak; shaky; oodles of other things that could be either something terrible. Or anxiety. Which I have in spades. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"Fear of everything going wrong(health) Thank you for the reply. These past 4 days I've automatically come to the conclusion that being afraid is useless and that this is just another phase or transaction from my old self to the new reality I'm in. Maybe the way I feel is all caused by me being unable to move forward and find a real thing to believe in.. there were times I had to hold on to something(chair, table) because I felt like I was about to fall down and my brain about to shut down, it once happened in front of my mother too and I felt pretty pathetic in that moment. It's funny how the subconscious adapts and gives answers in time.."
"Will these pills do the trick? I’ve been on clonazepam for many years and now I can’t even go to the doc’s for a visit from the anxiety. After half hour I finally made it inside. Long story short, I was given escitalopram 10mg (aka Lexipro). Has anyone tried this? Any success stories? Thanks."
"Will these pills do the trick? Different results for different people and different side effects. I was on Buspar and Imipramine years ago. They may be effective when combined with doctor's monitoring and counseling. There are no miracle cures out there, but there can be breakthroughs. Avoid alcohol, non-prescribed drugs, tobacco and caffeine. You might also find more info under 'Medication': medication/ Best of luck to you.

"I don't know what to do about this. I have been thinking of reaching out for help online and writing this post for over a month, and I feel like I've hit rock bottom now and I should do it. I am a new member (not a native English speaker, hopefully this won't be a problem) and I've never resorted to mental health forums or support groups before. I find myself in a situation that I am now unable to deal with and for which I am not able to find a name yet, which is what brings me here today. I need to gain understanding about my problem if I want to fix it, and I think I should start understanding whether this is an actual issue at all and acquire tools to describe it properly. I am not sure if this is the correct section but I do believe my problems are anxiety-related and I am open to further clarifications. I will try to explain what I'm dealing with as clearly as possible and eventually add background information if necessary. I am a 27 year old woman and during the last few months I have been experiencing unpleasant and almost unbearable physical sensations, accompanied by a great deal of related anxiety. These symptoms have been profoundly affecting my lifestyle, my productivity and my peace of mind. I haven't found a clear definition for my combination of symptoms so I will try and list them as carefully as possible: - Troubles with sleeping (this started around 4 years ago and has been worsening in time). Examples of this could be: at first I would prefer to arrange my sheets/duvet/pillows in a certain manner. I would sometimes remove my sheets to avoid crinkles. I would spend a significant amount of time moving the bed/adjusting bedding in order to feel more ""comfortable"". This would happen with virtually any combination of sheets, pillows, mattresses etc. (So I wasn't using anything that was actually uncomfortable). I would sometimes question hosts and friends about how comfortable they found my bed to be and would always receive positive comments, such as that the mattress was soft and comfy. Then I would experience discomfort while sleeping in beds different from my own (such as when going on vacation, sleeping at friend's house...) to the point that I would complain about not being able to get some good sleep in other people's beds. This has eventually led to an anticipatory fear of going on vacation, etc., due to being uncomfortable in bed, and in a feeling of shame in showing other people how I arrange my bed, how much time I spend adjusting it, and how much I toss and turn at night. I have noticed a ritualistical fashion in those behaviors. - Fidgeting in clothes: this has been worsening during the very last few months, and seems to have build up in time. At first I would find myself avoiding particular garments that weren't particulary comfortable; I am now in a place where I can only wear the same thing all the time, clothes have to fit certain standards for me to even consider buying them. I have given up on wearing garments that I never had problems with and that I didn't want to give up on, such bras and tights, which causes a lot of embarassment and discomfort. In winter I tend to be too cold because I cannot wear thick thights; in summer I have to wear oversized clothing to conceal the fact that I'm not wearing a bra. I don't attempt to buy underwear anymore because I have spent a lot of money on it and nothing would fit comfortably. I found some comfortable underwear a couple of years ago and have managed to keep that till now, but that will soon wear out and I don't know what I'll wear after that. I have come to the point of only having 2 night shirts that I could sleep on, I even have to try on socks before deciding if I can wear them, and I feel a lot of discomfort and find myself fidgeting in clothes when I am outside. Virtually nothing seems to fit comfortably. - Related anxiety: I do have anxiety both unrelated to these issues and anticipatory/subsequential anxiety. When I am supposed to go out, I experience anticipatory anxiety because I know my clothes might not fit comfortably and I spend a lot of time and energy planning what to wear so that that doesn't happen, or at least to alleviate those feelings. I sometimes avoid going out or have breakdowns after going out because of those unpleasant sensations. I find myself struggling to do things that other people can do naturally - such as sleeping, running errands, going on vacation. I find myself clenching my teeth and developing exhausting headaches in results of these activities, or having breakdowns when I've got to perform such activities. I strongly believe this is a psychological issue because I haven't always had it (it seems to build up and worsen in time) and because when I am in a very good place mentally, my symptoms improve dramatically. I want to become a better person and be a functional part of this society. I used to work in cancer research in university and would love to keep my work up but the burden of everyday life seems to weigh me down. I am certain this is anxiety driven and I would love to get a job so that I can afford therapy and learn more about myself and this ""condition""."
"I don't know what to do about this. Hello and welcome. This isn't the busiest section of the forum so I'm sorry no-one has replied to you sooner. You have done well to reach out for help here. Firstly, the symptoms you describe are not normal, they are impeding your daily functioning and are bothering you, so regardless of the cause, they are certainly a problem for you. It is good that you can recognise that your symptoms dramatically improve when you are in a good place mentally. You are right that this gives a big clue that your symptoms are psychological. The other thing that made me think that your symptoms might be psychological was this: as I read through what you have written you say that you have hit rock bottom, that you are unable to deal with it and you describe it as a problem and wanting to address it but then you conflict against yourself and say that you are not sure that it is an actual issue at all. This kind of conflicted thinking is often a sign that a problem is psychological, you are caught between being motivated to change and being motivated to ignore it (because these kind of symptoms usually have a deeper background that is really challenging to deal with). Your actual symptoms reminded me a bit of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).You have something you are constantly thinking (obsessing) about: are you going to be comfortable and what can you do to make yourself comfortable. And you have a compulsion (action that you have to carry out): to readjust the bed or to only put on certain comfortable clothing. Your symptoms might fit other psychological problems, only a professional can give you a diagnosis and help you down that road. Have you considered seeking out a professional to help you with these problems? In a way, I am not defined by my dissociation. In a way, I am. FORMER admin moderator.

"I don't know what to do about this. Hi Eleonora91 It sounds like this burden as been weighing on you for sometime. I fyou need some help, it's a miracle that there are people out there, who dedicated years of study, practice, and energy to figure why we people do what we do. The first time I intereacted with a counselor (and it was far from my last),I asked him when things go from a problem to a pyschlogical disorder (referring to the difference between depression and clinical despression). He said ""When it begins to detract from the quality of life"". We were talking about depression, but I believe the rule applies with all cases. Like salted lipstick said ""only a professional can give you a diagnosis and help you down that road. Have you considered seeking out a professional to help you with these problems?"""
"I don't know what to do about this. Hello @salted lipstick and @stereoplayer, I apologize for my late reply but have not been very active on this board lately. Yes I have considered seeking professional help, what has been mostly holding me back is that I don't know the cause of my symptoms and whether they have a psychological or physical origin. It is also hard to describe my symptoms and I haven't had much luck reading about them online. The first time you come across something it might be hard to describe it properly as you do not possess proper tools to adress the issue. It is not as easy as learning about the symptoms of conditions like depression or anxiety since I have not read about similar symptoms often online (apart from people who apprently suffer from sensory processing conditions). I have, surprisingly enough, found other people referring to similar symptoms on a social anxiety board, but I do not feel like I suffer from social anxiety and I don't think that gives me more insight on what I'm going through. My main concern is that therapy is quite expensive and I would need to open up about this with my family. It is already hard enough to explain my situation to my closest friends as they ""question"" me about the causes of my anxiety and don't seem to get it."
"Paranoia or Anxiety? I am very new, in fact I just registered. The reason I registered is because I saw a post from someone else that really reminded me of an issue I am currently dealing with but with a different reason. I've always been the kind of person that would ask ""what if"" at an extremely early age to now because of fear of the unknown. I never realized it as an issue until my fourth grade year when my anxiety started to show itself in the ugliest way. No one knew what was wrong with me and I didn't know what was wrong with me. I never knew mental illness was a thing. Through the years, I've developed irrational fears stemming from the anxiety. I was professionally diagnosed in November of 2013. Nothing was done to help. The whole goal of everyone around me was to keep me off of medication but now I think it's ruining my life. The constant fear, paranoia, and high vigilance I have throughout the day being alone is exhausting and every sound of situation in my mind feeds it all. I can't stop looking over my shoulder, feeling like someone or something is always there. I cannot think back to any trauma and neither can my family. I've just always been scared. Scared of people and things I don't understand. The intrusive thoughts about absolutely terrifying things that can and WILL happen to me in my lifetime playing over and over and over again in my mind before bed strains my sleep thin and I dread going to sleep at night.And they're not thoughts like my day time thoughts which are to lock all the doors and windows and draw my blinds and board up my bedroom door to sit in here all day - they're thoughts about my life and what is to come and what I'll be dealing with until the day I pass. I have panic attack after panic attack and it exhausts me to sleep and that's no way to live for me. I constantly go to the doctor to get help where no help is given. Recently, I've had to go in because of my heart fluttering randomly and near-fainting and I know for a fact it's because of the anxiety. It's slowly eating away at my life and my doctor wants to keep me off of anti-anxiety medications for fear I'll gain more weight. I've exhausted all other ways to cope with it that are healthy and wont damage my life or well-being and I'm left with the only option being medication. But all of this has left me with the question... How? How do I cope with this? How can I sleep? How can I calm my mind? How can I stop looking over my shoulder? I fear that I'm asking too much of my doctor asking for him to see me for symptoms because he cannot fix what I have. He can't take away the anxiety or the depression but the symptoms are becoming too much. Should I just go and be honest? I feel like our meetings are so strained and like I'm being timed every single second I am there. I'm far too poor to keep going or to get a therapist."
"Paranoia or Anxiety? I've been fearful too, from a very early age- probably around three or four. In my case I'm wondering if it was a case of PANS or PANDAS. Not that I haven't had traumatic patches, but I don't know- I do seem to be awful fragile without a absolute reason why. I've thought about meds, I can feel the stress eat away at my body and health. I probably look ten years older than I am, by this point. And I feel it. I'd just be like hey Doc, I'm not coping, I gotta have something to take the edge off of all these fears that eat at me. I mean I know doctors be all about weight, but unless we're talking about seriously high unhealthy levels of obesity... they set the bar for 'obese' way too low, IMO. Life's no good if your brain is gonna torture you day and night. I know I get so very tired. Being in frequent Fight or Flight is pretty tiring. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"I've created a second persona to deal with my anxiety Honestly I'm quite new to this forum stuff and to my SAD but I hope someone reads this and gives their opinion to my ""solution"" or even my story. I wrote my story down first because I been wanting express EVERYTHING that I believe has caused this SAD while retaining my anonymity and the COMPLETE truth of my feelings and situations I've been in. Sorry for the long response, I rambled and vented quite a bit of stuff that was pent up, so I just wrote it all out without stopping.:roll Read what you want, but my direct topic is the last 2 underlined paragraphs How my SAD started/Introduction.... Ever since my friend/teammate was shot and killed in October I had begun smoking ALOT of weed thinking I was subconsciously fine but it was a very poor coping mechanism. Was also dodging deans at my school and police outside because I was selling snacks and marijuana edibles to put money into my (and my mother's) VERY poor pockets. (Got caught up with it previously in school but continued under the radar despite being ). Next, I was helping my friend find his sweater which had stolen in a brawl between 2 different parties (one party known, from my school, and the other unknown) in the store we were in. While outside, we see 2 of the unknown guys who were in the fight follow my other friends who walk off and we follow and then suddenly the 2 guys disappear. They (unknown party from brawl) reappear with 8-10 other people coming down to us and attempt to rob us of our phones. We refuse and 2 of them jump one of my other friends. I jump in to fight them to save my friend and I get hit with a blunt object but I'm okay. They run off and leave They stole my some of stuff while fighting, my friends coat and his money and my other friends sweater. I later hear from a bystander that they had seen the unknown men tuck away a gun after telling their acquaintances not to shoot (it sounds unbelievable but stuff like this happens in NYC all the time.) I smoked after that as well too. I started to have mini panic attacks for a while while I was high and I decided to stop smoking cold turkey in a month. Trying to change from habitually smoking to socially or barely at all. But since then I've been alot more depressed and anxious, not only fearing for my safety but also always feeling judged. I think it may have been because in my depressive state I stopped taking care of my hygiene as much as I would usually and it may have caused my clothes to smell because of how blazed I was 4/7 days out of the week(before, during and afterschool) and my overall laziness while high. Alot of problems devloped with my mom as well. I was coming home at nearly 11pm everyday. Subsequently leading to me being locked out one day on a school night and lots and screaming matches. One day specifically, my anxiety was so bad I honestly thought I had $#%^ on myself because I constantly smelled $#%^ somewhere always near me ( I dropped my the bottom of my bag in some dog $#%^ while I was high and it wasnt washed immediately afterwards, found out because my mom took my bag and washed it while afterwards telling me it smelled lol...still didnt ease my stress) and I was incredibly embarrassed about it. So I was problrably talked about all day and I didnt know until 7th period when everyone said it smelled like $#%^. I didnt know it was my bag while I was tweaking out and having an anxiety attack already because my teacher was talking about drugs and it perked my ears up to wondering if she was talking about me being high. So that anxiety probably didnt help me look/ act normal. Ever since then I've upset and self conscious because I basically feel like a walking piece of glass and all my insecurities can be seen . Not feeling safe having to watch my back and also smelling bad specifically. I know its dumb but I always get anxious when someone scratches, sniffles or covers their nose. Also if someone stares at me for too long, walks behind me slow (what I feel like is too slow) and having their hands in their pockets for a long time, I get paranoid. I used to constantly ask my mom and sister if I smell bad but they would always just say no and eventually get upset and tell me to stop. Also used to be very conscious about smelling when I had weed on me too, always trying to cover it up to avoid detection So this might be a way that my brain/karma is kicking my ass for my stupidity. Oh and also my absent father who I haven't heard from in 9 years is trying to come back into my life as well.:frown2: (No, I'm not a gang member, no I don't continue in illegal distribution of such products, yes I do live in the hood) Me Currently.... Started medication, adderrall which helps my ADHD and depressive laziness and antidepressants for the anxiety and depression as well. I have been scared to go to school, go outside, and really live my life. Anxious about everything; smelling bad, if I'm being judged about how I dress, if someone is watching me or plotting on me and about fake friends. In my extended loneliness I've had of time to review how they acted and treated me and how naive I was to trust them(These feelings have extended to family as well, I've had many epiphanies about the duplicitous actions of the assholes in my life). Now I stick to making artwork(which helps me while home), listening to music and binge watching tv shows. Been feeling pretty pathetic. My mom has been understanding mostly but her outbursts of frustration when I have my emotional fits of depression include her yelling ""Your life is not as hard as you make it seem! You don't see me taking a pill for whenever I dont feel good!"", which just makes me feel like an even bigger burden. Yesterday I ate an edible early and locked myself in the room while I ""took a nap"" AKA silently crying for an hour and then going to sleep. But I've been looking for a job in spite of it but the constant rejection keeps reinforcing my negative thought process.:crying: The Topic/My Solution... In my pathetic times of binge-watching I have likened a character from Power, Ghost aka James St. Patrick. I have been watching this show for a month now and he is a character that embodies EVERYTHING I want to grow to be like. He is successful, a businessman (drug-dealer and nightclub owner; no I dont want to be a drug dealer anymore despite my past), father, confident, powerful, meticulous, intelligent, respected, fashionable, attractive, cunning, artful and overall an alpha male. Someone who demands and earns respect from those around him. I have been analyzing every part of his characteristics and I think that since I can't handle being the real me, I say to myself, ""how would Ghost act/respond in this ?"", then I tell myself to ""Be Ghost"" and I can feel my anxiety go away for a while as I let the ""Ghost"" that I have analyzed and created take control of my thoughts and mind. Its my coping mechanism that helps me but I would like to know if anyone else does this? does this seem like a bad idea even though its the only thing that works for right now? Am I ""crazy"" for this logic? or is as similar to the the stock phrase ""imagine the audience naked?"" Sorry for the long response, I rambled and vented quite a bit of stuff that was pent up, so I just wrote it all out without stopping.:roll Read what you want, but my direct topic is underlined above this sentence.

"This made me really anxious I am sometimes the anxious type who over-worries, overthinks things way too much, and I'm also oversensitive when I feel I have been wronged... but depending on the toughness or sensibilities of the other person, I also find myself unwilling to stick up for myself TOO much. Especially since I have found that I react way too badly sometimes when I'm upset, and when I know that I'm to blame partially for the situation, I know that anything I say might just dig me deeper than I was in the first place. So basically, back in May, I got super-excited about something... as I do sometimes. I have always been the type who gets WAY too excited about fandoms, particularly when I want to use them as an escape from reality (which probably is not healthy to begin with...) So I went searching for someone to commission to write a story I didn't have the motivation or energy to write myself. In my own way, I think I was also looking for new chat buddies, because all of my friends who I used to talk about fandoms with previously have become busy and less available, or they're not that interested in fandoms anymore. So I found someone who was taking commissions due to a family emergency, and I paid her forty dollars. She was clear upfront that when she could get to it would depend upon her muse, but that I wouldn't have to wait too long. In the end, she ended up refunding me after a week or two with a heartfelt apology, and I said I understood. And I did, especially since she was so polite about it. Then I turned to a friend of hers (with her blessing), and that's where the trouble started. To be fair, I DO have to say that a lot of this probably is my fault. When I get really excited about something, I sometimes start to develop certain expectations of a new person, especially since... as I indicated above, I have been pretty bored and lonely lately in the fandom departments, and I don't have much exciting going on in my life at times. So basically, I ran an idea by the new person, and she said she LOVED it. She also said she was going to be really busy, because she was working on a manuscript for professional publishing in July. So, just to be clear here, I paid her in May, and she said that it would take ""two weeks"", or possibly sometime in late June before she could really do anything on my commission. (I paid her seventy-five dollars; the previous person had been offering discounts due to the family emergency in the hopes of attracting more business more quickly.) Now... to be fair here, I had NEVER commissioned anyone to do any kind of writing before, so it is possible that I'm just not sure of the proper/standard etiquette, plus... I have seen independent individuals in the commission/crafting world tell others sometimes that 1: You can't rush art, and 2: that coming to them isn't the same as coming to a place in retail where everybody has a product available in two seconds. Plus... I think there were maybe some minor areas I got a little too friendly too fast, because I have sometimes felt (especially on the internet) that if someone seems nice, and we seem to be hitting it off, we're potential BFF material even if we're not. Also, it probably doesn't help matters any that I changed my mind four times, (I wanna go with this idea, no maybe I want to cancel now, no maybe I want to do this instead... no I'd like to go back to the original idea we started off with...) And I can definitely see how that would drive someone nuts, because sometimes I can be incredibly long-winded in my emails, and I've been told by other people before that sometimes I don't articulate very well when I get over-excited or anxious, leaving others to wonder WHAT I am trying to say, since a lot of my meaning sometimes gets lost in a lot of rambling. I have also driven others nuts sometimes due to my wishy-washyness, even my own family. And I'd have to say I acted wishy-washy in this case. In the end, (Again, bear in mind that I paid her in May, I was assured she would probably start the project in June, and I waited until mid-July to follow up much, when I heard nothing) so I finally demanded a couple of days ago for some kind of response, saying I either needed some kind of reply, since I did pay her, or I needed a refund. She then got kinda brash about it, saying that yes I did pay her, but I had broken every rule of etiquette and I did not respect personal space because I had sent her multiple emails, notes on Deviantart, and even posted on her profile wall once. And she also said that she had been upfront with me that she was busy, and simply said she wouldn't suffer any more pestering and that I should expect a refund by next Sunday, minus five dollars due to the pestering. Now... the thing is, I have pretty much decided to let the whole thing drop, because I pretty much consider it resolved now and if anything... I consider the entire matter to be a blessing in disguise, because it has shown me where I really DO need to start working on some of my own behavior. I even deactivated my Deviantart account and I backed off considerably from social media and fandom outlets, realizing that they are toxic to me and they make me very anxious... not to mention it's a bit too easy for me to get caught up in fandoms like a very unhealthy drug. But... I guess I have a bit too much of my mother in me, because there are still a few things that bug me about the entire matter. 1: On the person's own page, they said that they have a policy of trying to respond to any messages they receive within two business days, and if that is there policy, I didn't appreciate being ignored, especially since there were times when I WAS good at keeping my distance, and I didn't pester her at all during the month of July until I finally demanded a response, to which I got that catty response. 2: Since she had originally assured me that she would begin my commission sometime in June, she could've at least done me the courtesy of keeping me up to date, on her own, if there were going to be any delays. I got absolutely nothing but silence out of her until I got more aggressive and demanded an answer in mid-July. Honestly... I also feel that I should just let the entire matter slide and I probably did deserve her saying she would dock five dollars in a way, because I DID dump a lot of text on her in at least three emails in a row in May, and I did send her a few notes on DA and post on her profile wall once, and the poor woman probably felt bombarded, especially since she indicated she has mental issues and she has been very busy with a manuscript. To be fair, she might be anxious about pleasing her publisher, or maybe something even went wrong in the deal that disappointed her or she had to do rewrites, I don't know. I have a feeling I pressed the wrong buttons at the wrong time, which I am pretty good at doing since I can be a pest and sometimes I am not very tactful or considerate of other people's time. :/ I think in some ways... maybe I've also been getting a little too hyped up on my mom's attitude lately, and she's been adding to my ire in general, because she works in retail and it seems like any time we have any problems with people or them not acting fast enough or responding readily, she gets very, very angry and impatient, saying that if she responded so slowly or so badly in her line of work she'd be fired on the spot, and she's used to the idea that you are supposed to treat customers like royalty and she, in turn, excepts to be treated well whenever she's dealing with ANYONE in any kind of business venture. I can also hear her in my mind saying that if you commission someone, then that person should be treated like they are both the employee AND manager/boss of their own little business and should be treating/responding to ""customers"" accordingly... although I'm not entirely sure if it really works quite like retail when you are dealing with an independent writer on Deviantart who just does some writing on the side of a regular-based life/job or whatever.... So... I think I applied this mentality to this woman I commissioned, where I expected her to be my buddy, and maybe I expected her to be my friend and be willing to go over any text I sent her at the drop of a hat just because I had paid her, I don't know. When... I should have realized from the start that it was gonna be strictly professional, and I probably should have been more organized and decided what I was gonna do and what I wanted before I contacted her, and before I started bombarding her and changing my mind a lot. In the end, the entire episode left me anxious, left me overthinking and nitpicking to death about what I did wrong and what I feel she did wrong, and what everybody did wrong, and I even got upset over it a few times and even cried about it once or twice. I also feel like I've had some bratty entitlement issues over the entire thing, because... maybe I feel like I deserved her to be like my buddy and speak to me well, just because I paid her seventy-five dollars, even though she ""owed"" me nothing of the sort really. :/ In the end, I want to just forget that it happened. I pretty much cut ties with her and I'm just awaiting the refund, (money has always been a really sensitive issue for me anyway, particularly since I don't have THAT much to spare), and I have a feeling that if I say or do anything else at this point, it will probably just make everything worse, particularly since I think I expected too much too fast (INSTA-BUDDY!), not to mention I did bombard her a bit and I changed my mind about what i wanted or didn't want at least four times over the span of a month, which probably stressed her out and confused her on top of everything else she has to deal with right now. Just... I don't know. >.< If nothing else, it felt good just to organize my feelings on the matter and vent a little, I'm not sure what I'm looking for here or if this is even the appropriate forum/area to do this. I just know I learned one thing. I am never gonna do this again, since I've found I just really can't handle it and I come across as more of a disorganized pest than anything, and... I'm just not really gonna get involved in fandoms as much anymore, because I seem to develop very high expectations and it's almost like I want the writing equivalent of Burger King, have it done your way and have it done fast. :/ Not to mention I shouldn't be using fandoms as a substitute/escape from reality anyway, at least not religiously."
"Worst year of my life, ANXIETY and PARANOIA Hello everyone, I'm seeking help regarding my situation. I'm continuosly stressed and anxious about everything. I can't relax, i am restless and alsways have to keep myself occupied if it's not with cigarettes it is doing something with my hands. I don't freely think anymore, i'm always concearned about what others might think of me, i feel powerless and not good enough to face others. I am a student in international business and as the first year went well this second one was the worst! I can't concentrate anymore, i feel stupid... i have thoughts like as if there was a conspiracy against me and as if everyone knew how i felt....excessive paranoia! i have lost respect for myself. i don't have passions and i lost every sort of interest, i was not like that last years. i now can't have fun anymore coz i'm always concearned with something. i never know what to say, i'm not funny anymore coz all i can think of is how i am appearing to others and what others might think of me. it's like i lost the ability to think for myself. my happiness depends on the happiness of the people around me and i'm always looking in trying to understand how they feel instead of thinking about me. i lost that ability, it's like i'm experiencing dementia... and recently i'm noticing that my way of walking is not stable, it is like as if i limp. as you can tell i have many problems...and to me it happened because of my weed abuse of last year. it's been 2 months now since the last time i smoked weed and nothing changed. therefor i really don't know what to do. help!!!"
"Please help, my days are ruined Hej, I'm 24 years old an posted a similar thread in the sexual category. I've had a couple of very nice responses there, but my mind is still going in circles...so I came here to see if this might be more anxiety driven obsessive behavior. A bit about myself: I am still a virgin, but had sexual encounters with the opposite sex on quite a few occasions and really enjoyed them when I did. I'm very indecisive and need a lot of approval from the outside world and do let my (mainly female friends) make decisions for me (also in terms of who I should/shouldn't date/ have sex with). They don't actively say that, but i always contemplate what would they think of me if I had sex with this guy... About a month and a half ago I visited a friend and was in quite a rut, I was unhappy for no real reasons (that only happend to me throughout this last year of my masters it was mainly due to my looks that I was very in confident in and my inability to make friends easily) and wondered why. Also meeting new people at her Erasmus made me nervous as I have social anxiety. When we came into the kitchen I got struck by the beauty of her female flatmates (long her, feminine dressing and bodies) and I though 'Oh my god, I must be gay'. From there on I panicked and started checking whether or not I am actually attracted to women or men (everyone I saw). I started going over my past encounters with men, questioning why I never went further with them and if that I didn't indicated I'm gay. I got stuck in my mind, encapsuled myself and went back home to my family where I cried myself to sleep every night. I have never felt so uncertain and I took every test that I could find on the Internet googleing how do i know if I'm gay? Of course when the answer was straight I felt relieve for some time, but then got back at it again. When the answer was gay or bi I lost it and started getting air shortage/ heart racing and panic attacks. It just doesn't feel right to me. (no offense here, I grew up in a very accepting surrounding, I have lesbian/gay friends and my parents are also okay with that) Ever since I am more aware of womens bodies when I am around them, always questioning am I attracted to that? It gives me a lot of anxiety and pain as I am by now not really able to tell what actually is attraction and what is just appreciation of a beautiful human or 'normal attention' given to the same sex. When I dream I usually dream about being with males, actually never a woman. When masturbating I think of a man being turned on by me and how I could turn him on best. (Is that weird in itself?) When I try to imagine being with a woman I feel either nothing or need to start burping which is usually my sign for 'nah not for me'. Thinking of men makes me happy, but nevertheless I am questioning the reality of my feelings as I was never good at pinpointing them down. When I'm with my friends I feel like of 'course your straight, no attraction whatsoever' again until anxiety hits me and I try to look for tension when we touch. But it's not a sexual 'zing', more an awareness of the other body that I feel and it is not nice. Romantically I definitley had crushes on boys, butterflies, heart racing, stomach drop, everything. When it comes to girls I head one really deep friendship whit a girl I admired I found her so cool (the way she dresse, was confident) and I am now questioning whether that was a crush or just me seeking a role-model? It was never sexual with her although we got changed in front of eachother and had a lot of sleep-overs/went on holiday togehter. Of course I thought 'oh she looks really good in that bra' but more in a sense of 'I wish my boobs were not as wonky and more like hers'. Now I'm questioning whether that was all or if my wanting to be like her/admiration ment more. It gives me anxiety spikes talking to her and I just want to be able to return to our normal friendship! With men I always dream about finding the man that make me laugh and I a am happy with and I had a couple of good friendships that turned into more, which is the point I backed out for various reasons (mostly me having lied about being a virgin, friends saying 'you really like HIM?' and me then questioning it) Although I want to be liked/ dress up for men I am shy when it comes to speaking to them and I can't seem to find the right words to make myself interesting to them which make me angry at myself. I can easily talk to girls and I used to think it's because there's 'nothing at stake' sexually. I am so confused! After spending most of my time on formus like this reading around coming out and anxiety stories, it's just enough...why can't I know what I feel? Yesterday I took a flexuality test that was recommended in this for mum, once I answered what I hope/believe to be true which came out with mostly straight and a tat of ambisexual. Then I took the test again answering all the questions with uncetain or the middle scale as I really don't know how I feel/can't determine what I feel and it popped up with mostly ambisexual, but still quite a lot of straight. (almost same) which made me feels super anxious and I went back to the forum to reassure myself that I am not lesbian. In the test it also indicated some sort of change in my sexuality which gave me another hit and I thought no that's not true, but started questioning it afterwards. It is true I don't feel as feminine at the moment, but that is due to a way to short haircut that gives me a lot of insecurities as I just want to be back to my normal girly seductive self. I am now constantly afraid someon ecould assume that I was a lesbian due to my haircut and I try to dress purposely female. That mostly females complimented me on my hair doesn't make it any better. I a pretty certain that I don't want to have a penis so I'm trying not to give too much attention to that part of the test. But does my not-so-feminie-feeling mean that I have to be attracted to girls? Am I aware of girls more because they radiate what I want back for myself? This morning I woke up still dreaming about being with a boy, I thought oh there it is you're straight and fell back asleep. When I woke up again my mind went 'Are you really'' and I started checking again, not knowing what the true answer is. I am so tired of this. Please help."
"Please help, my days are ruined Also I should maybe mention that I would do and care a lot for my friends (male and female) and most of my more serious dating came from a friendship with a man. As soon as he showed interest in me I would stop investing as much in him as he might think I wanted too much. (whatever that is) and when he told me he wanted to be with me I was always questioning why. I was happy when I was with them, but the whole relationship thing stressed me out as I didn't want to commit to one person. With friends (and therefore especially females) I would never have that fear as it was always quite clear this is a friendship and cannot be more. I have a lot of anxiety and jealousy around my friends, I like to keep friendship groups separated as I feel like they know me in different environments/therefore different versions of myself and I get jealous when two of my friends get along really well. Or if they have another bestie. Especially male friends I want to keep to myself. I was never jealous of a boyfriend of a female friend."
"Please help, my days are ruined There have been times in my life when I have questioned my own sexuality. It can come and go. I would not obsess on it and especially I would not let it upset you. It seemed to happen to me when I was at a party or gathering. There was some nostalgia and the mood was very social. It was energizing and at the same time, slightly disturbing as I am not usually prone to these kinds of thoughts. This turmoil will pass. You will eventually sort out your feelings.

"Please help, my days are ruined Let's first agree that men and women are both visually appealing. Women, weather straight or gay, will always look at other womens features. We admire things about their bodies that differ from ours. For me I always noticed girls with flat stomachs and thought that was sexy because I have a flabby one. I've been sexual with guys and girls when I was that age but later knew that I liked men because they can do everything a woman can and then lay me out with the only thing they have better than a woman, a penis. I think you're at a point in your life where you're ready to experience sex and woman give you the false idea that it's not sex, it's foreplay with them. Look at why you don't lay down with a man? Would you feel guilty because of penetration? Do you feel like virginity is meant for your soulmate or spouse? Don't rush with anyone but if it feels right, go for it. Man, woman, doesn't matter, your heart will lead you. Thank you for reading a part of the journey through my bipolar mind."
"Please help, my days are ruined Hey and thank you for your replies! The last days I tried just not to think to much about it and it worked at times and then didn't again. I know that there is nothing bad about having feelings for either gender, but when I listen to myself I feel quite sure that I just want friendship from a woman. I feel more confident around them, especially when I admire their outgoing personality myself and then feel like it's kind of rubbing off on me when I am with them. That's it. When I am with men the reason for not having sex is variable...I would not do a one night stand as I 'give away' my virginity for 'too little'. Then I am not using contraception (except from condoms) and panic a lot at the thought of pregnancy. And lat but not least it is fear of the unknown and the expectations that people have of a 24 year old that should've had sex by now. My body confidence is not at it's best as well..."

Don't give it up for nothing, make sure you feel something. If you're concerned about contraception you can start the pill to ""regulate your period"". Dont worry about others expectations. Its not a circus out there hunny, they dont all want kinky crazy sex. The right type of guy will take it easy with you. Make sure they know you're a virgin ONLY WHEN YOU'RE READY FOR SEX! Don't tell them right away because they'll see it as a conquest. Lastly, your body is attractive and sexy to the man loving it. Dont worry about your body, instead enjoy what you're physically feeling. There are men attracted to all types of women, love yourself with the body you're in and a guy with your taste will come along. Confidence is sexy! Thank you for reading a part of the journey through my bipolar mind."
"Please help, my days are ruined Thank you BrelaxedHunny, I know I shouldn't get all worked up about it, but it is a bit too late for that now. One of the main things is that I have told lies about not being a virgin before, which made it worse. I am trying to become more confident and I sometimes succeed in suggesting it and men are always surprised if I am not that confident underneath the surface. Also I often question what does love feel like? Am I in love, do I have to be in love in order to have sex? I have been very protected by friends and family while growing up, they always told me that I was precious and should not easily give myself away to someone (not in a religious way) I feel pressured by society to have a perfect relationship and sex for me is one of the steps towards a relationship. I am never sure if he is the one and panic about having to introduce him to my family and friends as I feel like they all have their own expectations of who they'd see me with. I know I shouldn't care and if I love someone they will love him too in the end, I guess I have not found the strength to stand up for my feelings."
"Please help, my days are ruined You don't have to lie about it, just withhold it for a while, see if he's into your personality. Confidence is built. I know it's an odd thing to do but look at yourself in the mirror everyday and verbally say ""I'm beautiful, I'm valuable, I'm worthy of confidence"" or something like that. A daily mantra to build yourself and help you see your beauty and power. Love feels like you can't ever stop thinking about them, you feel safe and warm in their arms, you miss them when they're away, you hurt when they hurt, you just feel it. You'll naturally leave the family opinions and care about his. Nope, don't have to be in love to have sex but sometimes sex can make you think you're in love. Also, youre an individual, you dont have to care what your family or anyone elae thinks of your man. Ask yourself what you want in a man, forget the families ideas. Thank you for reading a part of the journey through my bipolar mind."
"Cure anxiety Picture of my situation with parents, and then solution, I am very curious if anyone tried and whether it helped them. My father is mentally ill, abused me until I left when I was 18, physically and mentally. He has himself mental issues but was trying to persuade me it is me who need help. During 28 years of marriage, he had a part time job for 4 years, living from the social support and my mother´s money. My mother was neglecting me, later she told me it was because of my father´s breakdown and the fact that my brother was born ill (he is OK now). My brother is 5 years younger, 4 years after school living at my parent´s house, earns 250 dollars per month that he spends on expensive clothing and mobile phones. So all 3 of them are living mostly from my mother´s money. I do not live at home for 10 years now. I used to go home once in 6 weeks for a weekend, my mother pays for the ticket - like 50 dollars or so. They never forget to mention how much money it is and how much money do they have to spend on me during those 2 days at home. I feel my parents do not take me as their chid. Everytime I have a little argue with a family member (casual, nothing extreme), my father run towards me, calling me names, kicking me out of the house - without knowing what we are arguing about (like I needed computer for 30 minutes to write an e-mail but my brother wanted to watch a movie on it despite the fact he has a TV and another computer in his room...). My father calls me a bitch, @@@@@@@, frigid slut - that only declares that he very easily loses his nerves. After that incident, I decided to leave right away and do not contact them. My father told my mother not to talk to me, so it was my birthday and she only sended me a message on the phone. When I asked her why she did not respond, she replied she had healthy issues. I have finished one university and now I am attending another, thanks to my husband who is very supportive. I have traveled a lot, without help of my parents, without their money (no regular money from them since I was 19). But they still prefere my brother who was for 4 years lying in the bed in our parent´s house. They treat him like a god, giving him money and me like a stupid naive girl, like I am not able to take care of myself. I have anxiety because of that because I believe I am a stupid cow, I do not believe myself, I am trembling everytime I have a task in the school even I am doing very well and was never kicked out of any exam. I always expect failure in my life. No matter how many times I have won. I love my parents so much, I love them with all my heart and I am desperate I have no contact with them. I need their support so much but they are just not willing/capable to give it to me.... Maybe it will be better not to contact them for a period of time, not to be treated like a dumb person, make me feel guilty they do not have money because of me despite the fact I am not living with them for 10 years.... This is pushing me down, because I believe them, I believe every word they say about how incompetent I am. Is it OK to cut them off for some period of time? I am trying and feel HORRIBLE about it like I cannot stand this situation. Is there anyone else who tried to cope with it the same way? I am asking because I do not want to cause myself depression or worsen my anxiety."
"Cure anxiety Choosing no contact with family isn't as simple as it sounds. Ultimately, if your parents have the ability to make you feel incompetent or guilty or stupid, they can do this partly because you believe them. If you cut them out of your life, that might make it so that you don't have them saying those things to you all the time, but if you believe those things in the first place, not having them there to tell you those things won't take away your belief in what they said about you. You would still have the problems with feeling those things while you have cut them off but you will also likely feel guilty for cutting them off and alone from them, like you have lost the potential to ever have a truly loving and supportive relationship with your family because you are not in contact with them. Perhaps their behaviour indicates that you will never have a truly loving and supportive relationship with them but you don't sound convinced of this because you do say you love your parents so much. But this love might also be because their treatment of you is what you are used to and we tend to cling to what is familiar because we needed them when we were growing up (for food and shelter and stuff), even if they were abusive. An alternative to going no contact all together is to have a trial period of no contact. Pick a time frame during which you would normally see them and tell them in advance that you don't plan on seeing them during that time. See how it goes, see how it feels to you. Try to think through how you will feel in the distant future, whether you will be more or less happy with the results of cutting off contact (say for example if one day you were to have found out they were really sick or had died, are you happy or unhappy with the decision you made and why). Getting a professional to help you work through the impact of the abuse you experienced can also be helpful to you and make it easier to decide what to do. Ultimately you should do whatever it is that you think is right for you. Remaining in contact or cutting contact are both extremely hard decisions. I hope you can work out what will be right for you. Try not to think of cutting off contact with them as a magic cure for your anxieties about your abilities, those anxieties will still be there. Cutting off contact would, however, lessen the amount of emotional abuse you are experiencing (except unless they start trying to harass you to get in contact with them).

"Cure anxiety I went no contact with my family a while ago. At first, it didn't help, because I kept running in the same type of persons as the ones who raised me. But then I started very slowly rebuilding myself outside of their sphere of influence. At the time I lived around them, they were all I knew. But since then I've built deeper relationships with people in general and one person in particular. Now that I experienced feelings of closeness, I have something to compare my relationship with them against. We feel at our happiest when we are able to express the full range of our self, I feel at my happiest when I am loved by people able to take in the full range of my personality and I theirs. It's not something that my family was able to provide. I will meet with some of them occasionally, the ones that aren't too hardcore. It doesn't make me feel exactly miserable, but we're not close. I've been struggling to take this realization in since it inspired me tremendous guilt: I am not at fault, there is nothing I could have done to make things different (except kept lying to myself which only would have made it appear otherwise...)"
"Successful resolution of anxiety induced delusions for years my wife have been diagnosed with depression, bipolar 2 and anxiety. In the last few years she had also developed mild alcohol use disorder, which of course made things worse. after shequit drinking in January, she started experiencing a number of paranoid delusions, including a pedophile ring closing in on our kids, the community hacking her account to paint her as a racist and run her out of town, and me taking our kids and flying away. there were no hallucinations or bizarre delusions, just believing a bunch of things that there was no factual basis of. Initially the doctor put her on lithium, which did no good. Further discussions with the therapist resulted in treating her illness as primarily anxiety-driven with obsessive traits. I had no idea that delusions could be anxiety driven, but they can be. They switched her to a low dose of olanzapine and Prozac. She's 45 and perimenopausal, so she needed also a supplement of progesterone. She also takes Xanax as needed during the day, which is usually a couple of times. I don't think we're done fine-tuning the medication, but it is made an unbelievable difference in our lives. She has also done an amazing job with her therapy and dealing with Her childhood emotional issues that have been unresolved for so long. She still has work to do on that, but is making great progress. I just wanted to pass along this success story in hopes that it might help someone else"
"Ptsd..housing issues I have PTSD and have lived in my current apartment complex for 2 1/2 years, but conditions here have deteriorated greatly within the last several months due to a drug dealer being moved in 2 apartments down from me and a family of children reaking havoc throughout the apartment complex. The property manager has full knowledge of all of this. I have spoken to her on more than one occasion about all of this. When I told her I have PTSD she basically blew it off and said PTSD is really common. My last interaction with the property manager she basically said she couldn't babysit the tenants and she tried to say i was the only one who has been complaining about those specific children .I spoke with a neighbor and he said there have been numerous other tenants complaining about those specific children. So she flat out LIED. Some of the incidences specific to my family are one time a little girl from this family bullied my son and a boy from the same family repeatedly tried to straight up walk into my apartment without knocking, then would knock and this went on for a couple of months almost daily. I am under constant stress and anxiety. So basically my question considering my PTSD diagnosis and feeling unsafe can i break my lease ??? Thanks in advance"
"Ptsd..housing issues Hello and welcome to PF... That's something that's best discussed with an attorney. If someone has been thru something similar they might be able to share the outcome of their experience, but as we're a peer support website, no one here would be able to definitively say on something legal like that. And as laws probably vary on that from location to location, the absolute best thing would be to consult an attorney. I've been fortunate to contact attorneys over the phone with a basic question, that they're willing to answer gratis . It's been my experience with attorneys that unless they're filing paperwork or actively representing you as a client, they seem to be generally willing to give you advice without charge. That's my experience, however. YMMV. I would imagine the best thing would be to provide an attorney with proof of your PTSD Dx, and let them contact the landlord to negotiate change in the conditions, or a release from the rental agreement. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Anxiety attacks getting worse? Hey forum - long time, no see (again)! Long story short: I've had quite a few anxiety-attacks in the past few years. Attacks I would call fairly ""normal"": around 10-15 minutes, hyperventilating, crying, but I'm able to calm myself down fairly quickly using grounding techniques. However... I had a really scary anxiety attack a couple of weeks ago, and it scared the heebie-jeebies out of me! I put myself in a situation I kinda knew I couldn't handle (theater warm-up) - but I wanted to try - and surprisingly I couldn't do it. The thing that followed then was just something I hadn't experienced before. I managed to lock myself in a bathroom and totally broke down; sobbing, screaming, flailing everything, smashing my head and fists against the walls - I couldn't control my body at all. It lasted for a good 45 minutes or something like that (didn't really have any sense of time), and it only stopped because I became too exhausted. It was a really scary and uncomfortable experience, and I really don't want it to happen again. My problem is now that my anxiety ABOUT getting anxiety attacks has risen a whole lot, and I had to stop going to performance-class and I keep to myself a lot more, which is making me more anxious and sad - and I know this kind of behavior was what led to my depression, and I just really don't want to end up there again. Do any of you lovely people have any tips as to how to handle this? I'm not able to see a psychologist on a regular basis and I live at a boarding school: being around a 100 people all the time is pretty much unavoidable.

"Anxiety attacks getting worse? That doesnt sound great! However, i dont think its a huge thing to worry about! I'm not fantastic at advice, but it seems to me that if you had a huge anxiety attack again, it would be because youre anxious about it! So if you just keep in mind that the only reason youd have a bad anxiety attack, is because you were anxious about it, then i would say just try to forget about it, and if the tought happens to pop on your head, just dismiss it, because theres actually nothing to worry about! Just my 2 cents anyway, hope it helps ahahah"
"Anxiety attacks getting worse? Hi there, people of the dark web It nice to know that I have people looking out for me, so thanks a lot for sharing my info! I hope you have a hearty laugh, and then go outside and not share random people's info, because that's a really neat thing to do. CPTSD - AvPD - Social/General Anxiety - Chronic Depression"
"Unable to speak? Hello, apologies if this isn't the right forum but I googled quite a bit and couldn't find an exact relation or anything of the likes, however something did point to anxiety, I don't really know if it fits or not. Basically sometimes in high stress situations I am unable to talk. I don't know what to say, somehow feel as if I don't WANT to say anything and at the same time not being able to. I try to find the right words and/or thoughts to speak but I can't and I'm trying to understand why. Is this some sort of anxiety at all? It happened again just now because I had an appointment scheduled at a mental health clinic and my caretaker would take me to it. For clarification, since I'm not a native english speaker so maybe my choice of words may be wrong, I am not physically disabled, I live in an assisted living community (I hope this is the right term for it). I remember it happening in my childhood quite a bit when my father would yell at me and I would just sit there and not say anything, maybe to defy him in a way, I am not quite sure. Anyways, I am not sure where to put this... behaviour(?) of mine and I have quite a bit of trouble speaking my thoughts, writing them down seems so much easier. Thanks in advance."
"Anxiety is getting rough Hello all, I wanted to seek some helpful and hopefully somewhat expert advice. I’m in my late twenties, been thru a few rough divorces and learned a lot about myself. I’ve been in therapy for the past few years and have C-PTSD, codependency, and some pretty decent anxiety. Most of this was related to a very rough childhood with a mom having schizophrenia and another disorder. Recently, I’ve been dating a gal for the past 6 months that has been great. She has her own set of issues and the initial onset of the relationship was a bit guarded on her end (which isn’t bad). We grew close and actually chose to move in together. Recently, I have noticed that I have several anxiety related thoughts and feelings and am unsure on what it is tied too. She’s very attractive and has male friends (I’m sure men know why that brings anxiety) but she has boundaries with them and doesn’t do anything to make me think anything is going on and wants me to hang out with her coworkers or friends. Also, I seem to be having a difficult time being confident with other men checking her out. With it being summer time, shorts and a tank top can often be very appealing for other men to look at and even make attempts to hit on her. I know this is natural and I should (do) trust her to turn them down and move on, but it seems to be killing my anxiety and deep fear of losing her to another man. I hate the thought of another man possibly walking away feeling like he is superior and got the attention of her behind my back or that she wants him. I realize a lot of this is tied to my insecurities, fears, etc. but wanting to know how I can become more confident or calmed with this?"
"Anxiety is getting rough Thats a difficult situation to be in, and I can see how you are struggling to cope with you feelings of anxiety. I've similar feelings at times when in a relationship, and i think it can help to talk to your girlfriend about how you feel if you can. As this might help you get a bit closer and build trust. It sounds that her wanting for you socialize with her is a very good thing as, she's being open and honest with you and including you more in her life, perhaps she also sees you as a good catch and wants to show you off as her boyfriend, just something to think about. Another thing to think about might be that she could also suffer her own insecurities and fears so its worth taking that in mind. Perhaps trying to find ways to boost your confidence could also help you, i.e. going to the gym, finding things to do which you like doing. It sounds like if you are able to deal with your anxiety and get it under control, that you can have a really great relationship with her. Good luck"
"Anxiety is getting rough Thanks for the reply. I have talked to her before and got some reassurances, sometimes only a simply response and others where she states she never wants to lose me or be in a situation where it could happen. It’s almost like my anxiety is bad enough that I even dislike knowing she’s going to be around friends and be in a bikini. The thought of other men seeing her close to naked really sucks and I KNOW that being in one is normal in life. I feel like my overthinking and anxiety have caused me to become quickly frustrated and/or want to shut down and end up feeling irritated for a little while. I don’t want to keep talking to her about things because I feel like it’s going to push her away, and potentially into another mans arms. I’ve been able to still bring up things that have happened or been said and explain why they bother me, etc though."
"Anxiety and Acid Reflux So I’ve had anxiety for a few years now and it’s been taking a physical toll on my health. Recently, I’ve been getting some bad acid reflux and heartburn. This has been especially difficult for me considering my anxiety centers around a phobia of vomiting. I usually can’t leave the house without antacids, and my doctor just prescribed me to Prevacid. I’m really nervous to start taking it because I know it’s stronger than my normal OTC Zantac and I’m debating taking it out of fear of making me nauseous. Has anyone else been through this or knows the side effects? Anything helps."
"Anxiety and Acid Reflux Puzzled323 wrote: I’m debating taking it out of fear of making me nauseous If it makes you nauseous, did you talk to your doctor about what to do? I always find it helps my anxiety about medications if I have a plan to get off of new medications before I start taking them. That way, if the new medication gives side effects that I don't want, I'm confident with how to safely stop taking it and that in turn makes me feel more confident to try the new medication. Would an approach like that possibly help you? It's not good you are having these problems. Hopefully the Prevacid or something else will help you. In a way, I am not defined by my dissociation.

"Anxiety and Acid Reflux Hey there, To be frank, I can't really provide you with any real suggestions--but know that you're not alone. I've had anxiety for years now, and - concurrently - massive stomach/gastrointestinal and digestive issues. Sometimes I get so bloated that I could pass as ~4 months pregnant--it's SO painful and makes me very agitated and self-conscious (particularly seeing as how I still have lingering body image issues). Lately, I've noticed that acid will occasionally come up into my throat (sometimes with small particles of food). I hate all of it. It's uncomfortable--and embarrassing when in public. If you find a solution or some sort of palliative measure, please let me know. Best of luck to you--and I'm sorry that I couldn't be of more help :/ ~aquamarine"
"Anxiety and Acid Reflux Count me in as having loads of reflux problems because of anxiety. I shudder to think what a doctor would find if he looks down there- years now of heartburn, reflux, etc., sometime choking on the stuff when it comes up. It's rough. Sometimes I'll take OTC prilosec, when it's extra bad. I'm trying to cut back a little on how much I eat (I could lose some pounds anyway). Sometimes when my anxiety's really bad, I just keep a bottle of antacid handy and sip on it all day. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Anxiety and Acid Reflux Acid reflux, IBS, etc. A lot of anxiety can be expressed through the gut. I treat the reflux symptomatically since I don't have it that often, but I need to be careful with what I eat, because that + stress can cause a lot of trouble with...the toilet. Overcome with despair and hopelessness... Cineri gloria sera est"
"Feeling paranoid and anxious after engaging in BDSM Hi so I have been feeling very guilty since I have tried BDSM a few months ago. Although I enjoy the session, I started to fear that my friends and family will find out. I started to think that maybe some of the pictures will be leaked and I am so scared about it. It had become so serious that whenever my friends or strangers give me a glance or stare at me for a while I feel extremely uncomfortable and thought it was because that they saw my pictures online and knew about it. I started to think people were talking behind my back too. I know that was probably paranoia but the fear is so intense that I sometimes cannot concentrate. Please help and give me some advice! Thanks!"
"Feeling paranoid and anxious after engaging in BDSM Can you talk to your BDSM partner about this? Or are you in an exclusive relationship? Do you have mutual trust? It sounds like your partner is in control of the pictures? Unless they’re on social media, I think it’s unlikely your family is hanging out on fetlife or someplace similar? I do not think anything is “wrong” about the BDSM lifestyle as long as there is a lot of trust, communication and safety...including a discussion ahead of time, if that makes sense."
"Feeling paranoid and anxious after engaging in BDSM the fear is genuine. leaking of the pics can be embarrassing. some nasty friend can get hold of the pics for fun. once the porn in my mobile was about to be seen by a colleague. i snatched the mobile at last moment n deleted all porn. there's more to life than sex. there's more what couples do than sex. if you're not ok with it, there are other ways you guys have have sex. one way that's comfortable to both of you. exhausted"
"I Need Help - My Heart is Always Racing Hi guys, I am new here, and I hope I can connect with some of you who can maybe relate to my symptoms. Let's call me Aspen. I am a 27 year-old female. I live with my fiancé, and I should be happy (and sometimes I am), but I'm really not. My heart is always racing. I've noticed this more and more since I've moved in with my fiancé. I believe I made a mistake saying yes to marrying him and getting this far into the relationship. I've always had anxiety, but being with him has made it worse. I need out, but I'm scared. My heart is always racing, frightened of the future of being alone. I am not a strong woman. At all. I play one at work, but deep inside, I am scared all. The. Time. Every. Day. Like I said, my heart is always racing. I am always on edge, even when I'm supposedly happy. All I am looking for right now is some comforting words. As I type this, my fiancé sits in the living room, playing his video games. He's been doing that the last 14 hours. I confronted him on it, and he barked at me, so here I am. Unhappy. I want out."
"I Need Help - My Heart is Always Racing Hey there, just wanted to say you're not alone. I'm also 27 year old female and have really bad anxiety because of potential of a relationship. He said he wanted marriage and children too and i chickened out. But now im scared of loneliness. So i kind of understand, i think. Right now, i think you're having an anxiety attack. It's going to pass eventually , so just try to breathe. My therapist adviced me to write down what i'm feeling on a piece of paper too and it kind of worked. Or you can keep up posting here too."

"Nauseous when I think about crush, don't know where else for Note, I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons So about 6 months ago, I hit it off with a girl in my grade (I'm a teenager). We both had a lot in common, and we genuinely liked each other. Over a break in December, I went on a trip to a city (not disclosing for privacy reasons), and when I came back home and went to school, I had terrible nausea, and I felt like I was going to throw up all the way through a class, which I have w/ her. Tried to go to school the next day, and threw up early in the morning while thinking of her. Tried to go again the next day, again, threw up in the morning. At that point, I ended up staying home that whole week, expecting it to just be a stomach bug or something and that it would go away in the weekend. Nope. Tried to go in on Monday of that week, I instantly had nausea when I was putting my shoes on. I just couldn't go to school. Over the course of the next few months, I was on homeschooling and homebound instruction for school, because I was too sick to eat. During all that time, I went through countless doctor appointments, each one finding nothing. About 3 weeks ago, the doctors finally seemed to find out what was wrong (again, not saying for privacy reasons, but it's a fairly common disease). They put me on a different diet plan, but that hasn't helped. I'm definitely not convinced the disease they diagnosed me with is causing this. I'm convinced I have some kind of anxiety because of the girl. Just tonight, I was trying to play an online game with her. About 10 minutes in, I had a terrible feeling of nausea, and I went to the bathroom where I ended up throwing up. I'm convinced this was because of her (technically me). All I want more than anything is to learn what I can do for this nausea feeling to go away, so I can actually ask this girl out and not be scared of throwing up. I would be forever in your debt if someone gave me tips that could help"
"Nauseous when I think about crush, don't know where else for if you ask me, this is nothing more than an irrational association. you seem to have hypnotised yourself into believing there's a connection between this girl and your nausea, when in fact you knew this girl and liked her before the nausea set in, which was after a trip somewhere. and you're even dismissive of any other cause for the nausea. if i were you, i'd accept that the two aren't connected and hope that's enough to stop your mind playing this trick on you. something knocked me out' the trees now i'm on my knees ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey there is one thing you must be sure of i can't take any more ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey don't like it but i guess i'm learning ... shock the monkey to life"
"Nauseous when I think about crush, don't know where else for My partner has had nausea with some vomiting if we have a verbal argument....we don’t fight that much and we don’t go about it in a toxic manner...but that has happened. Migraines, also. I have also had gastrointestinal distress during these times, but I have IBS, which is exacerbated by stress. So, I think it could be related or perhaps a coincidence, in your situation. It sounds like a manifestation of anxiety regarding your crush, IMO. In that case, I’d think it would sort out in due time. But perhaps see your doctor if it continues. Just in case it’s a virus or other condition."
"is this a symptom of anxiety? for the past few weeks, i have been constantly needing to urinate and no matter what it feels as if i cannot get everytbing out. it is also painful once it comes out. i have been tested about 3 times now for any infections/bacteria and i have none in my kidneys or bladder. i’m wondering if this is a symptom of anxiety because i have had nonstop anxiety for about a month now."
"is this a symptom of anxiety? If the urologist is at a loss to explain the frequency and retention, it may very well be anxiety. I have also cut way back on coffee and orange juice in the AM. I used to drink from the water fountains frequently whenever I walked past one, even if I wasn't thirsty. I have cut down my salt intake, particularly nitride and nitrate-containing foods and drinks. Soda is among the worst offenders. Sitting a lot can increase urge frequency. I am fine on weekends at home, but when I am under pressure and very active at work is when I can have issues. I used to be on medications and diuretics that gave me dry-mouth and I was always drinking water. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"So incredibly sad... I just started reading the book You're Not Crazy, It's Your Mother and I am so incredibly sad. I'm 51 and have been in therapy off and on almost my whole life. My daughter is also in therapy, for different reasons I hope, and it was her therapist that recommended this book to me. I only figured out LAST WEEK that my mom is a narcissist! This book is making so much sense to me that it's scary. Now I deal with the fact that my mom is 81 and not in the best of health and I don't think I have the strength to confront and/or discontinue contact with her. Hopefully this book and the others I've seen can just help me to deal with it better and stop taking responsibility for her actions. Thanks for listening. I could talk about this subject FOREVER!"
"I had an argument with a friend a week ago and still hurting About a week or so ago, when it was my brother's birthday, I had decided to confide in my friend about my problems. Our friendship is weird, he lives in New Zealand and I live in the U.S. and our connection only formed when we had came across eachother on a site. We've known eachother for three years now, and I would be lying if I said there wasn't turmoil here and there. Our arguments, if we had one, would result in an absence of talking for a while, maybe one to two weeks at the most? Well, it's the second week since we've stopped talking and I can't help but feel this stabbing pain in my stomach every time I decide to think about the situation. The thoughts range from what I could have done differently to utter resentment for him and eventually it wanes to me feeling sad that I couldn't have tried harder to maintain my composure during our dispute. For a few days I thought I was able to at least not acknowledge it, but as I was talking to another friend we both know, I had the compulsion to ask questions regarding if they still talked and let me tell you, I regretted that immediately after. Of course they still talk! They chat a couple of times a day and here I am having to endure this silent treatment for my gross handling of my emotions and frustrations. Having talked to most of my friends they all tell me that time will the wounds but right now it's not about the end of the journey but more along the lines of me needing to withstand the anxiety and jealous that runs rampant every time I decide to think about him while we are not talking. Paranoia runs through my mind regarding the situation and I just wish I could move on with my life without having to sulk over this. Even now I'm having to endure the stabbing pains of anxiety and it makes me want to curl up and sob my eyes out until I'm exhausted. The rational part of me wants to move on and wait until he's ready to talk again but the anxiety and emotional side of me is compelled to think over this until I can no longer stand it, like part of me is demanding a form of retaliation just for being ignored but I know that would make things worse. Long story short, I'm miserable. My sleep schedule is ruined over this and any time I wake up I get the sharp pangs of dread that are ready to remind me that I am still having to endure this situation. If anyone has experienced the silent treatement and tips on how to cope with it, I would love to hear any suggestion because right now I'm at my wits end trying to deal with the anxiety."
"Is it panic attacks or am I sick? Hi, my name is JF and this is my first post on here, i've been suffering from what I think and doctors think are panic attacks, i've been having them for the last 4 years and they still wreak havoc throught my life everyday, I would say I'm someone who love's life, my passion is music and on hard days it even takes that away from me. Okay here's the deal lately I've been experiencing intense panic attacks at work, i've recently moved to a bigger city so I know it could be stress related but I just want answers, I'm a cook and today I had an attack where, I nearly puked, felt like I was going to pass out, had very sharp pain in my liver area anyhow I almost had to leave work, I don't consider my job stressful, I've been a cook for years...I've also been waking up exhausted and covered in sweat for the past month, I'm incredibly exhausted from the daily pain and lack of sleep, I'm currently on Zoloft 100mg and honestly I've never had more panic attacks. The truth is I also have a hard time believing the whole Generalized Anxiety thing, I'm incredibly depressed as life is just pain at this point, every day is groundhog day, wake up exhausted, force myself to eat and take meds, then the panic attack start sometimes they are bearable, I can brush them off other times I survive them and pass out for the rest of the day, I'm also very paranoid in everyday events, going out with friends has been very difficult in these last years and I used to be a social butterfly, I encouter lots of confidence issues concerning that and I have a hard time making new friends and dealing with daily tasks, like cleaning up, doing laundry, going to get my paycheck, everything requires an insane amount of energy for me, I've avoided so many situations because of this and I've also forced myself in situations that I want to do, play live shows, going to concerts, taking walks, photography, writting, etc... I often wonder if I'll ever be able to just have fun again like without having to force myself throught a panic attacks or high anxiety just for the sake of not letting this disease get the best of me. I appreciate anyone who reads or answers me, thank you... Kinda looking to see if anyone lives a similiar thing than me and please share any advise I'll be glad to read them, cheers -JF"
"Is it panic attacks or am I sick? I was treated for anxiety and depression. The same medication treated the symptoms of both. The anxiety could advance into panic. My first clue was a change in breathing. Learn to recognize your body changes when an oncoming panic attack is imminent and try to defuse it. Tell your doctor that the Zoloft doesn't help and in fact may be exacerbating the situation. Zoloft doesn't work for everyone and the only way for the doctor to know this is if you tell them. Exercise and distraction is good. I do my hobbies and ride a bike to relax. My dad gave me a box of the families old cameras going back 100 years. Some still have unexposed film in them. I've gone back to film photography. Avoid alcohol, nicotine, sugar and caffeine. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"My wife was just diagnosed with GAD with delusional symptoms We've been to the psychiatrist twice and are still trying to get the medication right, and she has days when she accepts that her greatest fears are only delusions. Today, however, is not one of those days. She's very angry and wants to liquidate her IRA and get a divorce immediately. She's had some similar episodes, but I'm still looking for advice to ride it out until it passes. We have two children, 12 and 8, but I have to consider. Most of her anxiety is in the cause of their safety and well-being, although quite a bit of it is because of her insecurities and fear of relationships (ie, she does not feel worthy of love and affection) Any advice is appreciated. The current medication is an anti-psychotic (olanzapine) and Xanax, but the therapist is recommending that the psychiatrist treat it strictly as GAD, so maybe the medication will change when we see him on Wednesday. Historically Her diagnosis's have been depression, anxiety and bipolar, so she's very skeptical that the diagnosis has changed to GAD, even though the therapist told her that mental illness can evolve in different ways."
"Extreme suspiciousness, anxiety and fear Hi fellas and congratulations on the forum. This is my first post here. I will try to keep it short. The last 2-3 months I've been extremely suspicious everyday on the road. I believe that people will attack me or rob me. When i see big crowds downtown i'm afraid that riots will begin (i live in Greece, so riots are quite common). Today, i saw two guys with their faces painted white and i thought they were about to rob me (inside the subway). Another day, a beggar threatened to beat me up because i told him to leave and let me do my job(i was delivering flyers outside the subway) and my heart went to 200 BPM. I must mention that i've been under extreme pressure and stress everyday because of the college and work. Too much work to do, in too little time with deadlines approaching. Besides general anxiety, i suffer from approach anxiety with the opposite sex. (i'm male 30 y.o). Many times i believe that if i approach i girl i like she will offend me badly. I know its all in my head but there is no way i can calm down and live a normal life. I'm tired of being afraid to go out. Question #1) Regarding ALL things i mentioned before , do you believe it is anxiety or psychotic symptoms? Question #2) I have a few Stelazine pills, 15mg controlled release. Do you think they will help me calm down? I have read that Stelazine causes many extra-pyramidal symptoms and i dont have Akineton to neutralize these symptoms. P.S, If there is anyone here with any experience regarding Stelazine, i would greatly appreciate any information or advice. Thanks in advance"

"Second hand Stress and Anxiety I believe that my anxiety level is moderate and I can manage. But this becomes high due to my surroundings (my parents, hubby and my brother). My dad is constantly stress, cannot relax and in situation where he is not familiar, he become panicky. He is always rushing after time as if there is an emergency. His whole body gesture, his tone of voice etc ... just make one more stressed out. He is a friendly guy. When he needs me to do things for him, he would just pester me, pressurized me ... until I do things the way he wants. Otherwise, he is ok. My mum is a narcissistic and she knows how to pull my emotionally cord. She needs me to fulfilled her needs and if I don't, I feel kind of guilty. I now avoid spending too much time with her or else I feel drained out. My husband just scared the hell out of me when I tell him things like I nearly twisted my ankle on a trail. He would dramatized, make a fuss about it even over small things Sometimes he makes me so scrared that I cannot think by myself, all my common sense disappeared. All I can think of is ""Do as he said"" even if I don't want to. Hidding things from him makes me more peaceful. I met him when I was 13 years and I am now 49. It is like he has brainwashed me. When I see my parents no. on the phone, I become stressed ! There are times when I don't answer because either it is to hear my mum on going lamentation or I need to do things for them. My brother does not work, lives on dad's money and spend his time travelling. He is so lazy and does not want to take care of anything. My parents keep asking me to ""compensate"" for his shortcomimgs as I am a very capable person when he isn't. My brother is 47 years old. I am a highly intuitive sensitive person, an empath, kind, considerate, enjoy the simple things of life. II have also OCD and may be a little border line personality. I usually take good care of my parents. But this year, I become fed with people in general as I find they are too complicated, everyone just thinking about their own ""convenience"". I started to change, not giving a damn about anyone. But this is creating havoc because I don't do as my parents said. I listened to my hubby recently as he made me scared and as result I was the only one paying for the consequences. Where I am, I just want to be on my OWN."
"Do you fear getting your hand on things you love? I have terrible anxiety issues, and I feel that no matter what I try to do, it'll always fail. When I was applying for the baking job at work, I was afraid to, because I felt like I would fail. I really wanted to learn how to make doughnuts and muffins and brownies and cakes (I don't make the cakes), and I started, and at first, I failed, and I failed miserably, but I kept to it.

"Intense anxiety in school, fear of fainting/collapsing there I know that the anxiety comes on in school because I hate school and feel very uncomfortable there, but I've got to find some ways to cope with it. Even on a good day I will still feel some anxiety. I have this fear of fainting/collapsing in school even though I've never fainted before and I know that I probably never will even during my worst panic attacks. Once I start to get nervous, I begin feeling lightheaded and then I just worry and panic that I might pass out. This is much scarier if I've had coffee (obviously), but I refuse to give up coffee.I have given up coffee for weeks at a time when it's gotten really bad, but the anxiety is still there and I always go back to coffee. How do I just convince myself that nothing is going to happen and avoid the panic/anxiety attacks in school?"
"Intense anxiety in school, fear of fainting/collapsing there Other than tell yourself you're not going to faint, I don't know. I've been there. In fact, thought that I might feel faint a few times today, probably just tiredness, but I could tell it was close to turning into a panicky situation, and I just had to put it out of my mind and tell myself I was just tired, and anxious, and nothing horrible was going to happen to me. And it didn't. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"Intense anxiety in school, fear of fainting/collapsing there My change in breathing is my first clue of impending panic.

"Issue regarding my attempts with desensitizing So, when I was at therapy a few months ago (we haven't touched upon it since, since we're working on other things) my therapist mentioned desensitization... Specifically with fire, since I've been working on other issues (like my fear of crowds) without therapy's help. She mentioned how it usually is done with just photos and the like. IDK why but my mind usually rationalizes things until it's physically near me. I think it has to do with how a lot of things died around me when I was 3 years old in fire. But... Being 21 now, it's really frustrating it still affects me. I was panicking at the grill w/ my boyfriend. And photos don't bother me, but if I'm so much as 3-4 feet near a fire - even a camp fire, my mind goes into panic mode. I feel really dumb. ><"
"Issue regarding my attempts with desensitizing It might feel silly, but it sounds as if you had a traumatic experience involving fire? One person's silly, is another's terror. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"Issue regarding my attempts with desensitizing Yeah, but I really wanna get over it. My dad always insists ""oh you never had a traumatic experience!!!"" but he's also threatened to kill my mom before so I sorta... don't... think he's the best person to have opinions on that subject. Like I'd rather get rid of these fears so I can focus on more important things and not freak out over things that most people don't freak out over. >< I already have a lot of issues so I just wish I could stop panicking so easily..."
"I'm New ... Hi everyone. I'm New to psychforum I'm in the UK and I'm studying a master's degree at university. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder in 2010, and will the lots of intervention I did manage to get a lot better, despite it being very severe for me. In 2013, I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder instead ; I still had issues when it came to socialising, but they were less severe than they'd been, but I now had problems day to day, more generally. I struggled through my undergraduate degree, and I got great grades but at times I was just not leaving the house at all for weeks, I had no friends whatsoever and I was having frequent panic attacks. After graduating, I became a bit better, managed to work in a shop, though I was using some serious coping mechanisms for this and it was a very unique setup in that I only worked with 2 other people, who I knew from primary school. I applied for a master's degree, because I thought that I was making so much progress, it was a good time to do so, but unfortunately my health has taken a huge dip. I began to get symptoms I'd not experienced before; flashbacks of abuse from my father during childhood, long dissociative periods where I couldn't remember doing important things like paying bills or walking half a mile to the shops. In 2016 I was diagnosed with complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (c-PTSD), and I am now under a community mental health team (CMHT), taking Sertraline 100mg/D and propranolol, in a new City (I relocated for my Master's), and I am again just about managing to do the bare minimum in terms of my course. Getting great grades but doing all of it from home due to being so anxious and panicky that I will have a flashback or dissociative period when I am at uni. I also suffer from systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) which, for me, causes fatigue, rashes (incl a 'butterfly' rash across my face), joint inflammation and pain. It also causes me to have attacks of scintillating scomata, which essentially means that I randomly lose my vision without warning sometimes, and this can last anywhere between 15 minutes to 3 hours. I am currently really super depressed because in the past, I have had to deal with one of these issues at once, but now I am suffering from all of them at the same time and I just feel like there is so little that I can do at the moment, and I don't have much fun, considering I am only 24! I am wondering if anyone has any advice at all on how to become more active, slowly. I have been close to incapacitated by social anxiety before, and I made incredible amounts of progress with the help of meds, CBT and other therapies. When I was 15 I genuinely thought my life was over and I'd never be able to do anything, because I could hardly leave the house, and simply couldn't do things like catch a bus at all. But the fact that I came out of the other side of that once before gives me the strength to know that I can do it again, in time (maybe a lot of time). I really am hoping to start getting better and feel like I have a better quality of life, and I'm not afraid of putting in the hard work that I know it'll take, but I'm just absolutely at a loss as to where to start right now :/. I've been considering paying for a private support worker - someone who can come with me the first few times to things that I want to be doing in the longer term, like going to the gym, or an art class, or new places in this City I've recently moved to, as I don't have the ability to make friends I can do with with right now, but I'm not sure if this would be totally sad and pathetic and I don't want to make someone feel uncomfortable, like I'm paying them for companionship. Any advice is much appreciated, and I'd love to hear all about other people's experiences too."
"I cry. A lot. Hi, I am new to this forum. I am a 17 year old female. This problem has been around for a long time now, maybe 9 years now. Every time something slightly troublesome comes up, I have an overwhelming urge to cry. This can be as minor as confronting a teacher about a grade, talking to a friend about my grades, or asking my parents something related to my mental health without trying to give away too many details that I am not doing well mentally. I know this is linked to stress and anxiety. But it has come to a point where I am in a full-blown cry after my parents talk to me in a slightly hostile voice. I just don't know what to do. I cry a lot in public too, and I have to try my best to hide it with my glasses and sleeves. When a teacher calls on me to answer something, and I get it wrong, I break down. I know it sounds like this is some teenager hormone issue, but none of my other friends go through this to the degree I do. I also feel like this may have some attachment to having slight (undiagnosed) depression, but again I cry in situations that have no relation to being depressed. I know diagnosis is not allowed on this website, but I am curious to see if crying way too much is a symptom of anything else. Thanks."
"I cry. A lot. I get weepy easily. But a real cry? Maybe with something really mild- I know when depression gets real bad, it seems as if folks (at least some I've talked to about it) lose the ability to have a really good cry. I know while I get weepy easily, having a good hard cry, is really hard these days. Oh and don't discount the hormones- I mean, just 'cause it seems to be more than your peers, doesn't mean something's not going on- or even an imbalance they're not having to deal with. Not saying it is, but am saying you can't take that completely off the table, either, without tests. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"I cry. A lot. it's better to cry than make others cry. i've met people who are very very rude and enjoy tormenting others. especially at work place where bosses would purposely make juniors wait at office for no work. you're way better than such people. earlier i'd cry a lot. now i dont feel tears and i'm turning to stone. it's okay if you cry. tendency to cry equals ability to laugh it can be bit embarrassing to cry before public. at my office whenever i had to speak with my boss for salary or work issues, i'd rehearse the conversation in my mind ten times and then approach the boss. so being prepared before the event helps. exhausted"
"I cry. A lot. I've always been a 'crier'. I've learned that it really does have alot to do with personality. Sounds like you have a sweet and sensitive personality If you are at all the type who is self-conscious or really just likes to be the peacemaker, then any of the situations you gave as examples would probably make you cry. True, hormones do play a part-and can make it worse at times, but really there are those of us who just cry at the 'drop of a hat'. I've learned some tricks so I don't cry every time, but I've learned that sometimes...I'm just gonna do what has to be done, crying or not! People that know me know that I'm going to cry and it's just the way it is! The upside is-you can empathize with others when they're crying and having a hard time! Reminds me of the teaching I had in Sunday School 'Weep with those who weep'....and I was like ""Oh, yeah...I got this! I can cry with people...lol"" Embrace your personality, it's what makes you unique!"
"Chronic over worrying and self blaming To say that I worry a lot would be a massive understatement. I worry to the point that it is debilitating. Recently, I have actually lost some weight due to not being able to eat because of worry. While I could stand to drop a few pounds, it's bad that it is happening this way. I also have an extreme fear of abandonment. That is due to the fact that I have been abandoned in the past by people who I thought were my friends. People that I loved dearly. There is someone in my life now who I absolutely love with all of my heart. This person and I share a very special bond. I know that nothing is forever, but I want this person in my life for as long as they can possibly be. For the remainder of our lives if possible. Recently, when this person failed to reply to messages, I got worried to the point that I could not function. I mean, I could not eat or sleep. I thought for certain that I had done something to make them no longer want to have anything to do with me, even though I could not think of anything that I may have done. I just knew that I had to have done something. Someone told me that I was worried over nothing. That this person not replying probably had nothing to do with me personally. I could see their point. However, what bothered me was, it just was not like this person to just flat out not respond like this. Even if they were otherwise occupied, they would always tell me that. Plus, they would even say something like ""hit me up tomorrow when I will have more time to talk"". But, this time, there was nothing. I got a really bad vibe from it. I went into such a state of worry. I broke down emotionally. Then, I tried again the next day. I figured I had nothing to lose. Also, as someone pointed out to me, if she truly wanted nothing more to do with me, then she would just unfriend and/or block me, and in fact, would have already done it by now. So, I try again the next day, and she replies and everything seems okay. I was greatly relieved, and I asked if everything was alright, because she had me worried when she did not reply the day before. She said that that had absolutely nothing to do with me. I was glad to hear that, but I still worried a little. I took that to mean that she was not replying to anyone else either. I wasn't sure, because she did not elaborate on it. I have this issue where I worry. I worry to a point that I can not think straight. It interferes with my daily life when I am in such a state of worry. I forget to do things. I walk around in a perpetual daze. I hate that I get like this. But, it seems like it is out of my control. Plus, there is the self blame. I immediately assume that something is all my fault. If someone acts strange, or out of character, then I automatically think that it is because of me personally. And even when I can't think of anything that I may have done, I convince myself that I most certainly have done something and it was completely and totally unforgivable. Should I seek professional help for this? Perhaps get on some sort of medication? I need to do something because it is to a point where I am afraid that I am going to worry myself physically sick. Or, if it gets too out of control, I may harm myself. Any thoughts?"
"Chronic over worrying and self blaming I worry as well. my friend said 'you're seeking a perfect world which doesn't exist' venting to this friend helps a lot. i get worried even when i have to cross the street. if someone is walking toward me, i start trembling whether should i move left or right or should i stop and wait for the other person to move or should i gesture the other person to stop and i'll move or should i gesture the other person to move while i continue walking. so you're not alone. it's very very exhausting on the mind and people get fed up of me easily. exhausted"
"*TW* Im getting obsessed over someone and its not helping *** TRIGGER WARNING *** Hi, Im David. This is quite a long one so please bare with me. For quite a long time now, I cant get this guy out of my head. There's not a moment where i dont think about him. Whenever i receive messages, i always hope he's the sender. I get very happy and excited when i do get messages from him (most of the time its about schoolwork). I think about wanting to spend more time with him, and also the possible moments i'd be spending with him in the future. I wont say we're friends, more like acquaintances. He's really nice and most of the time seeing him instantly brightens my day. I really like him. There's times where he'd walk around near to my seat and observe what I'm doing, he'd go to me when he needs help understanding our lessons, and at times i see him stealing glances at me and i just pretend i dont notice. Now you could say that its just me being hopeful or im just being desperate, whatever it is, he makes me feel special. Lately, ive been very depressed, a lot of stuff just builds up and form into this one big monster of a downer. There was a time back then when i thought perhaps i have mental/emotional issues. I'm anxious about everything and for maybe the past 2 years and im gloomy more often than not, but back then i somehow managed to stay and feel ""normal"". It's not until lately that things got really worse and unbearable. I feel useless and insignificant, everything about school just makes it worse, a lot of deadlines, everyone is better than me at everything, I fear what future is there for a failure like me and on top of that, I'm lonely. I have friends but not ones I could open up to and ask help with my depressive thoughts. I have no one to ask for help, i dont have the balls to ask even my family, so i walked the darkness alone and everything just accumulated. I feel bound and isolated. If im not thinking about a particular problem, another one rears its ugly head and takes the spotlight. Day in, day out, the problems eats me up non-stop. It's like a huge truck running over me again and again. All the problems from way back, came back and stacked up with the rest. There were moments where id just cease to function. I feel like theres no future for me, or if there is, i fear its not worth living if all i will ever experience is the same pain and suffering and loneliness i am feeling right now. I felt like there was no way out. The other night, i was contemplating suicide. Amidst the cold darkness, there was that guy, the one i talked about earlier. He's my ray of sunshine. That night i was so ready to say goodbye to this world, to meet my end and be free from all the $#%^. I was laying there in my bed thinking how i'm going to kick the bucket. Ive never felt so low and utterly helpless. I breathed in and out fully accepting that day as my last, then i heard a ding! from my phone. It was him. Now he didnt say anything miraculous or holy that blessed me with the will to throw away that blade and live another day, well in a way he did. He just said 'i need help chapter 1-3'. I laughed silly at how this tiny message did all the wonders that got me up my bed, take my book, check what sorcery lies in chapter 1-3 and toss that blade away. I thought of the many great moments i have and i could spend with this guy in the future, we could even be close friends. That, im not willing to throw away. Now here's my problem. I'm afraid to lose him. In a year, we'd be graduating college. He'd be gone and we'd be going our separate ways. I'm afraid what future there wont be without him. Whats going to be my sunshine then? How am i going to find hope during dark times if he aint around? Its seems im getting obsessed with him. Thinking of losing him just adds to the still fresh wounds of depression. I know a lot can happen in a year, but right now, i need help dealing with this obsession, how do i stop relying on him as my sole saviour? how am i gonna accept the slowly but surely approaching end? Should i just forget him? How should i deal with all this? Take it how you will, for you it may seem petty or trivial, but for me, right now at this moment, it means a lot. It may hold my future of either sinking back to depression or finally moving on. Thanks. Last edited by shock_the_monkey on Thu Mar 29, 2018 1:01 pm, edited 2 times in total.

"*TW* Im getting obsessed over someone and its not helping back in my university days there was a girl that i was rather smitten by. we met at a club for mentally handicapped people that we both helped out at. in my final year she went to france and we used to keep in touch by letter. i suffered from severe depression thought the whole three years of university. she was very much the only thing that kept me going through those dark days. and, although she later departed my life, i can't deny that without her i simply wouldn't have coped. there's a song by BJH called 'paraiso dos cavalos' (paradise of the horses) - i can't listen to it without thinking of her, and it always makes me tear up. now, a quick quote from one of my favourite films, 'excalibur' by john boorman ... The fellowship was a brief beginning... ...a fair time that cannot be forgotten. And because it will not be forgotten... ...that fair time may come again. ... and this, to me, is the essence of life - we live in hope. something knocked me out' the trees now i'm on my knees ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey there is one thing you must be sure of i can't take any more ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey don't like it but i guess i'm learning ... shock the monkey to life"
"An introduction I am a little overwhelmed by being here and could easily have posted in a couple of place here. I am hopefully looking for extra support and understanding. I am 32, been married 5 years today, and have a beautiful 18 month old daughter. I have suffered with mostly anxiety since I was 4 years old off and on. On top of anxiety, I also suffer from severe depression, and OCD/Scrupulosity. My husband suffers from Borderline Personality disorder. With all that out of the way, I will yell you guys what has brought me here now. Last year, my husband and I started to help my dad who was terminally sick. My dad had just came back in my life right before he found out he had cancer. It was hard to do and he was sometimes hard to deal with. In November he went down hill quick and on November 8th I watched my daddy's life end right in front of me. The next day my husband was fired from a job he really liked. Since then, both my husband and I's mental health has not been the best. It seems every day we get thrown more bad news about something. Right now I am barely managing with my anxiety and intrusive thoughts. I suffer from scrupulosity and a terrifying fear of hell. Most people don't understand it. I live in the bible belt. I currently see a therapist and take medications, but I believe I need more help than I am getting. I could write a lot more but this is where I am right now. I appreciate anyone reading this."
"An introduction Welcome. Stick with the therapy and meds for now. Explain to the therapist that you don't think that you are getting the level of help that you need. They should have advanced resources available, if you require them. Have you had an extensive physical exam lately? I felt much better after blood tests revealed deficiencies that are being addressed through meds and mineral supplements. Sorry about the spate of bad news. The same meds that treated my depression also treated my anxiety. Today I am doing fairly well and although the roller coaster never stops, I can handle it as I know that I can hang on for the ride. Support from others really helps. There are 12-step meetings with others that are going through exactly what you are going through. It is cheaper than therapy, but should not be considered a replacement for professional help just yet. I use 12-step meetings as an 'aftercare'. Seeing that we are not alone in our life struggles and seeing how others deal with things, gives me ideas on how to move on that I would never have thought of by myself. Best of luck to you.

"Anxiety due to contact with siblings Hello, I live abroad and every time my siblings contact me (email only) I am left feeling very anxious (sweating and feeling flat). I suffer from anxiety and depression. I have asked them to leave me alone very politely but they get more persistent and demand to ring them. We have not had a good relationship and they bully me. I don't want to hurt anyone just want to be left in peace. Please advise me what to do? Many thanks!!"
"Anxiety due to contact with siblings Please don't feel that you are alone with this. I dread meeting with family most of the time. The apprehension is much worse beforehand, but it usually doesn't go so bad once I realize that it is over. I have a drunken, angry brother and sister that I cannot tolerate for very long. There are certain matters that the family must discuss and plan for together. If the phone conversation begins to stress you, get the main message across and avoid going into small talk if it begins to bother you. You can always close the conversation by stating that something has come up on your end and you need to get off the phone. Emails are impersonal to begin with. Sometimes it helps to send something humorous along with the message. Use emoticons or smiley faces to make it more personal and put the other party at ease. Choose a time when you are relaxed and open to some family-time. One thing that gets me is a stressful and seemingly pointless phone call just as I walk in the door from a stressful day and I am tired and hungry. At least with emails, I can choose the time to check them and answer them when I am ready to. Phone calls usually get me when I am unprepared for discussion. Best of luck to you.

"Anxiety due to contact with siblings Many thanks for your advice. I have only been in touch with them via email for the past 4 years. What I described was just my reaction to reading and responding to their emails. I have not given them my address or telephone number. I worry that some of my siblings will be more abusive as I have left my faith some time ago, have a partner they won't approve of. What concerns me is my safety but the lash back on my nieces. My parents were very kind but sadly passed away few years ago (5-10 years). I left home when I was 23, and I am 45 now. So I led a somewhat double life, not to hurt them. I can't even imagine talking to them. But they are putting too much pressure on me. I have asked them politely to just stay in touch via email and they get abusive. I love them very much and I don't want to hurt anyone. I just want to quietly live my life and sending them my love from far away. I like your idea of keeping conversations light. I shall bear that in mind. Thanks once again!!"
"Weed + Anxiety + Medication Hello guys. I am a 22 year old girl with social & general anxiety, bpd, and depression. I started smoking weed recreationally when i was around 16. I was on medication, but found that most of the time I had a good high. I was carefree and laughing nonstop. I stopped smoking for a bit and when I started again, I was probably on different medications, but for the same thing-- just normal anti depressants. I've always noticed that I get significantly higher than the people I smoke with. It makes me a bit self conscious but I figured it wasn't anything serious aside from maybe a bit of an annoyance to the people who chose to smoke with me. I honestly never even considered it could be my medications mixing until I was about 18 and took one hit from a bowl and got so high that I was hallucinating. My friend that was with me at the time didn't express any concern and actually seemed quite annoyed with how panicked I was. I ended up just laying there twitching and afraid until I fell asleep. I wasn't sure why it happened but it scared the crap out of me, so I did some research, chalked it up to the weed not mixing well with my medications, and I didn't smoke for a while after that. I've hallucinated 2 other times after smoking and was terrified but at least I knew what to do when I came across that situation. In the past year or so I have been smoking weed often, usually multiple times a week. I am still on antidepressants and benzos. I still find that I get higher than the people I smoke with. When I am high, I like to be alone or with my boyfriend. If I'm around people, I get extremely anxious and paranoid and worry that I might start hallucinating or something. I also get extremely nervous that everyone around me thinks I'm high, or even if they KNOW I'm high, that they'll think I'm acting too weird. Even after my high dissipates, lately, like in the past few weeks I've noticed pretty significant paranoia, disassociation, and just a general weird, uneasy feeling. Despite all of this, I don't really want to stop smoking weed because, when the circumstances are right, I do have a really good high. It makes everything more enjoyable (especially sex lol), but ONLY if I'm alone, or with my boyfriend, who is pretty much the only person I would allow to see me high anymore. Is this normal? Has this ever happened to anyone else? If so, could you describe what happened, I'm really curious about this. I'm wondering should I just stop smoking altogether? If I don't, could anything serious happen because of the medications not interacting well with the weed? Could I go insane or something? Also wondering if it could be beneficial to come off my medications and smoke weed medically? Would the weed actually be helpful for my anxiety if I were to go off my medication? I don't want to be stupid and go off my medication, but it really isn't working for me. I'm not sure what to do. It's so confusing to me that weed actually helps some people with their anxiety when it makes me so paranoid. *****************Also, I have only smoked medical marijuana in the past year and have hallucinated once during that time. I also wasn't sure which board to post this in, so I'm sorry is it doesn't belong here!! >.< Thanks for your help guys. <3"
"Weed + Anxiety + Medication Hmmmm, so my experience: When I started smoking weed, I really enjoyed it. I was a lightweight and definitely had hallucinations -- I think it's possible that the weed hit me so hard *because* I had anxiety, so I was very attuned to what my body was feeling so I paid much closer attention to the differences in my body than other people. Or maybe I'm just a lightweight I wasn't taking any medications at this time, so it's just definitely the way I am naturally. I kept smoking, occasionally hallucinating but usually not, and always getting much higher than everyone else. However, I started having panic attacks more and more often (incredibly anxious during and afterwards to the point where I'd feel sick) and I think they got worse because I had more and more bad experiences of being high built up. One day (maybe 9 months after I started smoking weed), I got high with my boyfriend (nothing different then usual), and he drove us to get fast food. And I got SICK. I was disassociating and had severe nausea and I thought I was going to die. I made him park the car because I was so afraid that if it moved, I'd get so sick that I'd actually die. We sat in the parking lot for four hours (I kept waiting for the high to wear off so I could calm down, but the feeling never lessened or went away) until I finally told him to take me home. When I got home, I couldn't sit up in bed for a week straight -- each time I did, I thought the nausea was too bad and I thought I'd die. I was disassociating and I felt like I couldn't see anything and nothing was real. I had to always have an apple and glass of water on my bedstand because I was convinced that if that happened to me again and I didn't have an apple or water, I'd die. My mom took me to every Urgent Care and the doctors kept telling me they had no idea what was wrong with me -- we thought it was something physical. Turns out the weed had triggered a SEVERE panic attack, which in turn triggered anxiety, severe OCD, and agoraphobia. I didn't leave my house for two months because I was so afraid that I'd have another attack and be isolated and not be able to get to a place where I could save myself from being sick like that again and dying. The disassociation was constant for those two months. For the following six months or so, I was physically able to go outside, but I still got nausea and dizziness and general panic/anxiety (so still agoraphobia) and I would have periods where disassociation would roll over me. It was terrifying. I wasn't able to ride in cars because I had severe panic attacks and disassociation for over two years, and I stopped being able to eat food because I was so afraid that it could have LSD or cannabis in it (getting high again was my worst fear and I was convinced I'd die if I had a second experience like that). I'm finally, three years later, somewhat close to as stable as where I used to be, but I feel like I lost a couple years of my life in that breakdown. I really don't think your reaction is because of your medication. Over the span of eight months, my body's reaction to weed morphed significantly, and I think it's just part of the chemicals in your body changing in your teens and twenties. My best friend, who has anxiety, OCD, and bipolar disorder, is on medications and uses weed medically. It's been incredibly helpful to her and none of my friends on medications have found a negative correspondence between weed and meds. Everyone's bodies are different and some people are helped by weed, but it's not abnormal to have paranoid and anxious reactions to weed. Recently, a few of my other friends, who have been smoking for years and didn't have much anxiety before have both gone to the ER for panic attacks that ended up turning into anxiety disorders. Weed can do that to people! It's really such a varied response. Weed can definitely be fun, but if you're already having paranoid reactions to it, I would say that's likely how your body processes weed and you shouldn't use it as your primary medication, because there's a chance it won't have anti-anxiety effects. So to answer your questions: what you experience when you get high is normal. My experience, I think, is a pretty worst case scenario, but it IS something that happens. (My dad worked in a psychiatric hospital in the 80's and a lot of the people he saw had schizophrenia induced by cannabis & LSD overusage in the 60's). I'd say that if weed so far hasn't been very helpful for your anxiety, I wouldn't use it as a primary medication -- I'd suggest finding an anxiety medication that works well for you and then choosing to smoke weed or not on top of that. In my own experience, I wish I had stopped smoking when I first noticed the panic attacks and disassociation, but so it goes. I don't think you could go insane from the medications interacting with weed, but weed by itself, especially combined with a predisposition for mental disorders CAN have negative physical and mental effects. (I'm still salty that it helps so many people and not me). Continue to smoke weed if you'd like -- it can be fun and it could be a large part of your lifestyle -- but make sure to seek other help for your anxiety and be aware that it can affect you negatively!"
"Weed + Anxiety + Medication You sound a bit like the constant battle between my parents and me over weed in one person. haha, a real conflicting answer here, because, I really support weed smoking, I do it daily myself, and have been for over 6 years. Now I was on antidepressants and stimulants for 4 years and I smoked Weed regularly for maybe 2 of those years in total and went mad, got sectioned and switched to meds for bipolar disorder along with a new diagnosis. the new meds do help, and I now know that I was Bipolar, and that the antidepressants and stimulants were keeping me in a hypomanic state, and I literally always felt buzzed/anxious or on edge. Weed also does this, medical or otherwise. Weed can increase or decrease anxiety, it's a bit of a stimulant and depressant, and hallucinogen, so yes all the effects you are feeling are normal. Since I came off the antidepressants, and only take stimulants recreationally or at raves, I haven't ""gone mad"", and I have been smoking weed every day though, so this proves to me that the combination of weed and meds, or just the meds on their own were causing an increase in my anxiety, which is understandable as the antidepressants have a mania-inducing/stimulating effect on bipolar patients and stimulants are stimulants, and weeds a bit of one so, self explanitory. all you need to do now is ask yourself do you want to continue taking it, is it helping you enough to keep on taking the risk getting a hold of, and smoking , ? at least you know you wont die or anything on it!"
"Weed + Anxiety + Medication Any type of drug, especially a hallucinogen, has a high possibility of causing a bad trip when you have an anxiety disorder. Marijuana can in fact cause long term side effects such as dissociation and paranoia, especially if you're already mentally ill. I use to smoke too and one day, I don't know if it's because of the type of weed or if I wasn't in a good mood or something, I had the worst trip ever. I hallucinated, was paranoid and everything. Every time I tried to smoke after that the same thing would happen so I stoped. Ever since that experience I've developed derealization. This was over 3 years ago btw. NPD / GAD"
"Anhedonia and racing thoughts Hi, I'm a 24 years old former university student and I have a generalized anxiety disorder developed after a depression followed by a burnout. My depression stopped about 2 years ago shortly before my burnout, in a silent bang where I went from crying 5 times a day to feeling absolutely nothing but numbness. My depression used to give me a very high libido somehow, my emotions were all over the place then I lost it all with my libido in the matter of a day. I went on with my life hoping that my problems would go away in due time, anti-depressant didn't help as they just numbed my emotions even further. Then, I suffered a burnout at university after a really difficult schoolwork and 5 days without sleeping. I thought I was becoming psychotic or dying, these possibility have been ruled out since, but my everyday anxiety has been somewhat recurring ever since that day. After my extensive preventive checkup with my psychiatrist, I was prescribed some clonazepam for my anxiety to use about once a week when needed (I'm very scared of benzo addiction so I only take them once a month) The only thing that seems to make me happy is drinking alcohol just enough to be tipsy, it doesn't make me aggressive or much dumber than I usually am, but it makes me so much more outgoing and happy, despite the numbness in my head that never leaves me like a football player slowly crushing my skull with his elbow. So I drank some coffee today and while I usually feel empty and nonchalant, which doesn't bother me usually because of how sedated from the anhedonia, a single cup of coffee was enough to give me the worst racing thoughts and I almost immediately started overanalysing everything so promptly, logically and pragmatically like a supercomputer and answering meaningless metaphysical and philosophical questions leading nowhere, coming from nowhere, I couldn't breath for a moment. The torture never ended until I hit the hay. Does anyone have a clue what's wrong with me? Is there a way I could stop these racing thoughts from torturing me and keeping me awake? Sometimes I get these episodes for no reason, but the coffee always seems to trigger it, it's frightening and I feel like I'll lose my mind (there it is, another racing thought that keeps coming back: ""am I losing my mind?"")"
"Unable to laugh after a panic attack? I haven't posted on this forum in years but I browse relatively frequently. While I have dealt with diagnosed Clinical Depression and anxiety for eight years I have never received long term treatment, though I have made an appointment to see someone later this month. My reason for posting here today has to do with a particularly bad bout of anxiety and depression the likes of which I have not faced since the onset eight years ago. To put it simply, my closest friend inadvertently did and said the very things that triggered the original reaction all those years ago and I was immediately reliving every detail in that moment. All of the progress I had made was vaporized and I suffered a total breakdown that night, which the worst of lasted for a few days. This is day six. While I am feeling quite a bit better I have not 100% recovered and become my old self again. While I am now at least able to function at work, eat again, and not feel nauseated all day I have run into a new problem. After the Panic attack I had on the 13th of February I have found it EXTREMELY difficult to smile or laugh at things even if I find them hysterical. I have not gotten any more attacks and this is the first I've had in eight years. I am just wondering if anyone else has experience with this sort of thing? There is a slightly numb and empty feeling inside of me that was never there before despite the lingering anxiety and depression over the years. Before I was able to cope. I was able to smile and laugh hysterically and life was pretty alright I suppose. After this attack though all of that seems broken? Will this go away on its own after a couple of weeks or months or is medication / therapy the only option now?"
"Unable to laugh after a panic attack? I've also had anhedonia and emotional numbness as the result of a burnout. I believe it comes and go depending on how much you fake it, but I haven't had much occasions to test my own theory, so take them with a grain of salt. My symptoms are very similar to yours and I would also love an answer, my psychiatrist only gives me anti-depressants with terrible side effects and little results on my mood which is precisely TOO STABLE and neutralized."
"How can I help my friend with panic attacks? First of all, I hope this is in the right forum. Second, I'm asking this mostly for a friend. Today my friend had a panic attack in class. I don't exactly know what brought it on, I think it was the effect of around 70 people in a small space all talking. He talked about his vision zooming in and out, and then he just dropped his head into his hands and started crying. He said this was the first time in 2 years he's had one. I'm not very knowledgeable about panic attacks. I've had one I can remember. I'm just wondering, how can I help him if this happens again? I recognised that it was a panic attack, but I just didn't quite know how to help him. Especially because it was in class. Thank you in advance."
"How can I help my friend with panic attacks? It's great that you want to help him. Props for that. Just being there for him. If you can, be calm in the moment when it happens. Calming presence is soothing. You can also assure him that he is safe and that the feelings of panic will pass eventually."
"Hi... Hi I'm new here and I have been going through the worst period of my life the last couple of weeks. I have been dealing with regret, shame and fear for the future. I'm so regretful for things I've done, for my darks secrets to come out. I keep thinking of what's gonna happen when people find out about my lies. I just feel like I don't want to wake up the next day, I've been crying so much lately and nothing make me happy. I just to enjoy music, movies, baking and I can't any of that anymore. I feel like whats happening is what I deserve for for of all being a compulsive liar, although I have stopped with that ever since I realized my problem I haven't told a lie. My lies were never about anyone else just about myself and ""pretended"" relationships. I have cried so many times and wished I didn't wake up the next morning, I don't feel like I deserve to live, good people are taken from this earth and here am I a liar living and still breathing. I would just want the pain to go away and the couple of last weeks which is when I realized there is something wrong with me and I woke up from this way of behaving, realized my actions I haven't found peace with myself. Everyday is a nightmare and every second is painful and is eating me alive. One second its the regret that hits me, then after a moment its the fear and the catastrophic future of what might happen if people find out, then its the shame and the guilt. It's like this horrible circle that never leaves my body, head and heart. Has anyone experienced something similar, how did you survive this? Love and peace"
"Hi... Hi I’ve lied some in my life but not the root cause for my GAD. I do share the feelings of hopelessness with you. IMO you need to make amends with these people or situations that have led you to lie. I take it to be one of the hardest things you will do, but seems necessary for recovery. Beating yourself up about mistakes will make the pain worse, focus on your amazing ability to change instead. Josh"
"Considering meds, would love advice? Hi all! I've had high levels of anxiety pretty much forever, and I see a psychologist regularly who uses CBT. I find CBT extremely useful, and I feel so much better for challenging my thinking, especially when I am consistent with using mindfulness. I feel like my anxiety is so much more under control, although I do have sleep disturbances and a few strange things popping up (like becoming obsessed with worry that I've left my oven on for no rational reason at work, worrying all day then coming home and of course its not) and what I call anxiety dreams. Despite this, day to day I am feeling better. The only thing, I also experience bruxism (excessive jaw grinding in my sleep) causing headaches and pain, which so far treatment has been unsuccessful, and neck/shoulder pain which is limiting and possibly related to the bruxism. I have looked into alternate treatment for the bruxism- I have been to countless dentists, use a mouth guard at night and now see a chiropractor but I would love something more effective. I have come across botox being used to relax the jaw muscle, and when I saw my doctor I asked her opinion about it. She said that the jaw problems are 100% anxiety, and to properly deal with it I need to address the anxiety effectively- using botox would be just a bandaid (in her opinion.) Since I am already doing CBT and mindfulness (and I think my psychologist is great) she thinks I should try antidepressants. I have NEVER been on antidepressants before and am a little wary of doing something that would be altering my mind, particularly as my anxiety isn't what I would say is terrible (IE I haven't been to hospital or had anything really drastic) what I am really wanting is a reduction in these physical symptoms. I have no idea about medication and worry about dependence and just prefer to manage things naturally HOWEVER it has been years and the jaw/neck pain is a real issue for me. Would love to hear experiences and feedback"
"Considering meds, would love advice? Hi butterfly, I used SSRIs for all of a couple of weeks, I couldn’t handle the stomach upset. I’ve tried klonopin and that works well for in the moment, but only used it for a few months. Recently I have found relief in taking hemp CBD oils and amino acids. The hemp oil doesn’t have any THC in it. I also take a strong probiotic. This combo is the only thing I’ve found to be helpful at easing my anxiety to where I can get work done, function and begin the process of healing my body and mind. I would say it’s worth a try, both bottles are abut a month supply and cost me $40 each at a local health food store. No side effects like meds and as far as I know no cases of dependency. Let me know if you try and if it is of any help to you. I was honestly about to make a dr appointment at psych to get meds before I found this combo. Josh"
"Not having anxiety makes me feel anxiety Hi everybody! So I am 23 years old, and I dealt with anxiety starting at 5 years old, got on Zoloft at age 10 for extreme OCD and anxiety and wanting to die because it was so bad. It helped. I started smoking weed when I was 17. Tried mushrooms 3 times when I was 19, the first time I had an extreme realization of being alive and just how amazing everything is. I started to try to ween myself off of Zoloft, which I did over the course of about 6 months. During that time a lot of anxiety came back. I then tried a mild form of a hallucinogen called 5-meO-DMT, which is that first time I experienced a sense of depersonalization or derealizarion. It was a feeling of hyper-awareness of how your body is commanded by your brain without you actually having to make yourself move, and also a feeling of lagging in mental response time. Any way, after I did that, I couldn’t smoke weed anymore because it caused me to have a lot of anxiety. The hallucinogens I have tried have caused feelings in me I had never felt before, most of them were unpleasant, and I still feel them sometimes. After I tried DMT (at age 20), I ended up taking Effexor for about 5 months, in combination with Abilify for about the first 2 months, but now I don’t take anything and I honestly have moments that I’ve never felt better than ever. I also felt pretty great my first 2-4 years of taking Zoloft. I tried smoking weed again for a while but had to stop due to it causing me to have paranoid thoughts, mostly dissociative feelings, or derealization. I honestly cannot explain how it made me feel. I guess you can say it was depersonalization but not really. I just felt or maybe had the thought even that nothing around me is real, it just feels like a dream that doesn’t feel real in a way. But during those moments I can also have extreme realizations about reality. ..... So the point of this post is that sometimes, my anxiety gets so low in a way (I say this because it seems as though sometimes my anxiety levels get so low, that I start to have anxiety in a different way because I’m not used to not having anxiety, so feeling different scares me). It’s like everything starts to feel so real that it starts to feel unreal. It’s like I’m having a new perspective that I don’t know how to interpret. I start to literally feel like this isn’t real, everything is not actually existing just a projection, or something like that. It’s weird because in a way I feel like I almost always have some for of dissociation, but just from general stress or anxiety. It’s like when you’re stressing out in your head, you’re not totally emotionally or mentally engaged in what’s going on around you, and you don’t feel as connected as you want to. But it’s not that things feel unreal in a sense as they do when you’re having a derealization attack. I really need help, advice, maybe something to help myself or say to myself. I tell myself, “everything is real. It’s okay. Relax. You’ll be okay.” And I pray a lot. It ends up going away. But can anyone explain this? Or help me to feel better about it or have any tips to cure that? I honestly do not want to take artificial medication. Thank you so much."
"Not having anxiety makes me feel anxiety Anxiety has been called an 'addiction' by some professionals. You need to break the habit of always wondering what will happen next: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/em ... how-not-be We had friends over for dinner and the lady couldn't take her smartphone off the table next to her plate. She was busy watching crisis after crisis unfold in text messages on her screen. She could not relax and share in a meal or conversation, except to say: OMG what just happened to so-and-so. I got rid of my phone as I could easily see this kind of distraction in my daily life. I also backed off caffeine as it stopped helping me wake up and just served to make me hyper.

"I feel so #######5 (nervous breakdown experience) I had a nervous breakdown in June 2017. Some background: I've been living at home since graduating college 2 years ago, worked at a job in my hometown. I consider myself ambitious, hardworking, independent. My anxiety and stress had been building ever since I moved home, until it got so debilitating I had to quit my job in June. I felt paralyzed, had derealization/DP. Panic attacks were insane. I felt a desperate need to escape, I felt extreme rage and resentment at my parents, I felt I was ready to explode/snap. It was like I had had ENOUGH of them (especially my mom). I've been seeing a therapist about this since October -- I felt therapy helped a lot, and I was so focused on it and made progress in terms of the issues with my mom. It was like we uncovered the root cause of my issue/anger. However, it's now January (almost Feb.) and I feel like reality has hit me -- I haven't reached the goal I wanted in therapy yet, and I realized I have to move on with my life. I feel like complete S**T because I regret not having taken a break following the breakdown in June -- I was in horrible shape but I felt like if I had gone away from my parents maybe I would have been better. But a part of my mind was like maybe I need to grow from this and get my anger out? And experience a breakthrough? I feel like a piece of $#%^, and so stupid for continuing on with this situation. I have dark, low thoughts as a result, suicidal thoughts I never thought I'd have in my life. I'm so angry with myself, wishing I had left just to give me some sense of joy because I had had it with my parents and living situation."
"I feel so #######5 (nervous breakdown experience) Two years might seem like a while, but this is really you getting your feet wet after college. I too went balls to the wall after college, and after that ambitious honeymoon phase left, I was burned out and anxious. I was near my home town. My mother did NOT make it easy. She kept trying to give me projects, because her line of work is related to what I used to do. This was on top of my main job...where I was an assistant manager. Everything you're saying sounds like me around that time. Therapy can take a really long time. I've been going (for many things) since January of last year. I go once a week, and still have many of my bad habits. Still I've lost many of them, so I know it's helping. Though it may be depressing and stressful to you, I wouldn't recommend taking on much more till you become more calm. My mom (though not much in my life anymore) instilled a need to always need to be doing something, and preferably something useful. It makes things extremely stressful when trying to relax. I'll often start a project for work, and wind up daydreaming because I both can't focus on work, but don't want to simply be lazy. *sigh I feel like a piece of $#%^, and so stupid for continuing on with this situation. I have dark, low thoughts as a result, suicidal thoughts I never thought I'd have in my life. I'm so angry with myself, wishing I had left just to give me some sense of joy because I had had it with my parents and living situation. Good lord you sound like me. I have pure ocd plus bipolar, which makes for all the dark thoughts when I'm down. This also includes me feeling like a POS for whenever I can't do something that I feel is important. I would maybe talk to your therapist about the likelihood of you having OCD, a mood disorder and maybe ADHD. Meds help, but don't leap on them till you're comfortable."
"Anyone else develop severe sleep issues from GAD? I always slept perfect my entire life until I was about 31 years old... and then gradually my sleep became worse over a span of about 5 months until I had to quit my awesome job and move back in with my parents. At this point, I still had no idea why I wasn't sleeping (both having trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep) so I first tried sleeping pills, but they only worked for about a couple of days until my system got used to them. It wasn't until I started taking an antidepressent that my sleep gradually returned to normal. It took me TWO YEARS to figure out that all I needed was an antidepressant to get my sleep to return to normal. I now completely understand how some people are just simply chemically off-balance and need medicine, and how no amount of talking will ever resolve some people's mental health issues... because in my case, I don't have anxiety about anything in particular so there's really nothing to talk about, since my anxiety is ""very general"". I also had a very good upbringing with no trauma, but have also been a quiet anxious guy my entire life (although, like I said above, it wasn't until I hit about age 31 that my sleep started to be affected negatively, which caused me to quit my job and move back in with the parents). So in my case, it's just my chemistry is off and wasn't caused by any kind of trauma. I also don't ever have panic attacks either... it's just a very ""general"" anxiety (which I think causes me to live a very simple life, because with a simpler life I have a lot less anxiety). So is there anyone else here that solved their sleep issues (caused by anxiety) by taking antidepressants?"
"Anyone else develop severe sleep issues from GAD? I’m 29, and I started having sleep issues about three months back for the first time in my life. I was about to get on medication then I got turned on to CBD oil from hemp. I take about 6mg - 10mg a day as well as some supplement called Gabatrol which is amino acids and some other things. Taking these daily coupled with getting my diet and exercise in check has really helped my sleep. I’ve always been anxious as well, funny how it starts to wick into our sleep as we age. I’m going to start light therapy as well to get my rhythm more in check since I sit in an office all day long. Glad to hear you’re having success with the medication, usually people get on a road to recovery and use the meds for a while to aid their journey. The ones I was on previously I couldn’t handle, they hurt my stomach. I myself have to go back to therapy, I have a lot I want to work on in my psyche."
"Anyone else develop severe sleep issues from GAD? I have periodic adrenal exhaustion that caused me to have high cortisol levels into the middle of the night. It seems to be from too much coffee taken in a short amount of time or a build up of taking at least the equivalent of 3 cups each morning. I literally have to just go cold turkey from coffee for close to a week. Now the second thing that screws with my sleep turns out to be zinc deficiency. I was reading all about vitamins, and I started taking several and an unintended positive was I started to sleep much longer at night without waking up. *Copper accumulation in the body may affect the brain. I used to wake up about every 1.5 hrs. I take about 2 or 2.5 standard zink pills to this day because I want to avoid that freqent waking problem."

"GAD with paranoia and impulsiveness with emotions? So I've been trying to get my GAD under control lately- twice-daily Buspar, CBT, etc. But somethings I've noticed that I'm just not sure if they're a normal thing with GAD- as you can see by the title, I suffer paranoid thoughts that everyone is secretly ganging up on me or working to hide things from or lie to me, as well as this impulse to need to spill my guts to everyone about anything and anyone, which often gets me into trouble. I see my doc sometime next week. I just want to know if anyone else suffers one and/or the other of these things along with GAD."
"GAD with paranoia and impulsiveness with emotions? I see this post is a few weeks old, but I just wanted to say that I have very similar feelings. As of now, I have not seen a psychologist and I am not on any medications, so I guess it's not related to those. These ""paranoid"" thoughts began for me a few years ago (I am now 30). I don't remember what triggered them, but at one point I was travelling constantly for work and I read something online about people getting spied on in hotel rooms. That made me start feeling paranoid that I was being watched in rooms, that people were out to get me. THOSE feelings made me worried that I was developing some form of clinical paranoia and THAT threw me into severe panic attacks. I realize that it's unreasonable, and I know that people aren't really out to get me, but the panic associated with those feelings is absolutely real. Sometimes I get the idea that people know my secrets and that they want to use them against me. Like you, it makes me want to just come out and say them. It's absolutely relieving to know that someone else feels the same way, and it makes me feel like I'm not going crazy. I haven't quite figured out how to deal with these thoughts outside of riding them out, but I'm going to try and schedule a meeting with a doc sooner than later because these thoughts and feelings are getting old."

"Anxiety Disorder be as bad as having depression. I was diagnosed with so many things since 12 years old. I dont take medicine now since trying and having my baby. I believe all along its been extreme anxiety. I dont believe I have had depression but, due to Anxiety being so bad at times I get so mad and frustrated that it makes me feel bad. I have tried suicides in past once almost died. I also have had in my youth bad things happen to me. I have had 2 pregnancies and one baby my Anxiety has gone through the roof. I get really frustrated and it turns to anger. It stems from being extremely anxious. Just was wondering why this happens. How to control it so I dont be this way anymore. I am about to be 36 years old in few weeks. It didnt start getting like this untill I was 24 years old. It happens alot when others stress me out or something goes wrong. Generally I am calm and parient person most of the time."
"Do I / Should I - Start Drinking Again? Hi - I have stopped drinking probably close to 1.5 years at this stage. Reason: Intense Depression, Anxiety and severe low moods for nearly weeks after the drinking session. I am not an alcoholic, I have no addiction to it in any way, I never really drank that much anyway, but when I did, it would be hell for weeks after. So I decided to stop. I am at the stage now where I am considering starting again, really from a social perspective as it's hard, at 25, to turn down a social gathering because I didn't want to drink. Anyway... advise? Has anyone done this before? - I don't know how hard I will feel it after being off for so long.. (I take Lexapro and Xanax for Anxiety and Mild/Moderate Depression) Thank you!"
"Do I / Should I - Start Drinking Again? Alcoholic or not, it may be best to discuss this with your doctor as I don't know your situation well enough to suggest yes or no. If alcohol caused you issues in the past, you may want to heed that. It can also react with your current medication in unpredictable ways. I know that alcohol caused some 'unpredictable' problems for me in my past and I chose to stop drinking. I can still attend gatherings and relax, I just drink plain, fizzy seltzer or fruit juice. Soda has questionable sweeteners, high sodium and possibly caffeine, so I avoid that also. It is about taking care of yourself and not having to pay a price of negative reactions and side-effects that may have been caused by the alcohol.

"Do I / Should I - Start Drinking Again? Why not just have one or two beers (but drink them very slowly)? When I was in college that's what I did, since if I had any more I would feel sick/bad the next day. Also, if you're taking an SSRI such as Lexapro, then the medicine may cause you to feel worse from alcohol, so it's advised that people taking SSRIs should only drink one or two drinks... One or two drinks shouldn't cause anything but relaxation. Or are you saying drinking small amounts (one or two drinks) causes you to get depressed/moody?"
"The bain of my life Im so sick of this, all of this stuff in my head is preventing me from living a normal life, why do I have to be burdened with all these thoughts. Ive had depression since christmas last year but have started to feel a bit better in the last through months through exercise and looking after myself. However I feel like these thoughts will never go away so ill be able to live a normal life where I can have deep and meaningful relationships with people. All I seem to do is worry about life always trying to figure out everything. This can range from philosophical questions to questions about human psychology and whether its innate or social conditioning. Such questions as 'what is a friend', 'what makes people different', 'where do opinions come from' 'what is humour'. You may say this all seems interesting but it takes over anything I do in life, I cant just have a good time with friends or anything because of this. Even simple things like a film I cant find entertaining as I am constantly thinking the whole way through. It makes me anxious as I feel I can never let people in fully as I feel all this information is too much for most people. Maybe ive always been like this and because of my anxiety it forces me to focus on much more and not relax. I feel like its just a constant cycle of wanting to know but never fully being satisfied. I just need someone to reassure me its anxiety as this is not the life I want."
"Age regression during anxiety/panic? I've been having something that seems kindof in between anxiety and panic attacks, but one feature I haven't seen anyone else post about is that I start feeling and speaking like a child or baby. Sometimes I literally talk ""baby talk"" (like ""goo goo gaga"" type stuff), and once that was followed by screaming for ""mama"" but I didn't feel very scared... just thought it was interesting. Other times words like what a toddler would say spontaneously pop into my head and I say them out loud, usually along with hiding under a blankie and crying like a sad toddler. Another time, all within the same episode, I did the baby talk, toddler talk/crying, and then some 12-year-old stuff. Has anyone heard of something like this that goes with anxiety or panic?"
"Age regression during anxiety/panic? Anxiety doesn't typically come with age regression as a feature of straight anxiety. Perhaps something else could be going on in addition to the anxiety. Have you considered seeing a therapist to work through what might be going on for you? It might be worth you seeing if you relate to the Dissociative Experience Scale: dissociative-identity/topic65082.html You might not... But what you described made me think of how it's like to experience co-consciousness with another part. Keep in mind I'm heaps biased though given that I have a dissociative condition. If you really want to know what is going on, the best thing to do is always going to be to consult a professional... In a way, I am not defined by my dissociation. In a way, I am.

"Age regression during anxiety/panic? Thanks for this reply. I've been seeing a therapist for a few months but she has only mentioned panic attacks. Once the possibility of past trauma came up when I had a spontaneous screaming episode but I don't have any memories of trauma (don't have many memories of home life at all before age 12-13...i thought it was all happy, but now I wonder...) I hadn't considered alters b/c I don't dissociate or lose time, but I wasn't aware of co-consciousness... in a way that idea kindof fits. What is that like exactly? Before each episode I get this feeling like something wants to come up and out of me, but I need complete privacy and to sort of let the feeling take over my brain and emotions. If I let it (and have privacy), then the words start coming and my voice says them out loud, as if from a second brain that I never knew I had. But my ""regular brain"" is always still present, and I think I could suppress the words and feelings if I wanted to. Can people with alters do that? My impression was that alters come out uncontrollably and They are more ""separate"" from one's primary self. I'm too embarrassed to ask the therapist about this... i'm pretty functional overall and I think she (T) thinks I over-interpret stuff."
"Anxious about GP increasing medication+Self-Esteem Issues. Hi everyone, So I have GAD, Hypochondria and Obsessive thoughts as well as a few compulsions and I'm on SSRI's for my various anxiety disorders and it's been brilliant and i'm only on 10mg a low does and I have been for months and it's been great but both my GP and my Psychiatrist said that they think I should increase it to 15 mg but that really worries me for a variety of reasons I have put on 8 kg's because of the medication & I hate myself, I was already very unhappy about my weight and was trying to lose some but now I have to lose even more & I can't seem to lose any. Im scared increasing the medication will make me gain even more. I have considered purging or not eating, which I know is a bad idea. Im anxious about taking my medication in general so I hate any kind of change around it. Im afraid I will get side effects. Im especially TERRIFIED of developing Serotonin Syndrome which is deadly I thought I was doing ok, I have been heaps better so I didn't think I'd need to increase it. I will admit I have still been anxious and on top of all of my other anxieties some new obsessive and intrusive thoughts have been occurring, for example I got house plants in my room and I'm afraid that they will cause me to suffocate or hurt me at night because they respire and release carbon dioxide and use oxygen. Im also afraid that putting hoodies under the door (I do this to make a barrier so spiders can't crawl under the door while I sleep, I'v been doing it for over a year) will cause me to suffocate in my sleep from a lack of oxygen. So I can see why they think we should increase it, however I have been doing much better than when I wasn't. Also I have been feeling really bad about myself mainly due to my weight and hips & stomach. I have considered not eating or throwing up, which I know is a bad idea, I'm a psych student so I understand how quickly it can develop into mental health issues, but I hate my body and I haven't bought new clothes in 2 years because nothing fits and I cry and have a breakdown everytime I go shopping for clothes becuase I feel increadibly fat and nothing i want fits or suits my body so I have given up. So I just cry in change rooms get in a bad mood and want to die so I just complain and go home and be miserable. Sorry about that I just needed a rant I think"
"Can’t stop quitting work Hey guys this is my first post. I’m new to the forum. A quick background about me is I have suffered from debilitating anxiety since I was middle school. Even as a child I was extremely shy and anti social so unsure if it goes back that far but middle school is when I really noticed it affecting my life. Fast forward to November of last year when I had a nervous breakdown and because of it lost my job. I was absent a lot or left early. I just couldn’t keep focusing on work. I wasn’t happy, I got divorced in 2015 and ever since I’ve dealt with a very vindictive narcissistic ex who would do anything it seems to hurt me and take my money. We have a 3 year old little girl between us. I’m a very loving father and I wanted the family she didn’t. Well anyway at the time my ex was dating someone who’s been in and out of jail and was just a bad guy and I didn’t want him around my daughter. The stress of untreated anxiety and panic disorder toppled with that just drove me to a nervous breakdown. I was in and out of the hospital 3 times in one month. Since I have been put on an anti depressant for the first time as I have refused ever since and it has worked wonders. My anxiety is almost entirely under control however I do not understand and this brings me to the point of this post....ever since my nervous breakdown I can’t stick with any jobs. I have quit 2-3 at this point this year. I don’t seem to stay longer then 2-3 months. I currently work from home and believe it or not I’m still feeling like I can’t stay. I’m already so close to quitting and it’s only been 2 months since I started. Don’t get me wrong I really like my job but I still somehow can’t make myself take calls all day. It’s like I can’t take being stuck behind the desk all day taking customer calls when I could spend the day doing what I want like spending time with my daughter basically just being happy doing what I want. I’m not sure if it’s anxiety or Work aversion which of course is related to being burned out. I want a job I can drive around and be free not stuck behind a desk taking call after call. I think I’m burned out possibly but to better explain how I feel it’s like this.... All of a sudden last week I was hit with the impulsive feeling that's been with me since I was 15. I wanted to quit my job and just go, run. It's a feeling I've had so many times I can't remember. I don't want this to sound like i'm lazy or have a bad work ethic because I don't but schedules and the responsibility of life have always made me filled with anxiety, extreme depression, and impulsive behaviors. It drives me crazy that I feel this way. I'm 25 and I've quit every single job I've had within the first 6 months (sometimes the first week) and the longest job i've ever had was 2 years, although I was miserable and somehow made myself do it. As I'm typing this I've called into work for the 2nd day in a row because I couldn't even bring myself to go (i've surprised myself that I called in and didn't just quit). It fills me with complete dread just thinking about going. I've tried to explain this to people in the past but when I feel this way it's almost like there's an invisible wall that's blocking me from going. Maybe like an invisible wall in my head that just won't let me do what I have to do because I'll put it through the anguish of dealing with it. Honestly I don't know....I guess I'm so upset because I thought things were actually going better and than this impulsiveness comes right back and seems to ruin everything as usual. I can't even talk myself through it anymore. It completely overtakes my mind and I just want to run. I even ruin good opportunities and jobs because normally 3 months into it I become so depressed, bored, and anxious that quitting is the only time I feel relief. But than it's a never ending cycle and at this moment I feel more lost than I ever have. I don't know if I'm looking for advice or just needing a community to vent to but I do know I need help."
"Can't find help anywhere. Hi, I'm new around here. I was diagnosed with panic syndrome earlier this year, and I had to take antidepressants for about 2 months, but I stopped for fearing becoming addicted. Since then the panic attacks are no longer so intense, but the ""anxiety"" persists. My symptoms are as follows: - Light chest pain during the crisis - Muscle tension, especially near the veins - Tiredness and body pains - Pressure around the head, as if they were squeezing my skull - Lack of appetite and stomach pain This symptom is more recent, but I also can sense a strange smell every time I get a little nervous. It's not necessarily a bad smell, it's just weird, and it gets much worse when I'm preparing food. Thanks to this, and the pains in the stomach, I lost a lot of weight in the last few months. My blood pressure is always great, and I've had blood tests, but no problem at all. All the doctors (I've seen many) have come to the conclusion that it's anxiety, but still, I can not convince my brain of that. Nowadays I'm better because I've been forcing myself to leave the house and being surrounded by people makes me feel safer (if something bad happens, someone can take me to the hospital) but when I'm alone for too long, it's terrible. I would really appreciate your help. I'm moving out of my mom's house in 2018 and I'm gonna have to live on my own because I'm going to college, so I can't go on like this. I didn't want to depend entirely on medicine either, but what do you guys suggest? I really can't find help anywhere else."
"Upper Legs muscles cramp only when sleeping I’m going on 7 weeks of the weirdest symptoms. I’ve been to my primary Dr, a sports medicine Dr and a Sleep Dr and none can confirm what’s going on. I see an Neuro Muscular Dr on Monday. This issue is only when I sleep so it’s not induced by body position. Once I fall asleep, I wake up every 1.5-2.0 hours every night and always on that schedule. I haven’t had one night making it 3 straight hours. When I wake up, my upper legs are really tight and when I straighten them they spasm and the cramp releases and I can go right back to sleep. This pattern continues night after night. I’ve tried everything, epsom salt baths, quinine, thc, CBD, prescription muscle relaxers, warm baths, stretching, foam roller, heat pad, ice…you name it and I’ve tried it. Has anyone heard of this before and have any suggestions that I can ask the neurologist about on Monday? I’ve also had sporadic muscle twitching since last March, 2022 but don’t have any muscle weakness. Thank you for any help."
"Upper Legs muscles cramp only when sleeping I'm really sorry to hear about your ongoing struggle with these symptoms. It's great that you have an upcoming appointment with a Neuro Muscular Dr – hopefully, they can provide some answers and solutions. It's important to share all your symptoms, including the muscle twitching, with them. Hang in there, and I hope you find some relief soon."
"Sleeping with knees upwards they fall & then upwards again. I need help and I can´t find any response on the web and I am thinking of going to a sleep disorder doctor, but first I wan´t to know why nobody seems to have this. Let me explain: My girlfriend tends to press her teeth while sleeping and suddenly in the middle of the night while she is sleeping she brings one knee up after 1min or so the knee keeps bending down land down when her knee is completely straight she brings the knee back again up, she doesn´t notice and she feels tired and never remembers a dream and she feels she has no rest. I am very worried because lately she is low on energy and its like she doesn´t rest. I need help does anybody know why is this I looked all over the internet and I just found one paragraph about bending knees upwards but there is only the description but no info the call it: MATTERHORN position but i am not sure. Thank you very much I would be very happy if somebody could help me I am very worried."
"Sleeping with knees upwards they fall & then upwards again. Look up ""restless leg syndrome"". It's possible GF has this problem. Had an uncle who was a mailman all his life and drove a USPS jeep with the community mail. The jeep was stickshift back in the day and he re-enacted the clutch-accelerator thing with both legs at night-time in his sleep, my aunt told me. Btw, it's the GF who needs to see a sleep disorder doctor, not you. Although you're probably not getting much sleep either with a restless sleeper ofc."
"Sleeping with knees upwards they fall & then upwards again. An old post, but for anyone who comes across it, I once awoke from sleep with one arm being held straight up into the air from my prone position. Have no idea why, or if I do that a lot. I've also woken while making odd noises. We do weird things in our sleep.... **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Sleeping with knees upwards they fall & then upwards again. I often find that I sleep with both my arms hugging my knees. Like fetal position, on my side. And the sleep is very uncomfortable this way. I find that I wake up but is still tired. It is very exhausting."
"Loud noises when falling asleep Exploding Head Syndrome https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploding_head_syndrome Anyone else ever experience that? I can't say for sure, but I believe it has happened to me. I was drifting to sleep, while very short on sleep, and while under similar conditions I've often experienced Hypnic Jerks, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk I've never experienced this before. It was as if a small-caliber handgun had been fired near my head. Very jarring and startling. Can't say I cared for it. I looked around to see if something had burst, but so far I've found no evidence that anything untoward happened. Failing any physical evidence, and the fact that the sound sounded very close to my head, I can only suppose that it was the syndrome. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Fearful of Falling Asleep?? Somniphobia. Do you like being in a mania or hypomania state? But when you go to sleep it could all end waking up with Manic Depression. Here's my story how I became fearful of falling asleep or Somniphobia. I've been off my meds and when this happens, I usually get manic or experience hypomania in which I can do anything even elevate to a higher consciousnesses. I vibrate at a high frequency’s that will make electronics go haywire. I can even start to manifest certain things into my life. However just like everything else what has a beginning must have an end. When it ends, its so over and I mean it’s over to the point of complete opposites. I can no longer be that sharp witty employee or do the important things in my life like cooking food or paying my bills or anything that requires the slightest bit of energy. I won't clean my house or go grocery shopping or even talk on the phone. I get stuck in bed for days and everything I worked on comes to a complete stop. This makes me feel inadequate or being a big failure. Lately my depression has gotten worse and the sad part is I never know when exactly it will happen. Sometimes I wake up feeling so horrible that it’s easy to say I wish I was dead than to feel like this. Then one-night it hit me. If I just don't go to sleep it will continue perhaps for one or two more days. With my mind going into a racing thoughts mode, its easy to stay on this pace even if I try to sleep, I can't because I'm just to wound up. The first time I tried it, wow it worked just like I thought. The next morning I was a little slow but after a good breakfast and some juice I was right back on track. I didn’t feel bad I felt great. So now its been 6 months and I try to stay awake for a least one or two more days then the following night. When I do I go to sleep its very late and only with the help of my night meds. I ran out of my night meds so now It's going to be a very bumpy road with the possibility of a complete breakdown. Not knowing how depressed I’m going to feel, how long, or how intense it will be. I'm borderline psychotic now from a lack of sleep. I want to say I'm thinking clearly but I'm not able to make sound judgements. I not too worried because I'm the king of procrastination. So far that’s what has worked for me in my life. Just let go and Let God."
"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Something Else? My ""tired spells"" started about 2 years ago. I remember I would be fine and normal but then randomly get very very tired for about 2-3 weeks in a row. This happened infrequently and it wasn't that inconvenient in the beginning. But then a year had passed and it suddenly got really really bad for about 2 entire months. I couldn't do anything because I was so sleep. I slept about 15 hours a day, and wanted to go to sleep whenever I was actually awake. One time I couldn't even walk because I was so tired. My mom asked me if I could bring her something from the kitchen and I cried because I realized I couldn't. But then it eventually went away. And now it's back again. Just as bad as that time. Right now I am so freaking tired. I sleep nonstop. I've missed school and I've refused to go places just because I feel like I'm about to drop dead. I've been wanting to go to the bookstore today so badly, but I feel like if I drive, I'll get in a car wreck for being so tired. Last night I did drive and I felt really off, I almost asked my mom if she could drive on the way back. I can't even do fun things. It's so hard to read(which I love doing). I can't pay attention to TV shows. Studying? Impossible. It just sucks. It's not worth it."
"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Something Else? Definitely discuss this with your physician. CFS is difficult to diagnose and wouldn't be my first guess. The doctor has to rule out many other possibilities before any CFS diagnosis can be made. Did anything significant happen 2 years ago that might have brought this on? Any major event, lifestyle, health or medication change? You may be asked to take part in a 24-hour diagnostic sleep study. It could just be depression. Get checked out. Best of luck to you.

"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Something Else? *** WARNING *** This is only my experience I was misdiagnosed more than once, but eventually I solved it. Notice I said I solved it and not my doctor. Thats when I realized sometimes, they are just practicing medicine and we need a second opinion. I just like you would fall asleep in the middle of the day or right after I woke up and sporadically. I was experiencing Chronic Fatigue, on and off for several years. Going back and forth to the doctors without ever knowing what it was. It was possible to be my Thyroid as I was hypothyroidism, Iron deficiency, poor diet, ungulated sleep routine, Depression, and yes, they told me it could be psychosomatic. But the truth was no of these. I experienced it so bad that I started to juice and go towards a plant base diet. It helped a little but still didn't stop it from happening.

"Sweating, paralysis, vivid dreams, Brain fog Hi, I'm really hoping someone can help me get to the bottom of my sleep issue. I'll start off saying I have had some of these symptoms on and off for a few years like occasional clusters of night sweats, vivid dreams and I've struggled with excessive day time sleepiness since I was about 14, but only gotten worse as I've gotten older. (26 now) It went from a day nap after school to now I can spend all day and night in and out of sleep without feeling much better. I could get a full 8- 12 hours sleep then a few hours later be so tired I can't keep my eyes open and have to go back to bed. Over the last 8 months things have taken a complete nose dive though. I've been back and fourth the doctors for blood tests and a chest xray but they are all coming back fine and there last option is to lower my antidepressants as they think it could be them causing the worsening issues but I'm not so convinced. I've been waking up every 4 hour without fail, then a few hours later falling back asleep. Almost every time I sleep I have vivid dreams/ sometimes nightmares/ sometimes nothing but the most troubling thing is I'm wake up drenched in sweat, feeling weak and unable to move. I feel almost like I'm stuck between wake and sleep, unable to pull myself out of bad dreams properly, mentally I feel terrible, groggy, disorientated with brain fog which lasts up to 30 minutes. My limbs are heavy and limp and take all my energy to move, I feel woozy and loose my balance and feel not myself and almost euphoric. I wake up craving sugar too. Recently I've started waking up with my feet and hands all contourted but interlocking so it's even harder to move which doesn't help the horrible feeling of waking up drenched in sweat. Sweating from my neck, chest and all down my legs. I've tried changing loads of things to see if anything helps but it hasn't, I tried eating very healthy for 6 months straight, I changed what time I eat so not to eat several hours before sleeping, tried eating before bed, reducing sugar, eating more sugar incase it was hypoglycaemia, quit smoking. I don't do drugs, occasionally drink alcohol, don't drink tea, coffee or energy drinks, only water. I have light bedding designed to be cooling, silk pillow, light cotton pjs and shorts even with no clothes on, windows open in winter, even at different houses and I still have the same issues almost constantly. I'm more exhausted since not being able to sleep longer that 4 hours and with all the sweating it's draining and getting my mental health down. I have thought maybe I have narcolepsy for the last few years due to all the day time sleepiness but the doctors haven't looked into it or anything else sleep disorder related. As a kid I always struggled getting to sleep and suffered nightterrors which I still occasionally get. I used to be a very active kid who would function off 4 hours sleep but since my teenage and 20s things just keep getting worse and I don't know what's causing what and if I'll ever sleep properly again. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!"
"Muscle twitching, bod twitches during sleep Hi! I’ve noticed my husband when he’s sleeping he will have muscle twitches /slight body movements during sleep like every 5 minutes, but subsides through the night. I notice more when he’s been stressed or has lots is anxiety (2020) has been tough. Anyway...any advice on this? Everything worries me on google. Thanks!"
"Muscle twitching, bod twitches during sleep I don't Google anything, I'll have everything under the sun wrong with me. If I am short on rest, and under stress (which the stress part is a lot of the time for me) I will have trouble falling asleep sometimes, for all the muscle twitches.

"Sudden Nausea as I fall asleep... For a year now I have been plagued by nausea that accompanies the onset of sleep. I can go to bed feeling perfectly normal, no anxiety, no nausea, nothing. Then as soon as I drift off I am jolted awake by a pang of nausea. Over and over and over. Has anyone experienced this before? My doctors have no idea what to do with me..."
"Sudden Nausea as I fall asleep... If the doctor's can't find anything, ask to be referred to a specialist. Did anything notable change for you a year ago? Common things could be esophageal issues like GERD or acid-reflux. Sometimes I get that a few minutes after laying down. Much depends on what I eat or drink before going to bed. A cold glass of seltzer will give that 'burp' of relief and I can go back to bed. There was a time when I would get bed-spins. Especially after bouts of alcohol use. It was very disorienting and I would vomit before I could make it to a wastebasket in the dark. There has to be an answer for this. Best of luck to you.

"Sleep problems I’ve been struggling with sleep since I was in high school. I’m almost 21 now so it’s been a long time having to deal with this. My main problem is the excessive sleepiness during the day. No matter how hard I try I cannot stay awake during the day. At night, even if I have forced myself to stay awake all day, I can’t seem to fall asleep at night. However it isn’t like this all the time and I can fall asleep at night sometimes. In the car or if I am sitting for long periods of time, I have definitely nodded off and fallen asleep for a few mins. Another thing I have been struggling with is constant nightmares. Not scary or unrealistic nightmares either, my nightmares always include people I know and they are scarily realistic situations. I have dealt with some traumatic events in the past couple years so I thought maybe my PTSD is making things worse. I also have had depression for years (specifically Dysthymia or chronic depression). I have tried so many times to correct my sleep schedule but no matter what I do I still get so tired during the day. I know I have to ask my doctor about it but I wanted some opinions before I go."
"Sleep problems Definitely get your doctor's opinion. If you haven't had a thorough physical with chemistry lab work, that may show some serum numbers skewed. Rule out any physical things, like high or low test numbers first. Have your doctor refer you on to a specialist, if necessary. You might consider a sleep study where you are monitored during sleep phases for anomalies. Sugar, carbs, salt, tobacco and alcohol, etc before bedtime can affect sleep. Complete darkness, silence and deep breathing before drifting off to slumber helps me. Intense dreams can leave me shaken the first part of the next day as well. I had some very realistic dreams when I was undergoing some major life changes. They aren't as disturbing now as they once were. Best of luck to you.

"Why don't I dream? I've have several back-to-back tragedies for 10 years or more. I use to dream very vivid dreams then about 9 to 10 years ago (when the cycle of events started) I had TERRIBLE nightmares - actually more than nightmares - night terrors. For the past year or more, I have no dreams at all (or don't recall having dreams). I don't even recall even a fragment of dreams. I even asked my husband if I talk in my sleep or mumble - nothing. I'm grateful the night terrors have stopped but I miss not dreaming. I'm a very creative person and love art, metalsmith work and hot glass work. I use to dream so vividly it would inspire me to create things - nothing. The practical side of my brain wonders if I'm simply blocking dreaming out because I was so fearful of sleep when I had night terrors. Anyone know why someone stops dreaming?"
"Why don't I dream? Oooh, a fellow metalsmith. I had years when I had no dreams. I mean I possibly did have dreams, but I didn't remember them. Then I had a period of very vivid dreams. The medication I was on affects my dreams (for instance, quetiapine as sleeping aid = super technicolor amazing dreams that I was looking forward to all evening, but lamictal + diazepam = dumb dreams about nothing, still, lots of them, zopiclon = no dreams at all). Can you think of a trigger for this change? Like, you got on or off some medication? Change in your caffeine intake? Substance use? Sports? Currently working on my upcoming signature."
"Why don't I dream? Usually, we wake up in the morning during REM sleep. That's the best time to remember your dreams. You have to train yourself to remember the dream you were having as you were waking up. If you wait even a minute, you won't be able to recall your dream. I became interested in lucid dreaming and began to do this. If you write down the dream in a dream log, it's even better. Just remember to think about what you were dreaming the instant you wake up and spend a few quiet minutes reviewing your dream. I'm not sure, but I think I've read that everyone dreams, but some people just don't remember them. Try it and see if it works for you."
"Why don't I dream? Apparently, even though you do not remember, you DO dream, but you just do not remember the dreams. I have never remembered any dream, in all my life, which tends to p!$$ me off, so it is nice to find that I am not the only one. I did read somewhere that to remember your dreams, you have to up your vitamin intake of...a certain vitamin, but I cannot remember what it is. How is your memory? If that is doing OK, then you must be dreaming, my memory is NOT doing OK, and I do not know if that is due to the lack of dreams, or the stroke that I had 20 years ago...or the alcohol from 10 years before the stroke. Although, a long time ago, I did have an exceptionally good memory, and I was not remembering dreams then."
"Why don't I dream? SlickSleep wrote: Your sleep goes through different stages throughout the night. Generally, most of your dreams occur during REM sleep, but can also be present during other phases. So it may be that you are not spending many periods in REM sleep. I agree with this. Get a sleep study because you need REM sleep."
"Why don't I dream? I think you need to use sleeping earplugs it will block all the sounds and help you to sweet dreams. I was suffering from sleep apnea; that is why I never do deep sleep. Without deep sleeping, a human being cannot survive a healthy life. So we need to seep well. Otherwise, we will suffer a lot of problems like depression, high blood pressure, increase cholesterol and much more. That is why I want to use a sleeping earplugs to give deep sleep. I found a couple of websites on google and I want to share here so that you guys can see them and suggest me what would be good for me? https://www.bigearinc.com/products/best-earplugs-for-sleeping https://hacktosleep.com/best-earplugs-for-sleeping"
"sleep terrors Because I have intense sleep terrors almost every night, I dread going to sleep. I don't remember having nightmares, but I will wake myself up screaming, and my heart will be racing. Before I fully wake up, I have a feeling of dread, like I am dying. The worst ones have been when I have gotten out of bed and ran or screamed uncontrollably over and over. I have tried numerous OTC remedies such as Benadryl and Melatonin, and the neurologist has prescribed Lunesta, which worked for a few months, and then didn't anymore. I'm desperate for a ""cure."" Not only am I frightening family members, I feel exhausted in the morning."
"Hypnagogic hallucinations (waking nightmares) For those who don't know, these are weird hallucination-dream or nightmare type things (lol not good at explaining it) that happen just as you're about to fall asleep...they can be auditory or visual, but for me they're just visual. I often see bugs or spiders - and it's almost hyperrealistic, and I panic, might scream, turn on the light, see that it's not there & I'm shaking for up to 2 hours afterwards and then I have to sleep with the light on all night. It's terrifying and really inconvenient. I'm starting to think that's why I prefer sleeping during the day, because it's not nearly as intense in daylight. I just want it to stop. I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who has had a problem with these now or in the past, and how I can get rid of them."
"Hypnagogic hallucinations (waking nightmares) I get these sometimes, especially when I come out of an episode of sleep paralysis. Mine are usually flashing lights, but I did once still see a man in black stood at side of me when awake which eventually faded! Bit scary! This morning I woke up from a bad nights sleep and there was a brown shape in front of my bedroom door. My 2 yr old son had woke up crying in the next room, so I just ignored it and walked through it I think you just have to change your mindset and think ""I haven't got time for this hallucination"""
"Hypnagogic hallucinations (waking nightmares) I usually have those when: 1-I'm not ""covered"" when I fall asleep 2-go to bed very late (at the stage when it's so late that one ends up feeling wide awake) 3-have trouble falling asleep. for me it usually involves someone being in room touching me or some sharp noise/light in my room. however I've had some hallucinations of family members (living 100s of miles away) running into my room to ask for something. at some point, I was afraid of going to bed because of the hallucinations. however, trying to avoid the 3 points mentioned above has reduced the frequency of the hallucinations. I hope this helps note: even though I agree that this is a disturbing phenomenon, I believe it would be unnatural if the phenomenon stopped occurring on a permanent basis"
"Hypnagogic hallucinations (waking nightmares) I think I just had one of these, it's so creepy and real. I woke up and three people were standing together holding hands dressed in all black saying something I couldn't make out, and I just stared at them for a while freaking out, and after like 20 seconds I looked away and then back and they were gone. My heart is still racing, it's so real."
"Hypnagogic hallucinations (waking nightmares) I've hallucinated mainly during hypnopompic states. Those have all been pleasant or just neutral experiences. Can't call them nightmares. So far the most interesting thing I've seen was this brightly shining, golden pyramid shaped drawer that was rotating in the air. Seen huge spider webs and snakes on the walls etc. Most recent hypnopompic hallucination I experienced when I tried to catch a bug… and then I eventually realised there wasn't any bug (maybe after 30 sec or so)."
"Hypnagogic hallucinations (waking nightmares) slither wrote: Usually when this happens, I see thoughts as written words, like in book in front of my eyes, whether they're open or not. It's always gibberish and I can never remember any of it. I had a dream and was able to remember specific details; I was in a store (may hve been goodwill), there was a computer case with 7th gen core i7 written on it. That's relevent because I was lucid and I'm a system builder, that built a system with an i7 950 (I think this cpu's 1st gen core i7)."
"Is there a solution for delayed sleep phase syndrome? Greetings folks. I really need some help with Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) which seems to be getting worse. Sleep time is now 6 - 8am so you can imagine, this is making life very difficult indeed. I have trawled the internet looking for answers and I'm just wondering if anyone has ever been 'cured' of this, and if so, how? There are lots of descriptions of symptoms out there by fellow-sufferers (which are almost a carbon copy likeness of my symptoms...which is reassuring) but very few actual answers or effective solutions! I was diagnosed by a specialist sleep clinic, but unfortunately they are being.....well, politeness stops me from finishing that sentence. They have put me on melatonin which I've been taking for about a year and have prescribed funky yellow sunglasses which cut out blue light. I have tried staying awake all night, I've tried setting punishing alarms to wake me up, Ive tried using a light box, but none of these things helped at all. I am taking medication for sleep (and other things), chiefly zopiclone, which helps, but doesn't knock me out - the stubbornness of the resistance to going to bed always wins. I'm thinking that some sort of schedule plus all the above, plus self-discipline might hold a solution somehow but I can't work it out. (Honestly, I'm not that good at self-discipline but am getting desperate.) The only other approach I've read about is just to give in to it & lead a nocturnal existence. I don't want to give up on this though, as it's seriously curtailing my opportunities for a fulfilling life. I have several co-morbid conditions, the worst of which being Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (M.E), sleep apnoea (now well-controlled by CPAP) and Emotionally Unstable (Borderline) Personality Disorder, which manifests itself as anxiety and depression. I have been on anti-depressants for years and my GP is being very helpful re meds at the moment and we are trying other meds to try to control anxiety & mood swings. (The Community Mental Health Team are useless.) I have finally found a good, long-term counsellor/therapist who I see every week & she really is brilliant. I think I have achieved more recovery in the 9 months I've been seeing her than I have for years, so I have hope there. Anyway - please forgive the length of this post but I wanted to give as much relevant background info as possible. I am prepared to do pretty much anything to sort this but I'm really not sure how to proceed. Thank you for reading this and many thanks in advance for any help you can give. Best wishes Wayne."
"Trying to figure out if this is from psych issue or... physiological... Hi all, I dont think Ive ever posted on this site but I lurked around a lot before finally making an account a few months back and now I have a question... I have multiple psych conditions including... Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, CPTSD, OCD, Agoraphobia, and Major Depressive Disorder. Lately... like the last month... ive been sleeping ridiculous amounts and im still exhausted. I dont know what's going on and am unable to get a therapist and psychiatrist for atleast another 4 weeks due to an insurance change (I was recently declared Seriously Mentally Ill and in my state they then put you on an integrated insurance program that combines physical health and psych health - it takes time to get it all activated and such though.) Basically my sleep habits have looked like this: sleep 9 hours, up 4, sleep another 6, up 36 hours, sleep 6 hours, up 3 hours, sleep 18 hours, up 2-5 hours, sleep 3-5 hours, up another 36-48, sleep another 15... continue on and on and on. Im waking up in sweats, nauseous, anxious, and exhausted. Before this started I had about 5-6 months of such vivid dreams I couldn't tell when I was awake vs asleep, which was frightening. Now those dreams are completely gone, im not getting stuck in dreams like I was - the cycle of falling asleep, dreaming, waking up in another dream, then another, then another. But now it's like I cant get any actual rest? I thought I was just really depressed, my living situation is currently less than ideal so I thought that was it.... but this seems like more than depression (which Ive been dealing and struggling with for over 20 years.) I dont know if Ive made any sense... im just at a loss... ive googled and tried to force myself to only sleep a certain amount of time but then I just fall asleep sitting up... Ive tried forcing a schedule but then I just lay in bed all night ""trying"" to sleep and not actually doing it. Ive always had issue sleeping at night but nothing this severe. Im not on any medication; previously I was on prozac, risperidone, trazodone, and benadryl. Im open to any and all suggestions, thoughts, ideas... I appreciate anyone reading this. Thanks again all, Neiko"
"Extremly Vivid Dtreams for ADHD and Bipolar Howdy! I dont take medicine as I can function very well and I can for the most part control my bipolar. I was wondering if anyone else has extremely vivd dreams aswell like if it was a youtube video it would be easily 1080P. My dreams are normally extremely weird and jumpy with sometimes it being mundane and other times it being fantasy. I cant really explain some dreams due to how jumpy they are but lately ive been able to ""control"" my dreams. For example when I wake up if I enjoy it enough I can easily fall back asleep with the same ""theme"" , but sometimes it jumps to another ""scene"". I can control myself in the dreams and it feels like im ""in there"" not just waking up and remembering. I've never questioned if a dream really happened and accept that they are just dreams. I can easily remember in vague detail dreams i've had over two years ago better than some events in my life. Is this normal? I recently registered here because last night I had the most vivid dream ive ever had to the point where I could hear the snow crush beneath my feet and see the snow fall as well as having a superhero fight(think Avengers civil war) were it was that everyone was fighting not just me if that makes any sense? I do get bad dreams rarely but when I do I can always manage to talk to it and manage to turn it into more of a weird dream than a nightmare. Am I normal or should I be concerned that this is a sign for something worse?"
"Extremly Vivid Dtreams for ADHD and Bipolar Hi Deku1233! Congrats that you can control your bipolar without taking meds. Of course I am curious what you are doing to control it. I am F25.8 Yes, I have very vivid dreams myself, high resolution, dolby surround and technicolor and even smells Additionally I have a body in my dreams most of the time, and of course I feel its position and moves and the haptic input and temperature. Sometimes this dreams are very hard to explain because magical things happen with changing perspectives, structures and twisting plots. Sometimes I have a bit of control, but that is not always the case, especially if the plot is about conflict, which I have very often. And yes, I can continue my dreams after a short time of being awake. Sure, the are „only“ dreams, but they determine my mood and in fact I need some time to get ready for the day, and I have flashbacks during the day. I think it is the wrong question to ask if that is „normal“. Some people remember their dreams, some don’t. Most people would wish they could remember them. You can train that to a little extent. Somewhat it is a gift. I would not worry if it does not affect your everyday stuff in a negative way. It is nice you can turn a nightmare into something else. I have read that is a advanced technique for lucid dreamers. So it is cool you can do it, others need years to get there. There are dream interpretation groups, I am sure they would be happy to have you! My therapist offers such a group where people share their dreams and get a psychological interpretation from her. Possibly that is something you would enjoy too. I am sure there are such groups on the web as well. My fav dream, about 8 months old: I was a walrus, escaping from an inuit hunter by swimming into a cave of an iceberg Sorry I have no interpretation for that, but it felt good to be such a strong and successful creature… Do not worry, I think everything is alright. Do you want to share a dream here? Could be fun to have a thread for it, eh?"
"Extremly Vivid Dtreams for ADHD and Bipolar Dream 3/4 2018-7-16 tan I have a job to do. There are about twenty plastic bags filled with with 4 different types tiny bones (bird or mouse) all mixed together and I have to sort them to pick the scapula out. We are in a hall, the tables standing in a horseshoe arrangement, preparing for a party. People walk around, working on the decoration, the band is playing already in warm up mode, early guests are coming in. The scapulae are needed for the rhythm-machine, they need to be filled in a container from where they will drop out on a drum’s membrane. I am in a hurry, we will launch in a couple minutes. The room quickly fills up. I am late. The people disturb me. I need room for my bowls, but they put snacks and confetti and paper streamers on the tables. Someone moves around with a ladder to check the chinese lanterns overhead. My stuff keeps disappearing. People constantly take it away and store it in distant places. I am struggling, trying to keep a friendly face. I feel stressed. The rhythm machine will be used for the grand opening. I realize I will not be ready in time. The battle is lost. My partner comes over, it is time to get on our places. She pulls my sleeve in a gentle way. The band stops playing in the background. The people mumble in the sudden silence. The band leader looks at me and shrugs while I move over. The boss’s assistant comes by, I wave at him, he rises an eyebrow: „are we ready?“ „not at all, I can not work under such circumstances“ „too bad!“ He walks past me and disappears through the door of the office, closing the door behind him. Silence. Everybody stares at the office door. I am fatalistic. The worst case did come true. Suddelnly the door opens, and the band starts to play in forte. Everybody is on their feet now. Assistant and boss come out, wearing tuxes. They have weiqui bowls in their hands and shake them. The assistant wears the black stone bowl, and the boss the one with the white stones. The stones are not visible, but I know it nevertheless. They play the part of the machine that I failed to feed. After the tune the boss delivers a short speech. Everyone applauds. Champagne is served. The boss comes over to my seat. He asks: „How much did we pay you for the seven days around christmas? Anyway, I will cut that to three days because of your failure.“ I get angry and answer: „You know what, I am quitting. Obviously you can do all yourself. I feel my help is no longer needed“ „That’s all up to you, have a nice evening“ he replies and walks away. Obviously I have to leave now. I wake up."
Have no clue what it is.?!.. When i was a kid i used to have these strange episodes before i sleep...usually occur while im awake closing my eyes and focusing in the dark...when it occurs...i have very increase in focus with strong violent feelings like i became a different person for some time ..sounds and thought are amplified too much...i was afraid when it occured the first couple times...then when i grew up i kinda trigger it from time to time intentionally as a matter of curiosity...it could happen in the middle of the day if i had a chance to focus while having certain emotional frequency...is that a panic attack or terror episodes or something?!...even if i sometimes kinda enjoy its thriller!!!
"Have no clue what it is.?!.. As I drift into the twilight between asleep & awake, strange things and thoughts happen to me as well. My muscles can involuntarily kick and jerk and my mind can race with (inappropriate or disturbing) thoughts before I finally zonk out. It is a stage of sleep, or pre-sleep. A curiosity, but nothing to be concerned about IMHO. Best of luck to you. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"A mobile app for sleeping The app is about leading your breathing into the most relaxing state, so that you can fall asleep easily. It sounds to me that it is kind of stunning but making sense to me. But seems the app not released to App Store yet, you may search in google"
"Help Concerning Abnormal Sleep Test Readings Hello, My question - in reference to the machine(s) used to monitor an individual's sleep in a hospital setting - is this: Is it possible for the machine to register someone as being asleep when, in fact, they are very much awake? The motivation for my wanting - or, rather needing - to know this information can be understood by reading the following description of my experience of just such an event occurring: I have had problems with sleep for most of my life and, as a result, was hooked up to a machine to monitor my sleep while in a hospital several years ago. After laying in bed, waiting to fall asleep for around an hour or so, the study was interrupted by someone accidentally entering the room, directly after which I was informed that I had been awakened by the intrusion. I, however, contested this notion, because I had been awake the entire time - entirely aware of every little noise in and outside of the room; I had simply been in the same meditative-like state that I always put myself into when attempting to sleep. I have a lifetime of experience with being in this state, which I can stay in for hours without ever actually falling asleep at any time. While in this state, I am always completely aware of my surroundings, and I always appear to be asleep - to the degree that everyone who witnesses me in this state claims that I am mistaken about being asleep - as they are invariably ""positive"" that I had been asleep. The test-giver told me that there was no possible way the machine would read as if I was asleep if I had not been, and, upon giving a detailed and accurate account to them of all of the little noises that had occurred while I was registered as being asleep (i.e., I knew exactly how many pages she had flipped in her book, how many times she had coughed, and the entire content of each of the individual conversations that were going on down the hall from my room's closed door between nurses and patients - verbatim), she became quite frustrated with me, quickly escalating to a level of anger that included her acting rather childish, accusing me of lying, stopping the test entirely, and, much to my chagrin, completely refusing to finish the test. I had been admitted to the hospital due to symptoms that were related to sleep deprivation, so it was – at the very least - disheartening, when I was told that I should simply take extra sleep medication, as I was already prescribed a rather excessive nightly dose of two high-powered medications that target sleep disorders. I was given a prescription in accordance with the recommended increase in dosages and discharged without myself or my doctors having come any closer to finding an appropriate treatment for the my perpetual sleeplessness, or any indication as to what the underlying problem causing the disorder might have been."
"Help Concerning Abnormal Sleep Test Readings That is unfortunate. Was it a polysomnogram? Polysomnograms are the ones where they glue electrodes to your scalp and monitor your brain waves. If it was that, you could have been in a meditative state, which may look to an untrained or poorly trained person, like you were sleeping. A sleep specialist would be able to know the difference though. The person administering the test usually is not a sleep specialist though. They are usually a technician with a bachelor's degree. She probably got offended and became unprofessional. When i did a polysomnogram, the sleep specialist showed me the different stages of sleep i was in throughout the night and was able to point out disruptions in my sleep. They made medication decisions based on this information."
"Help Concerning Abnormal Sleep Test Readings I have read about this happening sometimes, where your brain waves are reading as if you are asleep but you feel like you're awake. This happened to me last month in the MSLT. My last nap started at 2 pm, which was the beginning of a pyrotechnic show downtown, and I remember hearing it and hoping that it wasn't going to completely throw off my nap tests, and being a little anxious about the distant explosions keeping me awake. Then when my results came back, it said my sleep latency for that nap had been 0 minutes So I'll bet that your meditative trying-to-sleep state was sending out brain waves that read as being asleep, just like my I'm-so-sleepy-all-the-time-even-when-there-are-literal-explosions-outside state."
"Is this normal? My wife can't resist sleepiness Hi everyone, I search around the internet but could not find any clear answer to the question I have. Here is the thing: my wife is a pretty active person, but every time she feels even just a little sleepy, she gives in, even if she is sitting at the desk, lays her head down and sleeps. It's stronger than her, I am not sure exactly how to describe it, but it's definitely not like a normal nap. Her eyes start closing without her apparently wanting to, things start mixing in her head at the point she doesn't get what I say anymore, and just starts sleeping. Even if she is standing, as soon as she feels the ""urge"" to sleep, she just sits or lays down, and sleeps. It's like she doesn't have control, or doesn't want to have control (quite often I complain to her cause it really seems she just wants to sleep cause it's ""too strong to resist"", even if something important needs to be done, or we are actively making projects or working) I am not sure if it's a case of sleep disorder, but if it can help, a couple times she kinda scared me in the night with a few cases of shouting (I believe), kicking me by moving too much and I think apnea (though I can't tell since I was just half awake when it happened). Most of the other times I saw her sleeping she was just normal, but these few cases made me wonder. It's getting frustrating since she wakes up at 8 every day and basically drops around 9pm even if she just stays in the office during the day, or has a relaxing one. It seems to be getting worse with the summer heat, so I wonder if it's related. As a side note, if she gets interested in something, even during the ""about to fall asleep"" phase, she just ""wakes up"" and doesn't sleep until, say, midnight. Boredom? Disorder? I would like to help her cause she feels frustrated too at times, especially if we watch a movie, or sorry if we have something important to do Looking for some insights from the experts Thanks in advance p.s. she is Japanese, and yes, they do sleep in the train too."
"Odd sleep behaviour Hi all, I've been experiencing some odd sleep behaviour for as long as I can remember, and I can't find a name for it/category. Hoping someone here might know what it's called. It disrupts my sleep often. So most nights, I awake to find my body in odd positions/doing odd things, such as; *one arm sticking straight up in the air, perpendicular to my body, as if its trying to balance there (my legs do this too) I often don't become fully awake/aware of the position I'm in until my arm falls & hits me in the face. *laying on my stomach, knees bend so feet are sticking up in the air. My feet are usually either rubbing together of hitting/bouncing off one another. Has anyone ever heard of anything like this? I used to have insomnia/sleep walk/night terrors as a child. 30yo female, formal Dx DID, aka 'me' .. 16 others"
"I can't sleep after interrupted hypnosis. I got hypnotized by a TV show in which a hypnotist was carrying out hypnosis experiment on people, then they asked watchers who want to try it on themselves. I did all as he was telling me. When I started to knock out, at this exact moment it scared me, so I managed to wake myself up somehow, becoming back conscious. And after this I can't sleep normally, because my heart beats faster when I'm starting to fall asleep or relax (like through slow breathing etc). I can't control this, nothing worries me when I go to sleep, but seems like my heart has another representation So I need to use sleeping medicine every day and to fall asleep without exactly relaxing my brain (or it will be beating fast like night and start to hurt so I'll wake up). It's like when I stay awake and active mentally my heart beats slower then when I relax, so I just wait being kind of alert until the medicine works and puts me into sleeping. Seems like I somehow reordered my natural relaxing program when that hypnosis happened and it still can't change back into normal, now I don't know what to do with it! It's been a year since this happened."
"How do I get energy ? I sleep about 8ish hours a day and I almost never have energy afterwards. I tried doing naps, but it doesn't work and just make me desoriented. My energy doesn't change, even if I sleep 4 hours, or 10. I'm pretty sure I have bad sleep habits. Someday I love everyone and I'm so joyful to be alive and that kind of stuff, but the other day I'm kinda bored with everything, I can't laugh and I'm too tired for everything and I hate most of the people around me."
"Why do I need so much sleep? I sleep more than the average person and I don't understand why. I'll try to explain. I work at a school so back in the spring my schedule was fine. I'd go to bed around 12am and get up at 8am for work. I would be really tired initially but wake up once in the shower, and I'd be okay until 12am. Then in the summer I did summer school and that started earlier, so I had to wake up at 7am for that. I felt zombie like and miserable all morning. It was only a half day so I'd come home around 1:30pm and need a nap. I would try to get to sleep earlier at like 11pm but I couldn't fall asleep until after 12am and I was miserable every morning getting up so early. It's like I'm the opposite of normal people, I can only go to sleep late and wake up late. Now I have a few weeks off before I start regular school again and I may be going to an earlier school in the fall. So I may have to get up at 6:30am starting soon. I'm worried about it. But now that I'm not working, I sleep way too late and I can't control it. Last night I went to sleep at around 2:30am, so I figured I'd be awake at 10:30am or so. No, I didn't wake up until 1pm. I had an alarm set for 9am but I hit snooze few times and I guess I accidentally turned it off. I don't want to sleep this late on my days off, too many sunlight hours wasted. I talked to my friend about it who's a morning person and she thought it was the weirdest thing, sleeping that late. She laughed and couldn't believe it. So why do I need so much sleep? Is there anyone else out there who goes through this too?"
"Why do I need so much sleep? I sleep a lot and feel sleepy when I get very emotionally tired. I also sleep a lot in autumn. My doctor prescribed me special pills, here is their description *mod edit*. These pills help me balance sleep, feel more active, improve my cognitive abilities, and also helps to concentrate and stay motivated.

"Unable To Sleep In One Cycle? Hi everyone. I’ve had quite a battle with sleep over the years that started during childhood. To keep this from being a novel, I’ll attempt to simplify how I have been in recent times and what appears to be my issue today. I worked an 8 AM to 5 PM shift as a night owl for over 12 years until recently. When working that schedule, I would function the best when taking a nap right after work at 5 PM – anywhere from 2-3 hours. I would then get back up and function well all the way through the end until going to bed. I was typically slow to rise, but would often be able to shake it off and was extremely productive this way. Why not just 8 hours in a row? Well, it seemed as if the longer time I slept in one setting, the worse I felt. The occasions when I would “crash” and go to bed in the early evening are the nights when I would wake up sore, dazed, confused, etc. These nights I could often recall dozen(s) of dreams over the course of the day. I realized that it seems the longer I sleep, the more I dream. The more I dream, to which many I remember, the more tired I am when I wake up – and I frequently wake up. I heard the argument for years that I needed to adjust my “sleep hygiene”, but it always failed me. Finally, I started another job in February of this year. I had to do different shifts at first, but now find myself on the shift I wanted – noon to 8:30 pm. I can now stay up as late as I want and sleep in. I never don’t get at least 6 hours of sleep; typically at least 8 hours of sleep. So now I’ve put the theory to the test. The crazy thing is I’ve been doing this since July, and I feel awful – and I believe it’s the same reason as before. I am getting too much sleep in one setting. I’ve never heard of this being an exact problem for anyone. I wake up with blood shot eyes, like I’ve been up all night or just finished doing drugs. It’s embarrassing. I am slow to rise, as I always am, but typically am able to shake it off as I get up and alert. Within a few hours, I’m in desperate need of caffeine to continue the day – now after getting adequate rest in one setting, which is how you are “supposed to do it”. I recorded myself sleeping last year, and I’ve found that I frequently swing my legs back and forth (I bend the knees, then swing my legs most often). I often talk, but I do not sleep walk. As I mentioned, I wake up often. I was in the middle of seeing a sleep doctor right before I left my old job, and I’m going to have to start the process all over as insurance kept denying a sleep study (That’s Blue Cross Blue Shield for you). Has anyone ever experienced this “deep sleep” phenomanon? I can recall so many dreams over the course of a day, particularly when I get a lot of sleep, that sometimes they are disturbing, sad, etc."
"Too sleepy to take my wake up meds? My sleep doc started me on Modafinil/Provigil a couple weeks ago, and it really helps me get through my day feeling more normal. The problem is, when I wake up, I'm soooo sleepy that I can't even pick my head up to take my meds until after a 2-hour wake up process, usually after 12 hours of sleep. So, that's not ideal. Anyone else experience this? Any tips?"
"Heart Jolt Upon Falling Asleep I have a cyclic issue that continues to plague me and I am at my wits end. It comes and goes, sometimes gone for long periods and sometimes stays for long periods. It's here now. When I get in bed and fall asleep, the moment as soon as I am asleep, I am JOLTED awake by what I perceive to be a heart attack. I know it's not a heart attack. But,I have the perception that my heart feels like it is completely stopped, I grab my chest to see if my heart is still beating, and my head feels startled and dizzy due to the extreme fear that I am now about to die. Then I calm down, and the process repeats itself on and on on every few minutes. If I am lucky, I finally fall asleep and stay asleep. Sometimes this goes on for hours and hours. I get angry, and have even cried after hours of these jolts and no sleep. No sweats, no racing heart, no gasping for air. Just a heart-jolt and fear, over and over again. Occasionally I will let out a scream of fear, as some of the jolts are particularity stronger than others. Again, when I finally do get to sleep, I sleep like a baby. When this issue rears its head, it is also usually accompanied with me being able to hear and feel every heartbeat as I lay in bed. I guess this is a form of palpitations? At work, during the day, no issues with palpitations, very little anxiety/depression anymore. This only happens as soon as I lay down to rest/sleep. I have changed so much over the past 15 years, cut out caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, all three for long periods of time. I have been on ant depressants, anti anxiety meds, had EKGs, I have had a sleep study and no apnea was identified. This issue seems to follow me despite all of this. Happens during naps, in cars and airplanes, hotels, and at home. I know as soon as it is here, as it has been the past week, it will one day be gone, and then back again. Any ideas?"
"Heart Jolt Upon Falling Asleep Just FYI, I had the same exact problem as yours, it came and went for several years. Have had EKG's come back normal, no sleep apnea either. One day I told my new GP about the problem as well as hot/cold body temp problems which came on recently. He immediately ordered a thyroid test, done from a drawn blood sample. Test results indicated low functioning thyroid and the doctor prescribed daily 50 mcg levothyroxine. Haven't had a problem with either the heart jolting at bedtime or the body temp fluctuations since. The thyroid hormones regulate heartbeat, body temp, among several other functions. When there's not enough thyroid hormones, the regulatory functions don't work well."
"Heart Jolt Upon Falling Asleep The ""jolt"" you are describing seems to be a hypnic jerk. Almost everyone experiences them at some point in their lives, but stress can lead to them being more common. I think you are scaring yourself so much to the point where the stress of them coming actually causes them to occur more often. It is also natural that you will be more aware of your heartbeat if you are really that terrified. Try to relax and remind yourself that nothing bad is going to happen to you as you sleep. It's not worth it."
"Weird dream Why do you think it must mean something? It just sounds like your average dream to me. Dreams are images created by your brain for you to focus on while you are unconscious - nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes stress can make us dream odd or bad things. Sometimes when we're in a good mood, our brains are more likely to create more pleasant dreams. But dreams in the end are still just dreams. It's not worth it."
"Always tired I am always tired no matter how early or how much I sleep. I always wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all, and throughout the day I'm tired and will sometimes nod off. I'm always yawning all day every and feel tired, I feel too tired to walk or talk or do anything most of the time. If I stand up after sitting for a while I get a headache and my head and body always feels heavy and tired. I also have dreams every single night, most of the time they're pretty scary and in my point of view."
"Always tired I would consider seeing a doctor or specialist in case there are any other underlying medical conditions that might be causing this such as chronic fatigue, however you also want to make sure you are getting good quality sleep. Are you waking up throughout the night? Sleeping in pitch black? Winding down before bed time? Have good sleep hygiene practices? Exercising too late? If you feel these are in check and you are getting deep sleep then definitely see a doctor and find out what else is going on."
"Always tired Hi there Scarynorwegian! I have been where you are. Let me first assure you that despite how difficult feeling tired can make things, with a little effort you can make a change. So try to stay calm during this period of difficulty in your life which WILL change. I have made a huge amount of effort to help myself when I was going through what you have (and believe me it was incredibly close to what you described - including nightmares). I did it basically because life is short and I want to enjoy it and live it at least at 50%, but not feeling at 2% every day. So the bad news is there is no magic pill for this (besides moving house if you believe you might be allergic to something in the house perhaps?). But the good news is that through consistent, focussed effort, you will narrow down and determine what works for you and what doesn't, to even get to the point where you are even sleepoing better than your friends and family! What have you tried? Who else do you feel comfortable asking for help? Have you had blood tests from the Dr / sleep study? Is your room cleaned regularly, and aerated at least twice a day? Does it have a funny smell? Have you visited a good Acupuncturist? (Might be a spleen energy deficiency - common cause of constant tiredness). What self-help books have you read? Now is the time to push, marshall your friends and family for help, don't feel bad to ask because at the very least once you've improved your sleep you can inspire other sufferers. Get it? YOU must get the ball rolling, the sooner the better. The change might not occur immediately, but it will, I promise. One thing in life to keep in mind is that ""all things shall pass"". So please, don't let it stresss you, look it in the face and tackle it!!"
"Afraid to sleep Going thru separation from spouse with PPD, separated from two teen kids too, who dont believe me, neither the in laws, think i am the only problem, hate me, no meaning in life, now 50.

White noise and ASMR for better sleep? I use a fan at night on high about 3 feet from me to mask the surrounding noises so I can sleep. If I don't any little creek or pop will keep me up. I have tried to use deep theta waves but it just did work.

"White noise and ASMR for better sleep? I used the hairdryer for some time, on cool settings, next to the bed. It was also connected to the device that cuts off power after some time (30 minutes, enough to fall asleep). Whenever I had anxiety during the night, I was turning it on again."
"Nightime urination and psych meds? I began requiring psychotropic meds at the age of 18 after an onset of depression, anxiety, etc. I also experienced an urge to urinate. After my psychological symptoms had become controlled, my urinary symptoms began to increase. I began to not only experience urinary frequency during the day, but also the need to wake up 1-2 times a night 4x per week. At the age of 24, my meds welexapro, buspar, and klonopin rather than ativan. At this point, waking up 1-2x per night was the norm and I began to suffer from nocturnal enuresis on a nightly basis. Soon after, around age 25, I was not only incontinent during the night, but began to become incontinent during the day, as well as waking up 5-8x per night to urinate. I have been to 8 urologists (2 of which were “wasted” appts given their unrelated urological specialties that I was not made aware of, along with extra charges that were too much to pay) 1 neurologist, and 2 endocrinologists who ruled out diabetes mellitus and insipidous along with other potential endocrine issues. They were not convinced that the lithium created a lasting effect either. I have not seen a nephrologist. BPH and OAB meds. Tests: scopes, urodynamics, ultrasounds, cultures, labs, MRI. Intervention: interstim. 1 urologist detected a stricture, another did not. The second urologist did point out my prostate was not that of a 28 year old, but not “wonky” enough to deem it a problem for now. There are no urinary pills, or class of pills, to be revisited. Anyone have experience with any type of psychotropic drug that seemed to be the only possibility for uncharacteristic urinary symptoms??"
"Nightime urination and psych meds? There are dead things in my bed. All the time when I try to wake up, they have a voice like gravel and grave dirt, rough and dark and try to pull me down in hell with them. So I don't wake up ever again. Never, ever wake up again!

Exploding head syndrome Has anyone learned how to beat exploding head syndrome? The only thing I have found that works is taking way to many sleeping medications until I am forced to sleep. I know this is dangerous and not recommended which is why I am asking for what others have come up with.
"Exploding head syndrome I dont have this syndrome but i also hear noises when i sleep that people tell me isnt there. It does not bother me, so im sorry i dont have great advice, but what i will do if i cannot sleep or to distract myself is to put on a CD(usually upbeat music) that you can fall asleep to but will turn off automatically. Have you told anyone close to you that you have this syndrome? That can help."

"I have Night Eating Syndrome. I need your help. Since last year i've been taking a shower before going to bed which used to put me to sleep almost instantly when my head hit the pillow. Eventually I found a delay before falling asleep which inturn caused me to resort to eating before going to bed. This used to put me to sleep instantly, however howadays I realize that it's putting a damper on my ability to sleep. Night Eating Syndrome. As a result I find myself getting up multiple times throughout the night. Until recently, when I got up, my brain was on auto polit to get something to eat. In the last couple of days i've been taking lurasidone. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurasidone An anti anxiety medication that does help prevent me from eating, but sadly I have reason to believe it prevents me from sleeping. The first day I took it, I was unable to sleep the night before. Despite this it took several hours to for me to fall asleep, despite it surpressing my hunger. The second night I was unable to fall asleep until 6 am. The third night produced the same result as the first mainly because I couldn't sleep the previous night. I'm worried that i'm going to be facing a new pattern where I can't sleep the first night, but eventually sleep the second and that this pattern may get worse. I have reason to believe that while the Lurasidone curbs my apitite, it does not curb my need to eat in order to sleep. In addition to Lurasidone, I also take Trazodone(aka Asenapine) at 1 and a half tablets, Saphris at 5mg, and one or two pills of serenity formula. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trazodone https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asenapine I've heard that sleeping pills can worsen night eating syndrome and starting yesterday, I stopped taking them. http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonlin ... e=fulltext I've ordered a bottle of Serotonin brainn food since i've heard that lack of Serotonin causes Night Eating Syndrome. I don't know how this could effect my meds however. I take my Lurasidone at 7:00. 3 and half hours before going to bed. I also take Trazodone at 9:30 and Saphris at 10:30. I used to take a shower before going to bed, but as time went on I stopped as i'm worried that it's been causing me problems. I'm worried that my sleeping is going to get worse as time goes on as it always has since last year. I'm hoping that there is surgery or a brain implant that I could buy to help me out or if I could get a surgery operation to further examine my head, but I need more information. One of the problems i'm facing is that no one is telling me anything useful. My mother, despite knowing my plight, doesn't understand the weight of what i'm going through. It may help to know if there are support groups I could join. Any advice? Please help. I'm worried that my sleeping issues are going to get worse and without help I may eventually lose my ability to sleep. Notes: 1.I for some reason have an obsession with going to the bathroom at night even when there's only a few drops of urine in my body. 2.I believe that my nose my need surgery to breath properly as i've dug too far into my nose. 3.I'm unsure about the effects of my combined medicine and the side effects they come with. 4.Since taking my lurasidone, i've had 2 pieces of bread before bed to help stave off my hunger. 5.Songs get stuck in my head at night every two or three nights.

"I have Night Eating Syndrome. Hi, welcome to the forums. Sorry for the delayed response. I've been going through some problems of my own. The first thing I can recommend is talking to your doctor. Be honest with them about your concerns and tell them how you feel. The second thing I could try to recommend to you is possibly eating something healthier than bread before you go to sleep, like maybe an apple or a banana. Third, maybe try taking your medication a little earlier. Whenever my Geodon didn't sedate me for hours, I tried altering the time I took it, and that helped me. hope this helps, even a little.

"Murky&aggitated final stage (last hour) of sleep Hi everyone, I am posting this hoping that others who are having similar sleep disorders will maybe want to share their experience. I apologise for what seems to've become a very long thread - I tried to stick to the most relevant details. For about a year and a half I've been suffering from a specific type of sleep problem. The last part of my sleep, towards the morning (perhaps the final hour or so; hard to tell exactly) is very agitated; feels like a dizziness, as if I had mud in my head, and where I am half-awake (almost conscious/obsessive dream-like thoughts reoccur) yet find it difficult to wake up. This means that, after a struggle to break away from a confusing, exhausting last hour of sleep, not only will I have spent longer in bed than I'd have wished (say, 9 hours) but ""in exchange"" I get a day during which I am often tired, and sometimes find it hard to stay awake longer than 10pm. ""Tricking"" myself out of sleep before the critical stage starts (e.g. after 7 hours of sleep) doesn't work, as then I just feel under-slept. Other (even more upsetting) side-effects of this long-standing sleep disorder include irritablility and apathy to exercise and to sex. In addition, I seem to've acquired a form of tinitus (high-pitched buzz in both ears), the severity (loudness) of which varies from day to day, though hard to tell if correlated with sleep quality. Several medical tests (including ear-nose-throat, endocrinology and head MR-imaging) revealed no obvious cause underlying my symptoms, however a sleep study (polysomnography) revealed two presumtive (tentatively-given) diagnoses: 1) REM sleep disorder (although I don't have the intense dreams characteristic of this diagnostic) 2) borderline sleep apnea (several episodes of irregular breathing per night). After this test, my somnologist prescribed Circadin 2mg (melatonin), which I've been taking for a month now without any noticeable improvements even after being told to double the dosage; the medic recommended, if the Circadin treatment remains ineffective till the end, that I next try to sleep with an anti-apneic mask (CPAP). If that will fail also, she said the only remaining cause remains stress; I haven't been particularly stressed times, however I *do* tend to take things to heart. Some further details: - Taking natural sleep supplements (camomile tea, pills with lavander, etc) before bedtime helps sometimes but not reliably (probably not beyond placebo) - My sleep is abnormally dependent upon bed-time, in that if I go to bed late (a lot later than, say, midnight) I am guaranteed a tormented sleep. However, even going to bed early (11pm) hardly helps with the final-hour-restlessness that I describe. - I'm keeping careful sleep logs, however none of the factors I suspected - including amount of exercise (which I don't do enough of) and stress during the previous day, bed/pillow conditions, bed time, anything to do with meals (including coffee), etc - don't seem to obviously (and single-handedly) lead to this final-hour-syndrome - Soon after falling asleep, I am told I often fidget/twitch and snore, although I never have trouble *falling* asleep (only at the waking-up end) - Since 1.5 years ago when my problems started, the frequency with which my sleep ends with such a restless hour varies: I've had a few good months/weeks, but otherwise it's rare (maybe one night out of 10) that I *don't* get the symptom, i.e. when I wake up easily and rested. - My sleep hours are normally regular (midnight to 8am) I am male, mid 30s, no other major health problems. If anyone has encountered similar symptoms and can share any advice of what they tried that worked, I'd be really grateful! Many thanks in advance!"

"Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder + Sleeping Too Much (Help) Hello there, I'm Usman, 20 years old and I've been suffering from this delayed sleep phase syndrome. I haven't officially got diagnosed with it, actually misdiagnosed and prescribed a sleeping pill that just made it worse. But i know that i have this disorder because no matter what I do, I can't sleep at night and only be able to sleep throughout the day. At the time of this writing, it's 12:33 PM and I feel so active and refreshed. I won't be able to get sleep before 3:00 or 4:00 AM since i woke up at 3:00 pm today. I also have anxiety disorder for which I'm taking escitalopram for the past 3 years. I have to get up early in the morning to take the university classes and when I wake up in the morning, I feel terrible and experience severe anxiety because of not getting enough sleep at night. I feel like a zombie until afternoon. I've tried not sleeping at all the whole night and then forcing myself to stay up for the rest of the day in order to sleep at a reasonable time at night for example 9:00 PM. But after coming back home, my body says ""Hey, it's time to awake"" and I don't feel tired to sleep early. I can stay up and do the work even If I'm up since 18 hours! Or even if I can manage to sleep at 10:00 PM, what will happen is that I will sleep WAY too much, for example 14 hours and wake up at 12:00 PM. The next day, obviously since I have woke up at 12:00 PM, I won't be able to sleep at 10:00 PM and this goes on and on, every single day. No matter what I do, I can probably maintain the routine for 2-3 days but eventually i get back to my same routine. Sleep at day, Wake up at night. On Saturday night, I was able to sleep by 1:00 AM but I woke up at 3:00 PM (Over 14 hours). And since I woke up at 3:00 PM, I won't be able to sleep at 1:00 AM today. So basically, my sleep is delayed 2-3 hours every day because of sleeping too much. I usually sleep 12-14 hours a day. So basically, I have 2 problems: 1.) Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome 2.) Sleeping too much (12-14 hours) daily. I don't know why my body requires me to sleep too much. I also have terrible constipation most of the time so that may be reason why I'm sleeping so much. I can probably get rid of this disorder if I can wake up after 7-8 hours of sleep. Does anyone here experienced the same thing? I would love to hear from people who are like me and going through the same thing and possibly a solution to fix this problem. I got poor grades because of this disorder since I just can't concentrate in the morning classes. Thanks, Usman."
"Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder + Sleeping Too Much (Help) Hello i also sleep way too much because it is my way of coping with what i feel. I have little control of it because if i do not get 12 hours of sleep a day i will become very drowsy. I think i may have hypersomnia, and you might as well. I do not have delayed sleep phase disorder, but it seems that you are getting on the right track by going to talk to a doctor about this and getting a prescription(hopefully it will not be the right kind of medication). I wish you all the best!"
"REM.Sleep Fantasies (This happen to anybody else) Sometimes, when I'm dreaming, I'll get like sexual fantasies about stuff I don't like, but they'll feel ""nice"", and then I wake up, and feel anxious. Trouble is, it almost feels like I'm semi-awake when it happens, like I wake up, it happens, and then I wake up again, worried. This happen to anybody else? I'm comfused, because the idea of the fantasies makes me vomit. I researched it, and I think it's false awakening, but I'm unsure. Can anybody relate?"
"Does this sound like delayed sleep phase disorder? Hi. Since I started school at 5, my mum through no fault of her own, always had a difficult time getting me out of bed and ready even although I was asleep for 10.30pm after going to bed at around 8.30pm.. I loathed school nights. We used to joke about it all years later but the truth is, as a 29yr old, I still have the same problem. Unless I have an appointment or have to be somewhere for like 8am, I can't wake up until 10am or later. It seems if I wake at 11am I won't feel tired until 2 or 3am. I will set numerous alarms for half 6 but when they sound, I'll be like ***k that, turn them off and wake up at noon furious with myself. I work 4 till 11pm so I am pretty much able to follow my own sleep pattern. Don't get me wrong if I was offered 50 bucks to haul ass out of bed at 6am I could but I hate the groggy feeling that lasts for about an hour. Does this sound like dspd or something that can't be fixed? Ps my parents used to argue over this as my dad used to ""turn day into night"" lol so I probably got it from him? Kind regards Nokturnal"
"1am-3am awakenings EVERY night I’ve been having a pretty serious problem for the last month. Never experienced anything like this in my life. Initially it started as a few weeks on and off waking up way too early (530/515am) before my 6:05am alarm and has now turned into waking up every NIGHT, consistently, in between 1-3am in the last week. EVERY NIGHT. Last night I woke up at 2am and then 530am before my alarm. My first double whammy. After 20 mins or so I WILL actually fall back asleep, but the disruption makes me feel like a zombie the next day. 32 year old otherwise healthy male with a touch of hypothyroidism. Not on any meds. A little stressed out but nothing crazy imo What could this possibly be about??"
"1am-3am awakenings EVERY night I used to do the same thing. I'd go to bed at about 1am (second shift worker), wake up at 4am, go back to bed almost immediately, wake up at 6, walk around, fall back asleep, then wake up right before work, completely exhausted. I asked my psychiatrist and clinical psychologists. They told me it could be because of anxiety and stress, but they gave me a couple tips. 1. Empty your bladder before bed. 2. No caffeine four hours before bed. 3. Try to play relaxing music while you sleep. Really, they're basic tips. Hope this helps, even a little.

"Long-term sleep problems Hi, this is my first post on the forum. I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for in making this post, or even whether it's the correct forum for what I describe, but I hope it doesn't cause any problems! For many years - longer than I can remember - I haven't slept the full 8 hours. Also, perhaps coincidentally, for the last 20 years, I have been working shifts at work intermittently. I started off 20 years ago working mornings (6 - 2) and afternoons (2 - 10) and did that for about 7 years. But for the last 8 years I have worked a 3-shift system that has included mornings, afternoons and nights (10pm - 6am) on a rotating 3-week cycle. I find that when I'm on morning shift, I only sleep for a few hours and wake up very early - a lot earlier than I need to, even though I have an alarm clock. When I'm on afternoons, I can go to bed after midnight, and still wake up any time between 5 and 7am, and only sleep intermittently from then onwards. On nights, I get to bed about 6:30am, and it's unheard of for me to sleep past 11:30, often waking a lot earlier. Even when I'm not working, I can go to bed just after midnight and wake up early, only sleeping fitfully after. As you can imagine, this often leaves me feeling sleepy during the day. Sometimes i can be watching TV in the afternoon and go to sleep. I have often felt sleepy when driving home after a night shift, but that's not really surprising as I've had a night without sleep. I mentioned it in passing to a medical professional and, perhaps partly because I'm also overweight, I'm being referred to check for sleep apnea. SO it is being investigated. Does anybody else have similar problems sleeping? My own feeling about this is that it could just as easily be due to shift work rather than any other medical cause, but it's best to exclude something more serious."
"Long-term sleep problems Hello, my husband worked night shifts for almost 20 years and never had a regular 8-hour sleeping pattern for, well, obvious reasons... for him it was five days working 23-7am and then five days off trying to adjust back to sleeping at exactly the same time he was working before. So it's like having serious jet lag every five days. And in your case it's much worse because your shifts keep on changing. I'm not a professional – just an insomniac – but if you are worried about your health I would think changing your job might be helpful... sorry, I know this is not what you wanted to hear.

"i used to be able to sleep 8 hours now i can only sleep 6i If you are going through your day without feeling tired, than your body may be telling you that you got the quality sleep it needed. If thats not the case, than it could be several things. Are you drinking alcohol before bed? Alcohol may get you to sleep, but as you come down, you will wake up. Is there any environmental factors like noise, light, etc? Has anyone ever told you you snore heavily or gasp for breath during the night. If so, you may have a sleep disorder in need of treatment."
i used to be able to sleep 8 hours now i can only sleep 6i I suggest a sleep study. Sleep apnea can cause people to start waking tooearly and not get back to sleep. There's many people who have undiagnosed sleep apnea. I am thin with a small neck and I have sleep apnea.
"My sleep terror remedy Hello, I suffered from night terrors for years. I tried everything from setting my alarm, keeping pets out of the room, having my husband not disturbing my sleep for 1 1/2 hours after falling asleep Zantac, etc. Nothing worked so I went on clonazepam which helped a lot. I did not want to be on it long term so I worked with my doctor to get off of it which I did a year and a half ago. The night terrors came back which wasn't pleasant. Last fall after I went camping, I stumbled on a weird remedy which is just eating one large marshmallow before I go to bed. It really seems to have kept the terrors at bay. Does anyone know why this would work? Thanks. M.A."
"Dreams so vivid, Loosing track of reality For about half a year, maybe longer I've been having very vivid dreams. Whether it be 20 minutes long to a few hours long. It's always extremely vivid and detailed. I can remember every single dream I've had and it's getting worse. I've been sleeping longer and longer because I can't wake up from my dreams and now sometimes everything around me seems so fake. I've even gone so far as to have dreams that I couldn't wake up from- like I knew it was a dream in the dream but I had to perform a bunch of tasks to wake up. I've woken up screaming and when I die in a dream...I don't die I just regenerate or I tell myself it's a dream and I can go back in time and stop myself from dying. So, I'm not sure what's wrong. I always over sleep now and I feel awful. Granted this doesn't happen every night, only 6/7 nights. So, I get lucky if I get one good nights rest. I have no idea what's going on with me. But like I said it's only getting worse and worse."
"Dreams so vivid, Loosing track of reality Hello, are you currently taking any medication? When I was taking seroquel (quetiapine) I had a similar side effect, my dreams seemed more vivid than reality actually. I was looking forward to going to bed because my ""awake"" life was rather dull and I knew when I fall asleep I will get to watch a technicolor movie. Currently working on my upcoming signature."
"Dreams so vivid, Loosing track of reality No, I'm not currently on anything. I haven't been on any medication in the past for sleep, either. I'm really not sure what's wrong- it's actually basically what you said it was like too. I have crazy dreams that are awesome/exciting but when I wake up my life is boring."
"Dreams so vivid, Loosing track of reality Possible neurological condition? I would talk immediately with a doctor just to sort out what it might be. It could be anything, so just play it safe. Do not be proud of your disorder, be proud it does not define you and your struggles with it."
"Weird dreams and lack of nightmares I've had dreams where i'm anxious and bad dreams but never a true nightmare, I never wake up scared or terrified, I'm completely calm or I sleep right through it. Especially with bipolar I would expect to be having the worse but no, even when I was at my worst I had maybe some vivid dreams. I also get a really weird fake sleep paralysis in the morning where I'm asleep but in the dream I can't move. I'm in my bed and I have hallucinations within the dream like someone is in the room, shadows or pressure on the bed. In the dream I sometimes struggle to move and then I just wake up or sleep through it. I am also aware of my room while being asleep. Maybe i'm asleep with my eyes open? No idea. Had these since I was a kid. I dunno why I'm posting this because it doesn't interfere with me at all. I just thought it was very weird. Do not be proud of your disorder, be proud it does not define you and your struggles with it."
"Sleep Paralysis and Lucid Dreaming Hybrid? Weird experiences Hi all, new here. I found this place while trying to find any information about my experiences. I'll try and keep it pretty short but I'm afraid it could be a long read. Anyway; I started having sleep paralysis experiences about 7 years ago. At first I was scared of it, like everybody - until I read about it and it calmed me. But then it started to happen on a regular basis. I had it 3-4 times a week the next few years, but I learned to control it. Controlling it by not opening my eyes (in fear of hallucinations) and doing my best to wake up. But - as I met a few friends who had the same experiences, they also started talking about Lucid dreams. I thought it sounded cool and wanted to try it. But now I understand that what I have been experiencing a few times the last year or so isn't lucid dreaming. More like a mix between sleep paralysis, lucid dreaming and OBE. Most often, I just try to wake up from the paralysis (Still get them a few times a week) but sometimes, when I'm feeling adventurous, I take it step further: I use all the energy in my body to try and raise myself from bed. Mostly I can't do it, but a few times I've been able to get up and walk around in my apartment for 20-30 seconds up to a minute before I wake up. I can't really do anything. I'm trying to fly or go to other places and such but without any results. But today I managed to do more than that. It felt like I stayed in this for an hour. I was having a sleep paralysis, managed to get up, walk around my apartment (noticing an extra lamp and a chair which reminded me of it not being real), and I tried to go piss, watch porn and other stuff to see how it was like. It was very intense and I controlled everything. I can't do anything else than I would be able to do with ""physical"" me. That is, I can´t hover, fly, do backflips or anything. And I can't take myself to another place unless I walk there. So I'm trapped in my apartment. But I am in TOTAL control of what I'm doing. - Which is the interesting part here when I talk to friends who has Lucid dreams. Not a basic dream. This is something completely else and always origins from the sleep paralysis. Eventually I started freaking out so I decided to wake up. And now I'm sitting here with a pool of sweat in my bed, having a little trouble talking (like I was drunk or something) and I feel physically drained. What is happening? What is this all about? I have google this before but I've never actually seen somebody having the same experiences as me. Anyone here perhaps?"
"Strange sleeping pattern Hi there, I have always monitored my sleep cycle out of curiosity using the sleep cycle iOS app, but for the last few months I have occasionally noticed a strange sleeping pattern which has resulted in me waking up feeling exhausted and unrested. Here is a URL to a screenshot from the app from one of my particular bad nights: http://postimg.org/image/40tqjs2ej/ As you can see, I am not getting much in the way of deep sleep, and am waking up completely about once every 60 mins, leading to a cumulative 10 times per night, however I do not remember waking up in the morning. I ruminated over the possibility of sleep apnoea, however I am a healthy 23 year old male of normal weight who follows a good diet and exercise regimen, and I also try to participate in good sleep hygiene, so this has left me feeling puzzled and frustrated. I am also not really stressed currently. Has anyone experienced anything similar or does anyone have any idea about what may be causing this to happen? Many Thanks, Elliot"
"Strange sleeping pattern Hello, that's very interesting -- I was also thinking perhaps sleep apnea... can't think of anything else -- is the place you live at noisy? We live on top of a bar and I had to get used to sleeping with earplugs... I hope it gets better soon -- keep us posted please. Currently working on my upcoming signature."
"Confusing Sleep Disorder This is basically not too far off from REM sleep disorder but maybe belongs in something like a hypnogogic hallucinations thread. I've encountered someone who had some similarities that had REM behavior disorder. I don't have this disorder anymore so long as I stick to my medication. Basically both of us could relate on dreaming without sleeping... the entire night. I think paralysis kicked in for me but not him but basically everything would mentally turn into a dream but I wouldn't feel as if I got any sleep at all. This is unrelated and I've suffered from dissociative spectrum disorders but basically ever since I was young and woke up to one of my parents choking me from the back of the neck I've woken up ready to attack someone, basically on the wrong side of the bed in a serious way and waking up in a state of depersonalization/prolonged hypnogoic hallucinations. I've healed past all this but I was just wondering what this might mean. I also seemed to experience something like hypnogogic hallucinations before sleeping after having a dense baseball bat type log broken over the front of my head which also lead to various masochistic and antisocial behaviors later on and diminished emotional spectrum. My friend with the similar sleep disorder to me plus the REM behavior disorder also has a history of head trauma. I'm just unsure if this is already covered, hard to tell because of pschotic spectrum, hard to tell because of dissociative spectrum, or hard to tell because of brain damage."
"I have a delayed sleep-phase disorder Which basically means I will be chronically seen as a lazy slob for life. I went to sleep at 3-4am last night and woke up at 9pm! 18 hours. I feel disgusting, mentally and physically, I feel like I'm destroying my body. My head hurts, I'm trembling, it's like I'm in a fog. I wake up like this most days, feeling utterly disgusted and disoriented. I've tried going to sleep at early times, 9 or 10 or 11, and always wake up some time like 1 or 3am, unable to go back to sleep. I just give up. I don't think Ive ever in my life felt good, or rested, waking up in the morning, no matter how much sleep I've gotten prior. Tomorrow, I mean today , I have a drivers test, which I planned to prepare for today, i mean yesterday , while driving around. Now I have to wing it. I'm staying up all night, and I'll have to squeeze some time in tomorrow before the test while people are awake. I still can't parallel park correctly. The thing is, I know as soon as 6am rolls around, I'll begin to feel sick to my stomach, and tired, unable to keep my head up, because thats when my body wants to go to sleep."
"Are you active at all during the day..... I always have had problems sleeping... It takes me a long time to fall asleep, and I Don't stay asleep. I haven't slept as long as you have, and that does seem like a lot for one person to do. Have you tried just going to bed whenever you're tired, and setting an alarm and forcing yourself to get up no matter how tired you are? It's hard to get your biological clock reset, your body could be off for some reason..."
"The problem is I get tired around morning hours the most. Unless Iv'e been rock climbing or something, it takes me a long time to fall asleep and I sort of have to force myself. I've also tried staying up 24 hours and then going to sleep at a normal time, but it just doesn't work. I either am able to fall asleep, and then wake up way way too late from oversleeping again, or I am not able to fall asleep, still, even though I may be dead tired. The alarm thing...I also have problems getting out of bed. but i do try to set my alarm to at least give myself the chance. PS- took a nap again at 8am. left permit in another car so I could not take test. lulz."

Sometimes I've had to put my alarm clock on the other side of teh room, but it's easy to go back to bed again, just got to tell yourself to get up, and shower right away. Showers do wonders in the morning to get yourself up."
"I have a delayed sleep-phase disorder Advice on HOW to Get UP in the Morning I definitely have a Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder resisting sleep as long as possible and once asleep find it alI most impossible to wake up. I set three different alarms - always being sure that the alarms are far enough from my bed so that I have to get up in order to tourn them off. One alarm is in another room entirely. I will also ask my roommate to wake me up. Often I wake up late and have no recollection of turning off my alarms nor of anyone calling or talking to me. I have a job where there are important early meeting days, and weeks when I must be in early to teach workshops and it is a huge problem for me. I can't afford to lose my job. In addition I am constantly tired. Any morning when I must be in for 8am or 9am, no matter what time I have gone to bed, I feel disoriented for the entire day, a burning feeling in my chest almost like a hangover, all my bodily functions are out of whack (sorry). Regardless of feeling horrible, can anyone suggest some ways that work that might get me Out of Bed when I need to be."
"I have a delayed sleep-phase disorder I have DSPD AND a non-24 hour sleep cycle. I've learned to manage it pretty well, as I'm in college and I need to get up for classes. You might want to try what I came up with. Try to sleep 9-11 hours a night, no matter when you go to sleep. About once a week, force yourself to stay awake all night and all day the next day. This will make you tired enough to be able to sleep at a decent time the next night, such as 9-10-11 pm. Be sure not too fall asleep too late or early. This will reset your circadian rhythm and it'll be easier to fall asleep earlier. It may lead to slight sleep deprivation, but as long as you get a good night's rest on the nights when you do sleep, it shouldn't cause adverse health affects. Just be sure not to drive or operate machinery when you haven't slept. This may not be for you, but I hope you can at least try it. There are also ways to resets your circadian rhythm using food, if you'd like to look for them on Google. I think the world would be a lot better if every single person had extreme OCD. Think about it."

When I take college classes, I basically get just a few hours during the week and make it up on the weekend. Bad sleep hygiene, but I have no other choice unless I withdraw and get tons of loan debt accruing. I did withdraw that time when extreme lack of sleep resulted in psychosis. But even then, I can stay up for three days with no sleep and have tons of energy, take a quick nap and repeat. Then I sleep for about 20 hours on the weekend, and eventually the cycle extends such that I have those long sleep days during the week and miss class."
"I have a delayed sleep-phase disorder Hi there. I think I also have a delayed sleep-phase disorder. And yes, I'm regarded as a slob because I try and get as much sleep as I can when I can because sleep is like gold dust to me. I once slept for nearly 3 days running when I was at university, after going without sleep for about 2 weeks. For me, I find that I can't actually FALL asleep, because it feels like I'm falling and I have to let go and relax, but I can't. It makes me anxious having to let go and sleep, so I try to retain some control as much as I can until I'm so tired I fall asleep without realising. I have no idea how I can stop feeling like that, although sometimes, retraining myself by napping during the day helps me 're-learn' how to sleep again. He who knows, does not speak. He who speaks, does not know."
"I have a delayed sleep-phase disorder Thank goodness I'm not the only one! I'd like to ask the people on here, though-- is this a problem that's been haunting you most your life? Because for me, it has been- though of course, not to the same extremes as recently. My mom says that even when I was a baby I wouldn't sleep- they took me to doctors and labeled it as DSPD, the more accurate technical term being an ""altered cicadian rhythm."" It just sort of means that your biological clock is different from most people's. Not just a night-owl. I physically have trouble trying to sleep before a minimum of two am (usually three or four). I've tried everything- skipping days of sleeping in order to make myself more tired and hopefully sleep sooner- which always manages to backfire somehow. Getting on a very strict diet where you eat specific things at specific times. Lying in the dark, waiting to fall asleep. Doing something to tire me in order to sleep (gym is kind of helpful there, but it's never enough, because only my body tires). It's absolutely ridiculous, and it keeps me from doing a lot of things. Family doesn't understand it at all. There's actually two types of altered cicadian rhythms which are the basics of DSPD. The first is just sort of a traditional, shifted sleep schedule. You still need the same amount of sleep as any normal person might, but your hours of functionality are vastly different. Up late, sleep late. The other one is not merely a shifted rhythm but it is a lengthened one as well. Typically described as operating on the schedule of a 25-hour day, it means that you don't just go to bed late, but you go to bed late-r, and you need more sleep. Because you have this weird extra hour, your schedule constantly shifts between needing more time at night and in the mornings. I've recently read though that this can be affected with light therapy (sounds hokey, but stay with me here). I don't remember precisely what the light is called, but having a certain type of light on in the mornings can help slowly adjust your schedule, perhaps not to normal, but operable times. Just try google searching light therapy in relation to DSPD or cicadian rhythms- you should get something. Anyways, I'm willing to try it, and figured it might be worth something to somebody to share."
"I can't wake up in the morning. I sleep 8 hours every night and in the morning when I'm hitting snooze, I'm not even fully conscious, I'm still dreaming. By the time I'm done hitting snooze 45 minutes later I finally realize that I'm awake and I need to get up for work, and I'm already running late. Because I can't consciously wake up at the time I'm supposed to. I've tried setting the alarm earlier but it doesn't work I still wake up completely at the same time everyday, which is not early enough. Going to be earlier or later doesn't help either. I hate running late, how can I fix this?"
"I can't wake up in the morning. Hi. I'm sure you have thought of this but I case you haven't you could try to put an alarm clock on loud across your bedroom. I know it might not work cause you said your still in a semi sleep state, but I wonder if it's loud and far away enough you wouldn't be able to hit snooze. Also my friend sleeps with her blinds wide open so the sun light comes in and seems to help make her brain/body know it's morning and in about 15 minutes plus the alarm clock thing gets her up. Can't be easy for you. I hope this helps a bit"
"I can't wake up in the morning. I am struggling with this as well. I usually go to sleep after midnight (somewhere around 2 or 3AM) and have to wake up every morning at 6AM to get ready for school. I have many alarms set on my phone, each one 5 minutes after the other, since one alarm never wakes me up anymore. Turns out that this actually is a terrible mistake, since my brain knows that even if I turn off the first alarm, I can go back to sleep and maybe the following alarm would wake me up. But it doesn't, since I just open my eyes to turn off the next alarm and go back to sleep. My parents bought me a vintage alarm clock, which is right abore my head and whenever the alarm rings, it's just so loud that even the heaviest sleeper would wake up. The good thing is that once it starts ringing, it can't be turned off. But lately, I've gotten used to that as well and it doesn't seem to wake me up anymore. Instead, I have to have my mother struggle to wake me up, as I am often abusive and violent in the waking process, which strangely I cannot control, nor remember after fully waking up. This also has to do with my DID as well, which makes it really difficult for my mother. She has said many times that she's quite stressed and scared of me in the mornings, not knowing how I'll react, as most times I end up injuring her. This morning I left bruises on her arms, while I was in the stage between sleep and waking. I don't remember much of it, besides the part where I felt I was in dream land, dreaming about myself being a kung fu master or some sort. It may seem funny, but it's really not. I never wanted to injure my mother like that, but I can't really help it. However, there is one method of waking up that most of the time works on me. And that is when my mother turns on the TV and sets the volume high. Now, since I don't use my TV for anything, other than to connect it to my laptop and watch movies on the big screen, hearing a cooking show or something I don't ever watch is just really bugging me in a way, so I'd have to get up to turn the TV off. I've come to the conclusion that sounds that really annoy you and, of course, sounds that are loud enough for you to hear them through your dream, could wake you up easily. But as the person above me has said, these sounds should be on the other end of your room, in order for you to get up and walk that distance to turn it off. I've realized that I wake up faster when I'm sleeping on places where the windows are right next to my bed. It's difficult for me to wake up when I'm sleeping in my own room, since my bed is away from the windows, but if your bed is close to them, you can try to sleep with the windows opened, so the sun light and the possible car or bird sounds or any morning sounds coming from your window could wake you up easily. ❝If BJD dolls can be perfect, then so can I.❞ - Personal. ☽♡☾"
"I can't wake up in the morning. I feel as if I'm going through it as well, I can at times get up early, but those times I put thick clothes on for bed, so eventually the heat wakes me up slowly, if you keep the clothes on you have the energy to get up rather than waking up half asleep then leading to oversleep. It's a weird thing, because at night I feel that i'm too awake to fall asleep, I get oversleep a lot and also lost a job because of it."
Tremors I'm practically falling asleep as I type this. I am so tired but just as I fall asleep I wake right back up. A week ago I was having hypnagogic hallucinations and was hearing vivid noises just before sleep. Tonight I just keep waking up. Almost like surge of energy hits me and then I have a tremor for several minutes before I try again and it starts over. It would be comforting to know others experience this too! I just want to sleep!!! Is there treatment for this?
"A new solution for delayed sleep phase syndrome ( DSPS ) I'm dealing with DSPS since 2002 and recently I've found a solution for it When I was single it was easy to do chronotherapy but now with wife and two kids it's almost impossible to use chronotherapy so life is getting hard with DSPS. Recently I found a solution and it works very well for me. Hope it help others . see below for instructions First I make sure there is no sleep debt, I make sure I had enough sleep for 2-3 days then on day 4 I don't sleep at usual time (say 6 am) and I try to stay up as long as I can, then around 1 pm I really feel I can't stay up anymore so I go to bed and set multiple alarm clocks at 4 pm ( sleep only 3 hours) it's hard to get up but with multiple alaram clocks finally I get up. I wash my face and drink a cup of tea or eat something. this makes me to wake up and feel fresh. then I do my usual activities (mostly programming) then around 8 pm I fell I really need sleep so I go to bed and set alarm clock at 8:20 (sleep 20 min) then I hardly get up and after washing my face and eating something I feel fresh. I need this 20 min sleep again at around 1 am and I sleep at 1 am then get up 1:20 am. and finally I sleep at 6:0 am for 6 hours and get up at 12:0 pm. from now on I need 20 min sleep around 5 pm and another 20 min sleep around 12 am (mid night) then I sleep at 6:0 am for 6 hours. please note now getting up is much easier specially after 20 min sleep. I have to mention I never couldn't sleep less than 8 hours and sleeping less than 8 hours cause sleep debts. but this way I can sleep 6.5 hours a day without feeling tired, also It's easy to sleep at same time every day, I easily fall asleep at 6:0 am every day. There is only 2 negative points with this solution. 1.starting it is a bit hard 2.If for any reason I can't get my 20 min sleep during evening and during midnight then I can't continue this method anymore and my sleep cycle changes badly. (unfortunately I have this problem with two kids, some times I can't sleep when I need it, longest time I could use this pattern was for 2 weeks and finally my wife asks my to do something in the evening or midnight so I can't get that 20 min sleep and ...) Please note I work at night, that's why I sleep 6 am."
"Nocturnality I oftentimes flip my sleep/wake cycle. At times it gets so bad that I awaken at 9 at night and fall asleep by 10:00 AM the next day. I cannot control when this happens, and it usually takes several days for it to revert. Sometimes the morning feels like it's been a long day- it's almost exactly like the afternoon. Can't explain the feeling. Other times I could stay awake all night alone without uttering a single word before going back to bed. I find myself losing track of days and weeks. 3 days can go by and it will feel as if no time passed. Before I know it some deadline or another is here and it feels like there hasn't been enough time for it to arrive."
"Nocturnality Hi, would you say that this affects your life and/or health negatively? If not, perhaps it's not really a problem. If yes, you might speak to your doctor about it? ""Thanks"" to my bipolar, I have problems with sleep rhythm, and at the same time it is absolutely imperative that I sleep eight hours within the right timeframe. There are meds, anti-histamines, that allow you to regulate the sleep rhythm and are not addictive. You could also -- if you haven't already -- try melatonin, which is supposed to regulate your day/night rhythm. Perhaps you have a natural low level of melatonin? TL;DR version -- I'd suggest you speak to a doctor about it. Currently working on my upcoming signature."
"Sleep disorder and acupuncture Hi, I am 31 years old and I have been having disturbed sleep from the past 4 years. I am trying to figure out the reason. It is very exhausting and I just wish I could sleep like a normal person. I recently read a blog *mod edit*. It says acupuncture can help with getting better sleep. Is it true? I have never tried acupuncture, but if it can help me sleep better, I would definitely go for it. Has someone here tried this? Curious to know.

"What is happening? Ok so first off, I have really bad anxiety and I am very fearful of anything happening to my body that I'm unaware of (passing out, blacking out, fainting, seizures, anything like that). It also makes me very aware of my surroundings, and usually ends up preventing me from sleeping. But I usually get tired of sitting at my computer desk around like 8pm, and decide to go lay in bed and watch youtube/netflix. So I'll watch that for about 15 mins or so, and then my eyes get heavy so I lay down and close them, but still try listening to whatever I was watching. And then whenever the noise starts annoying me, I'll pause it. Then I'll just try to rest my eyes so I can get back up, so I try to be aware of the sounds and stuff in my room. But then I feel a rush of the feeling ""get up"" and I'll get up really quick, and confused, and scared. Because I don't know if I passed out or not. Which I couldn't have been long, maybe a minute, but I feel like I need to get up really quick and start panicking. And usually get more of the derealization feeling. Like I said, I have a really big fear of passing out and stuff, but I feel good when I lay down when I feel like that. Does this sound like I have something wrong with me, or just my anxiety trying to play tricks on me? I really hate it."
"waking up in middle of night and cannot fall back asleep I have anxiety disorder. when this happens, my sleep patterns change and it brings more anxiety. i can fall asleep easily but wake up after 4 hours. i cannot go back to sleep because i have so much anxiety. i toss and turn and i am in pain from the anxiety. not even sure why i m anxious. can someone help me? i cannot live like this and i think I'm loosing it. Please help."

"Sleep groping/fondling *TW* I have actually read here on the forum about this sort of phenomenon. I don't have much advice to give you I'm afraid -- just that it happens more often and it's not just you. Perhaps try to speak to some sort of professional about it? It's causing you problems, you're not happy about it (and neither is the girl), hence it deserves appropriate care. Currently working on my upcoming signature."
"Sleep groping/fondling *TW* Sleep fondling is quite common and not something you need to judge yourself about. The subconscious mind has a mind of its own. So even when your conscious mind (You) is sound asleep, your subconscious is still working. So fondling someone you are attracted to while sound asleep is giving your conscious mind the opportunity to realize what you really want even though your conscious (ego) mind states your don't want to do anything sexual with this girl. Explore this idea more and see what you come up with."
"Sleep groping/fondling *TW* Disclaimer: I might mention that I'm not in any way qualified to comment or lend love advice. This is just my personal thoughts on the matter. On a more direct line of thinking, try talking to your friend about your issue. Explain to her your thoughts on it and what you feel about it. If you feel you've already lost her trust, you can't really get to a worse place. It might help her to understand that you were not necessarily to blame (on a conscious level anyway) for your attentions. You might also mention your previous encounters. The fact that one enjoyed it while one repulsed it means that she can take initiative to prevent matters if she feels inclined. It is a far cry from rape, as that's usually about control and domination, not subconscious wanderings. Information and communication may just salvage your relationship with your friend. Be honest with her."
"Sleep groping/fondling *TW* Yes definitely talk to her. If you can, really listen to her and let her say everything she needs, without taking it personally. She has the right to feel how she feels about the situation, up to and including feeling like she was raped . This doesn't mean you're a bad person, it just means we don't get to say what the other person's experience was, even if we're unintentional about it. This includes yourself by the way - if you feel sick and angry then that's how you feel, so stay with that and explore those feelings, figure out why you feel that way, and any other things you feel too, like other commentors have suggested I think exploring your sexual desires and being REALLY honest about that is key here too. Make sure you figure out which parts are appropriate to share with her and which parts might hurt her when she's already feeling really vulnerable. I'd like to challenge you on something too - I'm actually going through a similar situation myself. My boyfriend masturbates in his sleep, once even to the point of ejaculating without waking up, and for multiple reasons of things in my past, that is REALLY triggering for me. I'm working through a lot of stuff around that, but when it comes to him, I feel REALLY betrayed for him not telling me before we moved in together. (yes, we'd slept together multiple times before, but always to have sex, which basically made it not happen or have him involve me the moment I was even stirring, and he was awake which made it ok, not to mention I was usually having to leave sometime in the night before it would start happening anyway) We unfortunately live in a society where most people have some kind of trauma around sexuality, especially women. To not mention this kind of thing and ask ""are you going to be ok with that if it happens?"" is HIGHLY irresponsible, especially if you're aware you might actually touch HER body without being able to ask for consent. Because subconscious or not, intention or not, you touched her without her consent. That's a big deal, and it's going to take some work to unravel. I'd definitely suggest sleeping separately for now until you get this figured out. It sounds like you and this girl are pretty sweet on each other, and you sound like an emotionally mature guy, so you should be able to at least work through this and remain friends if that's what needs to happen. Do be aware that it may take her months of sorting through this in her own head to fully process it, and she may need to come back to this conversation multiple times. Please always take her very seriously (remember, this isn't about you, it doesn't make you a bad person, but she does need to be acknowledged for her own experiences) always respect her, and give her space for the option to change her mind - women live in this ""rape culture"" where the victim is either blamed or denied, so she may not even be able to articulate that something's wrong yet. It may take you coming up to her and saying ""I feel sick about this... how are you feeling?"" for her to even be able to admit that something wrong happened. I'm sure you're up for the challenge, and if this can be a learning experience for the both of you, I believe it will actually help our society a lot in the long run. One more thing, it might be helpful to ask her what her boundaries on the matter are. Like ""what are you ok with and not ok with sleeping next to someone in the future?"" she may also have repressed memories of when she felt similar things before that she might now be having to face, complicating things. I know I do from my experiences! Best of luck."
"Shaking/fear going to sleep/during night after concussion. Hi, Pleased to have found a sleep disorder forum, mind you, not sure what is going on but feel so worried and don't know how to handle this. Quick background, had a severe concussion last year, also physical injuries, lot's of cognitive problems still and possible seizure activity, see a neurologist next month. Every single night when I am almost asleep I feel like every nerve in my body starts to shake and I feel such fear, it is so hard to explain, the only thing that stops it is to get out of bed and walk around. I wake up several times during the night...forgot what good sleep is...I suddenly wake up shaking inside, feel so frightened and sick, sometimes it feels like I'm in some sort of dream and I'm still in it, have been known to talk....to who...who knows! None of this ever happened until my accident. I try to read and relax before bed, take a nice bath, no TV etc but nothing works in stopping this terrible shaking/fear feeling, I'm literally in a fetal position shaking and want to cry. Dr has tested blood sugar, nothing wrong. I have tried eating a little something, not heavy, before bed, nothing works to stop this. Has anyone experienced this at all or has any advice, this is hell Thank you very much for any help/advice."
"Shaking/fear going to sleep/during night after concussion. I've been dealing with the same thing lately - I had a bad fall back in February that I hadn't thought to connect to this, so thank you. On the physical level, I'm assuming you got checked out by a doctor for external damage, did they look at internal damage? Did the concussion happen in a way that could have lent to alignment issues? Have those been addressed? If not, check out Katy Bowman's work and her aligned and well videos or program. On the brain level, even if you had a doctor check that out, it's unlikely they would look for the more subtle things that can happen, such as the testing offered by these guys; *mod edit* I'm sure there's a similar clinic in your area. For the time being, check out a product called ""Rescue Remedy."" It's been about the only thing I've found that's let me calm down enough to sleep lately. I can feel a real difference from it, my heart-rate especially slows down significantly almost instantly. Also it sounds like you would benefit significantly from Peter Levine's work. I'm currently in the process of acquiring some of his books and programs myself. His work is specifically geared towards dealing with trauma in this way. Hope this helps! Best of luck and check back in if you find something that works - I'd love to know, and I'll do the same Last edited by Oliveira on Mon Oct 05, 2015 7:51 pm, edited 1 time in total.

"Sleep Problems New member Paul here from the UK. My sleep problems are slowly getting worse. I have no difficulty getting off to sleep, often suffering auditory hypnogognia. I also suffer auditory hypnogognia while I am sleeping, with my name being called as if I have over slept. I regularly get up at 6am for work, but this is getting earlier and earlier, 3am to 4am being the norm. It doesn't seem to matter what I do exercise wise, since effective sleep eludes me. If I go to sleep at 8:30pm, I am up at 11pm, then 1am, then 4am, 4:30am, 5am, etc. I usually experience dreams (nightmares 60-70% of the time) prior to 11pm or after 4am. If I am lucky I will knock off Saturday night and manage to sleep through from say 10pm tip 4am. Currently I work 6 days a week and train 3 times a week. Any suggestions welcome."
"Sleep Problems Hey Paul. My name is paris and i am from greece. I am having exactly the same problem with you. It all started the previous monday as my college started again after a christmas break. i had to wake up at 7 so i fell asleep at 12. i woke up at 5 and then couldnt go back to sleep..it didnt bather me cuz i was pretty sure that the next day id sleep normally. However the next day i fell asleep again at 12 and woke up at 4 :s i was so confused and i didnt know what to do..ever since then this problem has become part of my life and i cannot fix it, i even tried to sleep at 3 in the morning so i wouldnt wake up at 4 but nothing..it didnt help i woke up one hour later..pff i am kinda relieved that i am not the only one in this world having this problem...if you contact a doctor or something please let me know about it.(sorry for my bad english)"
"Sleep Problems Hey there Paul, Is there a chance that your entire sleep rhythm is off which could lead to additional stress? Have you tried something of a natural sleep aid to help you fall asleep? You did not mention if you had tried something to help you sleep (or stay asleep at least) before so I felt it was worth exploring at the least."
"Sleep Problems Do you snore? I know I had no idea I was snoring until I married my husband and couldn't understand why I was waking up so tired every morning. He told me that I snored and sometimes very badly. So, I wasn't sure what to do. I'd wake up almost afraid of not breathing while I was sleeping and then I learned why I was experiencing all of this. I did everything In could to avoid using a CPAP *mod edit* I suddenly started sleeping so much better. I guess my point is, there are often outside influences and reasons that we aren't always aware about that affect our sleep.

"Panic attack during sleep?? A few times I've woken up during the night covered in sweat and feeling very scared, paranoid, confused, dizzy, terrified. Over the past year I've developed anxiety and depression and have a hard time every so often with what I think is a dissociative disorder. Anyway I have a lot of fears such as losing control of my mind. When I wake this panicked state I feel like I'm crazy or about to detach from reality. My mind races and it's like I'm still dreaming and having a panic attack at the same time. My heart races, my eyes can't focus, I'm irritable and confused and scared over something I'm not really sure what of. I have a fear of aliens and when I wake in the panic I get scared that an alien is gonna come in my house and take me. A million things go around head and it takes about 15 minutes to calm down and come around before I can go back to sleep. The next day I wake up feeling fine. Is this a panic attack in my sleep? Can anyone relate?"
Panic attack during sleep?? This sounds terrible. This has only happened a couple times to me. What medications do you take? if you don't mind me asking. I'm thinking your fears are defiantly effecting your subconscious have you talked to a psychologist or psychiatrist about your anxiety and fears at all?
"Hard time falling asleep and waking up I have a really hard time falling asleep no matter how tired I am. I feel more and more tired every day and it stresses me out... And when i finally fall asleep i wake up 6 hours later (or less) and cant fall asleep again even if im still tired. I sleep with my lights on because i am afraid of the dark. Sometimes hugging a pillow or blanket helps me fall asleep faster. i really need help fast because this affects my studying alot. i almost got kicked out of school because of me coming late to class all the time, oh and when im asleep those 6 hours, NOTHING can wake me up."
"Hard time falling asleep and waking up Hello, the lights on may be a problem. Would it be possible for you to install a dimmer? Or have a small ambient type of light? If you have all the lights on, your body erroneously believes it's daytime. So perhaps find a level of light that is just enough for you not to be scared, and then try to reduce it by just a tiny bit every week or so? Another thing that comes to mind -- have you tried any sleeping aids? Melatonin is available OTC, and 1 mg is enough; take it an hour before your desired sleep time. Big hugs. I hope this is a bit helpful. Currently working on my upcoming signature."

I can see why this is a problem. Myself, I can fall asleep without issue, but I haven't had a good nights rest in years. This is a basic sleep hygiene issue and can be resolved hopefully easily. Basic tips: no computer or TV within an hour of bed. No snacks, no caffeine after 5pm, and no alcohol before bed! This should help with a few things. Now, you say you're a student, first time living away from home? How is your diet? Going to sleep hungry can cause issues falling asleep, so make sure you have a decent dinner. Oliveira was very much on the right track with the larger issue. Light plays a huge role in our sleep/wake cycle. If you're sleeping with the light on, your body isn't producing melatonin, it's producing serotonin. The amount of light needs to be decreased ASAP at night, and make sure you get true direct sunlight in the morning, no sunglasses. The main thing to focus on is your fear of the dark, because that anxiety coupled with the anxiety of not sleeping, coupled with stress from school is going to keep you up. I'd recommend some l-tryptophan, once in the morning, and once at night without light, or at least, very, very dim. This will increase your melatonin at night, helping you to sleep, but in the day, it will become serotonin, to help with wakefulness and anxiety. Hope this helps"
Hard time falling asleep and waking up I agree with the others about trying to change your lighting. do you still have a lot of schooling left to do? I'm thinking talking to someone too that can comfort you right before bed might help a bit. If you wanted to go more professional you could talk to a psychologist or councillor. My friend had this problem when her boyfriend would leave for work and she was prescribed zopiclone to use. It would be a last resort but could talk to your Dr. And see what they think?? School is super important so I can see your problem. Hope you can figure something out take care.

And i got OCD-Anxiety-Depersonalization and got strong-wrong beliefs about dreams if thats gonna help you to understand whats wrong. Thank you friends."
"Night owl problem Hi, this forum isn't very lively I'm afraid. Sorry you didn't get many responses. One thing that comes to my mind is melatonin. It's a hormone that regulates your circadian rhythm -- normally it should be at its highest level between midnight and 8am. You can buy OTC melatonin supplements and try that for a while. They sell really high dosages but 1-2 mg will be plenty. There is also a possibility you have a disorder the name of which handily escapes me which basically means that your sleeping rhythm is different from that of general population. (If you look through other people's posts it's been mentioned.) And finally, you might go to your doctor and request a *SHORT TERM* sleeping aid. Take it for a week or two (not more, ideally) around 11 and go to bed. I have used a few, and can recommend (es)zopiclone or diazepam/valium. Ambien is very popular but since it made me sleep-e-mail, sleep-purchase-things-from-Amazon and finally sleep-walk-into-a-metal-chair, injure myself and ruin the chair, I personally wouldn't recommend that one. However, of course, your mileage may vary. You don't mention what sort of anti-psychotics you used. Seroquel (quetiapine) in very low doses, like 25mg, can also serve as a sleeping aid. If you've used that for a long time during daytime, your circadian rhythm might be out of whack indeed. So if melatonin doesn't do the trick I'd recommend you see a doctor about your sleep problem. Hugs -- I hope you catch some zzzs soon! Currently working on my upcoming signature."
"Night owl problem Oliveira: sleep-purchase-things-from-Amazon at least it wasn't sleep-purchase-boatloads of bad pornography. Anyways Sam...I used to be that way. Then at some point I quit sleeping altogether except a few hours here and there. That's when I started taking diphenhydramine. It's the same thing as allergy medicine so I think its fairly safe ...I've been taking it a very long time. Melatonin didn't work for me and gave me nightmares (not saying it wont work for you). And I'm not into prescription meds. If I slept fine during the day still ...I would be all about it. Actually, I really miss that. Those were the days."
"Night owl problem green m+m wrote: Oliveira: sleep-purchase-things-from-Amazon at least it wasn't sleep-purchase-boatloads of bad pornography. Luckily not! But it transpired that while I was asleep I made the order, got a confirmation mail, deleted it, then really went to sleep. I was shocked when a few days later a parcel with books turned up. I had them in ""things to buy later"" folder, and obviously while asleep I decided, what the heck, buying 'em now! Currently working on my upcoming signature."
"Night owl problem thanks for answers, about my medical history i used several of drugs including seroquel, mirtazapine, zyprexa, olanzapine based drugs mostly and risperidon with faverin, i know the fact about melatonin and it's supplements but i was really addicted to many medical drugs so if i swallow anything from a box i am going to look forward for more trust me i know my self so i need something like therapy or someone to talk, except the melatonin my sleep disorder causing because some of my problems like ocd if you have any advices or talk about my worries please leave me something to contact, and about the doctor's help i can not take it now cause of my education i'm livin on like country for now and i've lost my trust to psychiatrists/psychologists like a year ago thank you again for your care and help ^^"
Night owl problem I would suggest going to bed 1 hour earlier or at least half and hour earlier. After a few days you can change your bedtime schedules again and go to bed half and hour earlier than before. After a few weeks of doing it you could be going to bed 4 hours earlier and so on. That would be a step by step solution. You might also wanna try some self hipnosis to fall asleep earlier.
"Sleep problem, need help! I am a person who goes to bed by 10 pm because I am too sleepy by that time. The problem is, when I wake up to use the loo, I cannot go back to sleep that easy. Sometimes, it would take two hours before I can sleep again. What I did lately is to get up from bed and do some paper work to pass the time. I get sleepy at 9am so I go back to bed to sleep for an hour. This has been going on for a month now. I got headaches and my eyes hurt. I know this is unhealthy but I don't know what to do? an you give advice please!"
I can't sleep when I need to Okay. When I REALLY need to sleep I can sleep but I usually want to sleep at class and I am very tired but when I arrive home I can't sleep or I don't want to. I sleep eight hours and I am eighteen. I think I need to sleep 10 hours but I can't. At weekends I wake up at seven and half like every day or maybe one hour later. Sometimes I try so hard to not wake up that when I see the sun shining I believe that I woke up at 11 but I woke up at nine at most. Poor sleeping makes me tired
"I can't sleep when I need to Hi CatSlave, you mention the sun shining through -- I gather your bedroom isn't very dark in the mornings. For me personally sleeping in a room that isn't completely dark is out of question. Did you consider blinds or even better light-blocking curtains? For us people with sleep problems it is good to have proper sleep hygiene. Meaning: 1) going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day; 2) not using your bedroom for any activities other than sleep or sex (so no reading in bed); 3) ""cleaning up your thoughts"" before sleep -- spend five minutes trying to brush (I literally imagine a brush) any thoughts about tomorrow or the day that passed aside, and go to your happy place where you can relax. I imagine sitting on the beach by a bonfire, in the middle of the night, trees behind me. I imagine the noise the waves make in the greatest detail, and then I fall asleep. Big hugs, hope this helps a bit! Currently working on my upcoming signature."

"Plank Position Hello all, New to the forums. I couldn't find help as to why recently I've taken up an odd sleep position lately. Nor can I find any mention of anyone actually sleeping like my husband has been recently finding me. I start off sleeping normally on my side. I sleep on either side and usually alternate. I seem to be having a lot of neck pain and shoulder pain as of late and mentioned it to my husband. He told me he's caught me at least 4 times recently sleeping in a sort of ""plank"" position. Apparently, I settle my weight on my forearms, head hanging towards the bed. My head just hanging there. Doesn't that sound weird to anyone else? I've never heard of anyone sleeping like that. I've added an image to help you visualize how I am sleeping, The difference with this picture is that of course my abs are contracting so my lower body apparently is lying flat and it's just my chest and head that are the odd one's out. And also, just be clear, no, I do not do this exercise or go to a gym so I am at a loss. lol http://postimg.org/image/m7r0bwz4x/"
"New problem, confused and scared Hi there, About me - I'm 21y/o female, pretty healthy, very physically active (hiking, climbing, etc). My whole life I've described myself as a 'morning person' and generally wake up around 8 am on my own. I'm in a new dorm room at college and my side of the room gets zero natural light - what comes through shines on the door, not on my living space. Mostly my roommate keeps the blinds halfway down and the divider between our sides shut, though. Since I moved in, I've been having more and more trouble with my sleeping patterns. I can't fall asleep until 2-4 am, no matter what I do - total darkness and for hours, but no sleep. Then I can't wake up until 11am-1pm, no matter how many alarms I set. One morning, I set 10 separate alarms and slept through them all (my roommate told me). Ocassionally, I wake up for a minute to hit snooze, but then I fall asleep sitting up. I read about Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, and it's the only thing I've found that fits, but is it possible to experience this, or something like it, temporarily due to light deprivation? I feel so helpless, like it doesn't matter what I try, and I've never been like this before. I'm failing classes for the first time in my life because I can't wake up. More importantly, if I can start sleeping next to a window again (for normal light cycles), will I go back to normal? p.s I know that I need to seek professional help as well, but as I understand it, diagnosis can take a while and there aren't any specialists near me - I need help NOW, please"
"Did I experience Sleep Paralysis? Let me say that lately I have been having loads of anxiety issues and panic attacks, and it seems to be infiltrating my dreams now. Last night something horrible happened, and i'm going to try my best to describe it. After a day of drunkenness (about six beers) I fell asleep at maybe 10 or so. I remember having some problems getting to sleep and staying asleep, but I was eventually able to. I remember it was probably 2 AM or so, when I ""woke up"" to find things not quite right. There was a weird feeling in my chest and head, kind of like waves going through me, or a pressure. I had fallen asleep with a movie on my laptop (Spirited Away) but I remember specifically seeing "" The Ring "" playing on my laptop when I ""woke up"" (I never watched The Ring at all last night) but it appeared that it was the little creepy girl from The Ring on my screen, in a scene that is really in the movie. I don't remember much else besides a feeling of WANTING and NEEDING to wake my boyfriend up. I wanted to shake him and wake him up, because I was SURE I was dying and I wanted him to call an ambulance. But I couldn't. It was like a hundred pound weight was on me, and I was TERRIFIED. Finally (I can't remember how much time had passed) I was able to get myself out of bed slowly (this really happened, I think I was able to pull myself out of whatever was happening) and I quickly went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. My eyes were BLOODSHOT red, very red. and I got a washcloth and put hot water on it and put it on my face. I just remember being terrified ever since I woke up and for about the next 2 hours. So terrified I could not get back to sleep. I didn't want it to happen again. So I stayed up until about 4 and was finally able to get to sleep. I can't really describe how horrible I felt, it was just a feeling of dread the entire time. I don't really know what to think. I know that I kept waking up constantly after that, I couldn't sleep for very long. I've also been having bad nightmares as well. My boyfriend basically doesn't believe me and thinks i'm just crazy - which is insulting to me because it dismisses everything that I felt last night as something that i'm making up. Am I really crazy? Does this sound similar to anyone's experiences with Sleep Paralysis?"
"Being communicated to Hi, I'm new to this forum so have quite a few questions I want to ask. When I had just started at university I had an episode of sleep paralysis which was nothing unusual. My student accommodation was in a Victorian terrace house. In this episode I was paralysised in bed and I was looking over toward the wall. I got the usual fear of foreboding doom and sure enough a white ghostly figure appeared and floated toward me. As it got closer the noise in my head got louder (not sure if increased heart beat through fear causes this). The ""ghost"" stood at the side of the bed and pointed towards my alarm clock. For some reason I didn't want it to get to the alarm clock. I think I knew the alarm would soon be going off and would wake me out of the sleep paralysis. I managed to wriggle my little finger and this brought me out. I looked at the alarm clock to find out it had stopped! It was only battery operated, but even when I replaced the batteries the clock wouldn't work. Was that co-incidence or something a bit weird? My grandma who I was very close to had died in the months before I went to Uni."
"Severe Reoccuring Sleep Paralysis I'm hoping this is the right area to post this in. I feel like it's a sleep disorder because it has gotten to the point where it is a problem and affecting my life. When I was younger, I would experience sleep paralysis once every couple of months, and over the last few years it has gotten worse, and now I experience it multiple times a night. I've read that it usually happens when people are waking up, but with me it's always before I even fall asleep. I will lay down in my bed, and close my eyes, and try to sleep, and usually after a few minutes of laying there with my eyes closed,still awake and aware of my surroundings, I will get that feeling like I'm falling, and then I will just be stuck there in sleep paralysis, still aware of my surroundings, but unable to move. I do all the tricks to try and wake up, like wiggling my toes, or fingers, and just going with it and trying to relax, but it never works. Honestly it's confusing because it doesn't feel like I've fallen asleep at all in the first place. If I manage to relax, or move a limb, instead of waking up, I just experience falling and the paralysis all over again. The falling part usually lasts what feels like a few minutes, and causes a loud rushing sound, and makes it hard to concentrate on anything else, and once it stops, I become aware again of the fact that I can't move. This happens on a cycle over and over until I don't even know how much time has passed, and I'm just so exhausted that I can't even fight it anymore, I just lay there and let myself be paralysed and let myself feel like I'm falling. It's gotten to the point where trying to go to sleep has become very stressful. And because I go through the cycle of my paralysis and trying to wake up repeatedly so many times a night, by the time I do fall asleep, it's so hard to get up. If I don't have an alarm set in the morning, I will sleep for 12 hours, minimum, and nothing wakes me up. I don't understand whats happening. Or what to do about it. But I'm tired of going through how terrifying the sleep paralysis is, and then being totally exhausted and confused about life when it's over."
"Severe Reoccuring Sleep Paralysis Again, I notice the word 'terrifying' in your description (right about the time I wanted to ask you what else you were exactly experiencing).

"grumpy in the morning hello. i have this problem with my boyfriend, he's grumpy and mean in the morning. it looks like he isn't himself, he has this animalistic look in his eyes, he yells at me for something i did the day before or whatever he thinks of. and he won't stop also, i can cry and he will just go on. normally, he isn't like this at all. well, sometimes when he's mad or really irritated but not often. if i leave him alone for a half an hour he will be normal again. sometimes he yells at me in the middle of the night cause i'm coughing. he can't keep a normal biorhythm, he's awake at night, goes to bed in the morning, then decides he wants to wake up in the morning so he's awake for 30 hours and goes to sleep and then sleeps for 12+ hours. i think three weeks is the most he's kept a biorhythm of any kind. you can't really make definite plans with him cause you can never know if he'll be awake, and if he's sleeping tight there aren't many ways to wake him up. do you think this is a condition or is he just chaotic? It's not a question if I can fight by your side And withstand anything but I forgot that you said Girl, if you come You better bring your own sun"
"Sleep Paralysis? Hi, I didn't know whether to post this in the sleep disorder forum but I thought seeing as it's an isolated incident I would post it here and I've just read that it is thought to occur slightly more in people with mental health issues such as bipolar, ptsd or personality disorders. (I have 'suspected' BPD and currently awaiting treatment.) Last night, I believe I experienced 'sleep paralysis'. I had lots of crazy dreams last night, some traumatic. When this happened I was on the verge of waking up, sort of half asleep half awake. I can't remember what I was dreaming prior to it happening but I know it was something very dark. I found myself completely paralyzed. I remember feeling like something/someone was inside of me. I couldn't move a muscle, felt like I could hardly breathe and I couldn't talk. I was desperately trying to scream or talk but all that came out was this strange sound like a silent growl, the kind you see in movies when someone is getting possessed but just air coming out, no vocal whatsoever it just wouldn't work. It was truly horrifying and traumatic. My body just would not move. I tried as hard as I could for a long time. I felt like I was trying to use absolutely every ounce of energy in my body. This went on for a while and eventually I woke up. I have experienced dreams in the past where I'm trying to scream and nothing comes out, or I'm trying to run but my legs won't go, but this was just total and complete paralysis and I was semi conscious. After searching a little today I found out it is called sleep paralysis. Have any of you experienced it before? If so did it ever reoccur? I'm terrified to go to sleep tonight in case it happens again. Scary stuff. But also very interesting!"
"Sleep Paralysis? I have TOTALLY experienced it before and it is one of the most FRIGHTENING things I have ever experienIced...EVER. I have very vivid dreams. I joke to myself that they could become feature films with how detailed and dramatic they are. I would wake up but couldn't open my eyes. Couldn't move a muscle. I would scream but no sound came out. I would try to wiggle my fingers or toes to wake up. After an hour long struggle, I eventually wake up. Sometimes I have dreams within dreams to where I think I woke up, but I'm in another dream. What I realized was that certain sleeping positions triggered the paralysis more than others. I never sleep on my back or on my stomach anymore. For whatever reason (The back especially), I experienced sleep paralysis while laying in those positions. on my side holding a pillow gives the most relief. Welcome to the inner workings of my mind...."
"Sleep Paralysis? Yes, I have also had this and it is terrifying! It has only happened while sleeping on my back and while taking an afternoon nap, never at night. It feels like my body is asleep but my mind is awake. Like being trapped in your body. As you guys described, I will try to scream and nothing will come out, and will try with all my strength to move some part of my body, but nothing will move. I'm not sure what causes it. It hasn't happened to me in a long time and I hope it never happens again."
"Sleep Paralysis? Sleep paralysis is a totally normal body function and nothing to do with BPD. Your body goes into a state of paralysis when you are asleep to protect yourself - eg. so you don't fall out of bed. Occasssionally, everyone may be in that gradual state of waking when the mind becomes concious but before the body wakes up and moves out of its normal paralysis state. If it's never happened to you before it can be terrifying. Your mind feels partly awake, but your body feels like it can't move. Once you know what it is, it' s no big deal. Many people have this experience but later dismiss it as part of a dream."
"Sleep Paralysis? PamHelf wrote: Sleep paralysis is a totally normal body function and nothing to do with BPD. 100% true. Sleep paralysis can happen to anybody, doesn't matter what kind of illness the person has or doesn't have. It's caused by some disturbances due to the fact that your brain wakes up a little before your body does - hence you cannot move, that's why it's called a paralysis. Anyway - I've experienced it ONCE a few years ago, and I totally agree with HurricaneAsh: that was the most frightening thing EVER . Scared a s*** out of me. Considering that I fear demons and ghosts (too many horrors read in the childhood) - I'm still surprised my hair didn't go grey."
"Sleep Paralysis? I think that it is of interest that many of you refer to feelings of fear or of being terrified.... could there be something more to this?

"Falling asleep even with 8-9 hours I tend to get 7-9 hours of sleep every night, yet I still have problems staying awake during the day. Just last night for example, I went to sleep at 1AM and woke up at 8:30. Today I fell asleep at 5:00PM and didn't wake back up until 9:15PM. I eat lots of healthy foods and I exercise fairly regularly. I also feel sore many times when I wake up. I am always falling asleep at the worst possible times, my girlfriend thinks I don't care about her and just sleep because I want to, but I physically cannot stay awake all the time. Anyone know what this may be? I don't think narcolepsy because when I start feeling tired I can stay awake if I need to, it's just an overwhelming desire to sleep."
"Desperately looking for some answers :( Something weird happens to me in my sleep. The only way I can describe it is dreaming while I'm awake. It happens every night; I can see that I'm in my bed, yet my brain seems to think I'm somewhere else -- doing other things. I will use my sheets and pillows as if they're other items. I can see while this is happening that they are clearly just sheets and pillows but this doesn't snap me out of it. There are always other people involved in these ""dreams"" but I don't see them while my eyes are open; all I can see is my bedroom as it is, nothing abnormal -- no actual hallucinations. Usually I'll just sit up in my bed while this is happening, but there are times where I'll get out of my bed and walk around. The most common occurrence of this is me being ""kicked out"" of my bed because I'll think that I'm not actually in my room (yet I can see that I am). These ""dreams"" are never of a positive nature. There's always some type of conflict or I'll have anxiety about whatever is happening. The most recent reoccurring theme (lasted about 5 nights) was of me and my friend driving through the mountains. Either my brakes weren't working properly or something else was going wrong. I'd just be sitting up in my bed looking around, seeing clearing that I was in my room, but believing I was driving. I can't say how long these episodes last. I'm guessing anywhere between 2-10 minutes. It ends by me just laying back down and closing my eyes. I never actually ""snap out of it"" and realize that I'm just dreaming, I kind of just go back to sleep. It's hard to say what actually happens at that point. I'm pretty sure It only happens once per night, but I could be wrong -- I could be having several small episodes spread out throughout the night and just be remembering it as one single episode. I don't know. That's pretty much it. I've tried melatonin but that doesn't help. The only time it doesn't happen is if I'm sleeping somewhere else, such as a friends house or on a trip somewhere. As soon as I get back home, it happens again. I've tried switching rooms but to no avail. Every morning I wake up feeling extremely tired so it's definitely effecting my sleep in some way. Can anybody tell me what this is and what I can do about it? Thank you for reading!"
"Desperately looking for some answers :( The weirdest thing is that it doesn't happen anywhere but your house. Is it possible there is some sort of sonic interference that almost-but-not-entirely wakes you up? Something that comes from your neighbours? Did you try sleeping in another room? Also, maybe this is a silly question, but did you see a doctor about it? Currently working on my upcoming signature."

There's nothing I can think of that would be causing any type of ""sonic interference"" other than maybe the satellite dish on my neighbors roof. I've talked to my doctor about It but he wasn't much help. I asked him to prescribe me clonazepam but he didn't think it was a good idea so he gave me a sleep aid instead (zopiclone if i'm not mistaken). It leaves a horrible bitter taste in my mouth so I don't use it. I've been trying to find a ""sleep doctor"" but haven't had any luck yet."
"Desperately looking for some answers :( I'm using zopiclone but it's not really an answer. First, it's addictive. Second, yeah, the taste is not fun (although I find it weirdly comforting now, like ""I had the pill, sleep will come"").

"Restless sleep Hello everyone, So here's the thing: I am 25 years old. I think I've had unrefreshing sleep and trouble sleeping since childhood. When I finally decided to do something about it, I've done every single thing I could. DAILY, I meditate, do sports, cook own meals (according to SCD diet guidelines- basically only vegetables and meat). Sleep hasn't improved. Only thing that drives me during day is some energy I get from my routine. during sleep, I toss and turn a lot. Its not restless legs syndrome, just tossing and turning every 20 minutes for the duration of night. also had depression, this seems to be gone by mindfulness based cognitive therapy. on top of that, I do some concentration exercises so they equal each other out. I'm calm and I do what needs to be done during daylife. Feeling when I try to sleep when I already had normal hours of sleep (i'm usually sleepy anyway) is like there's something in my head that pevent's sleep. I know this sounds silly, but I can go and fall asleep instantly only after I'm really tired. Anything other is tossing, turning until I sleep and then tossing turning anyway. May this be that my brain doesn't switch off? I've talked to doctors about this, and they say tossing and turning isn't sleep disorder symptom. they say it may be psychological. I have 1 meditation session before lunch and 2 concentration sessions after I wake up and before sleep. I rarely go out of home because of fatigue I feel after walking a lot. and in teenage years I had active life. this exhaustion of mine seems to get stronger and routines I have seem to have less and less effect. I also dropped interacting with people because all I think about is my fatigue and how to cure it. I believe I also have autism, pure mindfulness based cognitive therapy seems to cure it, I was able to ineract with people but was too emotional with them and couldn't get daily things done, so started to do concentration exercises. forgot to mention that when I went to sleep at 11PM and got up at 6AM daily for about 4 months, it got worse when I started to sleep in my spare time ( yes, it sounds silly but even not doing anything during day makes me feel tired) I've listed here all that I know for sure about me, my symptoms. There isn't even decent sleep disorder clinic in post-soviet country of mine so I feel i'll waste my money by going there. I've paid money for quality doctors and their answer before taking money was: we don't know what's happening with you. would someone Please explain or guide me what's happening with me? May it be some hidden cancer symptoms or anything? Because with so much I do to keep my health up I'm still where I was a year ago- tired, always wanting to sleep person. Many tnanks"
"Restless sleep It sounds like you do a lot of great things to deal with your mood-stress. Often not being able to sleep is a ""somatic symptom"" of depression or anxiety. Do you find your mind thinking about things a lot at night when your trying to sleep? And also do you drink coffee-soda or products containing caffeine within 6-7 hours before you go to sleep? Also a comprehensive medical check up might be a good idea to help rule out any medical causes. If you already had one, I would suggest getting another one, or going to a sleep specialist. Hope this helps -Dan"
"Restless sleep Most of us have experienced trouble sleeping at one time or another. This is actually normal and usually short-term, due to stress or even other outside factors. But if insomnia are a typical occurrence and restrict your everyday life, you can be suffering from a sleep problem. Sleep issues cause in excess of just sleepiness. The not enough quality sleep can have a negative influence on your energy, emotional balance, and wellness. If you’re enduring sleeping problems, learn regarding the symptoms connected with common insomnia issues, what you can apply to assist yourself, and once to go to the doctor."
"Calling All Night Owls Are you a night owl? If so you could you have delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD). DSPD is a poorly understood circadian rhythm sleep disorder. Sufferers fall do not fall asleep until the early hours of the morning and sleep in late. They perform best at night. (creativity, thought processes, etc) and the disorder usually runs in families. Onset is in childhood or adolescence. I tick all of the boxes. Take a look at this link for more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sl ... e_syndrome"
"Calling All Night Owls I was just diagnosed with this several days ago, at 25. I've been living in a 28-30 hour daily schedule for 3 weeks now and I feel so fantastic. I'm alert through the day and I get tired at bed time. I had a lot of difficulties in my life as a result of it. If only I had known about this earlier! Now to find a way to earn a living on this crazy schedule, lol."
"Calling All Night Owls I know I have this. Have had it since I was a kid. Cannot adjust to 1st shift jobs so I've always tried to avoid. I do my best at night. In daytime, I dont feel awake. Sometimes I can go for up to 48 hrs of no sleep. I've tried to sleep normal, and maybe it will last for 2 days. Then its back to the night shift. Anyone mind if I suck their blood? ""Dracula voice"" Become what you are."
"Calling All Night Owls Very interesting...this seems to be exactly what I experience. I sleep a solid 8 hours 90%+ of the time, but it just happens to be between 5 am and 1 pm, and has been this way for a good 20 years. I can modify it a couple hours in one way or the other, but it always seems to snap back to that schedule."
"Calling All Night Owls This past week I've been like the rest of the world. Sports have started up for me so I'm tons more active. But one night I actually slept too much, which is rare. I still dont feel mentally productive in the day. Only thing I feel productive at is sports or gym. Become what you are."
"Calling All Night Owls I'm like this, but the only issue I see is that society refuses to accomodate those of us who are just more comfortable and awake at night. The night time is beautiful, quiet, calming. The day time is hectic, hot, noisy. I don't see the appeal in the sun whatsoever. Nobody would consider me having a ""problem"" if I could just as easily work and go to school as everyone else, but at night instead of the day. But because the ""people in charge"" like the blinding light and suffocating heat and crowds that infest the daylight hours, I'M the weird one."
"Calling All Night Owls I think I've got DSPD. Right now it's 1:14 in the morning, and I won't be able to fall asleep until 5 or 6 at least. I'll probably get up at 1 or 2 in the afternoon and take a nap later in the day. Kind of sucks, too, because I have a chronic neurological disorder that has ruined my night vision. So even if I could, by some miracle, find a job schedule that would accomodate for my weird sleep habits, I can't transport myself at night. Life is fun that way."
Calling All Night Owls I only just now have been able to put a name to what I have been experiencing and I cannot currently get an official diagnosis but this is kind of alarming for me. I'm not entirely sure when it started but all the time now it has been that I am staying awake later and later into the night. I find it impossible to sleep until at least midnight and often until morning light.
"Calling All Night Owls I've always been a night owl, ever since I was a baby. Considering I run anywhere on 4-6 hours of sleep normally and trying to be sleepy is a pain, I always thought I was an insomniac. I'm a psych. major in college now, and it's starting to take its toll with an 8am course I do love it though whenever we get to go over sleep disorders because I just sit there with a grin and think 'please, tell me more.' Sleep is a very interesting thing to me, partially because it takes a while to achieve. Once I'm out, I can sleep upwards to 9-11 hours, but it's usually around 5-6. I do get some...unusual consequences though. I walk around and a lot of interaction feels like it's done through a window pane, kinda muddled. I do have a strong tendency to zone out and daydream though; always have. My thoughts are racy, but they tend to get worse and juggle three things at once immediately after waking up. Does anyone else get this? ""There is a road, no simple highway, Between the dawn and the dark of night, And if you go no one may follow, That path is for your steps alone."" -Grateful Dead Ripple"
"Calling All Night Owls i been having problems with staying up too late for a couple years. i always feel wired at night even if the last sleep i got was like ages ago. back when i was being homeschooled it was a real pain because i would stay up until one or two and then have to get up at nine, so i was totally wiped out all the time. except at night of course XD now ive been doing online school for the last couple months i actually feel awake during the day (or whenever im up) because i can follow my own sleep schedule for once. if you take any given point in the day, theres about a sixty percent chance ill be awake, my sleep schedule is that ###$ up. my cousin bill is kind of like me because he stays up until like two and only gets up for dinner. we like to hang out at night and watch CSI together. i am different than him though because he actually has a somewhat regular schedule and i have nothing like that. it drives my aunt mad but she doesnt have any rules about it. yet. i remain hopeful about that."
"Hallucinations and sleepwalking Hey everyone, I've had a weird type of parasomnia for as long as I can remember, and I am unable to find a name for it. It usually happens when I had an emotional day, and usually after 3 or 4 hours of sleep (in the middle of the night, so to speak). To be as clear as possible, I am going to give you last night's example: I work as a camera operator, and yesterday we had quite a difficult shoot, where I made a few mistakes. Nevertheless, I didn't feel too worried, as I know these things can happen. But then, when I wen't to sleep, I ""woke up"" at about 2:30 am with this feeling that I was right in the middle of a shoot. I was aware that there was nobody in my room, but I had this feeling that people could see me and hear me, like they were just behind my door. I wasn't scared - the main feeling really was embarrassment. When I woke up, I was dressed up (I felt like my coworkers could see me in my pijamas, and so I got dressed!), and some items around my bed had moved, like I had tried to make the place look more tidy. Although I can't say that I was awake, I have very clear memories of what I was going through. I remember thinking at some point ""no way, they can't be in my room, it makes no sense"", but then the sensation took over again. That being said, I have no idea of how long it lasted, and I can't remember dressing up, although I can recall moving stuff around. I must also say that there were no actual hallucinations: I couldn't see no hear anybody. The best way I can describe it is this: it's like being in a room and knowing that behind the close door there are people, even though you can't hear them. Once again, it's not a scary feeling, it's just really stressful. So... does anyone have experienced something similar? Does it have a name? I must say I can easily live with this parasomnia, because it's not really giving me a hard time, but most of all I am quite curious, cause I've never met someone who has something similar. Well, thanx for reading me!"
"Why snoring can ruin a relationship I do not want this to seem like a pity party, but I do want to get it off my chest because it is really bothering me. I snore very loudly, to the point where it may wake me up at night and I do not wake up feeling refreshed in the slightest (I wake up very tired). When I got married, I figured that she would be OK with this issue or at least understand. Whereas we would spend most nights together before we got married (we did have two apartments back then), nowadays I have been sent to the couch more times than I care to remember. It just makes me feel bad because I feel as though I am upsetting her sleep, but at the same time it annoys me because I am not actively doing anything to make her tired – it just happens. Is there anyone who might have some advice on what I should do? Maybe how to approach the subject? Thank you. *mod edit* Last edited by Oliveira on Mon May 12, 2014 4:26 pm, edited 1 time in total.

"Interrupted I've qlways struggled with sleep, 'seduced' by the night, and I've always had vivid dreams, usually coming and going in phases. When I was younger I used to sleepwalk and talk, but I don't think I do much in my sleep anymore. I've pretty much become nocturnal, staying awake until anytime between 3am and not falling asleep at all. If I do sleep, it's usually until late afternoon (3ish 4ish), where I am met by either my.mum or older sister calling me or saying how frustrating it is trying to wake me up. They usually say they have repeatedly tried to wake me up, but I can only usually recall the one time, when I do get up. I feel like I need more space before I can even sort out my sleep habits, (my bed is in the hallway in an alvove). I also scare myself by overimagining sounds/ visuals, that scare me, and I feel really active in the night. I'm fine with my sleeping habits, even though a rational, sane person shouldn't be, but then again I'm not entirely sane or rational, so that probably explains a lot. I just feel crap being a burden on my family, who have started getting more and more irritated at me and my odd sleeping cycles. I don't really know what to do about it :/"
"Interrupted that. is. so. creepy. i have the exact same life as you! my room is the hallway closet under the stairs, i go to sleep at the same times, and every afternoon like clockwork my aunt comes and bangs on my door trying to wake me up for dinner. stayed up all night last night listening to dubstep and watching sh*tty late-night tv. and here i was thinking it was just me."
"Tired then wide awake and so on throughout day? Hi, I've got a problem where every single day I wake up feeling either energized, or like I got no sleep at all. And whichever one I woke feeling like, will switch to the other and vis versa throughout the day. These periods don't happen at all during specific times of the day, but I just switch between tired and energized randomly. And it's not just a normal tired- I feel foggy, and it's difficult to talk or focus, I'm very irritable and hard to make conversation with. Then, an hour later I'll be super alert and focused and talking non stop and jumping around! During my tired periods I can barely hold my head up. It's impacted my life because I can't go to outings or parties with my friends, or even dinner, without getting super tired and irritable and falling half asleep. Although I'm tired during these periods, I usually just fall half asleep but never go into any sort of deep REM. I've been diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia, and a mild form of anxiety. I'm currently perscribed Modafinil 100MG and Lexapro 20mg but neither seem to help my sleepy/awakeness. The switches throughout the day happen with or without medicine. I'm sick and tired of my body being unreliable, and not being to consistently stay alert! Even if I get 9 hours of sleep (which I do on a normal night) I never feel fully rested throughout the day. My eating schedule is normal, and I'm very active in working out. Medium stress level. Does anyone else have this problem or know what it is?? Thank you so much!"
"Polyphasic sleep as a solution? I've just been reading about delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), which is a disorder that makes you a night owl. You feel like you perform best during the night feeling alert and awake whereas during the day you would just sleep, sleep and sleep. I could say that I have DSPD, but that's not the point, because I'm aware that this disorder, at least in my case, has it's origin in my social anxiety. I'd rather sleep, instead of having to deal with people, and then when everyone is asleep during the night time I'd reach my energy peak. During the day time I have moments when I'm feeling like I'm about to fall asleep while standing. Sometimes I just feel so tired. And I know it's a sort of vicious circle, because if I don't get a proper sleep during the night, then I will be dead tired during the day. But in the end, it's my choice not to sleep like everyone else, because it's an easy way out for me. OK, so that was me and my messed up sleeping routine. Now, here comes the part related to my question. Today when I woke up around 11 am I was feeling very low and wasn't feeling like getting up at all. I was waiting for my roommates to leave for their classes, before I finally got up. I absolutely hate having to see anyone in the mornings when I wake up. It's one of the worst things ever. I remember back home, I couldn't stand the idea of seeing my own parents in the morning so I was just waiting them out, getting up just after they left home even though I knew I would be late for my classes because of that. Back to the point, today I went to sleep around 5 am and woke up at 11 am feeling like $#%^. Then around 7 pm, I started feeling very sleepy. (Now that I think back to it, coincidentally[?] it was around the same time when my roommates started coming back home.) Anyway, at 7 pm I took a 1 hour nap. The thing is that when I woke up I felt just amazing and what's important had no symptoms of social anxiety. I woke up, went to the kitchen to make myself some tea or something and actually felt very comfortable around people. Normally I'm so self-conscious, it's basically impossible to truly enjoy anyone's companionship (unless I'm very drunk.) This time I actually talked to people, not out of a painful neceessity, but simply because I felt like being friendly. It's actually not the first time, that after taking a nap I feel so good I'm able to storm into the kitchen without giving two sh*ts about people around me. No comparison between how I felt after my today's attempt at getting a night's sleep and after this nap. And I started thinking. If naps as opposed to full time sleep can make me feel so good, why not give up on full time sleeping altogether and substitute it with naps. I googled „no sleep only naps” and what I got is polyphasic sleep. Does anyone have any experience with it? I'm willing to give it a try, since my sleeping routine is already pretty messed up. Any ideas on how this works? Or why today I felt so much better after the nap than the 6 hours “night” sleep? Did anyone have similar experiences? I know that there may be no strict correlation between napping and feeling good, it all may have been accidental, I may not be able to repeat this, and it may not work in the long run but I guess I will never find out, unless I give it a try."
"Polyphasic sleep as a solution? Considering that I just had another day without getting proper sleep I'd like to share some more thughts on the topic. I would also like to add some questions concerning sleep deprivation. Have you ever noticed that after not getting enough sleep you get more creative? Like all of sudden you're able to come up with solutions that have never occured to you before. I'd even say that it kind of feels as if my IQ went up. Also I remember that when I was back home sleep depravation would result in poetry writing. I've read somwhere that sleep deprivation somehow disturbs the normal way brain wavelenghts work. I think it wasin the context of bashing the old fashioned forensic method of determining someone's sanity based on the graph of their brain wavelengths. The conclusion was that there's no use to it if a person who didn't get enough sleep last night gets a graph of similarly disrupted brain wavelengths as a person who for example suffers from schizophrenia. Also some time ago I noticed that sleep deprivation works as a sort of solution for my hightened self-consciousness and nervousness. It could be that it's because when I don't sleep I'm too tired to be even bothered with what other people say and do. It sometimes feels as if thare always were some sort of white noise in my head that disappears when I don't get enough sleep. And then I'm finlly able to get a clear vision, I'm calmer and more detached. I'm really wondering if that's how normal people around me feel like all the time. Anyone has similar experiences with sleep deprivation or any thoughts or helpful advices on polyphasic sleep?"
"Polyphasic sleep as a solution? In bipolar disorder sleep deprivation works as one of the triggers for hypomania or mania, which are both creative phases (sometimes over-creative, though). No idea if this would also work the same way with a non-bipolar person though. Currently working on my upcoming signature."
Polyphasic sleep as a solution? I should not give any advice have not practice much at all. But I like on of the many schemes. ¤ hour some awaken rest and then some 4 hours again seems my body like that one better than others I have tested. Only problem it needs some discipline to give body signals so that one don't miss the windows of opportunity to fast go into deep sleep again. I imagine one can get two deep sleep this way but I only wild guess.
"My sleep cycles don't make any sense. I've been having this problem for years. In fact it's hard to tell for how long because ever since I was a baby I've been sleeping for ""too long""... but recently, since I've not been in school or had a job, or anyone forcing me to wake up at any particular time, I've had problems with my sleep cycle slipping around so that I'm nocturnal. I've done some research and think I might fit the pattern of Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome except... It's so random? some days i'll sleep for nine hours and then the next I'll sleep for fifteen. It's like my brain is just generating random numbers and deciding to sleep for that amount of time, and the same thing for wakefulness. it's starting to worry me because everybody says that sleeping too much or sleeping at the wrong times can cause health problems but i don't know whether trying to force myself to sleep ""normally"" will help me or hurt me."
"Sleeping problem - Help needed Hi, I've had this problem for about 2 years now, but I don't know how to categorize it or if it is indeed a sleeping disorder, but here are some of the signs below: - I struggle to get to sleep until at least 1:30-3:00am every night. I just don't feel the urge to go to sleep, it is normally the last thing on my mind. - Most of the time I shall sleep in because of this. My sleeping pattern is really messed up. - I always feel sleepy and irritable during the day, which makes it hard for me to concentrate during the day, especially at college. - I never feel refreshed after a nights sleep, even if I get 8 hours sleep in. I don't remember the last time I actually had a good nights sleep. - Because I don't feel refreshed my reactions at times become are very slow. - I have constant swollen black bags under my eyes. They have gotten worse as the weeks go by. - I am usually forced to take a nap every day, normally after college, because of being so tired throughout the day. - I take caffeine tablets on a daily basis to keep me going (I know this isn't a good idea but it's the only thing that seems to build me up) The worst part about this problem is that even though I struggle to get to sleep, I seem to struggle to wake up to. I can fall asleep at 2, but then sleep in for nearly the full day, but even then I STILL don't feel fully refreshed. This is really messing up my sleeping patterns and affecting my college work. I don't know whether to tell my doctor or not, some help would be very appreciated. Thanks."
"Sleeping problem - Help needed I'm not a doctor, psych or professional. So these are just a random person's thoughts, not formal advice. I would usually suggest talking to a doctor. Just to rule out various problems and to get further support. But, I think perhaps it would be good to look at what you could change first. And then if it doesn't help, that's a good time to get a professional opinion. So, here's a list of things you could try. Ideally, all of them! But whatever you can manage is helpful. Either it'll improve things. Or it's something that you can rule out as having an effect. First, set yourself a bedtime and stick to it. You're in a routine already, but it's not working for you. I'd suggest starting to wind down at 10pm. Get away from all screens, make sure the lights are dim. A bath if that's possible may help to relax you. Some reading [not homework, textbooks, horror novels or anything electronic] might be good. Then head to bed about 11pm and do relaxation exercises, meditation, breathing exercises. Whatever slows your brain down enough to rest. Not necessarily sleep, although hopefully that will happen with time. Second, set yourself a wake-up time. If you're under 25, 8am is a good starting point. [8 hours probably isn't enough sleep for you. People vary, some need 10+ to be functional. Listening to your body over time should help to fine-tune this for you.] Make yourself get out of bed at that time. All the evil techniques you can think of! The alarm on the other side of the room. Family members asked to throw wet flannels at you if you aren't out of bed in time. Whatever you can think of that will work. A glass of water before sleeping might be enough to make your bladder persuade you out of bed when the alarm goes. Third, stop the caffeine. Taper it down during the week, then stop completely over a weekend. Yes, it will be very very hard work. But it's good as an occasional boost. Bad on a daily basis. You're essentially self-medicating with caffeine. If it was working, that'd be OK. Since it isn't, it's good to get it out of your system for the moment. Fourth, you don't mention exercise. That's a really helpful part of good sleep patterns. Even half an hour of walking daily will do the trick. If you can do more, that's better. Best to do it before the evening, in case you get an endorphin rush from it. [This has rarely happened to me. But some people go on about it. And it seems like it'd prevent sleep.] Fifth, you don't mention diet. If you eat lots of sugar, that's something else to try and cut down on. It means you'll be having huge energy swings depending on what you've eaten. Which could be contributing to difficulty sleeping. I'm not suggesting going to an all-lentil diet. Just, aim for healthy if you can. Sixth, do what you can to improve your sleeping environment. If it's noisy, maybe a white noise generator [fan, or do a YouTube search for 9+ hour long white noise videos.] Or earplugs. If it's stuffy, is it possible to have a window open? If it's messy, does this affect your mood? [Some people are fine, others rest better in an organised room.] Is your bed comfortable? Is it neither too cold or too warm? Some of these are major changes. And most of them will be difficult to stick to. But a doctor is likely to suggest similar stuff. Or, worse, prescribe sleeping pills. Then you have those to sleep, caffeine to wake up, and that's not a fun way to live. If you do all these, and your sleep doesn't start to improve, then do get checked out. There are other things that can cause broken sleep, such as snoring, serious breathing issues, and so on. If you live somewhere with access to a sleep clinic, they can do a more detailed study. But I'd cover the basics first in case it's something simple. Let us know how you get on! LOTS of people come here with similar issues. It's always good to read what works or doesn't. “ We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. ” Charlie Chaplain in The Great Dictator"
"Sleeping problem - Help needed I suggest not drinking any coffee 6 hours before the time you are meant to go to bed... Also, yes avoid major sugar rich foods before bed in any great quantity... What has worked for me is 5htp. I take it one hour before I go to bed. It helps you get a deep sleep, it helps getting to sleep. It also increases seratonin and reduces anxiety during the day. Give it a go but do not take it with antidepressants. Google 5htp benefits..."
"Sleeping problem - Help needed I read your sleeping problem.I'm not a doctor, I was also suffered from sleep apnea problems but i'm all right now.I think if you manage your life style means your wake up time ,your sleeping time ,daily exercise ,yoga then your sleeping problem is solve.Because sleeping problem is basically start from our lifestyle if we go to late night party in starting period of time these become serious and effect on our body. Secondly,identify your sleeping disorders causes like stress ,family problems any other .If you daily life is normal then you come out from sleeping problem"
Sleeping problem - Help needed To get rid from this disorder try following ways i think this will help you.. 1.Keep a daily sleep schedule and wake up at same time every day. 2.Keep your room cool and quiet. 3.Do relaxation Exercise before sleeping. 4.Caffeine and alcohol will cause sleeping patterns so try to avoid the intake of caffeine and alcohol 5.Also take warm bath before your bedtime.
"Sleeping problem - Help needed While it has been brought up before, I think it is worth exploring whether you are having issues with sleep apnea. Those symptoms sound extremely familiar – sleeping enough to ‘supposedly’ make it through the day, only to find out that you are utterly exhausted when you wake up. This might also explain why the caffeine offers some brief relief."
"Sleeping problem - Help needed *mod edit* First , go speak wit your doctor. He obviously has the most knowledge and would know how to cope with this. Second , set a permanent bedtime and wake up time . study shows that college students should get at least 9 hours of sleep. Make sure to have a couple of alarms so you don't sleep past your wake up time . As for bedtime , try to be in a relaxed state of mind. get away from anything that could distract you from sleeping. try being in a dark room with the fan on and do a little bit of meditation if you like. Third , exercise ! its important to get at least 1 hour of exercise daily . if your tight financially do pushups , sit ups or run around your block a few times , this will not only help you with sleep , but it will also prevent you from major weight gain and increase your cardiovascular system . Last , get on a good eating regiment. this is so important because this is what keeps you going throughout the day. Get rid of those caffeine pills , they do nothing but give you energy for a limited time and then crash and make you feel sick and tired . I hope what I provided will do some good for you , help with your sleeping issue and make you a more healthy , energized , and overall happy person.

"Mandibular advancement devices for snoring? Hey everyone, Wanted to ask you all for some input on an issue that has been bothering my wife and I for a while now. I've been having a lot of trouble with snoring – It hasn't been bothering me so much, other than not feeling quite rested after sleep – but it is really driving my wife crazy. It has gotten so bad that we spend about half the time in different beds. That really annoys me – I don't want to sleep apart from my wife! It started maybe 8 months or so ago. At first, we tried to brush it off and get used to it, but as the sleepless nights turned into weeks and months, both of us got tired quick. And I feel terrible, you know? We both work and even then it's hard to make ends meet. If we can't get enough sleep after a hard day, we slowly turn into zombies... We've had “walking dead” periods of a few weeks or even a couple months before. It's not fun. But going to a doctor is, unfortunately for now, out of the (financial) question. My wife doesn't need her beauty sleep – she needs her survival sleep. And I'm getting in the way of that! Anyway, I was searching the net for some sort of cure or product that could help me, and I stumbled across a website reviewing something called a VitalSleep MAD – this website hehttp://www.topsnoringmouthpieces.com/re ... italsleep/ . The MAD stands for “mandibular advancement device”, which is really just a fancy way of saying that it holds your jaw in a forward position, and thus (supposedly) ensures a free flow of air through your body. Because apparently it's a very relaxed jaw that drops down and blocks your airways at night, which makes sense – if I try snoring on purpose by laying down and letting my jaw “drop”, my airways are blocked. This is a problem that is affecting my marriage and my health, and adding a heap of stress onto my already hectic everyday life. We're not financially well-off enough to go to a doctor, but I've also learned that it is best to take a step back every time you feel like dropping 70 bucks out of desperation on an uncertain product. Take a step back, and ask people who might have experience with these things. So I'm turning to you all. Pretty please, with a cherry on top – tell me about your experience (if you have any) with this VitalSleep MAD, or any other mandibular advancement device? Thanks in advance!"
"I cannot wake up Hi everyone, this is basically my first post. I don't know if I have found the right forum section, but I will still try stating my problem here. I am a 26 year old woman. My problem is that I cannot wake up in the mornings by myself. This is not because I dont want to, it is because I simply do not wake up. I have to set an alarm every day, ever since I was young. If I do not set an alarm I wont wake up until noon or even way past noon. I go to bed at regular times between 22:30 and 24:00, which is why the fact that I can practically sleep forever confuses me so much. If I have work or anything else to do its not a problem getting up with an alarm set and i usually feel fine too. But once in a while it happens that my alarm fails (smartphone battery empty etc.) and then I wake up all dazed and confused at the latest hours. It is not that I feel good, because I had a good nap. I feel terrible. The whole day after waking up late is a blur and I cant focus or have energy for anything. I know this is weird, complaining about sleeping too much. Many people love to sleep. I mean yes, I have the possibility to avoid this happening by setting an alarm, every day of my life, but it just bugs me. I wonder why this happens and I wonder if there is anyone out there with the same problem maybe? It would be great if you could share your experiences or thoughts on this one. Thank you I sometimes wonder what is worse: the triviality of human interaction or the fact that no one notices."
"I cannot wake up In all likelihood, it is simply a matter of your own personal biological makeup, nothing being wrong at all. My fiancé has the same thing. Although she sets alarm after alarm every 5 minutes, and still she may not wake up for hours. Only when it's an absolute requirement is she able to wake up quickly. There isn't anything wrong with her, necessarily, simply not a ""morning person"". Conversely, I know of individuals who thrive on only 5 hours of sleep every night. Any more time and they feel overslept, any less and they feel as though they haven't gotten enough sleep. Personally, I can go to sleep at any time for any amount of time, and also stay awake for any amount of time (the latter, so long as I haven't been previously exhausted by other means). I usually also sleep through just about anything that would be natural. I've slept through tropical rain storms by the ocean, storms in which the thunder moved my bed around the room. But I'll wake up to something that shouldn't normally occur, such as a glass cup breaking, despite numerous walls and floors away from me. So everyone seems to be dramatically different when it comes to sleeping habits. Yours likely isn't anything too out of the ordinary either. However, you could always ask a doctor if you still feel uncomfortable. "" A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at. "" ~Bruce Lee"
"I cannot wake up Hello Ghost, thank you very much for your reply. I am curious about your fiancé, does she also feel exhausted after having slept too much? It just makes me wonder, why does my body want to sleep so much, when it is obviously not good for me. It would make total sense if I were exhausted before sleep, but AFTER I have slept makes me confused. But you're right, maybe it is just something physiological and a doctor can help with that. I sometimes wonder what is worse: the triviality of human interaction or the fact that no one notices."
"I cannot wake up She does indeed. My personal guess would still pertain to physiological properties. Just because it's not good for the general public, doesn't mean your body doesn't simply require it for its biological disposition. "" A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at. "" ~Bruce Lee"
"I cannot wake up Hi Kevin, thanks for your answer. I am eating regularly. That means I eat warm food once a day (e.g. a piece of meat or fish with vegetables and sometimes potatoes). In the evenings I mostly eat bread with smth on it. My weight is regular. I have also been wondering if it is the food, but I think I'm not eating unhealthy or anything. Sure I'll have a pizza every once in a while but I think that's normal as well. Maybe I have some kind of food intolerance. Anyways, thanks for your question I'll make sure to ask a doctor about it or have him run some tests, that's a good idea. I sometimes wonder what is worse: the triviality of human interaction or the fact that no one notices."
"Don't want to fall asleep Hi, I've recently developed this problem. Not sure how to categorize it, but it's about sleep so hopefully this is the correct forum! At night, even though I may be very sleepy or tired, I normally don't want to and don't feel like sleeping, such that I can stay up all night, or normally, until 5am when I'll force myself to sleep. But once I fall asleep, I don't want to wake up. I would sleep all day if I could. So I was wondering if this was some kind of sleep disorder, because not wanting to sleep and not wanting to wake up seems odd to me. Thanks! Undiagnosed ...but hopefully healing"
"Don't want to fall asleep I don't think there's anything wrong with you! It's just that your sleep routine is messed up. Why? Because you said that you cannot fall asleep before 5am and then after you do fall asleep you could sleep all day. This is a typical case of messed up sleep routine. It goes in cycles. Because you fall asleep late, you can't get up in the morning. You need your sleep and body doesn't really care that much when you sleep, as long as you get your 6-8 hours of rest. Try this: skip sleeping tomorrow. Don't go to bed at all. Watch tv, go outside, do something to make it trough the night. The next day go to sleep at 10 in the evening. I'm sure you will sleep like a baby. Sleep until 6 in the morning - set the alarm to go off at 6. Repeat this process until your sleep balance is established again. Here's some general sleep tips if you cannot sleep - take a look, maybe you find some information useful. Regards, JB"
"Don't want to fall asleep While I would by no means quantity myself as an expert, I would suggest that this is more a personal/emotional issue than a sleep issue. Do you find that you have a lot of stress in your life that is keeping you awake throughout the night? Perhaps there is something else that distracts you from being able to sleep?"
"Sleep Has Been Destroyed! Pain: Sub Conscious? Anxiety? For the past 6 months my sleep routine has been destroyed. The only thing that I can think of is when I started having back pain only while sleeping. I have no back pain when walking around doing stuff but only in the morning when I wake up. Once every few days or weeks it seems like a can get a full night sleep in I am lucky but lately it has been where I wake up at 2:00 then 4:00 then 6:00 and then finally 8:00 or 9:00. Seems like I sleep a little better right at the end because I am probably exhausted from all the stress of trying to go to sleep. History: A year and a half ago a played around with some GNC products like pro-hormones and stuff and worked out a lot. Been off of that for a while now. I worked out pretty hard. After coming off of that I use to jerk when falling asleep and freaked out. Thought I had something major but probably my muscles where just coming off of exhaustion. Went to the Doctors and had blood work done and he check me out and gave me a physical and said everything was fine. About nine months ago I needed a club to play golf so I went to golf pro shop and swung a club for 4 hours straight and I believe hurt my back. I swung pretty hard for a while. And believe it or not I did it the next day as well; to the point where I had a hard time breathing for a second. I know I am an idiot. I stopped everything and chilled. Maybe only driving range stuff after that. Relaxed for a while then played Disc Golf and threw the Disc as hard as I possible could about six months ago. Played for about 4 hours throwing the disc incredibly hard. Idiot again. Penalties: Well low and behold now I am having back problems only when I sleep and in the morning. But it seems more than that. I do not know if I created a mental loop in my mind but I cannot get a decent nights rest. I have gone to the Doctor again and have had multiple x-rays done and bloods tests taken. Everything came back fine. The pain is only in the morning and there is zero pain during the day. Here is an excerpt of a back pain post that I created to fill you in. Morning Back Pain – Should I Spend Money? Hello Everyone, I know there is so much out there on back pain; but I have a tough money question. I am a returning college student with not a whole lot of money. I am 33 year old male is I would say good shape. I work out decently and have a nice physique. My problem is that one time I went to a golf pro shop and spent 4 hours smacking the golf ball as hard as I could almost too where I had a small pain in my chest and it was hard to breathe for a split second. And if I couldn’t get more stupid I went the next day and did it again. I had to choose a golf club for a class so that is why I pushed myself. I know that was kind of stupid. After like a month I thought I healed up and then went and played Disc Golf and threw the Disc as hard as I possibly could for like 3 hours. I would throw it farther than anyone else. I guess I could have been showing off like an idiot. Well I was working out moderately hard for a while in the gym during all this and never felt any burst of pain really. The only thing that I noticed was a small pinch like pain when I would be watching TV. So then I decided to go to a Chiropractor and he solved that but he noticed that my spine was just slight to the right and my shoulders were a little uneven; but absolutely nothing major going on. This was the first time I ever went to a Chiropractor and it was literally insane. I thought he was going to kill me because I never heard my bones crack like that before and my neck. I think it might have been a littler before the Chiropractor that only in the morning when I wake up I would notice a pain right in the middle of my upper back between my shoulder blades; one time the pain moved to the right of my shoulder blade but that went away. Now all that is left is this ongoing pain in the middle of my back that I cannot for the life of me locate. It’s like it’s the long muscle in my back that go from top to bottom of your back and very close to my spine. I would say mid shoulder to mid back but not upper shoulder or lower back. It is so weird because during the day I feel absolutely great with no back pain at all; even playing Disc Golf or exercising; it is only right after I wake up and while I am still laying down. Pretty much as soon as I wake up everything is fantastic. Only other weird thing is I feel like my ear is ringing on my right ear when I sleep on my right side. This also goes away completely when I get up or move around. Doctor’s Office: I have been to my Doctor several times with this. I have had several X-Rays; nothing bruised on my skin or anything obvious; blood work done for immune system and anything out of the ordinary. I have taken muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory’s but they are all temporary relief. Seems like the pain comes back. My Doctor is just saying it is like a pulled or sore muscle or something but just seems strange that something so small could cause so much discomfort in the morning. Solutions: My dad has celiac disease but I do not but I read an article about how maybe you could not have the disease but a precursor of it somehow. I do have a lot of joint pain right now like in my Big Toe; Wrist; Neck and sometimes elbow. I have had all these X-Rayed and blood work done to see any causes and nothing major is going on. Here is the Article excerpt: Remove gluten from your diet. Recent studies have shown that some people may have non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity and if so, that may trigger a systemic immune response which can keep joints irritated. This wasn’t too challenging for me since I already didn’t eat breads, pastas, refined grains in general but gluten, as you may know, is in a LOT of foods – like beef jerky for one. Remove gluten for thirty days and pay attention to how you feel. For me, it helped. If after thirty days you feel better then you can always titrate some back into your diet to find your threshold if you want to. I am lost at this point: My main question is that do I put spend money I really do not have on a new bed and pillow with a mattress topper or am I just getting old and have to deal with an aching back and joint pain. Or could I possibly change my diet to a gluten free diet which will be like darn like impossible. I have heard from people’s reviews that they have had much success in changing out the mattress. And I am not even sure where the one that I am sleeping on came from. It’s a Cali-King and seems nice but a little old. I have great Health Insurance. It just doesn’t seem like the Doctors have the answers except Med up or go to a PT. I wish there was more information out there on this. Solutions: 1. Change Mattress 2. Change Pillow 3. Change Mattress Topper 4. Gluten Free Diet 5. Deal with it because you are getting older … Its life … Anything help would be greatly appreciated. Please leave your comments below. Thank You! Best, Astrongtower Update: Now after reading all of this what do you propose? I have been to the Doctors and they do not have the answers. Do I just chalk it up to getting old? I am only 33. I use to play pretty hard but I do not think I destroyed my body or did I? I am going back to school and I do know school and no job is stressing me out. But can it be creating this much havoc? All I know is that I am kind of afraid to go to sleep and it’s a real problem. I have some pain relievers and muscles relaxers but I do not really care for them. I just know that my sleep is absolutely horrible and it is not like it used to be where I could fall asleep like a baby and get 9 to 10 hours a sleep and nothing could wake me up. What in the world happened? I feel like I was just sleeping like this not too long ago. Please help me any way you can! Please leave comments below! Best, Astrongtower"
"Sleep Has Been Destroyed! Pain: Sub Conscious? Anxiety? Update: Last night I was able to get 9 hours of sleep somehow. I did wake up at exactly 2:30 A.M. which happens a lot because I think my body clock is off with all of this going on but I was able to go back to bed and I woke up at 9:00 A.M. after going to bed at 12:00 A.M. The difference this time was that we actually found a full body pillow that was in a bag somewhere from a long time ago. The one that literally wraps all around you. I used that last night and I think the difference was I did not sleep on my stomach and I did not toss and turn. Only around 9:00 did my back start to ache a little bit and force me out of bed and I began to toss and turn around the same time as well. I wanted to know exactly where the pain is coming from because it feels like sometimes it could be coming from my Spine or right rib or muscles near my spine. It is so hard to find exactly where. I have a FOAM roller which I get on sometimes to gauge where the pain is coming from. I did it a little differently this time. I put the edge of the FOAM roller in the middle of my back where the pain is and let my butt down and my chest arch up. I would definitely say this helped me isolated the pain to about 4 to 7 inches right along my spine. I could definitely feel the pain in the morning when I do this. I will move like an inch up or down and see if the pain is focused in that area. I would say when I get to my upper shoulders and neck there is zero pain and when I get to my lower back there is zero pain. It only seems to originate like to the top half of my back; like my back is too heavy for itself or something. Or it seems like a computer sitting down problem like I am arched or something over something for a long period and my back is just fed up with all of this. Also the sports injuries probably put it over the top I think. All I know is that the pain seems to be coming from the Spine or the muscles directly around the spine; but I think it’s the spine. I am almost thinking that whatever the Chiropractor did actually made things worse but I could be wrong. I never heard that kind of cracking before. It’s about a 4 – 7 inch radio directly up and down when I get on the foam roller and it does hurt; but only in the morning or if I get on the foam roller in that exact position. As I am typing this there is no pain in my back. Just wanted to update everyone. I hope someone knows what this is. I will be going to an orthopedic doctor soon but I am guessing that he will not be able to conclude anything either. Just seems sad. Please comment with any help or guidance. Best, Astrongtower"
"Sleep monitoring tool :- shared bed + cat? Having sleep problems, I want to monitor my sleep (and hopefully improve it). None of the devices I've looked at so far state how they cope with two people (and a cat) in one bed. Does anyone have any opinions? I'm considering the 'fitbit flex'.

"I Sleep More Than 24 Hours! How Can I Fix That? I've had depression for about 5 years and have had Asperger's and ADHD all my life. I've never been a morning person, but within the time that I've had depression, I've felt the need to sleep more. So much that sometimes I sleep more than 24 hours at a time. The longest I've ever slept for was for 3 days! And just this past weekend I slept 30 hours in one sitting! My parents and my doctor keep saying that it's because I ""don't take my meds as I should"" or ""don't go to bed at reasonable hours"". That's not the point. The point is that even when I do do those that I'm STILL TIRED! Even if I had a good night's sleep. I've even fallen asleep in classes! Right in front of teachers! I've thought about taking some B12, but I don't know if that will work. I've tried 5 Hour Energy, regular and extra strength, and both have done NOTHING to keep me awake. What should I do? Does anybody have any suggestions....other than the obvious?"
B-12 or B-Complex? Any medication interactions? I've been looking into Vitamin B12 or a B-complex supplement. I'm still quite hesitant about purchasing some since I'm still unsure if there will be any interactions with my current medications. But is there anything out there that I haven't already heard about or don't know about?
"I Sleep More Than 24 Hours! How Can I Fix That? Sorry, I don't know about the sleep side of things. That sounds pretty frustrating - 30 hours is a long time! I'd check with your doctor about the potential drug interactions. If you want to do some preliminary checks, this site is not bad: http://www.drugs.com/drug_interactions.html No diagnosis, lots of opinions, and a bunch of issues that I haven't quite figured out."
"I Sleep More Than 24 Hours! How Can I Fix That? I have Hypersomnia and that is how i describe it to people. I can sleep for very long periods at a time, wake up for a few hours and go back to sleep again. My doctor described it once as having a ""sleepy brain"", that ""no matter how long you sleep your brain still thinks you need sleep so you are constantly tired"". I take the same type of medication that they generally prescribe for ADHD, it calms down people with ADHD but it wakes me up to normality. So i dont know how it would work with someone who has both, but that is why i am not a doctor I am sure a doctor specializing in sleep/wake disorders (which is what my doc is) would know exactly what could help ya!"

I recently got a sleep study done. (I'm very eagerly awaiting the results since we put a rush on them.) Hypersomnia is one of the things he was looking for. Honesty I hope it's there. Because scheduling my college classes around sleeping so much is obviously not working and I'd like to give my professors some clarity of why I've gone over my allowed absences and to be able to defend myself from being penalized because of university policy. (I'm not looking for a ""get out of class free"" card. I've heard they won't accept Narcolepsy as a legitimate excuse, either. And ANY REAL HEALTH PROBLEM, SLEEP-RELATED OR NOT, SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY! So technically the school is be breaking the law if they aren't making appropriate accommodations.)"
"How to restore sleep architecture? Hello I have a sleep disorder. First, even after a busy and active day, when it should go to sleep, I do not want to sleep. This feeling that I need more hours in the day. I use sleeptracker and it shows me that I has REM early in the night, while NREM occurs at the end of the night. Because of this, I think, I'm pretty passive (emotionally and mentally) at the beginning of the day and active at the end, ie, the long wake up. Maybe you can advise me something. How to restore sleep architecture?"
"Parasomnia? Hello Everyone, I am new to the forums and am just reading through different stories in an effort to find something that might 'click' and help us to figure out what challenges my son is experiencing. I am the extremely lucky mother of a fantastic 14yo boy. He's bright, funny, and has a great heart. He also has been experiencing some strange episodes over the past year. It started in December 2012, while he was at the computer playing a video game. It was a bit later than usual, but not incredibly late. I was in my bedroom reading when I heard a crash in the dining room. I came in to find my son flat on his back, in a dining room chair. His eyes were wide open and he was 'frozen' in place. I panicked, screamed, yelled, shook him until he came out of it (about 1 minute) and helped him to his feet. He was a little upset about me causing such a fuss, but assured me he was okay. I checked his pulse, respirations, his pupil size and called my best friend (who is a doctor). All signs seemed to point to him being okay. My husband took him to the pediatrician the next day, and we were told he may have nodded off in the dining room and just 'knocked himself out'. We were told to bring him back if it happened again. There were no episodes until September 2013. He had an episode again where he fell, this time out of bed about an hour after going to bed for the night. I heard a crash and walked into his room. He had opened his closet door at some point, only a few feet from his bed. He was laying on the floor between the closet on his back, eyes wide open again and again it took about a minute for him to come to. After this episode, we were able to see a neurologist/pediatric sleep medicine doctor. First EEG came back normal, so we did a 3-day ambulatory EEG. That came back normal as well. The neurologist could not find any signs of epilepsy, and felt it might be more of a sleep disorder. However, she couldn't rule it out since no one knows what causes the fall since it is at night and he's in his room alone. She said to 'live life' and call her if it happened again.She thinks it is more of a Parasomnia, but this doesn't sound like what I've read of parasomnias. Since then, we have moved and we are in a newer/larger townhouse. So, here we are with episode 3. It happened last Thursday, and again I heard a crash. I went into his room and saw his empty bed. I looked again and could make him out on the floor of his room, again with the closet door open. He was on his back, eyes wide open, body rigid/muscles tight. In fact, he was holding something so tight in his hands that I had to pry it out. I was able to notice that he was breathing, at least, so that was reassuring (other times I was too panicked to notice). It took about a minute to get him to come out of it. Afterwards, he just wanted to get a drink and go back to sleep. I called the neurologist, and she said ""wellll, if it happens AGAIN, give me a call. Just monitor him"". At this point, I am panicked. I can't get sleep or rest, especially since my room is on the opposite side of the house. I have been sleeping on the couch so I can hear any sounds. I jump at every sound and I don't know what to do next. I don't know how to help him and it terrifies me and breaks my heart. I am fearful that he will fall and really injure himself, or that he will fall down the flight of stairs that we have here at the house (technically, our unit is the 2nd and 3rd unit of the building and we have a set of stairs immediately when you enter). I just feel so helpless, so I am trying to see if there may be someone who has experienced something similar or might know what more I can do. Has anyone else experienced something like this?"
"Parasomnia? Hello, I am also new to the forums and by coincidence I happen to see your post. My 15-year old daughter has experienced something similar since she was 13 years old. But what happens is that she just blanks out. She will be sitting and talking and then all of a sudden she has a blank stair and it sometimes last as long as 10 minutes. It happens at school alot and then they call 911 and transport her to emergency but she comes out of it usually in about 10 minutes or less. We did the ambulatory EEG also and nothing happened. It seems to occur if she stayed up too late the night before and/or if she gets really upset or stressed. She has not fallen though. It usually happens when she is sitting down and if she focuses on something or is daydreaming or something and she just blanks out. At one point she had an episode almost like two times a week for about a month. They ruled out siezures and suggested that she see a therapist. Young teens sometimes act out this way subconciously to receive attention, but they are not doing this purposely. When the episodes started she was arguing with her younger sister who is 11 now but was 8 or 9 at the time. The therapy seemed to work and the episodes stopped immediately, but they came back after about a year and a half. She had two last month. But none recently. its still a mystery. About a year before these episodes began she hit her head in the snow while sliding down a hill. We took her to the doctor and they checked her out and said there was know concussion. I know exactly what you are going through. Her attitude is great though, it has not presented any challenges, but she wants to start driving soon so my wife and I are faced with some decisions soon. I don't know if therapy worked or if it was just a coincidence that the episodes stopped for a while (it was no medication, only talking). But maybe you want to give therapy a try to see if it is psychological. Its worth a try. Don't panic, just manage it the best you can while working with the neurologists to find the cause. Stay positive and keep your child's attitude healthy and positive. Sorry I could not give you any more helpful info, but you helped me because I don't know anyone else going through these type of symptoms. Good luck and God bless."
"Weird Sensations Making Me Afraid to Lie Down/Try And Sleep Hi there, Before you go ""Woah, I'm not reading all that."", please, at least skim over what I've written, because this is getting difficult for me and I really have no idea what to do. I often have these weird sensations as I'm trying to sleep; I get this bizarre falling sensation. I know it's NOT a hypnagogic jerk, because I don't have to be falling sleep or even feel sleepy for it to happen; it can happen whenever I'm really comfortable and relaxed, so that's why it's usually when I'm trying to sleep, but it can even happen when I'm just really relaxed while sitting down. It's pretty hard to describe, but it usually starts pretty slow, I'll feel like a part of me in my stomach and chest is slowly falling a little bit through my body, but then I feel like I'm falling further and it gets really scary so I change positions and shake myself to get rid of the sensation. Sometimes before it happens I'll feel like my body is gently swaying up and down, or swinging from side to side. I've never allowed the sensation to continue for very long because of how scary it feels and because I'm scared what will happen if I let myself continue falling. As stupid as this sounds, I'm scared if I allow myself to fall too far I'll actually fall through my own body or something. This all started a few months back, when I just spent some time lying in the sun and relaxing, and I started breathing slowly in and out and imagining myself swaying up and down until I could actually feel it, and swaying side to side, or zooming forward and backwards. It was pretty fun, but then all of a sudden I got the falling sensation I described and quickly jumped up. It felt really scary. That night, I had trouble falling asleep, because even though I was really tired, whenever I got even close to falling asleep I'd get the falling sensation and have to sit up or shake myself or something to get rid of it, and then I'd try and fall asleep again but it would just happen again; I also kept getting the weird swaying sensations that I was making happen before it happened for the first time. Eventually, I fell asleep somehow. I don't get it anywhere near as much as that night any more, sometimes I don't get it at all. It often just happens because I'm thinking about it, all I need to do is relax my body and think about it and it'll happen. If I think about the swaying sensations they'll happen too; they're not unpleasant but if I have them too long they lead to the falling sensation, so I don't want the swaying sensations to happen either. I hate it when I end up thinking about either of those things because it makes it hard to get to sleep or relax, because something similar like what happened that night will happen, although not as bad as it was then. Usually the falling sensation happens only occasionally now though and I can often get to sleep with no problems by just not thinking too much about it. But just now, something else weird happened. I was trying to have a nap, but then I felt like my body was rising up a little bit and part of me was being pulled towards my feet. It disturbed and scared me so I kept shaking myself and changing positions to try and make it go away because I was scared I'd end up being pulled out of my body or something. But every time I got comfortable the sensation returned. So I've given up on trying to sleep for now; I really hope this doesn't happen again in the evening because then I'm sure I'll be getting little, if any, sleep. I'm a teenager, female, have never done drugs and have not been diagnosed with any mental health issues, if that helps. And sorry if any of this didn't make sense or I started rambling; I'm a little tired. Any suggestions?"
"Weird Sensations Making Me Afraid to Lie Down/Try And Sl I think you should see a neurologist. Not to scare you, but I have heard that that sensation is not uncommon with some sorts of brain tumors. Then again, it could just be that you arn't getting enough oxygen to your brain when you lie down. Either way, I STRONGLY suggest you see a doctor ASAP."

"Weird Sensations Making Me Afraid to Lie Down/Try And Sl Hiya, I know you wrote this a while back now but thought i'd just chime in to say that i had something similar happening to me. Does this fit you..? 1) ''It feels like my body is being whisked away for a moment and my mind is freefalling through the air'' 2) ''when i'm sitting it sometimes feels like i get rapidly disconnected and then reconnected to my body'' - it probably feels like you've been moved back and forth really quickly and then your brain is trying to catch up to a movement that didn't physically happen.. if this does sound like what you are experiencing then it may well be a problem with oxygen levels.. mine turned out to be caused by folic acid deficiency anemia.. folic acid apparently helps to create the red blood cells.. red blood cells carry oxygen etc.. if you're getting any of these symptoms as well then see your doctor when you have a chance (fairly soon though) head/neckaches weird electricky sensations/restless leg syndrome unusual fatigue (i was falling asleep in the afternoons as well as sleeping all night) finding it difficult to focus on a computer screen for as long as usual.. finding it difficult to wake up fully in the mornings (you may not notice.. i'm awful for mornings anyway) a slight issue with short term memory.. also.. this may be an issue with low blood pressure.. if this happens usually when you're relaxed or have just stood up (do you ever get dizzy when you first stand up?) then it may just be a blood pressure dip..

"I don't wake up to anything. I cannot wake up to my 10 alarms, setting them at different intervals (every minute, every two minutes, ect.), trying different alarm sounds, and I am out of ideas. I am a 22 year old female with a healthy weight and in good health. This started very mildly at about age 14 where I wouldn't wake up to my alarm and my mom would have to wake me up and I would have conversations with her in my sleep and this got progressively worse. I almost slept through a house fire that happened next door 2 years ago (if my partner had not woken me up), and sleep through floor sanders, people moving furniture out of the room, very loud noises. When I do wake up, I feel very tired and never really feel awake. I have slept 36 hours straight, and if I sleep through my alarms, I will sleep for 12+ hours. I have classes from 11:45am - 7:30pm on Tuesday and Thursday, and work from 1:45pm - 10:30pm Friday - Monday. I typically go to bed around 2-3 a.m. and wake up an hour before class or work. I went to a sleep clinic and filled out a 2 week sleep diary and without any testing they diagnosed me with DSPD, suggesting that I take melatonin at 10pm and basically did not listen to the problems I am having. I fall asleep fine and have no trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. I realize I don't have the ""normal"" societal sleep schedule, but I have done it before waking up at 6 a.m. for work and going to bed at 11pm. Even when I have to follow the normal sleep schedule for society, this is still a problem. I noticed when I took Adderall before I went to bed, I would wake up on time and feel refreshed. So I am now taking 10mg Adderall XR before I go to bed, and this helped A LOT. I would wake up to my first alarm, feeling refreshed like I had a good nights sleep, but this doesn't seem to be helping as much after 3 months of taking it. Please give me any suggestions or help you can think of because I am frustrated and tired of waking up hours after my alarms go off and seeing that I've turned them all off in my sleep and not remembering it. I hate missing classes and my grades are dropping as a result. Please help."
"I don't wake up to anything. wakemeuppp, Hello, if you're still out there. I see no one replied to your post and it's been nine months! DSPD is very rare. Anyhow, I'm not an expert, but here's what I think: you have a deeper underlying issue. DSPD is one thing, but sleeping for 36 hours straight, + multiple alarms, house fires and people working around you, is another. It comes as no surprise to many of us that a drug that once helped is no longer effective: your mind/body will ""filter-out"" the effects of the drug so you can ""re-face your problem"", which I suspect is psychological. Hope you're doing well."
"DSPD and migraines Hey hey, 25 y/o female here, have had serious sleep problems since i was child (3 - 4 y/o). Finally diagnosed with Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder earlier this year, and am currently in the process of resetting my circadian rhythms, under a doctor's supervision. Since beginning the process, I've been having what I think are migraines (blurred vision, dizziness, loss of motor control and crazy muscle spasms) every day, 3 hours after I wake up. Seriously, you could set your watch by them were it not for the fact that i'm getting up at a different time every two days. In the last two days i've had two a day, each lasting for 2 - 4 hours. I've had migraines before, and thankfully they're atypical so there's no pain, but they've never been this frequent or this consistent. Just wondering if anyone else has had a similar reaction, or whether these symptoms could be something else. Not worried about anything sinister - had an mri about 6 months ago and structurally everything's doing what it should. Mainly just wondering if this is likely to settle down once my sleep cycle is stabilised. Thanks!"

Best simple products to help with snoring? Hi guys. I have sleep issues of my own and I just found this forum. Looks like there are quite a few interesting topics covered which is great. My father suffers from major snoring issues. What are your suggestions when it comes to basic products out there you think he should try to begin with? I live in New Zealand so products that can be found over here would be best. He snores very loudly and it keeps the rest of the family up that live with him. I am keen to get him a few things to try... start with some basics and then go from there. Thanks for your help.
"Sleeping and emotional breakdowns. I'm new and this is my first time posting so I am not sure if I am in the right area or not, if not please let me know. Any way, when ever I go to bed or take a nap, even if im tired I get very tense around the back and shoulders and have an emotional breakdown where I often cry. it can sometimes get intense where I just feel like im going crazy. Every once in a great while I will feel like this all day and just stay in bed, but most of the time I feel great and happy during the day. Why does this happen when ever I lay down to take a nap or go to bed? Its like im just emotionally overwhelmed and I can even pin point why. Is this common ?"
"Is this a Sign of a Sleep Disorder? So, I took a long nap today in the middle of the day because I had lost out on sleep the previous night and I was too tired to work on anything after class. It is honestly the strangest experience I've ever had. Obviously, I did not have to go to work and did not have a shift today but while I was napping, I dreamt that even though I wasn't going to work, I believed that I had already completed one of the work tasks (are completed 3 times every shift) for the day and needed to complete another in the late afternoon when I woke up. I was very confused and stressed while I was asleep and was fighting with reality, now what is this about, why do I have to do this when I am not actually working a shift? Then, when I woke up and I was definitely conscious, I was very confused for at least 20 minutes. It felt like reality was warped and I was very upset because I believed I had not been at work when I was supposed to. I just sat there in bed for 20 minutes trying to work out what was going on and I was fully awake. I have never experienced anything to this extent, but I have had periods before where I've felt slightly confused a minute or two after I wake up but they're uncommon. I don't take any medications and don't have a family history of sleep problems. Self-Diagnosis- BPD traits and mood disturbance/depression/anxiety"
"Is this a Sign of a Sleep Disorder? I don't know if it is disorder or not but I can sympathize as this has happened to me one or two times. It is disturbing but I can't see it being harmful in any other way. I sometimes wake up from dreams that I went to work, then I have to get ready for work - thus I feel like I am doing a double shift. So the results of this lingers quite long. If you find out how to fix this then let me know so I can stop it too ""You never know how strong you are... Until being strong is the only option you have."""
"Phenomena surrounding sleep I have a few things I'd like to determine being normal or not regarding sleep. I'm pretty sure I have Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, but I doubt these are related to that. About two years ago I started hearing voices when I was falling asleep. I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, but I think the psychiatrist got it wrong. I even told her that I heard them virtually only at night when laying in bed, near sleep, and sometimes shortly after waking up in the morning but still laying in bed. I haven't heard them since about April of this year though. Also, sometimes while falling asleep I'll lose control of my thoughts and start thinking about ridiculous things that don't make sense, and sometimes it can take a minute or so before I realize it and stop. Earlier this year and much of last year I would wake up in the middle of the night not being able to move, occasionally accompanied by hallucinations. One time this past February I felt, saw, and heard two large rats crawling over me, and one time saw and felt a disembodied hand crawl up my torso. Now, I know all of these things can happen in people with sleep problems (and even those that don't), but I would just like to know if the concurrence and frequency of these are indicative of any kind of disorder, or if they just change from person to person. Thanks!"

"Auditory hallucination ""attack"" I was tired this morning and decided to try and take a nap. I hit my bed around 10:30 am and got up just now, around 12:30 pm. I don't think I ever completely fell asleep for whole time frame i was sleeping. Sometimes I'd shift and be conscious of my self and feel like the bed is moving or that my body is elongating for a brief period until I drifted back into sleep. Sometimes I'd become consciously confused between whether what I just messaged someone in my dream was actually sent in real life too. And at last, before deciding to wake up, and what instigated me to wake up, I auditory hallucinated really bad, and it's the most terrifying thing ever. I feel I should also mention that I'm normally capable of lucid dreaming and I do it very regularly, but what I had now isn't really a dream. I think, though, that it's why I was able to wake myself from it on my own will. Just now this is the most I've had it in one session of napping: quietly i would hear a cellphone ring or a door shutting or people picking up ""hello?"" or different phrases from various random conversations, like one between a male and his female friend, ""yeah i'm gonna go on a date"" ""what're you gonna do"" ""i just don't want to"", different female voices, male voices, and just normal hustle/bustle and commotion that one would typically probably hear in cities or whatever, and each thing i ""heard"" while ""sleeping"" would be isolated and separate from the next, there was no overlapping sounds.. I feel as though the things I hear are probably things my subconscious picked up during visits to cities, which makes sense, but I'm just curious as to why I'd even be having auditory hallucinations of them. There was this one thing that set me off and it was just like... a creepy whisper going ""hi there nathan"". an aggresive voice ""hey nathan"" ""what are you doing there nathan"" and it just kept like getting deeper and deeper into my head, like, maybe the perpetrator in my mind was antagonizing this Nathan kid and at the same time antagonizing me by being in my brain? I felt my head hurt. I made myself wake up because it really whacked me out and I didn't want the acquired headache to get any worse. I've had something like that happen before a couple months ago, where I'd heard a beeping noise in my sleep/""dream"" that gradually got louder and louder until it stressed my head and i had to force myself to wake up because I LITERALLY didn't think I'd be able to take anymore or else my brain would actually explode. That's about the only other time it's happened so vividly. I used to just hear phantom sounds when I was younger, ages 7-12, but it never really gave me headaches like that our disrupted my state, and the noises would be so slight and small and few that it would be like they never even happened. Anyway, auditory hallucinations are terrifying for me. I don't take any meds for anything, despite the fact I've been diagnosed with social anxiety, anxiety, and depression. Also, last night I had some anxiety episode (I'm not one to show physical symptoms of anxiety but I do experience it all just as bad in my head), what with thinking about school and interacting with 'friends' on facebook and feeling like i've overeaten and stuff, so that may also play a part in the reason why I had the auditory attack today? My question is, is this normal? And what's the explanation for why it happened? (I can't ask a psychiatrist or therapist about this right now because my therapy ended when summer started and the psychiatrist I see very rarely is my dad's, and I haven't seen my dad in a while.)"
"Anyone tried amphetamines for DSPD I am seeing a sleep specialist in a few days with forms for her to fill out for me to claim life long disability pension, I have had DSPD all my life since I can remember. It means I have trouble waking up and trouble going to sleep esentially like a 26hour sleep rythem. I dont really have a sleeping pattern, when I do work I end up going to work gradually later each day even up to 15mins late after a few months. I have a bigger problem with waking up on time than going to sleep on time.

"Can't find out what I'm experiencing? Any help? Hello, Just wanting to see if anyone can help me figure out what's going on with me! For as long as I can remember I've slept walked, but it has been much worse in the last 5 years. I do it between 2-7 times a week, often multiple times in one night. I am ALWAYS aware of what I'm doing. For example, last night I saw a shadow in my room and believed it to be a child I work with--I could see the shadow moving, woke up my other half who turned on the light and I could still see it, I was looking out the window for them, under the bed and trying to get clothes on. As soon as I ""come round"" I am aware of how ridiculous what I've just done is. Other examples include believing someone else is in bed with me, not my other half. It will usually be a work colleague or a stranger. I'll ""wake up"", feeling panic and (as I sleep nude) will silently feel around on the floor for clothes to put on, often crawling out of bed and out of the door to get away from whoever I think is in the bed. Again, either my OH will, over a period of minutes, convince me I'm dreaming/sleep walking or I will realise it myself by reasoning with myself. I often become agressive as it feels VERY real in my mind until I realise it's not happening and then I feel ridiculous that I could of imagined something. I am awake during these times. I remember every detail about my walking, straight after and the next day. Any ideas?!"
Bruxism problem Hi there I grind and clench alot. I wear a guard but my lower right gums are really tender and my first molar aches. I also have a lymph node that gets inflamed. I just wondering does anyone else get a bit of swelling around there lower jaw from Bruxism and an inflamed lymph node. It's really bugging me. Thanks
"Bruxism problem I used to have a tooth at the top poking into and rubbing the gum and teeth at the bottom of my mouth. It made all my problems seem much worse than they otherwise would have been because I couldn't concentrate due to the the constant pain and lack of sleep. I would have this radiating pain which would bring on headaches and migraines. It made my life pretty hellish for about two years. Have you see a dentist? Can they help you with this? The wearing of the guard suggests to me that you might have. As far as I know I didn't get swelling of the lymph node, but I might have. I got heaps of swelling and redness, and I couldn't fully close my mouth without intense pain for the time I had the problem. Strange beautiful grass of green, with your majestic silver seas."
"Sleeping disorder diagnosis? I've had sleeping and anxiety problems for about 15 years. I have panic disorder and borderline personality disorder and since the age of 16 I have been waking up in panic every single night. I wake up within the first hour of falling asleep (usually first 15 minutes). I jump up, sometimes shout out, sometimes throw the pillows or grab my partner. Sometimes I wake up and I'm in another room or staring out of the window. My heart beats really fast and I gasp for breath for a second. I always thought it was just anxiety or panic attacks in my sleep so I've never seen anybody about it. I'm certain it isn't just sleep apnea although I know I am quite a shallow breather. I've heard about the combination of sleep apnea and panic disorder being a problem though, the shallow breathing bringing on panic attacks. I've been reading about night terrors as well, which sound quite similar to this. I don't think I have dreams though, at least I don't remember them when I wake up in panic. I'm taking Pregabalin for anxiety and zopiclone for sleep. Zopiclone used to stop me waking up in panic but it doesn't do anything anymore. I wake up every single night in panic, sometimes every few minutes for hours, literally all night. The annoying thing is sometimes I can't keep myself awake, I'm so tired that eventually I fall back asleep and it happens again and again. Sorry for dragging this on. I really hate being like this and I want it to stop. The pregabalin is doing nothing for anxiety and the doctor says my waking up is anxiety so won't refer me to a sleep specialist. Sigh! You say it's over, I can sigh again, yeah But why try to stay sober when I'm dying here?"
"Could this really be RBD? Help. Starting this year I was had some violent dreams that caused me to wake. They usually involved arguing with someone, and sometimes physical confrontation. Upon waking, I saw myself sometimes kicking, punching, or hitting the bed. I'm not sure if it happened actually during REM, only in the process of waking, or only after waking. But this morning I believe I hit the wall next to my bed, causing me to wake, as I was doing a slapping motion in a dream. I started doing research on ""violent dreams"" yesterday and was horrified to discover a connection between acting out dreams during REM sleep, often violent, and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's or dementia, including Alzheimer’s. The name of the sleeping disorder, which I'm not certain I have but am concerned that I might, is called REM Behavior Disorder (RBD), characterized by loss of muscle atonia (paralysis) during REM sleep, resulting in acting out dreams as they happen. Studies suggest anywhere from around a 30% to an 80% of development of such diseases not that many years after onset of symptoms of RBD. They say it usually happens in older males - the mean age is around 60. However, I am in my 20's. I'm not certain that I have RBD - because in most cases I only perceived myself doing these actions after waking up. FWIW, I also have an abnormal sleeping schedule that I seem to tend towards every so often, in which I sleep very late, or in the early morning, and wake up in the afternoon or evening. However, I usually get enough hours of sleep. Based on what I have said, do you think that I am being paranoid or should I go get some advice and/or tests done asap, or maybe first record myself sleeping? If recording myself sleeping, do you have any recommendations as to good recording techniques, software, equipment, etc.? I am mainly concerned about the large file size that could occur. Thanks for any advice."

"New Here - Horrible sleep problem Hi, I am 18 and female. I have various psychological problems, but I cant discuss them all at once. Since I was about thirteen or fourteen, I started having sleep problems. I had severe seborrhea on my head, and I think also in my vaginal area. My head was always itchy during the day, but usually didn't get it's worse until I fell asleep. My life was never easy, I have many food allergies, etc., but I know they weren't the only cause of my sleep problems. And please don't ask me why I didn't do anything to help myself for five years. Almost every night for five years has been like this : Soon after i fall asleep I wake up scratching my head like a maniac, an am some nights scratching around my vaginal area too. I am unable to do anything, even though I'm half awake, for hours; I can't control my hands. It's horrible. I'm a virgin so it hurts more. What I do around my vaginal area is messed up. Its like I'm half-masturbating, half-scratching. It lasts hours non stop and I sometimes have my eyes open. But I cant stop doing it no matter how conscious I am, or painful it is. I can be so violent it's like I'm being raped. But I'm the one doing it. I recently tried using Nizoral shampoo to help. It only helps a bit. On stressful days, it gets worse. And if I eat so much as a cookie, or something small I don't usually eat it gets really horrible. Last night was the worst its ever been. Of course it had been a horrible day so that added to it. I not only had that problem, I had a terrible stomach ache and head itchiness too. Anyway what I was doing in my vaginal area last night lasted for hours. I have never been so violent before. I feel like I stuck my whole hand in there. Like I was violently raped. I cant do this anymore. I cant get rid f the stress in my life, everyone has hard times. I cant spend those times doing what I do to my body. Has anyone had a problem like this? Please anyone help."
"Nocturnal. (May not be the right place to put this, but here.) I am nocturnal, I guess. No matter how hard I try to stay sleeping at night, my sleep schedule gets flipped around, and I'm back to sleeping through the entire day. (I wake up when it's dark or getting dark, and fall asleep as the sun comes up, or short after.) Since I'm currently 17 years old (almost 18), and have been fighting my extremely drowsy days at school for years, I've been home schooled for two years. This problem has been occurring since I was, I think about, 13. The past two years consisted of me trying to stay up the rest of the day so I could force myself to fall asleep at night. I'd obviously, oversleep, or not sleep long enough, and have just given up for a while. I can't get a job. I've lost all motivation in schooling, socialization (which was terrible to begin with, I'm the kid who has no friends.), everything. I feel like I live in a dream world half the time. I'm always tired, I no longer have a life. :/ My concern is, how normal could this possibly be? I want to be a wildlife veterinarian, but if I can't even get myself motivated enough to finished high school, that is definitely not happening. I don't know what to do, I'm drained. (This is just interesting, and could help if you are familiar with, I think it's called, the ""meyers-briggs"" personality characterization. I've scored, on the online tests, INTP and INTJ equally. Geez, I'm gonna be a mess, haha.)"
"Nocturnal. Hi Shaidah. I’m sorry you have having difficulties. It’s pretty awful to be tired all the time. It may not be ""normal"" to be nocturnal but you aren't the only one. Sounds like your circadian rhythm is definitely set differently than most and being out of sync with most people’s schedule creates problems like you’ve experienced. You could try light therapy for resetting your body’s biological clock. It could be good to talk to your doctor too. They could help you determine if sleeping pills or a supplement like melatonin might help you get on the schedule you need to be on. Hopefully, things get easier for you to cope with after you graduate high school, when you have more control over your schedule. If you plan to go to college perhaps you can schedule late day or evening classes. Or, if you end up getting a job, there are 24 hour stores and businesses where you could work. Also, the thing about view count is that views from guests are also counted in addition to registered forum members, but guests are not able to reply, so it helps to create the situation you have here with 100 views but no replies. Sometimes too ppl just don’t know what to say. *hugs* and take care, Jan I am not on the forum much these days. Please contact another staff member. Thank you."
"Nocturnal. It is possible but not easy to go through life on a schedule like that. I remember senior year of high school I was late every single day. Every single day. I showed up for homeroom the very first day of the year and never again. I also failed my first period class because I was just unable to get to it. Well, almost failed it. What I found out was that basically...in life, there's a way around everything. For example, I dropped that first period class before I technically failed it and took the equivalent class at a community college in the afternoon and transferred it back to high school. I'm now 45 and since then my life has basically been a continuation of that theme - figuring a way around things to compensate for having a weird schedule. The job part is tough. Every job I had I have been threatened with termination because I just never showed up until 10:30 or 11 am at the earliest. Sometimes not until noon. But as soon as I got there I did such good work and stayed at least 10 full hours to make up for it that eventually, it was like...okay, it's no big deal if this guy comes in late if he gets the work done. There are plenty of jobs where you can have weird hours, like computer programmers. They're notorious for weird hours. Overnight help desk support is another one. The more that colleges embrace online classes, the more you can do it on your own time, maybe mixed with evening classes for errr...""commuter"" students. But here's the bottom line - there are always alternatives out there for people who are wired a bit differently. It's just a matter of doing the research and finding them out. Like at my high school, there was something called the Tutorial Center which was for kids who ""couldn't handle"" regular classes. Basically, it was an afternoon program where you went to an alternative class center where you could do individual work rather than classroom work and have it lead to a diploma - you could even do it in the evenings: link removed There might be something like that you can enroll in. And when I went to college I never had a single class before mid-afternoon, although that meant it took me 5 years to graduate rather than 4. Basically, I've found that if you can get up by 2 pm you can pretty much get stuff done. That means falling asleep at no later than 6 am. And if you can find a way to be self-employed, that makes it waaay easier too."
"sleepeating I sleepeat too..my dad also does it. I think I may have started sometime in high school our shortly thereafter. Most people think it's funny, everyone thinks it's weird , and most people don't believe me. I can pretty much eat anything even if it's something I would gag at while awake. I'LL bite my cheek and tongue and not notice until the morning.

sleep misperception im 17 how to get over it Monday i pulled an all Night then when Tuesday night came my mom said i slept but i said i been up for hours. Wednesday went to my doctor and told him everything but i just got sent back home to try to sleep Thursday it seems i slept for a few hours but get up tired. now this Friday at 1 am i fell asleep my mom said cause she turned off my tv but i woke up at 4 am saying i been awake all night what to do
"sleep misperception im 17 how to get over it Sounds irritating and simple, but try exercising more in the day, less caffeine especially towards the end of the day. Try not to do stimulating things at night like computers, tv or phone. Read a book, write or draw, something classical. The important thing is that you get SOME sleep, and gradually build it up, even if it means forcing yourself to stay awake in the day time and lying painstakingly for hours in bed trying to sleep. Lack of sleep can be really bad, and in severe cases can lead to psychosis. Sleep is essential to a healthy functioning system. Hope this helps Hikikomori42"
"Sleep disorder vs. fit (for a child) Hi! I've always been interested in the psych fields and have done a bit of research... but I'm dealing with an issue for which I can't find a name. My daughter is going to start seeing a psychologist soon, and I want to go in knowledgable. So, my Daughter is 5. Very intelligent, highly social, but when she gets tired, she can turn into a huge grump. So much so that she's thrown a fit a couple times that seems to have physically harmed her. She's gotten to this state where she seems all locked up... her jaw clenches and she'll stare, wide-eyed making a repetitive growling sound... and is entirely inconsolable. She can hear and is conscious, and I don't suspect it to be a seizure... but for the LIFE of her, she physically can't talk. I've asked ""do you want candy?"" And in her eyes, you can see that she heard the question, but words can't come out. I'll ask ""do you want a cold shower?"" Same thing, but her facial expression says no. ""Do you want huge spankings?"" Same thing, except her facial expression says a BIG no. Her pediatrician (who I believe to be a nut, we're switching), suggested that the only thing we can do is to leave her alone and let her go. When we've done so, it's lasted hours until she has a burning fever, drenched in sweat, starts vomiting until the point of dry-heaving, and complains of a headache after the fact. When we talked about it later, she's said that it felt like something in her throat closed and wouldn't let her talk even though she wanted to and the more scared she was of that situation, the tighter it got until she puts herself into a panic attack. Obviously she doesn't WANT to be in this state, so negative re-inforcement like a spanking wouldn't do anything. And once she's in this state, no amount of hugs or talking gets through because she's so hysterical. Again... her pediatrician says it's ""just a fit"" and not to worry about it. The reason I'm posting this in the sleep section is that I believe it has SOMETHING to do with her sleep... as she's only ever done this when she's very tired and gets upset about taking a nap. It isn't always this bad... but no matter what else she may get upset about... it's only this bad when she obviously needs a nap and has it set in her mind that there's no reason to take one. Once asleep, she also sleeps like an absolute rock. At 5 years old, she still has accidents almost every night and doesn't even notice. She was solidly potty trained while awake at 3, but no progress at night (we've talked to Drs and tried a LOT of things for this). She can also sleep through very loud noises, and if she falls asleep in my arms, I can toss her over my shoulders in a fireman carry and walk around a store for quite a while and she'll sleep right through it. I think whatever it is must have something to do with genetics, her baby brother started sleeping through the night at maybe 2-3 months (also sleeps through smoke alarms... although he's not a grump... if you wake him up early, he's the happiest thing in the world). Her mother still sleeps like a rock and had bed-wetting issues through her teens, as did my wife's father. Not sure about my wife's mother. Some I've asked have suggested that my daughter may be somewhere on the autistic spectrum due to the severity of her fits (also her maternal grandfather is suspected to have aspergers, although never diagnosed)... but she's highly social, highly empathetic, has no attachment to any kind of routine or any fixations on any particular subject, will hug any stranger I let her, has far above average speech/vocabulary... .... yea... So... any ideas for things it might be so I can keep an eye out for the right things for when she does start seeing a professional? I have a small background, minored in psychology and have always been interested because I'm a weirdo and my side of the family are all bat-(blank) crazy."
"Sleep disorder vs. fit (for a child) obviously, if this belongs in any other forum, I apologize and can re-post if it would be more appropriate elsewhere. Also, I'm certainly not looking for any sort of diagnosis... but I do have limited funds and want to make every session count. If I can go in with more useful information, I think it can help. Also, while this isn't a place for ""parenting"" advice... if someone does have any suggestions as to what sort of things can be done to get her out of this state, I would appreciate all the suggestions I can get. I assume something about her being tired makes her prone to panic attacks?"
"HOW can I return to a continous & deep sleep during 8 hours? Hi, I am 45 years old, I always had needed to sleep to late, when I were 30 years old I slept at 2am., for example, and I woke up at 11am in a continous and deep sleep . But since several years I sleep at 2am and wake up at 7 or 8am (very sensitive to any noise) tossing and turning in bed until 9am or 10am when I can finally sleep again until 2 or 3 pm. It's obvius that I have DSPS. Then HOW can I return to a continous and deep sleep between 2am and 11pm???? and HOW could I return to sleep at 10pm like many people? I had taken melatonin with bad results, I believe that I sleep just 10% more with the melatonin. Sincerely I would like to have chloroform beside my bed when I wake up early in the morning with only 5 hours of sleep . Beforehand. Thanks by your answers ."
"HOW can I return to a continous & deep sleep during 8 ho I think it's worth seeing a doctor or sleep clinic, Behrens. If this is DSPS then it may not respond to the usual insomnia approaches. If it isn't, then they can give you a more relevant diagnosis and relevant suggestions for tackling it. “ We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity.

I will search for a sleep clinic in my country (Venezuela) but I believe that it's so much expensive , that´s the reason why I wrote here. All started when I refused to sleep early (10pm), studying, playing guitar, watching TV, etc. when I were 20 or 30 years old. But when I got a woman and I had my daughter (when I were 35 years old) my sleep became in a light sleep. Now my eyes had rings and I need to sleep until 4pm to feel well, to feel rested."
"Completely reliant on an application to sleep. Is there something I can do about this ridiculous rut I'm stuck in? In 2010 something traumatic happened to me. To zone out, I put on an application on my ipod of rain sounds that completely blocks out external noise. From that day onward I continued to use it to help block out external noise. Without that application, I can't sleep. I have gone days without it and I'm an absolute WRECK.I can't sleep at all without it. It is the only thing that gets me to a peaceful state and blocks out external noise. It does not work properly on my phone because my phone does not allow the volume to go loud enough, so it's useless. I am extremely sensitive to any external sounds, like the birds in the morning, light, dogs barking.. etc. I need it if my parents are fighting or talking about me negatively. It's the only thing that puts me at pace. Any single noise will disrupt me trying to sleep. My mind won't calm down without it. Lately, my ipod earphone jack has broken down. It's broken so that sound only comes out of one ear, despite having new earphones. I spend a lot of time twisting, prodding and moving them throughout the night every night so the sound comes out properly. But any slight touch can stuff it up again. This makes for a very exhausting time for me. The first weeks when this happened I was taking it really hard. I still had sleep, but I was depressed and couldn't see properly as I was tired.. That has stopped and I can cope with it better now, but I'm still tired. Tired because I'm not getting the sleep I used to when it was better You have no idea the ridiculous things that I have done involving my ipod and sleep. One time I left my earphones at my mother's place and ran there in the middle of the night to pick them up as she had no petrol. I was that desperate for sleep and that's how much I need them. When I moved back in with my parents, my step father accidentally removed the app on my ipod. They had no modem that could connect to my ipod, so I was in a state of panic for about a month. I begged them daily because I was going through utter hell. Eventually they got it (angry of course) and I was better again. I lived alone for several months, all what keep me sane till I couldn't stand it living there no longer was that ipod solely. I can easily go through 5-6 pairs of earphones a year (or more). When they stop working, I usually go a week till my next pay and suffer during those days of no sleep till I get a new pair. It's so mentally challenging and all I want to do is shut everything out of my head. I don't know what to do about my ipod now, because I can't afford to get it fixed and I don't even know if it's fixable. I HATE being reliable on that to keep me 'stable' with my mental state. Without it I can't function and I'm angry and moody and constantly in a daze. Is there something else I can use to block out all noise with natural rain sounds that I can plug into my ears comfortably? I have thought about a stereo, but that won't work because I will rip it out of the hole when I toss and turn at night and probably break the earphones. My room plug hole is too far away from my bed too. I am happy about buying a rain sounds CD, as long as it doesn't contain thunder or birds in the music and keeps playing the same thing for about 8-10 hours. But I don't know how I could use that so I blocks out the neighbours dog or my parents."
"Completely reliant on an application to sleep. That's a tough situation, weirdone. So, a couple of thoughts. You could get a rain sounds CD and rip MP3s [or you might find some online for free. YouTube might have long-playing videos of rain that could work. And use something like http://savevid.com to make an MP3.] Then use a cheap MP3 player to hook yourself up at night. But that isn't an long-term solution. You need to wean yourself off this somehow. I don't usually tell people what to do. And you are COMPLETELY welcome to ignore me. I am just a random person on the internet. Only, this seems like it would make it difficult to share a bed with someone in future. And it's not usual for sleep to be so dependent on an external factor. Perhaps you could try dropping the volume a VERY small amount each night. So that the change is imperceptible. Over time, it will add up. You'll be getting yourself used to hearing little sounds while you sleep. And ignoring them, like you used to do. OR, you said that you're beginning to cope with the broken ipod so perhaps it's better not to look for an alternative at all. But continue to push through, waiting for your sleep to get back to normal. Also, with the traumatic event, have you spoken to anyone about that? If it's still causing you issues, that could be appearing as this sleep disorder. In which case, relieving your dependence on the app might cause a different anxiety issue to appear. And perhaps working through the trauma more might ease your sleep anxiety. Just another thought. “ We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity.

"Levitation Hi, I'm very new to the forums here, so I'm unsure if I even posted this at the right place. I also don't know where else to post this, because I would like input from from a psychological and spiritual viewpoint both (if the latter applies). Anyway just a little bit about me, though you may skip this paragraph if you wish. I'm currently in college working for my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, because the subject interests me, and I'm hoping to go somewhere in the future with this field. However there are many things I wonder about, which, as a future psychologist, I would like to understand so that I can explain to future patients. Like with many people, I tend to forget my dreams. Sometimes I will remember some pieces here and there, but everything else is lost in my memory. I've had a moderate amount of dreams in which I could remember a lot, if not, all of it. But never have I ever sleep walked before (at least to my knowledge). Except this one time... I was staying at some apartment/hotel (cannot remember which) with my parents, and I want to say I was in my mid-teens or so, maybe 16 or a bit older. My parents went to sleep, and I went to my room to lay on my bed. Now before I mention anything else, you guys know that tingly feeling you get when your foot is asleep? I believe it's possible that I may have slept in a funny position, but instead of it affecting my foot, it was somewhere in the back of my head, perhaps between the neck and head (medulla? I could be wrong). Anyway, I do remember a tingling sensation of some sort, especially after I woke up, but I will get to that later. During my sleep, I got out of bed, and I was aware that I was doing so. I walked over to the kitchen, and I was doing something at the counter, but I cannot remember what. Then I instinctively peer down at the ground, and notice that: 1) I cannot feel the ground beneath me, yet I felt it when I was walking to the kitchen 2) I felt light 3) I was floating, possibly several inches above the kitchen floor My reaction was surprise, and even though I was aware that I had been lying in bed moments before, I could not tell if I was sleepwalking, or if I was dreaming that I was doing this. Everything else that happened after that was very blurry in my memory, but I was somehow back in my bed (cannot remember how I got to it), and I found myself desperately trying to wake myself up. After being seemingly paralyzed for a minute, I finally ""woke"" up. I could feel the back of my head tingling with that sensation of 'your foot having fallen asleep' but on the head instead. Scared, I darted over to my parents bedroom and woke them up. I described to my mom what had happened, but she was too sleepy to decipher the meaning, and told me to go back to sleep. I never told her about it again, until recently, and she said that I should do some research on this, because it is unusual. It can't be that unusual, because I've been reading about people expriencing some similar things. Does anyone have some kind of explanation for this? Was it really related to how my body was positioned when I fell asleep, or something else? Thanks"
"Excessive Daytime Sleepiness NOT responding to meds?? I have a long history of sleep disorders so this isn't exactly a new problem, although I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. It's nearly impossible for me to wake up in the morning, no matter how many hours of sleep I get. When I'm finally conscious enough to wake up I'm still so tired that if I close my eyes again I'll immediately fall asleep. Getting through the day is a nightmare because it's a constant struggle to stay awake enough to focus on anything, to have enough energy to be functional. I've been on psych meds for years and no matter what I've tried I still feel sedated (even with the kind that are said to be more energizing, like Wellbutrin). It seems regardless of what I take I'm fatigued. I often take caffeine pills in hopes that it will wake me up....it seems to ""physically"" keep me awake (i.e., I can feel my heart rate speed up) but I am still yawning non-stop and sleepy. My doctor put me on Nuvigil a couple of months ago, it seemed to help for a few days then stopped (so he increased the dose from 150mg to 250mg). I've continued to take it even though I still drag through the day trying to stay awake. I took Provigil years ago with a similar problem. Is there no hope for this? I mean, aren't Nuvigil and Provigil praised for being the ones that can help in extreme cases like that? Is there something else anyone knows of or has tried?"
"DSPS- sleeping 3.5 hours on Melatonin. Hi, I've got DSPS since I was 17. I'm 25 now. Nothing helped so far. I've tried Melatonin several times and had nightmares. This time they are gone. I take a slow-release version of 2 mg, and I sleep at a reasonable hour, but only for 3.5 hours. What can I do to sleep at least 6 hours at night? Should I try to combine the Melatonin with a benzodiazepine? Any help will be great. Thanks in advance."
"DSPS- sleeping 3.5 hours on Melatonin. sometimes buspirone helps me sleep by cancelling out the biochemical state of things preventing me sleeping. dont have any atm though. Research has suggested most dsps is psychological. In my case i think the dsps is caused by biochemical changes which are caused by psychological elements, e.g. levels of adrenaline vs cortisol etc."
"Years of sleeping problems Hello, for five or six years now I've had massive issues with my sleeping off and on. I've been diagnosed with Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, meaning that my internal clock isn't what it should be. Treatment is melatonin and/or light treatment, none of which worked. I've tried every single sleep hygiene tip that's out there, and now given up. I'm tired of not having functioning sleep, and I was hoping you could have any ideas. The problem has been different, sometimes extremely little sleep (1-4 hours a night for six months) where I was simply unable to fall asleep at the correct time. I always started waking up in the evening, making it impossible to sleep. Since I had to get up at 5 in the morning for school at that time, sleep was scarce. I completely collapsed and flunked out of school after that, and I feel I haven't really recovered since. Some months i can't sleep more than four hours at the time, sleeping several times during a day. Some months I seem to have a normal sleep, where I feel I can function pretty well. Now, for quite a few months, I've been unable to function during the day unless I have 10-16 hours sleep. If i have any less, or more, I'm tired and drowsy all day and my mind just doesn't function. Needless to say that any attempt on a normal life with this sort of sleep pattern is rather difficult. It doesn't help that I'm awake most of the night, and sleep most of the day. I'm lucky if I get to the store. I also get extremely tired very easilly, and if I have an early appointment that only lets me sleep for about 5-6 hours (which should be sufficient for a normal person) I'm knackered for days. I don't drink caffeine anymore, I gave it up in hope of improvements. There hasn't been any so far. I don't smoke, drink or do any drugs, except for prescribed medicine. I've been on and off on sleep medication (I'm afraid of getting hooked). I'm thinking that it might have somthing to do with my recent asperger diagnosis. Sorry for the long post. I really hope someone out there could have any ideas."
"Can't wake up on my own, always sleeping but still tired I figured i'd post here and get some perspective. First i'll explain what i've been going through best I can. (important note: i work the graveyard shift, from midnight-8:30am usually. generally i like to get home from work, do a couple things, then go to sleep before noon. then, sleep for a while, wake up around 7pm or so, and have my time to do things then, after sleeping and before work.) It all started about 4 months ago, give or take (bad memory). One night, out of no where, i slept until 11 pm (i try to leave the house to go to work around 11:40 pm). there was no gradation between waking up at a normal hour and waking up at a late hour like that. it just suddenly happened one night. ever since then, most nights, i wake up right around 11 pm no matter what i do (usually about 11:15 pm. i call it 'amityville horror curse' since it feels like it anyways). it can vary, sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little later. once in a blue moon i will sleep even later (to the point that i'm ate for work, but still sleeping) or even rarer, i'll wake up earlier (and by earlier i mean about 10 pm). now, it's not like usual, where someone wakes up, hits the snooze, goes back to sleep. aka, making a conscious decision to go back to sleep. i literally hear nothing, and don't wake up, and have no ability to wake myself up. my body just wakes up when it wants to, and there's nothing i can do about it. so i'm nearly terrified to sleep, since i don't know if, when i wake up, i will already be late for work, or what. i've tried several different things to wake up. i already have 3-4 alarms, and have tried setting them earlier, later, etc. nothing works, and usually i never hear them. i've tried sleeping with the tv on and off. i've tried sleeping earlier and later. nothing changes anything. i, on average over these months, sleep about 12 hours a day (sometimes i go through periods, like now, where i'm saying screw it and going to sleep around 4 pm, and getting about 7 hours of sleep). now, another thing is that no matter how long i sleep, i wake up completely exhausted (one day on my day off, i slept 24 hours, not waking up once in between. i woke up, and still felt tired later), to the point that about an hour after waking up, i am nodding off and falling asleep (not good for work). i at least have been prescribed some medication recently (used for a mental illness, but can double to work on lethargy), which at least keeps me from dozing off when i'm awake. on a rare occasion i will wake up to the alarms, a phone call, or just for no reason. but i literally can't get up/make it out of bed before falling back asleep. now, i've gotten blood tests and nothing is abnormal. i don't have anemia, or thyroid problems. i can pretty much already rule out sleep apnea. i had a suspicion that it could maybe be chronic fatigue syndrome, but i don't know. i'm trying to apply to do a sleep study. i know it's not just simply 'being depressed'. i've had depression my whole life, and have dealt with it. it wouldn't just suddenly effect me. besides, it doesn't explain being exhausted after sleeping plenty, or not ever waking up during sleep for any reason, until my body wakes up on it's own. it's not because of my work shift, since it still doesn't explain not having energy, and i've been at this job over a year and am fine with it. i didn't change any prescriptions (or anything else for that matter) around the time it started. i'm completely stumped, and annoyed. i literally don't have a minute of the day to myself. i have no time to clean, walk my dog or do anything with him, to relax, to do anything. i know people say all they do is sleep and work, but that's *literally* all i do most of the week. it's horrible, and i really can't have it effect my job anymore, because it's been effecting that to a degree. In summary: - I sleep long hours (against my will) but never gain any energy, and am so exhausted when i'm awake that i need to take prescription medication to keep me awake. Nearly positive it is not: - depression/emotions -medication/diet/etc. change -laziness -thyroid issues -anemia -sleep apnea If anyone could give me any insight or suggestions or anything else, it would be appreciated. In the meantime, i hope to find a sleep study as soon as possible, and hopefully that can shine some light on the issue. [edit: just an added note, don't think it has much to do with the issue but figured i'd add it. since around that time i've noticed that i must bite/grind teeth in my sleep because i often wake up with the insides of my cheeks and lips shredded. not bleeding usually, but the outer layer of skin is shredded to bits.] ☥fiat justitia ruat coelum☥ Rex - 22 - Male - Host Duke - 31? - Male - Alter non-diagnosed"
"Can't wake up on my own, always sleeping but still tired It's not a directly helpful suggestion. But if you aren't already, I'd recommend a sleep diary, logging when you went to sleep and got up. And perhaps some notes on diet and exercise, since they can influence sleeping patterns. You've ruled out a major effect from them, but you might catch something more subtle over time. I wonder if it might be a cumulative sleep debt, that's built up over time. It might be that 7 hours just isn't enough and you actually need 12 hours. Some people do. I'd recommend as much of a routine as possible, both in your timings and in how you prepare to sleep. And stick to that on your days off, too, so your body can trust the cycle. And check your teeth with a dentist to see about the biting. Apart from that, I hope you get into a sleep study soon, because this must be really frustrating! “ We think too much and feel too little.

"Can't wake up on my own, always sleeping but still tired Thanks. I've been recommended to do a sleep diary before (just in general, before this started) but i have a really bad memory so i can never remember to do it, or if i remember, then i forget the times i need to record. also i've gone on sleeping schedules before, and changed things around (alarm schedule, time to go to bed, time to wake up, etc.) but nothing has changed it. And i don't believe it would be cumulative. I can't really explain it, but i just don't believe it is. Especially since, even if it was, i don't think it would still be happening at this point. Sorry if it seems like i'm just shooting everything down that you said. And yeah, i need to try to remember to ask my dentist about the biting. He mentioned it to me before but i keep forgetting to look into a guard or something. I was researching again recently and came across something called ""hypersomnia"" and it sounds very similar to what i am experiencing. So i will bring this up with my therapist, then my doctor when i see them again. thanks again. ☥fiat justitia ruat coelum☥ Rex - 22 - Male - Host Duke - 31? - Male - Alter non-diagnosed"
"Meladaptive Daydreaming Disorder So, I have meladaptive daydreaming disorder, and most days I cope with it alright, trying hard to keep myself focused. It's like my mind gets so wrapped up in deep thoughts or daydreams that I can hardly do anything quickly. I often find myself staring into nothing once I realize I'm daydreaming again. It's like I can't really control it. When I take showers, I always find myself staring at the faucet for 10 minutes or so before I realize I'm supposed to be taking a shower. When I go to the bathroom to do something like brush my hair or teeth I find myself staring into space, simply letting my mind go wherever it wants. It hasn't usually caused me much trouble other than people complaining about me taking way too much time to do things. Of course, what am I supposed to tell them? ""Oh well I was staring for 10 of the 15 minutes I was in there."" Of course not. My family would think I've lost it if they knew this was an every day thing. The days that I can cope with it and keep myself occupied are unfurtunately the days that I have the worst anxiety issues. It's like I need to have my head in the clouds in order to escape unnecessary panic all day long. I feel like it drags me down completely. I can't just be alert and calm at the same time. I would much prefer a life without these disorders, but I have to learn to cope with such things. Most of my daydreams are about situations in my life or daydreams about what would happen if I acted a certain way. It's like a whole scene plays in my head and I can't help it. Also, a lot of them are about storylines, mainly a character in the book I've been writing, and anime (yes, I am a total nerd). Some nights I just lay in bed for hours consciously dreaming about things like that. So much so that I often lose a lot of real sleep. However, I've been working on that book for over 4 years now and I've only gotten the footnotes and chapter one written. I start writing and then I begin to daydream. Most people call me lazy, but I can't control it very well. I'm not a lazy person. I simply can't help the fact that I get caught up in thoughts and daydreams. It really makes me lose all motivation. I end up wasting too much time on things and they never get finished. I don't even know what career field I want to go into! I've been in college for two years now for advertising and business, and after daydreaming about medical things, I've now decided I want to study in the medical field. Oh and apparently I'd like to open a cafe, and be a mortician, and start a charity, and become an artist, AND be a writer, teacher, musician, music producer, and a vetinarian. It's like all these fantasies influence my personal choices and I have a hard time figuring out what I really want in life. I feel as if this disorder completely gets in the way of my everyday life, and I fear deeply that it's going to leave me with an empty future as well. Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated. ""Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door. Quothe the raven, 'Nevermore'"""
"Meladaptive Daydreaming Disorder Yes! Yes! And the worst is, it's not a diagnosable disorder. So you might find a therapist or psych willing to work with you on it. But you might also find them trying to label you schizophrenic, delusional, depersonalised or a number of other variations. Insights. I've done it for 25 years, so in my case it hasn't worn off by itself. There's a recent discussion depersonalization/topic94387.html which might be relevant. It's hard to separate it from ""normal"" issues. I think not knowing ""what you want to do with your life"" is quite common only made worse by MDD. It's not [I am not a psych, this is only opinion] a result of MDD. Yes, it may well mess up the future. I haven't done NOTHING with my life. But I wonder what would have been different if I hadn't been spending 6-14 hours a day daydreaming. I haven't unpicked the relationship between MDD and anxiety. I suspect that I might have been so anxious in the past because of the effects of MDD. But at the time, it very much felt like MDD was, as you say, an escape from it all. I also wonder if it's linked to OCD because of the compulsive and intrusive nature of the thoughts. It's stressful to try to choose not to daydream. I've stopped at the moment by taking n-acetyl cysteine [an amino acid] which I started to try and lift mood. Had no effect on that but it was like an off-button for my daydreaming. It doesn't work consistently! But my advice is to research as much as you can and experiment SAFELY. I had bad side effects from inositol which is helpful for OCD [which is why I tried it out]. Just because it's from a health food shop, or is labelled a supplement, doesn't make it right for your body chemistry. Seeing a psych may help, it's worth printing out an MDD info sheet to take with you. If they're willing to listen, they can be really helpful in tackling the anxiety which may be a trigger for you. And perhaps with the MDD too. Just be REALLY sceptical about taking prescribed meds. Research them first. And let us know how it goes. “ We think too much and feel too little.

"oversleeping too much :c I always always always have at least 12 hours of sleep. I usually wake up exactly 12 hours after I've gone to sleep, but then I can sleep for another 6-8 hours. I don't know what this is; I can just sleep and sleep and sleep - even when I'm not tired. I don't like it :/ I want to go out and do things but I just sleep my days away Because I do this, I'm incredibly lethargic all the time which just makes me want to sleep more. it's a horrible cycle 'cause we all have wings, but some of us don't know why."
oversleeping too much :c Sleep is good for health but too much sleep may also bad for health. 6-8 hours sleep is enough for a day. But if you can able to control it then concern any counselor.They will help you in this case. I think do exercise after wake up or go for running. It will keep you active and fresh.
"oversleeping too much :c I know I definitely have bad health because of all of my sleep. I want to get up and exercise everyday but I don't know, I always end up sleeping or find it just too hard to get up and stay awake But i will try It's going to be hard but I have to persevere lol 'cause we all have wings, but some of us don't know why."
"oversleeping too much :c Tayola, I realize your post was from awhile back but....... Have you considered having a sleep study? It is possible you may have sleep apnea or other medical issues. Consider 1st going in to see your regular doctor to rule out thyroid issues, etc. Also, are you on any meds that might cause fatigue, sleepiness,etc? I have a similar prob w/ hypersomnia I was diagnosed w/ sleep apnea 11 yrs ago and now sleep w/ a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machine. It helped immensely since my apnea was pretty severe so I wasn't getting into the deeper stages of sleep. I still cant go a night w/out wearing the machine but I still can sleep 12 plus hrs a night if I didnt need to be up for work, etc. So on my days off, I feel like crap after oversleeping. Partially for reasons of guilt. Makes me feel like a lazy bum But it is a vicious circle regarding getting up and moving or staying active. When you lay around all day, you feel even more tired and less motivated.....i know, easier said than done. But once you get the ball rolling as far as exercising it becomes easier. ""You must expend energy to get energy."" So exercising gives you more energy, not less. Sure, you're tired afterwards...physically, but wide away mentally and the great chemicals (endorphins) are a nice legal drug Coffee is a great cup of motivation too. Good luck and keep us posted."
"Sleeping terrifies me. I am not completely certain I would put this issue in this topic but considering I'm not really sure where to put it under I will do it anyways. For the past two weeks I have been having problems sleeping and haven't been able to get fully rested and would have to take school off even though I wouldn't want too. The past two days have been different. My parents left for the weekend and I'm not comfortable sleeping in the house alone, especially since even when they're here I experience things I wouldn't want to experience without them being in the house. When I try to sleep I feel as though someone is watching me or hear people saying my name. I'm not sure how to describe it. I get dizzy and feel pretty out of it and start to hear faint whispers of voices that sound like my parents but its never really them. The voices just say my name over and over. And when I get up it feels as though everything is really slow but fast at the same time. Just thinking about this terrifies me that it's going to happen again. I have had these experiences before when I was younger if I don't take my ADHD medication, Strattera 60mg. But I haven't taken it for two years. I don't understand what's wrong with me. I'm a female and I'm 17 years old"
"Sleeping terrifies me. Do you hear someone whispering your name and then waking up or is it that you hear someone continually calling your name even when you're wide awake? If you only hear this when you're half asleep then it's probablly just your mind playing tricks on you(it happens to me too, I get called by a woman ).I think this is similar to sleep paralysis so you should look into that. Some things to get better are eating healthy food, going to bed early (not when you're really tired), not using the computer 2 hours before bedtime and not being stressed. I know those are the same idiot solutions as always but they work and I hope you get better! Btw. the feeling of being watch are probably you bein scared of sleeping alone. If you are wide awake when you hear things etc. then those are hallucinations and you shouldtalk it over with you doctor, it could be the meds. I hope you get better"
"I can't sleep! I've been sleeping great lately with the addition of klonopin and seroquel. However the past two nights I have not slept well, I tried to take a nap today (which I usually do) and it failed. I tried taking an extra klonopin, but to not avail. I waited a good 20 minutes and sleep did not come. Usually on this medication I call fall asleep within 10 minutes. I'm freaking out and becoming paranoid about sleep, I fear it. When I don't sleep I feel sick and gross. I' m so tired all the time. Help?"
"I can't sleep! Hey there, I have trouble sleeping a lot too, I have a few problems but night terrors are something that have haunted me for a few years now! I take clonazepam to help me relax and sleep. If i am really having trouble sleeping I like to use lavender products and Badger forehead balm is great to relax you as well. Also having a nice bath and making your bed ready helps too as well as reading a book. A lot of people say to write to do lists so then you don't worry about what you may have to do tomorrow, or even just write that on your phone calendar or something? Hope some of this might help?"
"I can't sleep! ispydork, I have the same problem. As long as there's no ""noise from next door, grrrr"" I can fall right asleep, but am waking up constantly. I am on Klonapin 2mg, Trazodone 200mg, Abilify 15mg at night. If yours keeps up, you might try trazodone if you have depression at all. It's for that and also helps you go to sleep."
"Biting, twitching, tapping teeth My boyfriend says I twitch my limbs around a lot when I'm sleeping. He also says I tap my teeth together gently for a while sometimes with my mouth open. The weirdest thing though is that I've been waking myself up lately by taking a big violent bite out of the air and snapping my teeth shut. I'm wondering if anyone else experiences that because I haven't been able to find any info on that other than tooth grinding, which I also do, but this is different."
"What is Wrong with me?!?! 1-2 days out of every week, there will be a night where I will be up 24 hours straight. Let me go into detail, when it comes to the time where I normally go to bed I still don't feel tired,it still feels like day, all through the night. If I try to sleep it doesn't happen, it's not like a tossing turning uncomfortable type of deal, I know I haven't been drifting in or out of sleep either. It just feels pretty weird because my body is not tired at all. I have tried dosages of melatonin ranging from 1-20 mg on each occasion. Nothing works, neither does Valerian root. I even tried 200mg's of seroquel.....nothing. Also on days when I get a good amount of sleep 8-10 hours, I will randomly get really tired for no reason, I have been removed from class because of this. All this is really taking a toll on me, does anyone know what this is?"
"What is Wrong with me?!?! I don't know, but have you talked to a doctor about it? It might just be that you have unusual sleep cycles, but it's worth ruling out physical causes such as hormone imbalances first. “ We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. ” Charlie Chaplain in The Great Dictator"
"What is Wrong with me?!?! I haven't used it [I rarely suffer from insomnia.] A forum search will let you know what other people here have said about it in the past. It does seem to be primarily used as an antidepressant, although the wikipedia page does mention regulation of sleep disorders too at a much lower dosage. Let us know how it goes! “ We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. ” Charlie Chaplain in The Great Dictator"
"What is Wrong with me?!?! A few other thoughts, if it's helpful. Have you analysed your general routine, just to rule out environmental issues? I'm embarrassed to say how long it took me one time to realise that the cup of coffee I had before bed might be connected to sleep issues. This was before the internet, I was much more stupid then. ; ) Do you have any kind of diary or log of sleep quality? Perhaps keeping short notes on diet, exercise and how you spent the few hours before bed might give you some clues? Did your doctor discuss other possibilities with you or did they go straight for the prescription pad? “ We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. ” Charlie Chaplain in The Great Dictator"
"What is Wrong with me?!?! He went straight for the prescription pad lol. I know it has to be something with my internal ""alarm clock."" I will probably start a sleep log, thanks for that idea! The reason I know it has to do with me is when I took seroquel+trazadone I gradually got sedated and fell asleep fast. I took 200mg trazadone+100mg seroquel 4 hours ago and feel nothing."
"What is Wrong with me?!?! It's not the same issue, but perhaps some of the thoughts in this thread insomnia/topic94815.html might help. Just around general sleep routines and lifestyle. Might give you some hints about what to log or experiment with. I'm not a doctor, this is not a medical opinion, your doctor completely overrides this, but, that seems like it might be quite a high dose of trazadone. If it's not doing the job, unless your doctor has explicitly okayed it, I wouldn't keep increasing dosages. Just IMO. “ We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity.

"Afraid to Sleep Alone until 13 years old. So, I'm a 16 year old male and until I was 13 years old I would get extreme anxiety trying to sleep alone so I used to sleep with my grandma or my mom. I don't know what was wrong with me but it still bothers me looking back at it and I feel like a freak, like people would think I was a freak if they knew. It's been really bothering me and I don't know what to do, I just want to feel normal. I'm pretty sure the reason I had such anxiety trying to sleep alone was because my dad (before he divorced my mom and abandoned us when I was 12) used to make me watch really messed up scary movies and tv shows about serial killers and rapists and things like that at as young as 7 years old. And despite knowing that this was probably the reason, and a good reason at that, i still feel like a weirdo for having to sleep with my mom or grandma for so long. Is there anyone on here who went through anything remotely similar?"
Feeling Constantly Tired? For a little over a year I have been feeling constantly tired... all day... every day. I can get a solid 9 hours of sleep and i will still wake up and feel exhausted. I have days where I wake up and 2 hours latere I am already ready to go back to sleep. I am diagnosed with depression and am working with doctors now to see what is wrong with me. It's such a frustrating feeling and I was wondering if anyone else out there feels this way?
"Feeling Constantly Tired? Perhaps I should also add.... I've had the same problem with tiredness and depression for years, and I couldn't get anyone to listen to me. I finally found a health professional that took me seriously and ordered a sleep study. The study revealed that I only had one cycle of REM sleep over a period of time when I should have had three. Only then was I told that REM sleep suppression is a side effect of many antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs). I am now working with a sleep psychologist. I'm still in the early stages of treatment, but I am hopeful"
"Feeling Constantly Tired? Hello, I was dx w/ sleep apnea 10 yrs ago and have been using a CPAP. It was a little difficult to get used to be sooo worth it. Just to give you an idea.....sleeping 2 hours w/ the CPAP made me feel way less tired than 10 hours of sleep w/out it. My sleep study concluded that I was having very freq apneas. 2 per minute!! Lasting between 15-45 seconds. It's no wonder that I was ready to go back to bed an hour after waking, nodding off at the wheel, extremely irritable (go figure ). Please send an update on your apnea being treated w/ CPAP, or dental appliance, etc."
"Please tell me what this is!! Hi everyone, I have a problem. So my problem is that almost everytime I go to sleep I end up waking up psychotic, like I wake up really mad and wanting to hurt my mom or just anyone that is around me, it usually happens more after I take naps, and Im like this all day and sometimes I feel like my body has switched to the ""evil"" side of me. Can anyone tell me if they've experienced this? Im worried that one day I'll end up hitting my mom or something"
"Please tell me what this is!! L13290, Hello from Patchoulijade. First of all welcome to Psych Forum. I am a member just like you. There are no dr.'s, psychiatrists, psychologists, etc. on this site. There are people who suffer from mental health issues who work together to try and resolve our issues. So again, Wlelcome. First of all, could you please share what your personal definition of ""psychotic"" is? That would be very helpful. And may I please ask your age? It matter a lot in knowing where you are in your growth process, please. Also, L13290 could you please share more about ""switching"" after you wake up from naps, being asleep, etc. Are you having significant personality changes, or is the ""shifting"" more mood-related? Wanting to hurt another human being is illegal in the state I live in. And I know you do not want a criminal record after hurting your Mom. Why do you have so much anger aimed at her? What type of relationship have you/do you have with her, please? You used the word ""evil"" side of you. Do you feel that you have different personalities? Have you ever been to a mental health professional? Something you need to seriously consider doing L12390. Rage is more like what I hear you expressing towards your mom. Yet you also said you want to hurt anyone that may be around you when you are ""switching"". Please respond to questions I have asked you. You have asked for help. You now need to search within you regarding the above questions and answer them as honestly and to the absolute best of your ability so this member can understand more about what you are dealing with L13290. Peace. Patchoulijade."
hearing voices right before falling asleep? does this happen to anyone else out there? the voices are really clear and some times really loud..like screaming in my ear. the loud ones only last less than a second just enough to snap me out of being able to sleep. also i almost always recognize the voices as close friends other than this one time i heard someone but when i opened my eyes it was me talking to my self. just wondering anyone else?
"hearing voices right before falling asleep? Not voices, per se, but last night I actually heard what sounded like a choir holding out one, long note. It was beautiful, but eventually got quite disruptive. Oddly enough, if I cover my ears with something, such as a pillow, it goes away. When I lived with my parents still, I would often get up in the middle of the night to turn the TV in the living room off, only to find that it wasn't on in the first place, and I was just ""hearing things""."
"hearing voices right before falling asleep? The experience of hearing voices, sound or music during sleep are all associated with the 'hypnagogic state'. The hypnagogic state is the borderline between sleep and waking. When one's mind is alert, but the body falls asleep, one experiences conscious hypnagogia. Interestingly, this hypnagogia can be induced intentionally, by performing a progressive relaxation technique. Usually, hypnagogia begins with simply shapes and colours forming behind the closed eyelids, along with voices and sounds. Music is rarely heard during this state- but is definitely associated with it. Hypnagogic images may start to appear, which will gradually increase in complexity. A wake initiated lucid dream (WILD) can result as the hypnagogic imagery evolves, and eventually forms dream scenes. Consciously observing a dream forming in front of your eyes is an amazing experience. In no way is hypnagogia harmful- it is a completely natural event. Sometimes, the voices repeat words multiple times. Just like it is difficult to remember dreams, remembering all the details of hypnagogia can also be difficult. The main difference between hypnagogia and dreams is that hypnagogic images are highly static, and lack narrative content."
"Odd Sleep disorder, or some other problem? I've been dealing with this problem that's really affecting my sleep for the past year. At night I stay up really late, and even though I get really tired, I feel this need to keep pushing myself to stay up and not go to bed yet. Only sometimes, I rationalize this in my head as not wanting to go to bed yet because I'm afraid of not having been productive enough through the day and am afraid of ""losing it"" or something, but not everytime. It's really weird, and I dont know what it is. But I'm really sleep deprived and every night I tell myself not to do it, but every night ends up the same. I'll try really hard to break free of this terrible cycle and attempt to take small steps and go to bed 1/2 hour earlier each night, and I will make progress for 2-3 nights, but it's always derailed at some point when I stay up till dawn the next day before and I'm back to square one. Any thoughts on what is going on here? I want to be a normal person again and not a zombie... Thanks for any advice!"
"Odd Sleep disorder, or some other problem? Hi, lady_labyrinth! It might be anxiety or even part of some kind of depression. Have you been feeling other stuff too, for the past year. Did anything traumatic happen? You could see a doctor about this. Go to your usual doc and tell them you need someone who specializes in sleep disorders. forum-rules.php I am sorry I am not on the forum as much as I used to be, if I do not reply to you quickly, please contact another moderator/supermod/admin as well."
"Odd Sleep disorder, or some other problem? Well, I'd say in this situation you need to take radical decision, that is start going to sleep at the time which you consider would be if you had already achieved the ""normal"". I strongly suggest 9 pm or 10pm but it is, of course, your choice. There are three things you need to do: a - spare 1-3 hours (once) for doing nothing but contemplating on the fact that life is more than results, more than economic gain and more than any other measurable results. It is more. b - decide on the time for sleep and when the time comes, let everything go and just go to sleep. It's really not as important as you imagine :] c - spend 30 min. to 1 hour every day for the next two week during which you would be thinking about what works need to be done, which ones do not need and etc. - how to simplify and increase the effectivenes of your activities in order to finish everything 2 hours before your sleeping time (this will be your buffer). Knock and it will be opened :] Hope this helps!"
"Odd Sleep disorder, or some other problem? I usually skip going to sleep one night completely, then go to bed early the next night, then get up at whatever time I want to reset the sleep cycle to. Getting up can be really hard though. I get really bad sleep inertia, when I can fall back asleep very easily for at least 40 minutes, and much longer if I actually fall asleep. Also if I am sleep deprived, I can sleep much longer than normal, easily over 15 hours. Most of the reason I skip a night's sleep is that I'm afraid I wouldn't bother getting up or wouldn't be awoken by the alarm since I'd be too tired. Also if I'm doing anything special the next day and is anxious or have lots of thoughts in bed, I have a hard time falling asleep. Clozapine 700mg (max 800) and Aripiprazole 20mg (max 30)"
"How can i fix my sleeping schedule? I'm going back to school in september after months of unscheudled sleeping. I mean I rarely had to do anything, so I slept very randomly, like when i started a torrent or i have nothing to do in the afternoon, or i was simply bored because i cant find anything entertaining on TV, in varying intervals(6-36h) and lenghts(2-16h), and now i cant return to a regular sleeping pattern. I'm trying for two weeks now without any significant results. Just trying to find the thin line where my needs and society's needs overlaps"
"How can i fix my sleeping schedule? You might like to have a look at this thread: insomnia/topic94815.html as it has many interesting ideas about insomnia. I'd also recommend getting into a routine during the day, particularly with regard to bedtime ritual, exercise and regulating caffeine intake, and see if that helps. And not sleeping any longer than 9 hours, with an alarm clock on the other side of the bedroom if that's what it takes. “ We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity.

"havent slept through the night in 15 years Hi all, just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and if they have found any solutions? I'm not one of these people who can crash the second they hit the pillow. It usually takes me 10-15 mins on average to fall asleep, sometimes up to an hour, sometimes 3-4 hours. But whenever I get to sleep I never remain asleep the full night. I will usually wake at about 3am, have to go back to sleep, wake again an hour and a half later, go back to sleep, wake, re-sleep for 45 mins etc... I can never sleep more than 4-5 hours in a block and after the initial 4-5 hours it's 45-90 minute blocks maximum. It gets to the point where I just aren't tired enough to go back to sleep so I wake up. I'm almost never refreshed from sleep, I'm constantly tired throughout the day. Even if I then go to bed early - eg 9pm/10pm - I won't fall asleep till 1am. Sleeping pills have almost no effect on me, even prescription ones. I still exhibit the same pattern. My last two gf's have both been the types that can fall asleep in a minute and be out like a light for 10-12 hours if they're tired. I really wish I could get that kind of sleep but for me, it's broken nights sleep every night of my life and some times I get so frustrated with being unable to sleep I just get so angry and in despair and upset. I can't remember ever having slept through the night or getting more than 7-8 hours in a night (and that 7-8 hours being broken sleep). Has anyone had something similar?"
sleep misperception please help out the whole of last week i feel i never slept i went to my doctor Wensday cause i been having problems since monday sleeping but he just said take no sleep pills im 17 by the way.I feel crazy its saturday now and mom says i been sleeping but i get up having no memory of sleep i just remember being up tossing not sleeping i fell i never slept
"sleep misperception please help out I'd suggest keeping a sleep diary, writing down each morning how long you felt you slept for and how long you were in bed for. It would be good to include what you're eating, especially within 6 hours of sleep and any other triggers, such as mental stimulation [gaming, reading, movies, etc.] just before bed, and exercise. This will help you to see if there are any patterns for good or bad nights, and also gives you evidence if you need to go back to the doctor. You won't need to be vague and will have an informative data set for him/her to look at and make recommendations from there. “ We think too much and feel too little.

"unintentionally rocking back and forth while trying to sleep Last night while I was trying to sleep, I was almost asleep and I felt my body rock back and forth.

"Why do I not like sleep, and I'm okay with it? I'm new to this forum, and it's usually nights like tonight I ask myself this question. I've been doing it for literally YEARS!!!! I was ""diagnosed,"" with ADHD as a youth, and was prescribed appropriate meds for it, which I had stopped taking when I had entered the military nearly 14yrs ago. I feel like sleep is a massive waste of time, and if I didn't need to be at 110% for my next day, I wouldn't sleep. I could literally find millions of things to do with myself in the time, and STILL never feel like I got anything done. It's not that I don't enjoy sleeping; when I'm tired, I LOVE curling up to sleep, but I find absolutely ZERO enjoyment out of sitting in my bed, wanting to sleep. If I go to bed at 0500L, I get up at 0900L, as if I just got 8hrs of restful sleep.. If I get 8hrs of sleep, I feel okay.. If I get more than that, my body is sore, and my head hurts.. I never thought there was anything wrong with me and always felt like there was something wrong with my friends who DID sleep for 9+hrs. Some folks blame it on the military, but I beg to differ; it's ALWAYS been like this. Without sounding neurotic, I have been starting to feel like there's something wrong with me, because I have been fighting sleep lately, as I've been getting older.. I just don't want to give in to it. Now before people get on me for the ""health,"" concerns, I'm aware of how bad it is to not get enough sleep. I still get my sleep, just not in a Circadian rhythm as others do.. It's not helping that I'm in college, and that my sh-t insurance only covers some visits to things like Counselors and Psychologists. JT I do it my way, because no one has told me their way was better yet."
"Why do I not like sleep, and I'm okay with it? Hi, JT! Maybe this is just part of the ADHD for you and if it doesn't hurt you maybe it's not the end of the world. It sucks that you don't have good insurance, people shouldn't have to depend on that to get help...

"Why do I not like sleep, and I'm okay with it? Hey Jasmin! Imagine if you will: 15 February2012 Dr's Office: ""Thank you for calling ******** Dr's Office. How can I help you?"" Me: ""Yes, I've been having some issues with mental health lately, and I was hoping to see if I could speak to someone, whether it be a Counselor, Doctor, Nurse, etc..."" Dr's: ""Okay, do you feel like you're not safe or that you want to hurt yourself or others?"" Me: *chuckle* ""Naaaaah, I just haven't been sleeping, can't concentrate much, issues forgetting things. Not sure if it's the ADHD I was diagnosed with as a kid, or if it's from the concussion I got last year, just lingering."" Dr's: ""Well, our next available appointment is 30 April. Will that work for you?"" Me: ""30 April?!?!?!?! That's two months away!!! Are there any other Dr's in the area that aren't so busy?"" Dr's: ""Unfortunately, no. There may be another Dr somewhere around here, but they are probably booked worse."" I realize Doctors are tough to come by in some disciplines, but I find it odd that I finally take the plunge and decide to get help for myself, and the Doctors tell me they're too busy. I know it sounds selfish of me, and I've already gone nearly 32 years with this, but I was hoping maybe just to get in, introduce myself, and begin the process, so another 2 months shouldn't be a too bad. I was hoping to at least be on the path to recovery before the end of this Semester, since this one counts a bit more than others.. So the struggle continues...........

"Brain sleeping while awake? Brain trip? Hello, I have had this a month or two ago and i had it last night again. When i'm in bed and very tired my brain sometimes trips out. I learned this happens when i have slept little the previous day. When i experience this my mind has trouble grasping proportions, for example my bed felt the size of a football pitch, my body feels out of proportion aswell. From feeling very tiny to bloated and round in a few seconds. Also if i imagined a picture in my head the image would shake, fly all over the place, 1 second it seems normal size then an intense zooming out. In a sense i felt out of body, also remember flying real fast trough something, like made up non logical scenery. All this whilst still being awake.

"Adaptive Lighting Hi everybody, I'm a senior in the Industrial Design program at the University of Cincinnati. I'm currently working on my thesis project and my topic is light.

Has anyone found that light effects how well they sleep? I'll be posting similar threads in the SAD and general health sections if anyone is interested to check them out.

"REM BEhavioural Disorder Thx Kristoff. I did a sleep study and the Dr showed me the results. Apparently I was spending most of the night in sleep stage 2 and 3, and only occasionally getting to stage 4. I snore. And when I would snore, I'd know myself out of stage 4 sleep and partially wake up. During this half awake stage, I'd be able to act out dreams. Funny that it's always punching though. SOmetimes screaming. The doc said it was probably my SNRI meds that were causing this... if I weren't on them my snoring would not wake me up. Apparently anit depressants are known to create this issue. It went away for a long time, now I've realized it might be coming back.

"Does this happen to anyone else? Sometimes when I'm falling asleep I'll hear a voice in my ear, as if someone is speaking right next to me. The other night it happened and I heard my friend say my name and I jolted upwards. My boyfriend asked me what was wrong and when I told him he was concerned. He said that never happened to him before. I thought this was something that happens to everyone. That was the first time I heard the voice of someone I know, it's rarely more than a word or two, I have never recognized a voice before, and it ALWAYS sounds as though the persons mouth is right next to my ear. It's always shocking, but I have never thought too much into it. Does this happen to anyone else?"
"Does this happen to anyone else? I've never had that happen before as you describe... I have heard a voice in my ear before saying my name. That was a particular memory of a traumatic event.

Does this happen to anyone else? This sounds like an auditory hypnogogic hallucination. hypnogogic - because it happens just before sleep (if it happened just before wakening it would be hypnopompic). Seemingly nothing to worry about - so I was told by a Psychiatrist. Some Emotional and Mood Instability.
"Strange Sleep Paralysis last night. So last night I had another bout of Sleep Paralysis, but this one was a lot different from the usual. Usually I cant move period when it happens, and I don't really feel much of anything. Occasionally I see the random hallucination of a figure made of shadow doing a whole lot of nothing but standing on the other side of the room until the paralysis wears off. This time was completely different though. Rather than gradually waking up like usual it felt like I was just jerked awake like someone had just hit me or something. After waking up I immediately became aware of the sensation of being electrocuted, and it hurt. I wasn't paralyzed though, I could still move but it just made it worse and hurt more when I did. I also hallucinated something completely different than usual, but I don't think it's all that important(It involved one really freakin' tall alien) and it only lasted about a minute or so until everything felt like it just fast forwarded a good few hours to the point where it just started get light outside and I'm completely covered in sweat and it feels like I'm on fire. I had to get up and jump in an ice cold shower to cool off. I'd somewhat gotten used to my Sleep Paralysis for the most part despite it not being all that common, and then this comes out of left field. I've felt shook up all day and I even had a minor panic attack over it earlier. Even the first time I ever had Sleep Paralysis didn't shake me up this bad.

I'm trying to exercise on a daily bases (slow going) and I don't want to intake too many carbs or anything because I already gain weight from the depakote. I wonder if this is depression related, if anyone else experiences this, and who I should talk to. None of the doctors I've seen seem to say anything about it.

"Is this sleep paralysis? Hi, I'm Missy. I'm a 19 year old female. and I think that what I have been experiencing is sleep paralysis, but I want to be sure it isn't something else. This has been going on for around a year or so. Here goes: So, sometimes I'll wake up and I can't move or speak. I can control my breathing and if there is someone else in the room I try to breathe more heavily or quickly to let them know what's going on so they can wake me up but it has never worked. It Always feels like I'm in slow motion. That's the biggest thing. I feel like I'm moving in extreme slow motion, but I somehow know that I'm not. I usually know exactly where I am and what is happening as it has been happening for around six months now so I'm never really frightened. I can sometimes wake myself up my twitching my face or jerking my head. But, if I do this I will sometimes fall straight back to sleep. In times when I can't wake myself up, I end up willing myself back to sleep. It has happened in the middle of the night, in the middle of the day when I'm taking naps, and even in the car when I'm sleeping on road trips. If it happens once, it's likely to happen again if I go back to sleep, but it does not happen every time I sleep. Usually it is around twice a month or so.

Many sleep disorders Sometimes our sleep is depend on our daily work. If you with hard then after you get tired you can sleep easily. But many times the stress is the main reason for sleep disorder. Sleep disorder is now a days very common problem and some people take tablets for sleeping. It is really very harmful. I think do the exercise for the normal sleep.
"Many sleep disorders I agree shree123, somes I look at the hand full of pills I take and I feel sad and afraid. I've been to many doctors and shrinks and I haven't been able to find the source of my disorder. I've been meditating now a few years now and that hasn't helped. My disorder started about a year after my wife died. So I can only artibute it to unresolved grief."
"Many sleep disorders Sleep disorders include a range of problems. Sleep disorders are a common problem for many people. Lack of sleep can cause irritability, depression, an inability to focus. Sleep disorders can affect anyone at any age and can be caused by a variety of reasons. sleeping pills, behavioral or psychological treatments or other types of treatments are now available but I think healthy food and exercise will help you to fight with Sleep disorder."
"Many sleep disorders exercise is the only thing I haven't tried. I have to find some way to integrate it into my life, I get home so late after work. Something very strange happened last Friday.

The next night it was the usual insomnia. I'm still trying to understand why that night I slept like a normal person. I come home tired from work almost every day why doesn't it help me sleep? Then I think, could it be the pychological? Maybe just being with my brother (whom I love more than anything) was relaxing mentally and touched mt heart. I'm really at a loss and can't explain this. I guess next time I see my shrink we'll talk about it."
"Actually don't know what's wrong... I was actually hoping someone could help me, because I actually don't know what I have. Or maybe it's just normal. I can't sleep very well.

"Delayed REM, but not full on DSPS? I've always had trouble waking up in the mornings, and in the last two years it's gotten exponentially worse, but the doctors can't figure out what's wrong. This is a long, detailed story so bear with me: Background: From elementary to high school, I had to wake up at 6AM, and according to my parents I was always hard to wake up, and it was always hard for me to fall asleep. I don't recall any of this (or much of my childhood period), and I'm still having extreme difficulty waking up. But here's the kicker: I don't have any problems going to sleep and I don't wake up in the night . Usually, I go to bed anywhere between 11:30 and 12:30. I have no problems going to sleep, and I fall asleep within 20 minutes. I don't wake up in the middle of the night (that I can recall). When my alarm clock, which is situated across the room, goes off anytime before 10AM, I get up out of bed in a foggy, drunken-like stupor, hit the snooze button, carry the alarm with me back to bed, and go back to sleep. As the alarm keeps going off every five minutes for the next hour or two, it is constantly interrupting my dreams and I continually wake up in a foggy stupor and hit the snooze button. My wife will try to wake me up and I will talk to her in my sleep, and then never remember any of it. By the time I wake up, it's 10-11AM and my body feels horrible (almost aching all over) and I'm fatigued for the entire day. Occasionally I will have ""excessive daytime drowsiness"" in addition to the fatigue. My wife also mentioned that she has dreams in the middle of the night , while I notice that I only have them in the late morning , which is what tipped me off that something isn't quite right. Environment I've lived in the same house for 22 years. 11 years I slept in a downstairs bedroom, 11 years I slept in an upstairs bedroom. Suffered from the same symptoms, though not as bad as recently. Moved to a new place 8 months ago, and the fatigue and sleepiness hit me really hard the last 3-4 months. Two years ago I spent most of March in Japan, where I walked all over the place and was passed out asleep by 10PM and woke up at the crack of dawn, completely alert and awake, with no fatigue and no drowsiness during the day. Come back home, suffer from jet lag for a month and a half, then I'm back into the same old painful cycle. Spent a week this Spring in Hawaii, still slept late, had mild fatigue and no drowsiness. Spent 8 months this past Summer in California at an intensive language program where breakfast was at 7AM, classes at 8AM. The first 5 weeks I went to bed around 12-1AM and struggled to wake up in time for 8AM class. Last 3 weeks I went to bed at around 11-11:30PM and was barely able to wake up by 7AM, but was able to get breakfast and get to class on time. Did not suffer from any fatigue or drowsiness at all. Came home, I started sleeping even later, and feeling even worse. The only two environments where I did not suffer from this problem were California and Japan, Japan being the better of the two. Doctor Visits I went to my physician. He tested me for Vitamin D, HIV, and some other run-of-the-mill stuff. Couldn't find anything. I went to an endocrinologist. He checked Thyroid, Liver functions, Testosterone, Quartisol, Vitamin D, bone density. Didn't find anything wrong with me other than osteoporosis (at the age of 23 no less) and completely ignored my other symptoms and focused on the osteoporosis. Went back to my physician, said the endocrinologist wasn't helping and things were getting worse. He said that I have a ""narcoleptic feel"" and referred me to a sleep study. Went to a sleep study. Went to sleep at 10:30PM, they woke me up at 5AM. I woke up completely awake and alert, rested and refreshed. Which never, ever happens at home. Sleep doctor said my sleep study was normal. After I explained to him that I did not experience any problems at the sleep study, he thought that my problem could be environmental. Then I told him that I've had the problem at 3 different locations, excluding Hawaii, hotels, etc. Then I mentioned that the alarm clock keeps interrupting my dreams. He said that that would make sense if my REM phase is delayed, and that the alarms are interrupting my REM sleep and I'm not getting any rest. So he suggested I push my sleeping schedule back an hour. Currently I'm going to bed around 11-11:30PM, trying to wake up between 6:30 and 8:30. I still can't do it. If my REM sleep doesn't start until 5AM, and doesn't end until 10AM, how am I supposed to wake up and have a normal life? I've already had to drop a 10:20AM class because I couldn't make it in time, and my cognitive functions are going down the toilet and I can't concentrate because I'm not getting any rest. And to make things worse, I have a 9:10AM class next semester that I have to take. Is there anything I can do to get my butt out of bed in the mornings?"
"RLS and pain Does anyone else here have Restless Legs Syndrome? If you do, do have extreme pain with it? Not only do I have pain at night, but I have almost unbearable pain during the day. It feels like I'm getting hit over and over with a sledgehammer. Is this something that is normal with RLS or should I be talking to my doctor about other possibilities? Thanks!"
"RLS and pain Never been officially diagnosed with it, but I know I have it. The sensations and pain is different every night. I don't take meds for it and haven't spoken to a doc about it. When it gets real bad I just get up and walk. Walking time varies to depending how bad my legs hurt. The walking does help. If you are worried, talk to a doc."
RLS and pain My thing is that I don't just get pain in the night. It's 24 hours when it comes and then it will go away for weeks and sometimes months at a time. Walking makes it worse too. I'm thinking of mentioning it to my doc today.
"RLS and pain SEVERE RLS runs in my family. It is a mild form of Parkinson's and, like Parkinson's, the cause is neurological NOT muscular, so muscle relaxers, exercise of the muscles to exhaustion, stretching, and the like will NOT have a significant effect on your symptoms. RLS gets worse as you get older and WAY worse if you are a pregnant woman. No treatment or drug ever works long term, so you will have to develop a good relationship with a neurologist that is an expert in the disorder so you can keep tweeking your medication routine as needed and even take ""medication holiday"" to bring your tolerance back down to the point where meds can help. Fibromyalgia is highly correllated with RLS. The pain that you are experiencing could be due to Fibromyalgia symptoms and may be controlled by anti-depressent meds that focus on dopamine and/or seretonin receptors. On line support groups are a great help. There is one through USC that is monitored by a leading expert in the subject and he gives EXCELLENT advice. Good luck."
"Seizure, not, or what? I am not sure if this is the right forum to post this on, but I was hoping someone might have an answer. The other night, I woke up and I was shaking all over, but I couldn't make myself move. I tried to sit up, but I couldn't. Also, I couldn't breathe, and could not talk either. It only lasted a few seconds, but it was pretty scary, nonetheless. I was just wondering if anyone knew what could cause this, or what it might be... (?)"
"Seizure, not, or what? Hi, Koco! We can't give you a diagnosis or a sure answer here, you could talk to your doctor about it if you want. I think some people can't move when they first wake up because of something called sleep paralysis, but it doesn't involve shaking. Hey, try asking in more forums. Are you ok? forum-rules.php I am sorry I am not on the forum as much as I used to be, if I do not reply to you quickly, please contact another moderator/supermod/admin as well."
"Strange Positions? I was wondering if anyone sleeps or wakes up in strange positions?? I usually wake up in the morning with my back twisted (legs going one way, torso going the other way). OR I am flat on my stomach with my head all the way turned to the side. My back/neck hurts all day every day because of it. Is this normal? Is there something wrong?"
"Strange Positions? Yep, It happens to me. When I was little (from months to 3 years) I used to sleep in strange positions (I was told), the most frequent was in prone with my butt up, supporting on knees and head.. When I was in like 4th grade I used to sleep like a corpse in a coffin, I woke up the same, without even undoing the bed! haha it freked me out a little. It has been a range of all sort of positions since, like the ones you mentioned, and sometimes it seems like a tornado pass thru with all the movement. I remember a couple of weeks I had an ingrown toenail because I was pushing my toe against something hard while sleeping and other things due to bad positions. I´m very anxious since I remember so that's the answer. it's definitely a mix of a reflection of the state of mind, weather, health condition and other things, but mainly the first one, I think. Meditation is a good option, you can do it before sleep. You could also wrap yurself like a mummy before bed. Take care"
"alpha delta sleep and fatigue? alpha wave intrustion/alpha delta sleep/ alpha sleep anomaly- all names for the same thing. Does anyone else have this? Are there medications that help with this? I was told I do not have a sleep disorder except my EEG showed I had alpha wave intrustion. I cannot seem to get enough sleep. I can sleep most of the night and half of the day. 14 hours easily. I am not depressed. Although I've been having some medical problems related to gastrointestinal partial paralysis/severe IBS. I also cannot sleep on a set schedule due to chronic pain. Alpha EEG Sleep Anomaly - Alpha wave sleep disturbances are common in patients with FMS and/or myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). Delta sleep is interrupted when alpha waves intrude. Alpha waves can wake patients up, or just prevent them from getting a good quality of sleep, which usually results in more pain. K-alpha waves, which mainly occur during stage two sleep, create poking sensations. Experts believe that K-alpha waves also contribute to GI (gastrointestinal) problems and cause muscle pain. This sleep anomaly affects mostly women FMS patients. Although K-alpha is similar to PLMS, it may not be caused by the same mechanism."
"Trouble Finding Sleep solution I have been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, as well as Chronic Fatigue/fibromyalgia. For years I took Flexeril, but recently stopped taking it because of how sedating it was. I have gone through several more medications, but the trouble is that I am extremely sensitive to most drugs and usually have undesirable results. My doctor tried me on Trazadone, then Ambien. I can take one half of an Ambien for about two nights, and have it work great, then it stops working. Meaning that I resume the old sleep/wake cycle. I am trying to find something that will help me sleep through the night without messing with my memory or sedating too much the next day. Sometimes Valerian and Melatonin work great, but rarely allow me to sleep all night. Has anyone found something that works for them? I am looking for new ideas."
"Trouble Finding Sleep solution I'm not 100% sure about this one but I'm hoping it will be effective on you as what it done to my mom a few months ago. Have you tried the 5-HTP ? particularly a MX type? In my mother supplementation this kind of medication, it really improve her chances of enjoying a peaceful and deep night's sleep. But to make sure, kindly asked this one for a pharmacist or doctor for assessment. Hope this info helps"
"Please help with advice on sleep disorder/chronic fatigue Hi everyone, I am really hoping that someone on here has some information/advice/help for me on a long-term issue that I am suffering. It seems to be getting worse, it's driving me crazy and i want to get a life now that i am a Mum! Ever since my late teens I have always needed heaps of sleep and have always felt extremely tired. I have never had any energy or stamina and I always feel generally 'achy' and sometimes 'spaced out'. It is not unusual for me to sleep for 12+ hours and still wake-up feeling exhausted and in need of more sleep. I never, ever wake feeling refreshed and require several very loud alarms going off repeatedly to actually rouse me. I never wake, not even to use the toilet. I have visited the GP at least 4/5 times and had tests for Anaemia, thyroid disfunction, diabetes, glandular fever, White cell count, kidney/liver function and endless other things all of which have come back negative. [I almost wanted 'something to be wrong so that at least I know what it is and can be treated] Other than doing the tests, the gp's have never taken me seriously and once the results have come back negative, they have almost 'dismissed' me as being depressed or made me feel like I was making it up. I have almost felt embarrased or akward as if I had an illness to be ashamed of. I have more or less resigned myself to having to live with it and just get as much sleep as possible but I have never really had any sort of 'normal' life. I don't really achieve much, [if anything] some days and most importantly of all I now have a gorgeous, wonderful son and I can't be the mother I want to be. I want to be able to care for him properly, to play with him properly but I can't because Im always so worn out, all I want to do is sleep, or at least rest. In addition, obviously my 15 month old wears me out more because he is constantly on the go and into everything and I cant keep up with him. I get so tired I want to drop and then I get moody and irritable. In addition, I also suffer from severe back pain [and general stiffness in the joints, particularly the knees] I have been diagnosed with oesteo arthritis of the spine. I regularly take diclofenac or other strong painkillers to alleviate the pain.... Prior to having the baby, although I did not like having to live with the constant exhaustion, it was 'manageable' - I simply slept for very long periods [sometimes 18+ hours, all day and night constant sleep] I iterally had 'no life'. I merely slept and worked and that was it. Now I have the baby, its difficult to sleep for very long periods and even if I did not have my stunning little boy I don't know how much longer I could go on feeling c**p all the time. I want to have energy and I want a life. My Mum helps with the baby and has him for me [work permitting] if I am having a really bad day but I want to be there for my son and not rely on her. More inportantly, it frightens the hell out of me that I am not alert and 'on the ball' or that I wont wake up if there is something wrong with him [I am a single parent - the baby's cot is in my room] or I will 'miss something' if he is ill and will fail to spot it. I am reluctant to go back to the gp because of the way they made me feel previously. I tried to purchase modafinil/provigil online but its not available without prescription and its very expensive. I would like to ask the GP to prescribe it, but I have a feeling that they wont without a diagnosis and will be reluctant to do so anyway because it costs a lot. Please, please does anyone have any advice, tips or anything would be so useful - I am desperate. Thank you for reading, sorry the post is so long."
"Please help with advice on sleep disorder/chronic fatigu Have you had a sleep study done, checking for narcolepsy or apnea? Also I know someone with Srojrens that was not diagnosed for decades. And there can be Lyme disease. Two books I highly recommend that may help give ideas are ""Your Symptoms are Real"" by Natelson and ""It's Not Mental"" by Wolfson. Both talk about chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia and more - needing so much sleep, and the aches and pains and brain foggy and all of it it not making sense but it nevertheless is REAL. Also - as mentioned in the Not Mental book, even if you take ""enough"" B vitamins, some genetic glitches can hinder its usefulness and you might need methylated forms. That Provigil or Nuvigil really might help you get through the day while you search for the cause of your fatigue. I realize it is prescription, but the doctor can give it off-label for ""idiopathic hypersomnia"" which is what they call it when they don't know the cause. Warning - for some people a little is enough. For others, a little is like nothing. And for others, it can cause side-effects like headaches. But I would ask your doctor about trying it."
"Please help with advice on sleep disorder/chronic fatigu I'd also try with a sleep disorders clinic. I'm on a ton of meds which doesn't help but had a study done that found I stopped breathing 29 times per hour. That's the same as no sleep, you can't get into a deep sleep like that. Do you drive? have you ever fallen asleep while doing that or just at the wrong times? I just hired a sleep apnoea machine as when I was retested with one I now no longer stop breathing. Just getting use to it is a pain but I notice the first part of the day I'm already waking up much more clear headed and awake and it's only been 3 nights on limited sleep due to work too. Also the biggest bit, doctors aren't Gods and make mistakes, can you find a new doc for a second opinion?"
"Do the dreams mean anything!!!! Hi everyone, I have heard lots of stories about people and their dreams….some say it scares them….some laugh at it….some see something good coming……I have never experienced such dreams…..I would like to know that does a dream mean really anything……does it hold a special meaning…or its just that people build something up!!!!"
"Well in the early days of psychology, many psychologists followed Freud's ideas and would analyze dreams. Over time it has become much less prevalent to interpret dreams. Through the current research on dreams, scientists have not found one true answer they can all agree on if they mean anything. I think that dreams are simply random firings of neurological processes in one's brain. They probably have some correlation to what you were thinking about that day. Moreover, I don't think they have any meaning at all, regardless of how crazy they can be."
Re : Do the dreams mean anything!!!! There are two faces to it…some believe and some do not. Everyone has his own story. But I feel that the dreams are somewhat a part of our life and they do convey a message. Like I had a dream of going on jogging and I was continuously jogging ….and the dream broke. And when I had the dream analysis I found that it meant my motivation was becoming higher and when I put it in my life…its true. I am feeling motivated with the things around i.e. to be more hard-working and achieve something.
"Do the dreams mean anything!!!! As the saying goes, if a million monkeys are given typewriters, one of them will write Shakespeare. So many dreams have been had that it would be more amazing if none of them seemed profound. Billions of people have lived on this planet, multiplied by 365 nights each year of dreams, so that is a LOT of dreams. An occasional dream that is life-changing, meaningful, or prophetic may be one-in-a-million, but it has so many chances to happen. Another thing is that people tend to see patterns and make meaning out of things. Some people do it more than others. A person who is looking for meaning can find it in chicken entrails or in astrology, so it's no surprise that some people feel like they have experienced something like that in a dream."
"What is this?? Sorry, don't know where to post this. Sometimes in at night I wake up and I can't move or speak. It's so f* scary! I hate it. It happens a lot, to the point where I'm terrified to go back to sleep. And when I'm ""awake"" I still feel like I'm in my dream, even though I'm completely conscious of what's going on.

"What is this?? Hi, Cidney! Please tell a doctor about this. It sounds like something called sleep paralysis, but no one can give you a diagnosis here. So please tell your regular doctor and ask them to send you to a good specialist. forum-rules.php I am sorry I am not on the forum as much as I used to be, if I do not reply to you quickly, please contact another moderator/supermod/admin as well."
"What is this?? When people sleep, they normally become paralyzed. Usually they don't wake up so they never find out, and sleep paralysis goes unknown by most people. Then someone wakes up paralyzed and thinks it's abnormal and gets scared. If you frequently wake up paralyzed you may be unusual, but it doesn't mean anything is wrong. If this has happened to you many times before and you've still gotten out of bed safely every morning, then next time it happens you can look back on previous episodes as evidence that you'll be okay."
"fighting sleep i have a very bad habit of fighting to stay awake every night. i am not afraid of going to sleep, i do not have nightmares, or anything like that. i live alone and have obligations usually early in the morning. it is 2:15 A.M. now i need to be somewhere at 9 A.M. i know i will be tired when i get up. i deal with that almost every day. i do not normally sleep during the day. i live alone and have no reason to not sleep at night. any suggestions as to why an adult would want to fight sleep so much?"
"Sleep apnea HI I have sleep apnea so I use a machine to help stop me from not breathing in my sleep. some of you may want to make an appointment with your local sleep disorder clinic, if one is available. my psychiatrist put me on trazodone to help me sleep. Do any of you have sleep apnea too? If so, do you use your machine every night (if you have a machine)? Just wondering. ""Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it"" (Luke 18:17)"
Sleep apnea I suffer from Sleep Apnea due to a number of health related factors. I use a CPAP Machine to sleep with at night. Here's the specifics: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure It takes courage to live through suffering; and it takes honesty to observe it. C. S. Lewis To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless. G. K. Chesterton.
Sleep apnea i have sleep apnea and the doctor said i need a CPAP Machine which costs $1200 that i cant affored to get i dont get very good sleep when they did the sleep study it showed i got no REM sleep at all and stoped breathing almost every min Do Not Distorb Im Distorbed Enough Already
"Sleep apnea I took some short tests online but I feel it may be better to ask someone who actually has sleep apnea if my symptoms sound familiar. Since around high school, I have had trouble with feeling really tired during the day but I have always gotten at least 7-8 hours of sleep because I love sleeping. It seems like the only time I feel resfreshed at all is on my days off when I can get 9 or more hours of sleep. Sometimes I even operate better if I get less sleep but even though I feel more alert during the day, it begins wearing off at night and by the time it's near bedtime, I am slurring and stumbling like I'm drunk. When I was in college, I dozed off a couple times while driving and almost hit the median. Now, I have been dozing off at work. My coworker had to wake me up once everyday last week. And I can't seem to keep my eyes open while driving. Everytime I blink my eyes seem to stay closed. I have frequent drymouth when I wake up and I often get headaches after sleeping or napping. I know it is supposed to get worse with age, but can it get worse if your life gets more stressful? I have quite smoking and I have lost 18 pounds so far from walking practically everyday but it still doesn't help. I have no energy to clean or do anything productive and if I start something, I hardly ever finish it which is a constant source of disappointment in myself. I am thinking about calling my doctor and seeing if I can get a sleep test done. Are they normally covered by insurance? Are the breathing machines covered, too? Thank you so much in advance for any responses!

"Sleep apnea KEEP REGULAR HOURS. Keep your biological clock in sync by going to bed at the same time each night and waking up at the same time each morning - even on weekends. DEVELOP A SLEEP RITUAL. Doing the same things each night just before bed cues your body to settle down for the night. SLEEP ON A COMFORTABLE, SUPPORTIVE MATTRESS AND FOUNDATION. It's difficult to get deep, restful sleep on a sleep set that's too small, too soft, too hard or too old. *Edited by Chucky"
"Sleep apnea Hi, I also am always extremely tired and snore a lot. I am on quite heavy doses of psych meds but since starting work 5 weeks ago and working all hours of the day and night I have started to fall asleep while driving. My doctor has rushed my study forward to Thursday night so I'll let you know then if it's found I have sleep apnoea and to what degree. We should be coming into some tax money soon which I was hoping to put on a holiday but health is more important and in Australia the gear is like $2,000. I feel like 12hours sleep a night to feel rested and driving now even when awake is starting to trigger anxiety and thus depression which has been well controlled for the last few years so hopefully we'll find the answer shortly. Just from all the information I've read, you should use the machine every night unless you under go radical life changes and then you'd need to be re-tested to see if the sleep apnoea is still there as the most common form is an obstructive airway. -- Sat Jul 16, 2011 8:39 pm -- Finally got my results back I stop breathing on average 29 times an hour, no wonder I feel like crap. That does not allow you to get into a deep sleep which is needed to rest the brain allowing the body to be physically restored. Now I have to wait for a trial of a CPAP to see if that will help. Sleep apnoea is awful I never feel rested or have the energy to do anything, so then you feel guilty because nothing gets done and at work especially in my job mistakes can cost lives."
"fear of sleep owly wrote: is there anyone else here who is actually afraid to go to sleep? owly Hi, is there a reason for it? Are you afraid you wont wake up if you do sleep? Afraid of nightmares? I used to get anxious about it when I had symptoms of anxiety or chest pains because of it...."
"i feel incredibly vulnerable when i go to sleep... when i am really really stressed, i'll wake myself up as soon as i fall to sleep - every two minutes - i'll start hallucinating and will have terrifying nightmares (this doesn't happen often, or i just wouldn't cope). just afraid of dreams, not being able to wake up, waking up and seeing someone there, seeing shadows in the dark, sleep paralysis. right now, i'm stressed, and my sleep is really poor quality.. the nightmares are ok, i'm dealing with them, and i'm not really hallucinating which is good - means i'm getting better. owly"
"Yes I am actually afraid to go to sleep. I think it is a 'letting go' issue. I can be really tired and be ready to fall asleep but than i stop myself thinking 'WAIT, I want to know exactly what happens and what the process of how I go from being awake to asleep. I have had several nights like this and I have kept myself awake for hours until I finally fall asleep. Another question arises, how did I go to sleep? I can't remember... but i wake up the next morning and can remember my dream.. so obviously i have. but i am left with no reassurance for my next night... I have this letting go issue with a lot of other things also. but once my sleep get affected by it it is making me tired inside out all the time. I need my sleep back!! please someone help!"
"blue^girl"" -- I was just thinking about this last night before falling asleep; will I wake up the next day? I don't normally have problems falling asleep once I hit the pillow, but negative thoughts sometimes are swirling in my head; like not being around for 6-7 hours... strange I know. Don't know if it's fear or a concern. The ""letting go"" issue does exist for me too. Fortunately I have very trouble sleeping, but required to go to bed quite for some reason. I feel a lot better with the sleep I get before midnight. There's been studies/reports -- the deep sleep one gets before 12 o'clock is indeed the most beneficial."
"Insomnia due to stress is one thing, but fear of sleep it's another and I (unfortunately) know a disorder that fear of sleep is a thing that among others, characterize it. Its Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). Let me explain... A NPD person doesn't really have it's own personality. He generates a personality from the response he takes from other persons. So these people afraid to death to be alone. But there is one time a day that everyone gets alone, ant it's sleeping time. Even if we go to bed with our spouse, the time we close our eyes, we're alone and the only relationship we have is with ourselves. And that's exactly what a NPD person try to avoid all of his life. Having no other person to interact he run out of his own personality, his own ego, and this is equivalent in some way to death. So NPD's experience a fear of death when they have to go to sleep. Some of them try to work overtime, or try to sleep with the lights turned on, some experience nightmares. I don't mean that everyone that has a fear of sleep has NPD, but it's a considerable situation."
"fear of sleep For this thing, for it seems to be 100% mental, you should google on ""Lester Levinson"" or the ""letting go technique:; believe it would be helpfull. From my own experience, you shoud start by this very simple thing: whenever the fear shows up, do not try to run away from it. Imagine it as vividly as you can, let yourself feel it and say YES to that fear. Yes, yes, yes, yes, hello, fear, oh fear, hello, hi. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Admit it, let it be. Sometimes miracles happen with this one technique..."
"Apnea Sleepwalking Enuresis Tenant This is about a 30 year old who is my tenant and lives above me. I would guess he was a bed wetter sleep walker child and it was not handled well at the time. I am a former licensed psychologist with MS now, so I no longer practice, and I have no experience with sleep disorders anyway. I do have empathy for my tenant, however. I've been renting to him for 3 years. There are a number of facts and symptoms which point to trouble, which I really don’t want to be responsible for any more. I do remember seeing odd welts on his forehead when he first moved in. He asked to replace his carpets one time, as he claims they smelled (carpets were new). Later I found pet stain & smell remover spray under his sink (during repair). I had inquired as to his snoring like a freight train before his 1st renewal, and he moved his bed to another room. About at this time I became aware that noises at night were in reality his sleep walking, and they have been very loud and shocking from time to time when he falls or knocks something over (perhaps once a month). THUD WHAM BAMB at midnight! He drinks alcohol heavily when he gets home from work and until bed, (I see his trash). I would guess he believes it helps him sleep. He apparently does not realize it contributes to sleep walking plus urinating. Finally, he has a compulsive water usage problem also, sometimes flushing the toilet 6 times in a row. (I pay the water bill.) He fills 30 1/2 gal. jugs of water at a time (what for?) I have asked him if there is anything wrong with the toilet (he says no). Because he lives on the 2nd floor with a stairway leading down from the living room with no door or gate, I would have to guess this to be very dangerous in his situation. Renewal of the lease is coming in a couple months. I would like to treat him like an adult and do not want him to be vindictive. I’m sure he faced a lot of ridicule and discrimination as a child at camp and sleep-over time. He does not have a partner and spends almost all of his free time on internet games. Currently I am thinking about giving him the option to seek ongoing (provable) treatment in order to remain. Any hint of failed treatment that is not ongoing will violate terms of the new lease and he will be asked to leave. (failed treatment that is ongoing is OK) Perhaps he will leave now on his own, as I think avoidance has been his primary resolution strategy in the past. I am searching around the internet for a discussion group to get feedback, and found this one. What would you do? Thanks, Tom"
"Apnea Sleepwalking Enuresis Tenant Hi, Tom! It's kind of you to do this and not just tell him to leave. Maybe he needs someone to tell him that he has to get help.

"I need some advice please, thanks. Okay here is what has been bothering about my sleeping, recently I have been hallunicinating whilst asleep, scares the crap out of me and also I think I have what you call sleep parillysis where I am asleep, I can't move but I can hear everything and this happens quite regularly also whilst I am awake I keep getting those body jerking movements you know when you fall asleep and sometimes REM when I am awake, I think its called where my eyes move rapidly and If I sleep any more then four hours I feel even more tired what the hell. Thanks in advance."
"I need some advice please, thanks. Yeah, it is indeed a strange thing, I think it's called sleep paralysis.

"Really weird sleep problem Sorry if this is the wrong forum, I'm not sure if this is a asleep issue or an OCD issue or both...thought I'd stick it here and hope for the best. For the past two years I've had a sleep issue. I, for a most part, get to sleep fairly quickly. No real problems there. The issue is once I've been asleep an hour or two I wake up. Now let me first explain something. I sleep on my right side because I have a frozen shoulder and cracked rib pain on my left. If I try to sleep on that side within ten minutes it hurts like heck and I have to roll over. Except I share a bed with my fiancé, and I can't sleep facing people, it feels too confined and stuffy. So I have to sleep on the right side of the bed so I can face outwards. When I wake up (on the right side of the bed) I, like most people, try to go back to sleep, I'm comfortable and warm and happy to go back to sleep. That's when my brain kicks in. I need to swap to the left side of the bed, I know it will hurt and I don't want to but if I don't I won't go back to sleep because that side of the bed is way more comfy than the side I'm on. So I rouse my fiancé (who is an insomniac and gets less than 4 hours of sleep a night normally...even before he met me and I went nuts with sleep issues) and we swap sides. Give it ten minutes for the pain to start (sometimes I fall asleep so it's another hour maybe) and I have to swap sides again. Give it another hour and I'm back to the left of the bed. This can happen six or more times a night. I try to not give in, I tell myself I won't swap sides...I don't sleep. At all. And all the time my brain is telling me that the other side of the bed is more comfortable, it's honestly driving me mad, I want to sleep properly and not disturb my fiancé so he can get more than a few hours sleep, I feel terrible because I haven't had a full nights sleep in two years and I tried to tell my doctor but she didn't seem to understand and assumed I meant I tossed and turned...I do, only ten times worse because I have to physically move to the other side of the bed. I don't know what to do any more I'm afraid my fiance will get sick of this (he says he won't but it doesn't stop me worrying) and leave so he can get a better nights sleep. What can I do?"
"Really weird sleep problem Hi, Kitten! If your doctor didn't understand, then tell a psych specialist and/or go back to her and tell her you suspect it's due to OCD.

"Is a sleep disorder ruining my marriage? First off I want to start this by saying some of the thing I am going to put here is totally embarrassing, so please understand how hard this is. I am 30, I have 3 kids, and recently married their father (in Feb of this year).For as long as I can remember I have fallen asleep easily. Watching TV, movies...in class...even in the middle of band in High School I would fall asleep sitting in the chair, instrument in hand. It’s not that I *want* to I just can’t help it. In the last year or so I have been dealing with chronic feelings of being tired, no amount of sleep helps. I can go to bed as early as 8:30-9:00 sleep until 7am and still be tired. I don’t toss and turn, I don’t dream I just never feel rested. It has gotten to the point that I can be sitting at a table with friends playing a board game and drinking coffee...one moment i am awake and talking the next thing I know someone is waking me up. I fight all day to stay awake at work. I fall asleep eating..smoking...anything. While this may sound strange it has started to take a huge toll on my marriage. My husband will come to bed at night and try to wake me up (he works 2nd shift) and I wont even roll over. I may on occasion push him away but never anything more. He has even go so far as to wake me up with sex and even with that I wont wake up. So he thinks I am not turned on or please by him..and doesn’t understand I have no control over what is happening. It hurts his feelings and is to the point we fight about me falling sleep on the couch or anywhere else so much that we don’t even talk anymore. I have tried everything. If I am not standing up physically moving or working on something that requires my total attention at work 9 times out of 10 I will be asleep in less than an hour. My doctor has been no help and I don’t know what to do. I am looking at loosing my job, my husband..and if I fall asleep driving again maybe my life. Is this some type of sleep disorder?"
"Is a sleep disorder ruining my marriage? Hi pwhitley, the 2nd link is for info on narcolepsy which is a possibility. The 1st link is for the Cleveland Clinic. If you live in the states then you have probably heard of them as they are one of the premier health care systems in the country. On this site they have info on different sleep disorders, but also have a place where you can ask a doctor questions. I have used that service myself at times. It can come in handy. I would think that any info that they might give would be more helpful and accurate than anything that I may have. http://my.clevelandclinic.org/disorders/Sleep_Disorders/hic_Sleep_and_Psychiatric_Disorders.aspx http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/narcolepsy/detail_narcolepsy.htm "" Cinderella and the prince lived, they say, happily ever after, like two dolls in a museum case never bothered by diapers or dust, never arguing over the timing of an egg, never telling the same story twice ..."" Anne Sexton http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrWMBC6yoME"
"Is a sleep disorder ruining my marriage? I think you both need to calm down, arguing is helping nothing, maybe before you fall asleep try to talk to him about how this is affecting you and that it isn't something you can help. It does sound like narcolepsy (please note I am not a doctor, this is just guess work) but at the same time the constant exhaustion sounds like chronic fatigue, both of which I believe can be controlled. If your doctor won't help have you considered requesting to see a different person? Or make a note of how many times you've fallen asleep, enlist your family and friends to help, if they can say that you were awake at a table playing a board game one minute then asleep the next your doctor might take you more seriously. Try to make a note of exactly how long you were asleep for. If you can show that you've spent 16 hours asleep in one day or whatever the number is they won't just tell you to get more sleep."
"Zero internal sleep schedule Wondering if people can point me in the right direction. I've never heard of anything like this. I have had these problems probably since puberty, and I'm almost 30 now. - Once I am alseep, I sleep like the dead. However, it usually takes me hours to fall asleep. - Even after 8 hours of sleep I'm tired, but getting more sleep doesn't help. - Some days I come home and try to take a ""nap""...and sleep for the next 12-16 hours. If I give the excuse of illness, I can sleep for a few days (getting up only occasionally) before finally getting restless. - Other days I simply cannot get tired. Sometimes I'll go weeks on 4-ish hours a night. - When given no schedule, I level out to 8-10 hours of sleep, from about 4am to 2pm. But that only seems to be out of outside necessity, not internal; like, gee, I should go to bed now I guess, not gee I'm tired. - No matter what time of the day I wake up, I generally don't feel ""awake"" until around 2pm. Is this some kind of delayed sleep disorder which I am just ignoring? Or does it sound like something else? (Also, why the heck haven't any of my doctors/therapists ever done anything about it? Kind of cheeses me. Probably because I haven't raised enough of a stink about it.) Just because I'm crazy doesn't mean I'm wrong. Please feel free to request citations/sources. Here's my Dx .

"Not Sure There Is A Name For It... So i got some serious problems when it comes to sleep. Its not as simple as sleeping during the day is easy, and sleeping at night is hard. Not a problem with falling asleep fast, or taking hours to fall asleep. Not even as simple as not getting enuf hours or to many hours of sleep. The problem is i have no sleep cycle, it changes day to day. Some days ill be up for a few hours and fal back asleep, wile other times are be unable to fall asleep for days at a time. This isnt as simple as lay there and do nothing and relax till you fall asleep, i have tried that, and laid in bed for 10 strait hours thinking about nothing without falling asleep. --MONDAY-- I will give you a description of this weeks sleep cycle... wake up 6am-mon was on my computer looking for a home and a car apparently fell asleep at some point wile on the computer and woke up around 2pm-mon with my hand still on the mouse was up and out of the house till 9pm-mon got in bed and laid down at 10pm-mon --TUESDAY-- at 2am-tue i turned on the TV, cuz i hadn't slept yet fell asleep around 7am-tue woke up at noon-tue and got up and started doing stuff came home at 11pm-tue and got in bed --WEDNESDAY-- wasn't tired so i messed around on my computer till 10am-wed(gave up on getting tired at that point) cooked some breakfast, and went back to the computer, never made it past bootup(fell asleep) woke up at noon-wed went out and hung out all day got home at 10pm-wed wasn't even remotely tired, so i watched tv/computered all night --THURSDAY--- left the house at noon-thur got home 8pm-thur and got in bed --FRIDAY-- layed there not doing anything till 2am-fri(finaly fell asleep around then) woke up at 5pm-fri was up for 4 hours fell asleep at 9pm-fri --SATURDAY-- woke up at 1am-sat messed around on my computer till noon messed around outside for a few hours got back on my computer at midnight --SUNDAY-- Its now 5:30am-sun and i still haven't slept The problem is, im never tired.

If my body hasn't decided its time to sleep, i cant sleep no matter what i do."
"Not Sure There Is A Name For It... Hey dude, I held off replying in the hope that someone else might. Sleep disorders isn't really my 'area'. Having read your post, however, the first thing that comes to my mind is 'narcolepsy', but even then your symptoms don't perfectly match it. Narcolepsy - in my mind at least - is characterised by irregular sleep patterns and can include falling asleep 'anywhere', including while outside. In my viwe, there is a good reason behind sleep disorders though, and I always think of diet at first. If you take too much coffee, for example, then you'll get terrible sleep and will feel energetic, when in fact your cells are crying out for a good rest. Someone once said that drinking coffee constantly is like whipping a knackered/exhausted horsse during a horsse race. Other things that can cause problems include drugs (obviously), stress, etc. Let me know what you think.

"Not Sure There Is A Name For It... Hi F.I.T.H, I have been looking on lots of websites trying to figure why I am sleepy all day, and one that has come up a lot is Circadian Rhythm Disorder, which seems to involve difficulty maintaining a sleep routine - worth googling that and seeing if anything rings true. I also watched a tv programme about sleep - think it was one of the BBC channels - they showed Dominik Diamond, a journalist and tv presenter trying to overcome his insomnia. He ended up sleeping at erratic times and then had enough sleep that day so couldn't sleep when he wanted to and then was exhausted the next day and so on... He did a video diary of Sleep Deprivation Therapy, where he was only allowed 6 hours, and needed to get up after time was up, even if he hadn't slept the whole time. Gradually he was allowed to go to bed earlier (no daytime naps no matter how tired he was) but the getting up time stayed constant. I think it worked although I fell asleep through the programme myself so not sure how much I missed! I would guess something like that would need to be done under medical supervision as lack of sleep carries its own risks, and would not be a bad idea to see a doctor anyway. I have also seen a lot about disturbed sleep patterns and depression, or depression treatments being used to cure sleep disorders, so the GP would be the first port of call for that. Hope it helps, Mairi"

"Distributed Sleep, Graveyard Job Hi all, So I'm currently working a graveyard job in the summer, 3-4 nights/week, 11pm-7am. I'm a college student, trying to save up some money for the summer, but also doing some volunteer work related to my career pursuit. Because this graveyard job is not full-time, I am working at another job a couple afternoons during the weekday as well, which starts at 2:30pm, but I can only get around 10 hrs/week at this day job. This job isn't bad at all, other than the graveyard part. When I applied for this job, this graveyard position was the only one available, however, so it definitely made sense to take it. I've always had sleeping problems, but only to a mild extent. The biggest problem was usually waking up tired, and desiring to sleep 10-12 hours/night. The other big issue was getting to sleep early; I'd often lay in bed struggling to fall asleep. But other than that, once I'd had fallen asleep, I could sleep pretty soundly. As I said, getting up was often the difficult part. Now that I stay up until 7am most nights, my sleep cycle has been completely screwed up . Ideally, I like to sleep after my shift at 7am until 2:15pm, or later if I don't have to work at my other job. However, I simply can't sleep soundly. I tend to wake up almost every hour . On my days off, due to sleep deprivation I've been trying to catch up on sleep by sleeping at a normal time, say 11pm. I want to hang out with friends these days so I try to sleep earlier. When I slept at 11pm, I woke up an hour and a half later unable to fall asleep again. Several hours of trying to fall asleep later, I finally decided to visit my girlfriend, who lives after two hours away. Unfortunately, I was tired the entire day. I spent the night over at her place and tried to sleep at 11:30am. I instantly fell asleep, but woke up at 3am, unable to fall asleep once again. This has been terrible, obviously detrimental to my health. Is there any way to sleep more soundly? Medications? etc. Even when I don't sleep ""early,"" I still wake up every 2-5 hours, not feeling rested. Thanks in advance!"
"Distributed Sleep, Graveyard Job Dude, It makes sense that your cycle would be messed up due to the two jobs you have. The body gets used to a pattern of sleeping over time and then tries to stick to it. How many times have you managed to wake up at the right time in the morning without your alarm, and irrespective of the number of hours sleep you got? Okay, maybe you haven't done it, but I know others - including myself - who have. I acn set my alarm for 7AM, but i'll usually wake up just before it without fail, even if I go to bed at 2AM or whatever. You could go to your doctor to get sleeping tablets, but be warned that they might make your situation worse if you react adversely to them. They can be powerful drugs to take, which makes sense as a human is a 'tough' animal to take down and make drowsy.

"PERMANENT effects of chronic sleep deprivation? It is a long commute to my workplace, and we often work overtime, so 99% of the time I get less sleep that I would if I didn't use an alarm clock. I get maybe 5-7 hours per sleep on worknights, and then I sleep in on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday mornings). To make matters worse, I suspect I need more sleep than the average person since I'm an HSP (highly sensitive person) (see Elaine Aron PhDs books for more info on sensory-processing sensitivity). Anyway, if I quit this job and throw away my alarm clock, letting myself wake up whenever I want, will I still suffer any effects? I'm particularly concerned about the mental effects. According to a blog comment by someone named ""Daniel"" hour less than 8 hours a day is a loss of 1 IQ point. A human can lose up to 30 IQ points in a single week by reducing his sleep to 4 hours per night. This will recover when going to normal sleep (8 hours) however."" He never cited his sources or mentioned if he had any credentials, so I'm not sure if I should believe him. I'm on holidays now; the last day I worked was like June 5th. How many more days should I wait before my IQ has climbed back to normal? Or do I still have lost sleep to make up for? Or is it a lost cause and I should just take the IQ test as soon as possible because sleeping in on more days isn't going to change anything?"
"PERMANENT effects of chronic sleep deprivation? Heya, I don't 'buy' that notion about IQ at all. The author of the study probably only researched a small and biased sub-set of the popuulation, and therefore it would not be applicable to everyone. I also believe that there are much more productive ways through your current problems. For example, if you sleep 5-7 hours each weeknight, is that so bad? If you get sufficient rest at the weekend, then it should be okay. Long-term, however, you could look to move closer to your workplace (or apply for jobs closer to your current residence). I don't suggest leaving your current job and having nothing to do. Also, even if you did leave your job, I think that you would just wke up at the same time anyway. on the weekends, I ALWAYS weake-up at the time that I usually get-up on any weekday. The only difference is that I can just go back to sleep. The body learns what it's usual sleeping pattern is, and there are chemicals and signals that regulate it. So, when the weeekend comes along, the body just assumes that the usual pattern will continue, and you wnd-up waking up at the same time as you would get-up for work.

"Bruxism Bruxism sucks. SO MUCH. It has basically made the last 9 months for me a living hell. Severe neck pain and headaches, migraines...tiredness. Every day. Does anyone else have it? When I finally found out a name for clenching at night (or grinding, but I clench) I found out it was the third most common sleeping disorder....and many people have it, but very few actually know that they have it or have any symptoms. Anyway when it really dawned on me that my neck pain was caused from bruxism, and I basically wasted my summer going to chiropractors and all that jazz, I read about this device called the SleepGuard, which I promptly bought. I've had it for about a month and it is working, but I have still been having trouble with pain in the last few days...my neck seizes up a lot and is in so much pain...my boyfriend massages my neck so much its ridiculous. The pain bruxism creates prevents me from being productive and getting on with every day life. The SleepGuard is based on psychology, woohoo! Classic Conditioning, where, you train yourself to relax to a beep tone, so that when you wear it at night.....if you clench, it beeps, and you relax, and so you stop clenching. It records the times you clench and the total time you clench. I have gone from doing it 30-90 times a night down to 7-30 times which is great (but 30 times is still a lot and has its repercussions the next day). Anyway it works, its taking awhile.... That is the EXTRA EXTRA EXTRA short version of my painful journey with bruxism. I am just wondering if anyone else has bruxism and has any input/complaints/stories/agreements/solutions to offer."
"Bruxism Hi, I had been looking at this word 'Bruxism' here since yesterday but I've only now realised what it is that I've actually decided to read your post. I remember hearing something about it in the news recently too, and indeed about how common it actually is. The problem with posting about it here though is - firstly - that this particular part of the website isn't too active. Secondly, not many people know what the word 'bruxism' means. You'd probably get more people reading your posts if you just called it 'sleep teeth grinding' or something similar. I think you might also get more/better help on websites devoted solely to sleeping problems. You're welcome to stay here if you want to though, as we cater fora whole range of issues as you can see. My brother has bruxism too by the way, and he also shouts in his sleep and sleepwalks. Kevin psychforums.com rules: http://www.psychforums.com/forum-rules.php Please send me a private message if you need help with anything."
"Bruxism I am suffering of bruxism too !! DAY AND NIGHT !! it doesnt stop, it really doesnt! its making my life a hell !! i cant do my daily activities, i am always tired sleepy drowzy ! My neuropsychatrist said its a form of somtization, manifestation of stress. he gave SSRIs medicament (Seroxat) and clonazepam (Rivotril). I am really worried about these 2 medicaments as I read that the rivotril may cause addiction and withdrawal symptoms... Could you please give any help regarding ?? I ll be very thankful."
sleeping problems so it is 3:24 am in the morning. I woke up in the middle of the night again. It's been happening a lot lately even though im on meds. I heard sometimes that means like your super depressed. Maybe i am i just don't realize it yet. I feel sad onlly occasionally which is strange since I am diagnosed with major depression and I thought that meant every single day of your life is supposed to be miserable. Anyway I hope this doesn't keep happening or if it does it gets better with different meds
"hearing voices when trying to fall asleep I didn't know where it was best to post this. I have been hearing voices when trying to fall asleep for about a month now. They don't tell me anything meaningful, just random words, and they are stranger's voices/whispers most commonly. The fact that confuses me is that i am not half asleep or something, just trying to fall asleep. I am very afraid of schizophrenia ."
"Hey, What other symptoms have you? If you wish to look, the official symptoms for Schizophrenia are listed hehttp://counsellingresource.com/distress ... renia.html I believe that the majority of people hear voices in their head to some degree. However, some people - like you, for example - react badly to them. Other people would just dismiss them and not worry about them. Kevin."

I don't have much to contribute, but found your story rather interesting. Sorry to hear the condition is affecting your precious sleep. For some reason I've been slightly remembering my dreams lately; perhaps it's the seasonal change or something bizarre. Normally I never have dreams. Hope you get the rest eventually. And when you're better maybe you can elaborate regarding the voices out of curiosity if you want. Anyway -- be good well_lg!

"Hi well_lg, Hearing voices would rattle me. I have heard this once, I do know that if I hear the voice I am still incontrol. I would share it with my psych. If it is just random words and such, maybe it is a way for your mind to let off steam. Do you ever go thru a relaxation excerise as you are falling asleep? They work great. Guided Imagine Trips. If you want to know more ask, and I will post what I do that works for me. Chucky- Thanks for the great link! forum-rules.php"
"Hey! I don't have other symptoms or at least i don't think i do. but i am afraid of schizofrenia because i have history of this disease in my family and i've seen what it can do to you. I dunno what to tell you about the voices, they are small voices saying random things like ""no no"" or re-iteration of my thoughts.., it usually happens once a night, but not every night, but rather let's say 3-4 times a month, when i'm stressed even more often. I know some people would just dismiss this as stress/hypnagogia and stuff.."
"SmallTalkRed wrote: Chucky- Thanks for the great link! It was one of the first websites that came up when I searched from http://www.google.ie/ well_lg, in all honesty, I think that you are so worried by Schiophrenia that you are perceiving simple fleeting thoughts in your head as 'voices'. If you truly do not exhibit any other symptoms, then stop worrying about this. There chances are high that you don't have it. Take care my friend, Kevin."
"One thing that you could see is whether it is related to a parasomnia called ""Exploding Head Syndrome"" (see the Wikipedia article on it). In spite of the dramatic name, it consists of auditory hallucinations in the stage between wakefulness and sleeping. Though, from what I have read, it is more like a loud noise, rather than talking voices."
"hearing voices when trying to fall asleep I think sparky is right. I've experienced what well_lg said. I'll be trying to fall asleep, and then all of a sudden, I'll hear random whispers, things scurrying around me, and sometimes a slamming door or two that brings me out of the state. It is disturbing, but I'm pretty sure that the cause is Theta brain waves. At least that's what my research has found, though I cannot totally explain it. If your concerned about it, then talk to a qualified physician."
"hearing voices when trying to fall asleep I have some good news for you my friend. When you hear voices or whispering or random noises or anything of that nature when you're falling asleep it's because you're experiencing the transition between being awake and going into sleep paralysis. This happens every time you go to sleep. It helps to prevent you from hurting yourself in a dream by closing down all motor skills except breathing. The voices you hear are just auditory hallucinations. They're nothing to worry about. And if you can ignore them for long enough you will slip into what is known as a lucid dream where you have complete control over the dream. I just want to repeat again, the sounds you hear are harmless and most often sound very vivid. Don't freak out! Lucid dreams are an amazing experience and it sounds like you would be a natural at Wake Initiated Lucid Dreaming (WILD). You should do some reading on it and experiment. It's something that doesn't come easy to most people."
"hearing voices when trying to fall asleep Hi mate, I've recently been having almost the same thing happen to me. It's just when I try to relax my mind to go to sleep that I hear thoughts or sounds that are louder and uncontrolled than my normal thoughts. They are absolutely random and not related to anything about what I would be thinking about. This has caused me great anxiety and stress which keeps me awake and therefore I have gone countless nights without sleep. This has caused me to become depressed, as I just watched the Machinest and don't wanna turn out like that guy lol. I hope you can get through this. I've just started trying meditation, which helps you get inner peace and give you the ability to control your thoughts. Here is a free site where you can learn: http://meditation.org.au/class1.asp All the best, please let me know if you figure out any strategies to get to sleep. Because I'm sooooooooooo tired!!!!"
Narcoleptic needing a job! HELP?! Ok I may be posting this on the wrong forum... but I've been dealing with narcolepsy since 05' and no matter what I do I cannot get on a proper sleep schedule! I seem to sleep better when the sun is shining. Why in the world I'll never know! But it's frustrating because I have like 4 college degrees and unable to work because it seems every few weeks I crash and simply sleep for a week straight! I'm considering reeducating myself in medical billing and transcription so that I can work from home. Any other work from home ideas would be soooo appreciated! I'M BROKE and living with my ex...I'm at the end of a rope here and needing a solution desperately. How does someone in my position support themselves? I'm seriously at a loss. If you have and suggestions or resourses please help!?
"You seem to have made quite a few posts on this exact problem in the past on this website. Why has nothing improved for you too much? I'm sure that you have been given adequate advice already, so, have you not been trying it out? I don't mean to sound harsh to you my friend - I'm just genuinely curious and yet worried tha nothing seems to have improved for you. Kevin"
"GHB is easy to make and very effective. DO YOUR HOMEWORK FIRST. The difference between a working medicine and a death sentence is just a few milligrams. They prescribe pharma company made version of this called Xyrem which is identical to homemade GHB. Ask your doctor about it, and don't mention GHB. If you have genuine narcolepsy, your doctor should be happy to prescribe it. Remember, in doctor-talk it's Xyrem not GHB. If you call it GHB they will definitely NOT give it to you, Google Xyrem and research."
"What?! Hmm you must have me mistaken with someone else. Grant it I do do some strange things in my sleep, but I've not yet posted on any forums without my knowledge...then again how would I know? *hehe*:oops: It was only harsh because its the first time I've asked about this. Perhaps, I should have looked around a bit b-4 I posted but some days I simply don't have the time. I forgive you...I've noticed that some other friends of mine from the UK might have reacted in the same manner... Don't Worry though your an endearing lot! *chuckle*8) Now do you have any constructive advice?"
"WOOW! VOR, Thanks for the advice I emailed my doctor just now I have an appointment in a couple of weeks and I'll definitely inquire about it. I had no idea! I had heard the word xyrem but I was on provigil and it really didn't help at all Ritalin made me high as a kite...hated it. So now I'm on adderall which is wonderful I love it when it works it works all day until the evening and although I do crash I like to fall asleep on a schedule so I'm quite happy with it. But when it doesn't work...it makes no sense to me at all. No matter what I cant move or wake up. Sometimes this lasts 3 days sometimes 3 weeks I never know! AND If I try and take anymore adderall...I just get my blood pressure rising. (BTW I'm prescribed 30mg and I take 25 when I add the extra 5mm I just don't like it) I'm very careful...I hate drugs...I don't even take a Tylenol unless I'm dying... I hope this works! woot!"
"Hi again, Yeh, I might have mixed you up with someone else - Sorry about that. voice_of_reason seems to know more about this than I do, but I was going to suggest drinking some herbal tea before you go to bed. Herbal tea has the effect of making us tired (and - no - there isn't a whole lot of caffeine in them). Kevin"
"Need Interpretation, scared I keep having a reoccurring nightmare where my father shoots and kills my husband, my brother, and my sister and her family. This dream is so terrifying and real. It is extremely clear and vivid. Back story - My father is abusive and has threatened to kill me and those that I love, we are estranged and he recently has started to track me again. Any thoughts input, help? Thank you so much."
"Need Interpretation, scared Hi, I was all prepared to say that this is 'just' a dream, but I don't think that would help you out very much. Look at it this way though: A dream is just a collection of random thoughts in our heads, usually thoughts that have been on our mind recently. The mind does'nt really know what it's doing when we dream, and so thoughts can be 'grabbed' from anywhere in our brain. That's why they can seem so bizarre at times, scary at others, and funny at others. You're one is scary - no doubt about it - but it's not real. There's no way that' it is any indication of what might happen in the future. The next time that you have this dream, just forget about it and pass it off as silly. Your father might have problems with anger, but he's not a murderer, Im' sure. Kevin"
"can't sleep? may be a virus... I have already shared with you my own experience with an effective antiviral supplement that suprisingly helped my fatigue issues. it wasn't a miracle, and it took some time (3-4 weeks) but instead of waking up 3-4 times during nights, I am hardly waking up now, and if I do, I immediately fall back. Yesterday when I googled for better sleep articles, I found an article in Bio-Medicine site, about the supplement I am taking and how it helps with sleep disorders... What can I say...I was glad that there are some scientific studies and articles in this field... In a nutshell- this article brings a new approach, that demonstrates how sleep disorder can be cause by....a virus! The article discuss about the relation between chronic viruses and sleep disorder. It is based on a long research, and showing that high level of chronic viruses in the human body can cause chronic diseases and serious disorders. The article also brings some info. about sleep pills and drugs versus natural supplements, pointing about the unwanted side effects we all know for drugs.. It also describes gene-eden, the new antiviral supplement that I am taking and how it's aiming to target chronic viruses. Interesting article, I suggest you check it out on this Bio-Medicine site (search there under ""better sleep""). Sweet dreams to us all:-)"
"can't sleep? may be a virus... Hey, I went to that website and put in the search term but could not find much relevant infoi. However, I think that I might have studied this virus last year. There are other parasites too that can cause a sleeping kind of state in people. Look up African Sleeping-Sickness ( Trypanosoma gambiense is the bug that causes it)."
"Needing at least 11-12 hours? Is this normal? I've been this way for as long as I can remember, but as I also sleep funny (I go to bed at 6am instead of in the evening like regular people, have tried pretty much everything to shift this), it really interferes with day-to-day life. I would like to be more helpful round the house-hold etc., be more prepared for the college schedule but I just can't because my body clock is so off and and I need soooo much sleep. I heard that anyone who sleeps for more than 10 hours suffers from something called, ""hyposomnia"". Is this true?"
"Needing at least 11-12 hours? lumpy, nobody here can really say what is wrong with you. Sleeping for that length might not be the sign that anything is wrong though. What I think you should do is go to your GP or else just try very hard to go to bed early each night. For example, set yourself a deadline of 5AM for tomorrow night, and then gradualy bring it back to earlier times. Kevin"
"sleep paralysis Is there a known connection between sleep paralysis and cluster-B personality disorders? I have both and it seems like more than a coincidence, especially since the sleep paralysis seems to get worse when I'm having decompensation. As an aside I was having it almost every day for a while but it went away when I started taking bupropion. I've been on that medicine for several years and I haven't had a single episode since."
"sleep paralysis Hi, I noticed this thread on Monday, but since no-one has replied yet, I thought that I might. I have never heard of any connection between these two, and I cannot think of any reason why there would be a connection. The best place to find out is to search the Internet (in general) about it, but you should be aware that a person can present many psychological/behavioural problems (i.e. dual diagnoses)."
"sleep paralysis Thanks, Chucky. I have searched the internet but found nothing. I only think it's linked because the sleep paralysis got better or worse depending on the state of the disorder, and decompensation is kind of a psychotic phenomenon anyway. Otherwise I wouldn't usually think something was linked just because I had both. Maybe it's real but hasn't been studied? Maybe I can get credit for a discovery."
"sleep paralysis Chucky wrote: You think that the sleep paralysis lessened because the disorder did? Don't think you think that the medication had a bigger part to play though? What I meant was the sleep paralysis which I had occasionally my whole life, became really frequent when I decompensated and became really depressed. Decompensation does have other known psychotic sleep disturbances like extreme nightmares which I also had frequently, so why not sleep paralysis? Some weeks I felt worse and it happened more often, some I felt a little less bad and it happened less. All this was before I started on Wellbutrin which eliminated the paralsys entirely. You are of course right to be skeptical, but the medical community hasn't figured out everything yet either. I'm a scientist myself, and I'm not in the habit of chasing crackpot theories, but in this case I think I at least have enough evidence to consider it a rational possibility. It would need to be studied to be any more than that."
"sleep paralysis Hy again sfguy75x, how far are you in your career? You're certainly right in saying that we haven't figured out everything - far from it - and therefore your theory could be right. You'd have to get into the field of psychology and develop a reputation first before anyone else in the field would take you seriously though. Kevin"
"sleep paralysis I'm a Ph.D grad student but in something very different from psychology. I find psych fascinating but just as an amateur. I'll just have to live without scientific confirmation of this one. Practically speaking, the thing that matters most is that Bupropion has been a perfect cure for me. Are you a professional in the psych field? Is that why you're so active on the board?"
"sleep paralysis. HELP. i wasnt surewhich forum this went under. anyway. this is horrible. does anyone else here get it? ive heard that1/4 of people will experience it once in their lives... its been really bad this week. in the past is only happened maybe a couple of times a year, for a few years. last night, it happened repeatedly, and far worse than before. i found myself trapped as usual, paralysed, unable to move. for a short while i thought i was going to die. then i tried to move. i was aware of the difference between reality and dreaming, which is the point where you usually wake up, but i couldnt escape the dream. i managed to very slowly raise my arms above me, and i felt/saw this horrible squishy black snake-like spirit thing pass through my arm like a ghost. the weird thing is usually i wake up, am paralysed, try to thrash around a bit until im awake and have control of my limbs again. this time, i had some control, but it was extremely slow, like trying to move through thick honey. i thought i would never go back to normal. anyone had this experience?"
"I've had something like this as part of my PTSD nightmares, where I can't move for some time after I wake up. Usually it only lasts about 30 seconds and I'm ok, but the more stressed I am, the longer it can last. I don't know if it would help, but you may want to look into a mild sleep aid or some form of anti anxiety drug to see if it helps."
"i've only had it twice... the second time a figure was kneeling on my back. i read a bit on the net about lucid dreaming which kind of helped. they say, if you are on your way to sleep and you're worried, you can just wiggle your toes... that you're more likely to get it if you're lying on your back (so on your side is better), ... and that some people, when it's happening, spin themselves by mentally ""willing"" it, out of their bodies and go on amazing adventures. so, maybe look that up if it sounds interesting. i have to say it was one of the worst experiences of my life... i felt that finally all my fears had come true and that i had truly lost the plot. i can kind of feel it coming on in severe times of stress so am extra careful. hope this helps, owly"
"SAME THING! my boyfriend has experienced the same thing! about 4 times in the past 2 years. He has described it to me, and it sounds awful. What happens to him is that he will be asleep, and then his mind wakes up. when he tries to move his body, it won't move at all. You are able to raise your arm a little, but he can't move at all. This lasts literally 5 minutes. He sees a dark shadow/ghost like figure above him on the ceiling. One time, he saw hundreds of bugs crawling in just one corner of the room. He could see it, but when he tried to move, he couldn't. The ironic thing is that just last night before we went to bed, he told me he found out it was something called sleep paralysis. The next morning, I went to work, and he was asleep. He told me that the same thing happened to him again. This time, it was even more weird. He said that either he was dreaming, or actually doing it, but he supposedly walked to the front door, peeked through the hole, and went incredibly sleepy, and ran back into bed and fell asleep. On his way to the door, he saw something in front of him with a large sheet over it. It looked like a person under the sheet. He ran to it and grabbed it with his arms, but found out it was metal. This was obviously a dream because we don't have anything like that in our house, but it was just so weird. He said it felt so real. It's really scary. I think the best thing you can do is just research about it and find out as much as you can. He found out that it is not harmful at all, but I'm sure it doesn't seem like it at the time. Good luck and I hope I helped."
"I have the same type of dreams which I also associate with my PTSD. I find them more disturbing than any nightmares (or night terrors) which I suffer. I think as a victim of sexual abuse, the conscious loss of control is an overwhelming fear which these dreams represent in my mind. I don't know anyway to avoid them. I wish I had more to offer in that respect. Best, N. Things Fall Apart"
"Sleep paralysis is quite common, and even though it can be disconcerting while dreaming, it has a purpose. It is normal for a healthy person under the age of 50 to be unable to move during a dream, primarily to keep one from injury while having a disturbing or vivid dream. Once I understood the reason we are physiologically created this way, the times I experienced a dream where I was unable to move, I was comforted knowing it's completely natural. I have a LOT of vivid dreams, and the scary ones stick with me... I sympathize with how unsettling it is, but I know it's part of what keeps us safe while dreaming. nosce te ipsum P.S. I'm not a shrink."
"I had several SP episodes from the age of 13 to 20 years old. Some times it could happened 3 or 4 times a year, some times 3 or 4 times a week! At that time (now I'm 42) SP was pretty unknown to professionals. Of course it is terrifying but you can learn to recognize it. There are some tips you can follow: Try to have a strict sleep schedule every day. Try to minimize any stress during the day. Aerobic exercise will surely help. Try to avoid any sleeping pills that have any effect on REM sleep."
"Sleep paralysis is a completely natural phenomenon that everyone experiences several times every night - usually they are unconscious by then. Instead of fearing and running from this experience, why don't you embrace it? It is a powerful tool when learning to enter your dreams consciously. Once you enter sleep paralysis, just maintain consciousness and STAY CALM and before you know it, you will be in the dream world, usually through a false awakening. You'll think you're awake, but look at your alarm clock then look away and look back -- the time will be completely different! It may even display words instead! This indicates that you are asleep and dreaming, and well, now you're conscious of it all! Don't be afraid. Take time to fly around and enjoy your own fully virtual world inside your head. Good luck! Jared"
"REM while awake? If I stuck this in the wrong section, sorry... but i figured since this was kinda sleep related it should go here. Sometimes whenever I'm reading, or just looking at something, I experience rapid eye movement; my eyes shake back and forth for just a second or two and it makes my vision blurry to the point where I can't see while it happens. Afterwards, all is normal. I'm not tired or anything when this happens either, its just like my eyes go crazy for a moment. Has anyone experienced this, and if so, know whether it is a bad thing or not(and possibly what it is)?"
"REM while awake? Hi quasar, Yes, I have experienced this and it's such a strange thing to happen. It's nothing to do with REM though, and is actually something that occurs in many people. I'm fairly sure that there's a name for it, but I cannot think of it just now. It's nothing to worry about. I imagine that it's just the muscles surrounding the eye getting an extra jolt of electricity/nerve-impulse (or something like that) and then vibrating back and forth, thus vibrating the eye with it. Kevin"
"any advice? I have had problems keeping a steady sleep schedule for about three years, but recently I have had some new stuff pop up. I have a hard time explaining it to my T and nurse, because it changes often. I've had some med changes recently, quite a few of them actually, so maybe that is it? I was originally on trazodone, then it changed to ambien but insurance didn't cover it (ambien worked very well for me, it was amazing, but we couldn't afford it) and then I took temazepam but it didn't really help at all so about two weeks ago I stopped taking it and never refilled my script. Even though I wasn't taking a lot, only 12.5mg (sometiems 2 of them) of the temazepam each night, I think it might have something to do with this crap that's been happening. It has been reoccuring nightmares, usually 4-5 times each week for about the past 3 weeks, that has been driving me crazy lately, along with other things. On the nights that I don't have them, I won't have them at all, but the nights that I do, I usually wake up multiple times and fall right back into where it left off unless I get up and distract myself for a bit. Also I have been getting really itchy at night and I'll start burning up. Usually during the day I am exhausted, when I first lay down, I truely feel very tired. I'll usually lay there for about a half an hour, which is a BIG improvement compared to when it was 3-4 hours before. But now, I'll usually fall asleep fairly quickly and then after anywhere betweek ten minutes and a few hours I'll wake up suddenly, usually from what sounds like screaming in my head if it's been only a few minutes, or if it's been longer, usually a nightmare. It's not always bad dreams though, sometimes I just wake up. Immediately after I wake, I'll have, not really a burst of enerydy per se, but I usually sit up right away, and if I try to fall back asleep I can't and I usually will get up like I said earlier and find something to do. I just can't go back to sleep. Then I will do this over and over again all night. This is mixed in with me not being able to sit still. I feel like I have to move, I go from one side of the bed to the other, moving into different positions constantly. It feels like while doing this, I am half sleeping, half awake. I don't always know what is real. I hear people screaming and see patterns in the lights. I get twitches and start talking aloud to myself to try to calm myself down, I think I am going crazy. I seriously question my sanity at night. I am so afraid that I am going to fall into a bad dream and never get out. I don't know. Maybe this is just stress, my life has been kind of messed up lately. For me in the past, sleep and marijuana were the only two things that I really enjoyed, I loved both of them, it was where I could escape from the daily BS I put up with and could relax and just feel good. Just laying there. I had to stop smoking first because of the meds, and then because of a job, and I stopped for months. I had no problem doing this even after smoking on a daily basis for quite some time. So now the only good thing I had has been taken from me. So because I no longer am on any meds and won't be drug tested , I am thinking about smoking again. I think it might help. My T reccommended a sleep study, so that should happen in the next few weeks hopefully. But til then I don't know what to do. I think I might refill the temazepam and see if that might help. Anybody have any thoughts on this? Any suggestions?"
"any advice? Hi, I am not sure of the physiology of the drug that you've been taking, but I'm guessing that it directly affects the nervous system, which is why it could be causing you to wake up with 'screaming' in your head. I'm glad that you've spoken to yuor doctor about this too, because I don't want to see you continuing down this rocky road for much longer. These things should be sorted out sooner rather than later. What else has been happening in your life though? Do you eat/drink anything before bed?"
"Teeth grinding - please reply! Dunno where this fits really, but wanted to know what the hell would bring this on? Yuk yuk YUK! I can't stand the sound of ppl doing it and yet now I am doing it! What's wrong with me and what causes it????????????!!! ""Without fear there is no courage"""
"Hey sniffles, I have experienced this too. Do you have an anxiety disorder,because if so that could be causing it. Also certain meds can cause this. Such as zoloft prozac and other ssris,and some antipsychotics. Mine I think was due to the zoloft, but after my body got used to it, it stopped. either that or I just don't notice it anymore. Some illegal drugs can cause this too. Cocaine and other stimulants. Hope this helps you. take care. Amy ""An eye for an eye leaves the world blind."" -- Gandhi"
"well... i've never taken illegal drugs (sad huh?! ha ha) and in jan this year i managed to get myself off years and years of Effexor (venlafaxine) and Topiramate (topamax). i'm not allow benzo's anymore like xanax (Xanor) and Rivitrol and yet am still doing this. am always anxious and super obsessed with my weight (I'm ano) and angry at the world for hell knows what for! i don't want to grind away my teeth into stumps!!!

"i hope they aren't uncomfortable! yuk! i just don't get why i do it anyway! and i am ALWAYS so tired and lathargic! i exercise a lot and still feel like $#%^ every day! caffeine pills dont work as does none of the boosters (both over the counter or scripted) so am lost for help. ""Without fear there is no courage"""
"If i were you I would stay away from caffine. That could be your problem right there. And some people can have adverse effects with caffine. Especially those with adhd. You are probably so tired because you aren't getting enough nutrients. I know that you suffer from anorexia, but do you think you could slurp down a supplement drink, or even a slimfast, if your concerned about your weight. My friend used to drink boost because she was malnourished and it helped her alot. And they don't taste that bad either. And there is very little fat or calories in them.

Hello sniffles and aimdog, guys its a nice topic to discuess ...aim you gave a lot of usefull information about it... and i would like to share something about this teeth grinding... sniffles teeth grinding is called Bruxism... is the term that refers to an incessant grinding and clenching of the teeth. Bruxism usually occurs during sleep. Bruxers (persons with bruxism) are often unaware that they have developed this habit, and often do not know that treatment is available until damage to the mouth and teeth has been done. However, each individual may experience Bruxism symptoms differently. Bruxism is due to clenching of the teeth other than in chewing and is associated with forceful lateral or protrusive jaw movements. This results in grinding or rubbing the teeth together. Children with bruxism usually stop grinding their teeth before adulthood. However, bruxism can affect adults for an indefinite period of time. More often, psychological bruxism causes includes: Suppressed anger or frustration Aggressive, competitive or hyperactive personality type Anxiety, stress or tension Bruxism self care steps given fellow may prevent or help treat bruxism limit alcohol, tobacco and caffeine reduce stress, consult your sleep partne, have regular dental exams Some more useful resource to help you out from all kinds of sleep disorders A Guide To Brusim"
"Sleep problems Hey guys, just wondering if anyone can offer up some help. I have terrible troubles getting to sleep, and overall, I don't feel that the sleep I do get is restful, at all, considering I'm ALWAYS (well, most of the time) tired. When I go to bed, almost every night, i seem to start drifting to sleep, then, I'm not sure if i fully fall asleep, or are just half asleep, I jerk awake really quickly, more wide awake then I was before I went to bed. Also, I get really, really hot and uncomfortable. I figure this part is from a boost in metabolism in the same context as the 'fight-or-flight' reaction from the CNS. Any ideas? Thanks. All I know is no one dies I'm still confusing love with need."
"hi, i do the same thing, night terrors. But mine is from abuse. There is a medicine called Periactin. plus 20 mg of ambien. I sleep pretty solid now. I have went 2-3 weeks with no sleep. When it is that long, I have mania. Sucks big time. Is that like what you go thru? They say do some math, in your head that helps in. forum-rules.php"
"The one problem I have with sleep drugs is the potential not to reach REM sleep/the other form of restful sleep. Whats the point in sleeping if it's not a restful sleep? Do you get a restful sleep, or is it just an ok, so-so sleep? Thanks. All I know is no one dies I'm still confusing love with need."
"REM and Dream Symbols What is REM? If you said it’s a southern rock band then you are correct. But this article is about rapid eye movement, REM. Much of our memorable dreaming takes place during what is known as REM sleep. REM is a sleep stage that is marked by movements of the eye behind the closed eyelids. Accompanied by the appearance of characteristic rhythms in the brain’s electrical activity. There are 4 stages of REM sleep. The first stage takes place about 90 minutes after you fall asleep and last for approximately 5 minutes. Three of four further periods of REM sleep occur during the night at intervals of about 90 minutes, each lasting longer than the previous one. The last period of REM sleep usually occurs one hour before you awake. REM sleep is where you dream……… Do you ever wake up in the morning and say, “ I had a strange dream or a bad dream ”. Or maybe you had some prophetic dreams or a digital dream. Scientific research indicates we can remember about 80 percent of each dream episode if we are awaked immediately after its completion. But this drops to about 30 percent with in the next eight minutes or so and then rapidly declines to about five percent. Next time you have a dog dream, a hair dream, a vista dream or maybe even a green dream grab a piece of paper and pen when you wake up from the dream. Make notes of the dream and any type of dream symbols that occurred. While scientists generally agree that the process of dreaming is important, many of them believe that the content is valueless. However, the coherence of much dream material and the existence of recurring dreams, which repeat themselves over many years, would suggest otherwise. The appearance in dreams of memories from long ago and the proven therapeutic value of dream interpretation, confirm that the dreaming mind can give us valuable guidance. http://www.dream2see.com"
"My opinion is that dreams are valueless, and the more emphasis that is placed on them, the more likely the person having the dreams is likely to become worried/obsessed by them. Dreams are just a mixture of random thoughts pulled together into one - that's why they can seem so weird sometimes. They mean absolutely nothing. If anything, dreams just tell us what has been on our minds recently, nothing more. Kevin"
"Sleep Paralysis I'm narcoleptic. I get sleep paralysis. I've gotten it for years, long before I was diagnosed, since I was a child, so it's nothing really new or scary. The problem I have is that it keeps me from getting out of bed right away, and instead of coming out of the sleep paralysis, I always just fall back asleep. Even when people drag me out of bed, I usually just end up sleeping on the floor. I've missed classes, appointments, and other commitments because of this. Anyone else have this problem? If so, is there a solution?"
Nighttime Behaviors I have a problem and I don’t really know if there is a reason or even an actual name for it. I do some odd behaviors in my sleep. The first thing is hitting. For some reason while I’m sleeping I reach out and punch my wife in the back. If she isn’t there or I’m on my other side I usually hit the wall several times and very hard. Sometimes I have dreams of hitting someone but most of the time I have no memory of anything. The next thing is masturbation. My wife says that on a few occasions she has been woken up by me masturbating quite heavily and very fast. My wife said that she tied to stop me and that I got violent when she tried to hold me or move my hands. She has said that I don’t speak coherently it is really more moaning and mumbling. The other thing is talking. My wife is not the first to mention this I was told by my comrades in the army and my mother. The talking ranges from yelling and screaming to very quite mumbling and weeping. People have said sometimes it’s a word here and there other times I carry on conversations. Nothing seems to increase or decrease it. I don’t know if I have a disorder or not what do you think?
"How do I live healthy on a graveyard shift? Hey, ya'll. I'm new here. Joined mainly because of this problem, but I plan to stay around and go to all the forums here (I am majoring in psychology). Anyways, I have been working till 5 AM the past 2 weeks and have seen it taken dramatic tolls on my appearance. Increased acne and severe dark circles under my eyes. I think the problem is that I am sleeping from 5:30 to 1:30 or 2, but that's where I need all your advice. I hear that every hour before midnight of sleep is twice as rejuvenating as the hours after. Does this mean it would be healthier to do my sleeping from 2 PM to 10 PM? Thanks, Jared"
"Jared, I have never heard about the fact that each hour before midnight is twice as rejuvenating as those afterwards. I imagine that this is just a myth, and that the real reason your appearane is changing is because you aren't getting enough vitamin D (or else your diet is just poor). Vitamin D is created in the body when sunlight hits our skin. So, the less you spend in the Sun, the less Vitamin D you get. Kevin"
"Thank Kevin. I live in Idaho so the sun is HARDLY out in the winter. At least while I am awake. Usually the sun is already down or it is clowdy and rainy by the time I wake up from my mid-day sleep. Then it's time to go back to work. I have really sensitive, pale skin and acne, so I don't think tanning would be a good idea... what do you think?"
"Yes, it is very dark here now too because it's the winter-time. In fact, my eyes are getting dark circles under them too. I am also pale and have to moisturise my face each day (otherwise, I'd get acne too). I don't think that a tan would look good on people like you and I, but you can always try! The dark circles are caused by poor blood-flow in the blood vessels under the eyes. I'm not sure why not getting enough sleep causes it, but if you moisturise that area specifically, then it might be able to lessen the 'darkness' somewhat."
"i started nightshift about 6 months ago and its only preferance. would you rather be awake in the mornings or evenings? none of the people i work with look all that healthy, even the part time people that do 2 days a week so it kind of comes with the hours. i suppose the best thing to do would be to work dayshift eewol."

"i'm really fat and i'm getting fatter- need help Yeah I just keep eating constant all the time, I don't do any exercise I can't be stuffed. I eat total rubbish like I drink coke ALL DAY cause I am addicted, and like i eat like 1kg of bacon and put 7 eggs in and eat several meet pies, cheese cake etc. I can't eat healthy stuff it makes me sick I tried it I can't stand the stand it is horrid. I'm 135kg and rising. Its not due to me being weak its genetic, my mum had it so did granpa, though they weren't as fat as I am. I don't work, never go out the house, never shower (I stink bad) all i do all day is play computer and eat. mum comes over couple of times per week (1.5 hour drive for her each way) and cleans the house up and does the dishes, washes clothes etc cause I am too fat and lazy lol I got a dog and even he is mega fat. Like REALLY fat and I don't over feed him either. I don't know I think I should be able to go to hospital cause its due to mental and genetic problems, it is nothing to do with will power. Like serious I am on disability and if mum did not bring me food over I would not be able to afford to eat properly. She pays for my internet, cigarettes and everything. I am 38 BTW. I also got a cousin he is 200kg and on Disability too. His brother is also on Disability as well for social anxiety that is bad well its really bad. The girls I am living with are complaining say they hate it here, saying i stink and crap, its real rude man like I got a disability. I never had a job, I never even finish year 8 in high school. I am sick though of attitude i get , discrimination, its crap persecution, like serious, don't blame me. I am bit down though, wish I had gf so could have sex aheaps, and like serious need them to clean the place, i am never going to do it, but i HATE fat women not attractive, only like very pretty skinny girl, young like 21 would be good. I want someone that can accept my disability and would be good if they did have job though cause not enough $$. Society does nothing for me man, I don't get enough support. I can't even afford stuff like a car, have to get my mum to come all the way down in the rare even i go out, but i wont do that anymore wont go to the doctor he had the nerve to call me obese and try and lecture me saying what I gotta do, he has no idea bout my medical conditions. Even the locum made inappropriate comments and stuff when i got them out to my house. My uncle got $400,000 he was sexually harrassed, i been discriminated against due to weight, i deserve money like that so i can make my life better. disability aint enough for me."
"i'm really fat and i'm getting fatter- need help There are people with eating disorders who genuinely want help for their disorders and actively participate in treatment. For some, all they want is support. What I see in your post isn't a request for support or the willingness to change. You want money, and felt that it is owed to you. Money won't make you stop all the stuff you've listed here, and nobody can make that change in your life but you. It's nobody's job but your own to pave a way in life. There's nothing wrong with leaning on others but the things you want are totally beyond reasonable. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"i'm really fat and i'm getting fatter- need help Food addiction involves consumption of food repeatedly against the individual. The effects of food addiction lead to depression and anxiety. For reducing negative emotions you need to eat more food. If you are having these type of feelings,would suggest you to consult good health care professional specially dealing with addiction."
"i'm really fat and i'm getting fatter- need help I see what you post and it looks to me that you have lack of confidence as well as a lack of motivation. The first step in losing weight and making a change happens with you. You need to tell yourself ""do I really want to make a change?"" if you answer yes then I can sure help you. The first step is to get away from fast foods and soda. These have a lot of fat , grease , and sugar which is not good for you because it will not only make you gain weight but it can also cause early death! . Next step is going to be hard , and its to change your eating habit to a more basic healthy regiment . remember to get the body and weight you want its 70% in the kitchen and 30% working out. There are 3 basic things to know when it comes to eating healthy and its carbs , healthy fats , and protein. some good carbs to get would be oatmeal, whole grain products, corn, apples bananas, veggies, etc. carbs to avoid would be cookies, cakes, pastries, and candy. Good protein would be chicken with no skin, turkey, fish, and low fat dairy except for eggs. Finally ,good fat choices would be peanut butter, almonds, canola oil, low fat cheeses, and even sunflower seeds. Try to avoid butter, and high in fat meats and dairy. All you have to do now is look at the nutrition facts when choosing a food and see if it meets these requirements. If you want to take it a step further and workout . just work on you lower body one day (legs, calves, and hip flexors) and upper another day (chest, arms, back ) and core every other day. make sure to give at least 2-3 days a week of rest and remember to eat clean ! hope you take my advice and change your life , goodluck!"
i'm really fat and i'm getting fatter- need help For me food addiction has been with me all my life. I had a great year of being 55kg my ideal weight about 2016. It didn't last long but I did receive some really encouraging comments. When the pandemic hit I was at home. I hadn't eaten chocolate since my teens. Suddenly I was eating over 1kg per day. My food of choice evolved into chocolate covered ice-cream boxes of them per day. I am now about to eat boxes of it again. I am double my ideal weight. Please stop me?
"i'm really fat and i'm getting fatter- need help I would also like to add that I was doing aerobics at home for the pandemic years. I have even given that up this year. I have a goal with my weight but then I think oh yeah I may not get to that event I am looking forward to because of Covid then I sink back into eating. Lately, my body aches so much I have food delivered to me."
i'm really fat and i'm getting fatter- need help mgluick11 I have read your situation. God bless you. I understand. I just don't have the energy to refuse junk food. I can function on an empty stomach. Being full all the time is what it has been like for nearly 3 years.
"i'm really fat and i'm getting fatter- need help Hi and welcome to the forum ! I do want to mention that this forum has been very quiet lately so there may not be many responses to your posts . As for your last post , I think you already know all the reasons why you shouldn't eat junk food . Addiction is a disease of compulsion . I've found that distraction works for me but I need a literal list of things to do instead of giving in to my compulsion ( I'm addicted to gambling but have been in recovery for 7 years now.) I had to make a plan . Without a plan , I failed again and again . I also had to address the reasons why I gambled which for me meant facing a lot of the unhealthy ways I dealt with stress , loneliness and unhappiness . It's a long process but it's been a healing journey ."
"Food fills the emptiness inside me Hi all, I wouldn't say I'm a food addict and I'm not exceptionally overweight but I am somewhat heavy. I fear one day I may become a food addict. Eating junk food and sweets helps fill the emptiness inside me and takes away the pain I'm feeling when I'm depressed. It really does make me feel better. I try to eat healthy at times but I crave junk food. I crave sweets and desserts. A part of my hopes I get so big one day that my heart just stops because then the emptiness will finally be gone."
Food fills the emptiness inside me I love eating everything especially fried food and sweets its just so satisfying.I still stay so skinny but in the long run diabetes and heart problems might catch up to me.A young body at the moment might process it well but not so well later.

How do you manage to stay skinny? I've been gaining weight and I just don't care anymore.
Food fills the emptiness inside me I'm able to stay so skinny and also not do any exercise cause its genetics.Your body either burns it quickly for fuel or stores it inside.If you are gaining weight a much more low calorie diet will be the best solution.You can do exercise but eating something like a fast food meal would easily put back what you worked off so that would be a losing battle without a diet.
"Food fills the emptiness inside me I am similar to Castle as well... I am relatively skinny due to genetics, but when I did my last blood test, I found out that I have excessive fatty liver (can lead to diabetes) and limited function in my kidneys. I also crave junk food, but I know that if I have that one piece, im not going to stop... Its a tough mental battle, but I need to make sure my insides are healthy.."

Food fills the emptiness inside me I have some issues with food and I do not know how to cope with it. I try to fill the emptiness inside me but after that I feel guilty for that.

"Intervention or not? My Mother's Committing Suicide w/Food I desperately need advice. My mother is over age 60 and obese. Like many American women, she struggled with her weight through life, but nothing like this before. She has given up on herself, she is depressed, she can barely walk, her health is crumbling rapidly, and any attempt our family makes to ask her about it ends in her crying and acting like we're abusing her. She fully admits that she is an addict and runs to food to fill every void. But that's as far as she goes. She is unwilling to fix herself and comes up with elaborate excuses for why she can't work at losing weight. She and my father have been happily married for 40+ years, but I think he's nearly had it with her. As have the rest of us. Having to watch her fist down a dozen pastries after dinner feels like I'm watching her slowly commit suicide. I've never been ashamed of her having some extra weight on her but now I'm deeply ashamed of her obesity. I cringe when we're together in public because people actually stare at ME like, ""a good daughter would get her mother some help"". Last year I offered to bring she and my dad on a family vacation and she said no because she can't walk. I told her she had a year to lose some weight before the trip and she looked at me like I asked her to model down a catwalk. So this is my dilemma... Should I remove myself from her life? Or should I have an intervention? I've removed less toxic people from my life in the past, but this is my mother! I want to travel with her and watch her play with my children, not watch her die of an addiction. It's so bad I can't even look at her when she's in the room. Even my little kids ask ""Why is grandma so fat? Teacher says that's unhealthy."" One of the problems with intervention is that she's convinced herself I have no credibility because I've always been thin and have no addictions. Whenever it has come up before she always starts with ""You don't understand because you're skinny."" - or so strong willed, etc etc. When I try to show her obese recovery stories she always has an excuse like, ""I'm older than her"", or ""shorter than him"", or ""she has a different body type"", or ""he has a fighting personality and I don't""... Then the excuses expand - ""I can't afford to eat healthy"", or ""your father won't eat diet food"", or ""I 'd feel silly going to a therapist"", etc, etc... The thought of telling her I'm removing myself from her life makes me cry just thinking about it. But I'm spending far too much time miserable and frustrated because of her and it's starting to take its toll on *my* marriage and children now. Any advice you can give me on this would be most appreciated."
"Intervention or not? My Mother's Committing Suicide w/Food I don't think removing yourself from her life is the best idea. Who knows how long she has left to live, and when she dies you'll feel awful for not having spent more time with her. I'm not an expert, but isn't there some kind of medication that she could take? Meanwhile, you could work with her on reducing the amount of pastries. btw I know this post is old, but I thought I'd reply in case you see it or if there's anyone in a similar situation out there."
"Intervention or not? My Mother's Committing Suicide w/Food I know this post is old, but I need to speak. You could be my child When he was about 11 years old I decided to have weight loss surgery (My thought being I could die on the table or give weight loss a chance) I lost a lot of weight and went roller skating, played basketball, rode bikes and even went horseback riding with him He is 22 now and I have gained most of my weight back I realized there was a reason I had to be fat due to childhood trauma I had to be repulsive to others I am working through therapy and have started an art journal, because I fear someone would find my writing. It is the most amazing thing, no more constant cravings, the weight is coming off and my goal is to move more. I know it will take time, but I am worth it and so is my son."
"A connection? I have been mulling over whether or not there is a connection between these situations/issues. Today it finally came to me to Google the situation and see if I could find anything. So that is what has brought me here today. I struggled with whether to post this in this particular forum or one of the sexual abuse ones. As I do not feel as though I experienced abuse with my particular situation, I opted for this forum. Please, if it is improper here, let me know and I will move or remove it to the appropriate forum. I have been overweight the majority of my life. Apparently I was of a relatively normal weight until sometime in elementary school. A comment made by a family member has always left me curious (and it is someone I fully trust, so please do not read into it as more than an offhanded comment). I had asked if I was overweight as a little kid. They said no you were a normal weight when you were little, but, ""sometime in elementary school, we don't know what happened, but you just seemed to start gaining weight."" Hmmm. When I was ""young"" - I'm not sure what age, I don't recall - I in my parents' bedroom snooping in a drawer containing belongings of my older brother who was active military. Most of the contents was rather boring; however, there was a cheap looking paperback book that caught my interest. I still remember the name and what the cover looked like. Campus Pussy . As a voracious reader even then, I naturally had to check it out. I am confident that I need not expand on the subject matter and the fact that my body had natural (female) reactions. To my knowledge, no one ever knew I had found that book, despite the fact that I marked every page where an explicit encounter took place. Earlier this year, I caught a portion of an interview of none other than Kanye West wherein he spoke of being exposed to pornography as a child - that there were images and magazines around their home that he would see. He went on to talk about how that impacted him as an adult with his sex addition issues, and I would suspect, other addictive behaviors we know nothing about. Something with his interview got me thinking. COULD THERE BE a correlation or connection between my reading that very age inappropriate ""novel"" and my basically life long weight issues? I know often times sexual abuse and rape victims gain weight as a cloak to hide themselves and their bodies. Otherwise I have a very normal, productive life. Educated, professional job, various relationships, etc. Until Kanye's interview, it never crossed my mind that even reading that type of material as a child could have a negative impact. I have been on every diet and program under the sun. I have had successes. I have never been able to maintain the weight loss, but I believe some of the blame lies in the dated methods used in the 1980's-early 2000's. Additionally, my mother was an alcoholic all of my life. Thoughts? Thank you!"
"A connection? This is a perfectly reasonable place for your post. If you're not already doing so, I'd suggest seeking out a good therapist to work with you. Your post sounds very well thought out, it's clear that your weight is causing you distress, and you're looking for answers. In addition, it sounds like you know something is off -- and the family member's comments seems to support that. Do you have any recollection about when, how or why you began to gain weight in childhood? Do you remember how old you were, other people's comments at the time, how you felt? It would seem quite strange if you didn't. I was really struck by your last sentence. You added that in an offhand way and to me, your mother being an alcoholic would be incredibly unlikely not to create significant psychology issues for you, issues which should benefit from psychotherapy. Children of alcoholics have a higher number of challenges than children of non-alcoholics. I wish you the best in your quest and your healing.

"Everything in Moderation I have an addictive personality. Been addicted to cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, porn, masturbation and of course food. The food addiction for me was out of boredom. Anyway, many years ago I had a friend (heroin addict) and I'll always remember his words ""everything in moderation"". Whether he said this to justify his own addiction or whether it was genuine words of advice doesn't really matter because I listened, remembered and utilised this into my own life. I don't believe in stopping eating what I want but I believe in moderating eating what I want so that it doesn't ruin my life, health or whatever else. I also live by the rule of ""only eat when you're hungry and don't eat enough to make you full"". England's Glory"
"Addicted to Food Hello. My therapist agrees that I have a food addiction but my family does not believe me and they say that it’s just in my head and I’m making myself believe that. I binge eat junk food almost everyday and food is the only thing that makes me happy. Once I start eating I don’t stop and no matter how full I am I will continue eating. I sometimes throw up when I’m feeling full so I can continue eating. I’ve gained 30-40 lbs in the last 6 months because of my eating. I’d like to get help and get healthy. I’ve tried going on diets but I always fall back to my ways. When I eat healthy I feel sick and I feel depressed. Everyday I say starting tomorrow I will eat healthy but it never happens. Especially now it’s Christmas time it’s going to be harder for me to eat well but I’d like nothing more than to break my addiction. My therapist told me to limit my food intake and to practice portion control but that is so hard for me it feels impossible and nobody seems to understand me and my family isn’t taking this seriously but I’m so desperate for help. I’m thinking that I will try to recover from this addiction starting tomorrow, Thursday December 12 2019. I think maybe if I talk to others that understand me I can get some necessary help so I can break my addiction. I’d also like to document my journey to get healthy as I think that that’s also something that will help me. So sorry for this rant."
"Addicted to Food Hi Sunflower0629, Could your family be in denial? Is it possible that if they acknowledge your food addiction, they might have to take a closer look at some of their own dysfunctional behavior(s)? Some people are painfully slow. Could it be that they don’t believe you now, but might believe you in the future? NEDA (The National Eating Disorders Association) is a good resource: nationaleatingdisorders.org I think it’s a great idea to document your journey & this website is a good place to do it. You may not get many responses, but I’ve found it helpful as a safe place to write things out."

Maybe with support from the doctor I can address my family about this. As for now they believe that I just like to eat and not that I have a genuine issue. Thank you."
"Addicted to Food Hey Sunflower, Some families just minimize certain problems and think you ""just like to eat"". I think documenting your progress is a great idea, but also you will need a support system to help you through this journey. Are there any family members who may be more understanding of your problem and your dependency on food? The holidays can be difficult times, but I hope you stay strong and keep things in moderation."
"Anyone want to quit together? I mentioned this in a reply to another post, but I thought maybe it would be better to bring it up here... I am going to quit sugar (starting today) and I wanted to see whether any of you would like to quit sugar with me. I was thinking of using whatsapp (could be a group chat) to stay in communication and support each other through withdrawals and daily struggles. Or if you've quit before and want to be something like an AA sponsor, but for sugar addiction. I've quit before, but it's an addition that keeps coming back to haunt me. I'd like to quit permanently, but I don't have a lot of self control. It might help if there was another person to keep me on track. I want to lay this demon to rest. We can talk more about this if you're interested. I'm also accepting any suggestions on how you quit! Please post"
"Anyone want to quit together? I think about this every day. The hardest part is avoiding the cravings. I too have done this before. The first 10-15 days are the hardest, and then it's a breeze for a good 3-4 months and you lose 25-30 lbs. but then you stall out, both mentally and physically. Food really is an addiction. It's amazing what you'll eat, and how much of it you'll eat, when you have things like stress, anxiety and exhaustion factoring into your daily life. I tell myself every day that I want to quit sugar, and go carb-free and green. Then life kicks me in the face, and I'm back to binge eating protein bars and sandwiches. (my two current weaknesses). FYI: If you're looking for something to maybe help you out, I have used ""Brighter Day"" before. It's a pill you take, and it helps with cravings and your mood. It's stimulant free, so no caffeine crash or anything. Let's take it a day or two at a time, and see how things go. I'll check back in soon."
"Addicted to fast food /takeaways Hi , i am Caz , 26 from UK. I have a fastfood/takeaway addiction and it is ruining my life. Everyday i think of it , crave it , feel frustrated if i dont have it. I spent alot of money on them. I didnt used to have this problem. I dont know what started it. How do i stop? Please help. Thanks , Caz."
"Addicted to fast food /takeaways Hi Caz, It's likely that this problem has two parts to it: physical addiction to the fast food because of all the salt, sugar and fat in it, and an aspect of emotional eating that goes along with it. The first part is unpleasant to tackle because the physical cravings are hard to ignore. I found the cravings for fast food went away after about a week. Emotional eating is harder to address. Do you have rituals associated with the food? Is it a way you treat yourself? How do you feel before, during, and after eating it? If your mood state is dependent on knowing you will be getting the food at some point, you're eating emotionally. Ask yourself what you're thinking, feeling, and experiencing physically as you go through the craving. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Addicted to fast food /takeaways hi caz, i am new to this site. tonight i googled 'fast food addiction message board' in hopes of finding someone out there who suffers the same way that i do. reaching out for those who can support me, i guess you could say. & in turn, i hope to help someone else. i am severely addicted to fast food. it's absolutely horrid. i spend hundreds of dollars a month on it. i'm not sure WHY i am hooked on it. i know there is absolutely an emotional component, though i'm not sure how/when/why it developed. i've been buying fast food very frequently since i was a teenager earning money at my first job. i'm now close to 32 years old, and nothing has changed. i am married and have two children. two little girls who deserve to have money aside to give them things in life. for example, my littlest one would like to take piano lessons. also, i struggle sometimes to buy them necessities in life - snow boots, bathing suits, shoes, etc. it is not that i don't have money - my husband and i have good jobs that provide us with excellent paycheques. the problem is that i throw all the money away on food. my husband is no support. he likes fast food, though i wouldn't say he's addicted. he sees it as entertainment, social, a day out with family and friends to have dinner. he doesn't stop me when i spend incessant amounts of money on food. i think he may be afraid of the backlash that would likely ensue. the amount of money i waste is my main motivator for stopping this self destructive behavior. there are many things in life that we do without as a result of not having money. also, i become very agitated and my mood changes when i am faced with perhaps not being able to access it immediately. i'm not kidding when i say i spend hundreds of dollars. i would guess it's somewhere in the $400/month range. i'm not sure where to go with this. part of me thinks it may be due to depression - i do struggle with this, though it goes through periods of complete stability - yet my self destructive food behavior does not stop. perhaps we can figure out some ways to conquer this together. i set myself up for failure by promising myself i won't eat it for a week, two weeks, a month, whatever. i cross the days off on a calender for every day that i'm successful. eventually i miss the emotions that come with eating and i cave."
"Addicted to fast food /takeaways I have a problem with fast food / restaurants. However my problem tends to be that it's way easier to eat out then it is to cook at home. I'm a single guy living in an ""apartment"" on zoo property. I love the atmosphere and everything but I have no bathroom / running water in my apartment. I have to walk / drive to the visitors center to take a shower / use the bathroom. I have however turned one part of my apartment into a kitchen with a hot plate, microwave, toaster oven, etc.. So I do have the ability to cook, it's just a pain in the butt cleaning the dishes afterwards lol. Having to haul them with me to the visitors center. I have one of those 5 gallon water dispensers and I can refill it for $2.00 so drinking water is no problem. I would move out, but I can't justify it when I'm living rent / utility free, without having to lift a finger around the zoo unless I want to. Of course with my love for animals I help out almost every day. So eating out is a convenience for me, and of course I love it too!"
"Addicted to fast food /takeaways i know exactly how you feel! btw im am new to this site and trying to get help so there may be some ranting sorry Anyway, a few years ago i really restricted and lost about 50 lbs but then i started bingeing. ALOT. i think it may have because of something that happened to me but idk. then i couldnt really get my hands on enough food at once to binge on or (i was working at the time) if i binged i would eat so much i would be sick and could not move and so i couldnt binge because id get fired so i would still binge some just not as often so maybe just a few times a week. so then i was just eating like ""snacking all the time. and most of it was fast food and now its gotten so bad i have to have it like 2 times a day of i freak out and now its even worst because im trying to recover and thats stressing me out so i just want food greasy hot fast food. i live less then a minute away from a mcdonalds and its literally killing me. ive gained over 100lbs in less then 2 years from constant fast food consumption. i want to stop i NEED to stop or i WILL die. but i cant. i am extremely obese and lately ive been getting alot of chest pain"

"Addicted to fast food /takeaways to Caz and the others who have replied. I've only recently become convinced that the flavour enhancers that are used in our popular fast food places are addictive. I don't just mean 'tasty', as we all agree they are, but actually addictive! I've already submitted a post on that, a few days ago. I have to keep away from them, and I can actually walk past them, (thank goodness). When I'm out shopping, If I go in and have one, I'll be just like some of you and will think about the taste all day and every day, until I can't stand it anymore and go back. As has been said in other posts, it's almost as bad (if not worse) than alcoholism. The items we crave? We have to somehow not touch them. That, my friends, is the million dollar question. As someone else said, when you have a family and run a household, you cant punish everyone for your own problem, by never buying any of the items that set you off. Why cant I have a craving for something simple like lettuce? As for the cost? I'm now trying to apply the same approach that I used (with success) when I gave up smoking. I think of the health aspect and the money aspect. I wish you all well, and will try to keep the forum posted."

Thanks for the concern tho"
"Addicted to fast food /takeaways I've been addicted to/craving fast food too lately, mainly, specifically, McDonald's sausage McGriddle. Specifically because it's like pancakes and sausage and syrup. I know I could just keep these things at home and make them myself once in a while, but as a grad student all I want to do is grab and go. It's awful, really, because I hate McDonald's especially. I have a weak, undeveloped theory that I'm addicted to corn syrup, aspartame, and any other common chemical found in fast foods and diet sodas. I'm actually wondering if it's half because of when my mother carried me as a fetus, if she ate a lot of corn syrup!"
"Addicted to fast food /takeaways Hi, guys. My name is Nat, and I am fast food addict, I work 12 hours night shift, and I do bring my own food to work and planty of it. But I still drive through the fast food places in the morning for heavy breakfast, I usually order Steak egg cheese bagel meal and sausage bisquit plus sweet tea in the morning. I get big satisfaction from getting this food even it cost me almost $10 each time ( 3x week). This is happening only after my night work. My work is very stressful and it is 12 hours long. I eat my home food but still drive through and eat fast meal in the morning. I really need some help. I realize that this is psychological more than physical.. Please, help me here.. How do I start saying no to something I am addicted to???? Cry for help!!!!"
"Alone You'd never think I have a food addiction until you tell me I was supposed to have one cinnamon bun and I took three, and a bagel, and a GoGurt, and yesterday's shortcake, and the M&M's from a YoCrunch.

Alone I have run into more then one person at Weight Watchers folks who are trying to maintain their weight. They said the same thing they can eat anything and stay skinny. But their on the eating plan because they have high blood pressure high cholesterol and some go onto have diabetis.
"Alone I'm about 130 pounds and I'm 5'5"" or 5'6"". So it's a healthy weight, but I feel like I'm on my way to diabetes with my sugar addiction. My brother was diagnosed with diabetes when he was younger than I am now. I've quit sugar before--not fruits and such, but the rest. I felt fine, but eventually I thought I could have a little treat here and there and after more than a year without sugar, I caved. Now it's half of what I eat. Especially chocolate. I've quit sugar a couple of other times, but those haven't lasted. I've tried having a sugar day, where I only had sugar one day per week, but it became a day I obsessed about and I'd eat myself silly on that day so that I felt sick. I'm going to quit again now, but I don't think I have the self control to stop for good. But I have to try. What might help me was having someone do this with me. Anyone else out there who wants to quit? It would be great to have someone for support as we went through the same horror of giving up sugar."
Over eaters Annonymous and dual addictions Hi I am Elizabeth I am a recovering sex addict love addict and binge eater. I've got 1 year of sobriety in SAA. I have not started OA yet but there are issues. I use to weigh 342 pounds. I had to lose 50 to get a painful hernia surgery.Then after the surgery I got an infection plus a wound from knocking out 1 or my drains. I spent 5 and a half months in senior citizens living place and nursing facility and 6 weeks in the hospital and rehab. In that time I was on alot of antibiotics strong ones and morphine which made me sick. When they gave i to me in my veins Id instantly barf. I was so sick I lost all the way down to 252 now. I have been out of the hospital old folks home 3 months I was down to 240 in the old folks home gained up to 260 now down to 252. Im maintaining my weight loss.tobecontinued
"Over eaters Annonymous and dual addictions The problem is that awhile back I attended SLAA Sex and Love Addicts annonymous had a woman tell me she was obese went to OA lost her weight and then became a sex addict then went to SAA. She said she had to go to OA first that's what I should do my thinking is she was insinuating I should stop SAA. I brought it up to another SAA person who was also in OA and he said he agree with her. A couple of others said the same thing to me Im not taking of their advice you want to know why? I have not actually figured what they are actually talking about or saying to me,I have absolutely no idea. Are they saying go to both SAA and OA are they saying stop going to SAA go back out and sexually act out while I am in OA? Are they telling me to put my weight back on so I can go to OA? Maybe they think my sex addiction is in my head,some folks do not believe women can become sex addicts? I have organizational dislexia. I can read and write fine.But if I'm driving a car on a freeway I turn my signs around backwards which is why I don't drive much anymore. If I go into a big building I have never been into I have to get my sisters to take me so they can tell me on my cell phone how to get in and out. I will walk into the wrong office, not be able to find my way out turn the entrance exit around in my head. The point is trying to work 2 programs is not making sense and peoples words aren't making sense to me at all. But I have a lot of weight loss 90 pounds so I don't see a need for OA so I'm sticking to my program for now."
"Over eaters Annonymous and dual addictions Welcome LizinTx , Congratulations on your weight loss ! That's an awesome achievement and I hope you're seeing the positive effects from it . People are always going to have opinions and they're usually based on their experience . It's good to have an open mind about them but your choices are your choices . I think their reasoning is this : Trying to manage 2 very different and difficult behaviors at the same time can become overwhelming to the point where some people just give up trying . They feel like "" If I can't fix everything , then I can't fix anything ."" It sounds like you have a good plan that's working for you . What's important is that you're honest with yourself if you find that it's not working . Recovery is about trying everything and keeping what works ."
"Help me My name is Kamryn, I'm 16, and I have a crippling addiction to food. It started when I was probably about 8 years old, when I would sneak into my family's kitchen, early in the morning every day, and steal Hershey kisses from a giant jar my parents had. From there, my food addiction arose. I suspect it's because I've not lived in the best conditions in my life and my family has been torn apart in the past year and a half that it has escalated. My parents started realizing it was a problem when, on several occasions,, they had discovered I had eaten food that was intended to be used for dinners (tortillas, cheese, chips, etc.). I started getting in trouble over it shortly afterwards and since then the intensity of my binging as well as my punishments that come as consequences have incteased radically. I write this now after being caught at 10:30 at night trying to sneak into the freezer and get an ice cream sandwich, my second one of the night. This is worse than usual, as it followed the discovery of the extent of my bringing from my dad, resulting in my grounding, as well as a disappointed talking to from my mother. I do not predict this will end well for me but I realize that it is my fault for trying to sneak food. I don't necessarily blame my parents either for over punishment for me, as it isn't just a health issue, but also a financial issue, as we don't have the money to be buying tons of food. I'm hoping that the people of this forum can help provide some support as well as advice for breaking my addiction. I don't know what to do. Help me."
"Help me Hi Kamryn! It's nice to 'meet' you! I'm Victoria, and I'm 18. I've read your post, and I'm really glad you've reached out for help! I'm by no means a mental health professional, but *mod edit* I myself have (very recently) struggled with my very own food addiction. I think you have a very positive outlook on your situation; as you've said your parents will have a very difficult time understanding your actions and how to deal with them appropriately, and, while it's not your fault that you have certain impulses (a lot of this do have to do with your environment and body), you haven't victimised yourself. The most important first step is realising that it is, indeed, your responsibility now to take action and change your life for the better, and that that's very much possible. While I never had what would be classified as an eating disorder, I have faced a lot of the same emotions and problems, such as binge eating, wanting to eat in secret, excessive guilt, and etc. etc. However, I am also a certified personal trainer and fitness enthusiast, thus I've since turned my psychological reactions (in terms of food addiction and a prior panic 'disorder') into curiosity and learning opportunities. I've talked to people, done some research, and seen some first hand accounts, and it's helped me see the bigger picture. Sorry if I'm rambling a bit, it's just that I'd really like to help you get to a better place, and it would be a pleasure if you would accept what help I can offer you on a level of peer support I'm not sure what other information you might be looking for right now, but please do respond (I'll try to check back often) *mod edit* Look forward to hearing back from you, Victoria Last edited by Snaga on Mon Jul 17, 2017 7:44 pm, edited 1 time in total.

"My Binge Eating Recovery Journal Hi guys, I am new to this site, but I have decided to keep a binge eating recovery journal. Here are a few facts about myself: 1. I am 21 years old 2. I am a third year at an Ivy league college 3. I used to swim (not on a team though haha) 4. I am currently about 135 pounds (and 5'1) but I eat. A. Lot. (I am naturally about 107 pounds if I eat like a normal person 5. I am excited to recover Let me know if you have any questions you want me to answer, and don't forget to follow my blog! Warmly, -Lianna"
"Realization about my binge issue. Granted my parents were those that told me to clean my plate and tempted me to finish things by giving food as a reward, but today I dawned on something I hadn't fully realized before. Long story short, I had to change my diet because of an intestinal issue that would lead to me being hooked up to medical equipment for the rest of my life if I didn't take a step back now. I'm not overweight or in bad (looking) shape, but my digestive system seems to be held together by duct tape. Over the course of a little over a week, I've noticed I haven't missed the food or caffeine which I also can't have at all. Thing is I'm still binge eating from time to time, but only with healthy foods (I'm not allowed red meat, bread, pasta, artificial sugar, fried foods etc). The thing I DO miss is the random energy spikes I would get. Now granted I'm sure this also has to do with me being bipolar, but it seems I'm not so much a food junkie as much as an adrenaline junkie. One thing I've found is eating certain foods increase manic episodes with bipolar giving me a manic high with energy spikes. Not sure where I'm going with this. I suppose I'll have to find a balance with foods that give me energy without going too over the top with it. I guess I'm also curious if anyone else had gone through withdrawals like that and how they handled the energy levels."
"Can you be addicted to soft drinks? I drink a lot of soda. About 6-8 12oz cans of it a day. My preferred brands are diet Mountain Dew and diet Coke. I am getting worried that I drink too much, but can't seem to, or want to, stop. I am also afraid that my teeth are starting to show signs of my constant soda drinking. They are yellower than they used to be. I had an uncle once ( he's since been divorced from my dad's sister ) who had rotted all his teeth out on drinking soda all the time and now wears full dentures. I don't want my teeth to go the same route. Its bad enough that I grind them at night and often forget to wear my night guard. Can I be addicted? If so, what can I do?"
"Can you be addicted to soft drinks? I think you can be addicted to soft drink, and its really not good for you. Coke and similar drinks often contain caffeine, which can be addictive. Most contain lots of sugar which can give a sugar high a buzz. Even diet coke is not good. Try to wean yourself off these drinks cutting down a little every day. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Lao Tzu"
"Can you be addicted to soft drinks? Yes, in a sense. The caffeine in it is known to be addictive, but so is aspartame. If you try to quit drinking the diet soda cold-turkey, you'll get withdrawal symptoms from both the caffeine and aspartame. You'll have to wean yourself off them slowly and start to replace each soda with something like a cup of tea, and then switch to herbal tea or water once the aspartame withdrawals are over with. Even though there's no sugar in diet drinks, the phosphorous in the drink will erode your teeth. If you haven't done so lately, arrange an appointment with a dental hygienist to make sure your teeth don't have any immediate needs. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Can you be addicted to soft drinks? A person can become addicted to anything. It is not so much what your addicted too, but what it symbolizes. Even smoking for example is often about giving oneself permission to take a break, remove themselves from an area and indulge in self comfort. Once a person can find something more healthy to replace that addiction, it is a success. So maybe ask yourself what Soda does for you. Do you have a routine that goes with drinking it? Explore the feelings and thoughts that you have before, during and after you have a soda. A journal can help with this. See if you can pick out any patterns. Let us know how you are doing ok? Take care One Two men looked through bars. One saw Mud, the other saw Stars."
"Can you be addicted to soft drinks? Yes Soda is an addiction . I have this same issues . I been in recovery for almst a year .

I wanted to do something about it . I hope to one day wheh Im strong enough to be able to help others with this also . Thanks for letting me share Deb"
"Can you be addicted to soft drinks? Many soda drinks have caffeine in them, which is addictive. If you're drinking soda with caffeine, then the answer to your question is yes! If you are worried about this, check the ingredients on the bottle / can. If caffeine is in the drink, the company must list it as an ingredient."
"Any Luck just Cutting out Sugar I have a problem with sugar and with flour or any kind of grain really. I'll eat myself sick every time. I couple years ago I decided to just cut out all refined sugars and all grains from my diet. Over a few months I went down to a healthy weight with no added exercise at all. Unfortunately over the next couple years I went off the diet and gained it back. I just ended my first week back on the only diet I've ever gotten to work. My sugar withdrawal is over (I was dreaming about snickers and candy early in the week!) and I feel much better... but I wanted to know if other people have done this and how it is has gone. Have you ever tried to cut out sugar and/or grains? What has been your experience? I'd like to mention this is not Atkins, I let myself eat as much as I want including whole fruit and vegetables. I just believe now that I cannot control myself to have candy or sweets, I just can't stop and I eat more and more!"
"Any Luck just Cutting out Sugar HI - I have had to cut sugar and grain out of my life because I am diabetic. I assume you are not. What I found very helpful was getting a FitBit (activity tracker) and using their website to log all my daily food. I customize the setting to what is healthy for me. The interface is very intuitive and once set up there isn't much time wasted each day plugging in my numbers. Charting somehow helps me keep things in check. I hate the idea of having to ""go over"" limits and see RED warning signs appear on chart. I know that seems silly (its seems silly to me!) but it works. Of course, all the other standards apply too. - don't buy sweets in bulk, so they are easily accessible at home. - start by cutting down to 1/3 you normally eat - eat it slow - choose a shop farther from home and designate as a place you buy sweet (if you must!), so you may be inclined to ""skip it"" if you don't have the time to travel - look into desserts and treats that are sugarless. it may taste like crap at first but eventually you will get used to it...etc hope this helps - otter.

Of course, all the other standards apply too. - don't buy sweets in bulk, so they are easily accessible at home. - start by cutting down to 1/3 you normally eat - eat it slow - choose a shop farther from home and designate as a place you buy sweet (if you must!), so you may be inclined to ""skip it"" if you don't have the time to travel - look into desserts and treats that are sugarless. it may taste like crap at first but eventually you will get used to it...etc hope this helps - otter. Without any doubt, I agree with you, Your openions are 100% true."
"New in the forum - can't stop eating Hello! I need help. I don't know what this is. Today I ate over 3300kcal. I did not exercise, heck I didn't even leave the house. I'm 5'7 (170cm) and roughly 132lbs (60kg). I go for daily walks, weight lifting four times a week and dance twice a week. In general I follow a high carb, low fat plant based style of eating with occasional high fat foods. Medium amount of sodium, almost no added sugar and no added oil, but I still eat natural sugars in fruits and veggies and fat from nuts and seeds. Usually I eat at least three portions of vegetables and five portions of fruit a day, most of the time it's more. I do not blend my food (no smoothies and juices) and eat a lot of starchy vegetables and beans as well. Whole grain flour products sometimes. I have absolutely no idea why I can't stop eating and eating and eating. The foods I binge on are usually whole grain products (today it was homemade pretzels), often without any salt or sugar, sometimes it's dried fruit - any source of concentrated, but still relatively unprocessed carbohydrates. I have a huge stomach volume, my diet contains 80-120g of fiber daily, I drink at least three liters of water, sometimes over four. I get adequate sleep (around eight hours per night). I usually do not count calories or weigh my food, but when I do I'm always shocked. My belly started growing from this kind of eating. I'm also growing muscle, but I know there's fat gain going on as well. I'm bloated a lot of the time and my stomach hurts so bad after binging. I just want to eat normal portions. Everyone who sees me eating comments on how much I eat because my portions are enormous. Other people eat less in an entire day than what I have for breakfast. I can easily eat two cups of dry oatmeal cooked with water plus mango, blueberries, flax seeds and cinnamon after I ate half a honeydew melon as an appetizer. It's gotten really bad when I started to lift intensively, on the one hand I'm weirdly proud that I can eat so much, but on the other hand I just want to be a normal person eating normal amounts of healthy food. Nutrient wise I don't have any problems, my blood tests are flawless, I've never been anemic or had any other nutrient deficiency (that's basically impossible with the amount of nutrient dense foods I'm eating). I need help. I've been in therapy for depression for around six months now and a year ago or so I developed restrictive eating patterns (eating 1400-1600kcal a day), but that's long gone. It's gotten better, but now it's getting worse. Anyone know any advice?"
"Hi all. New to the forum. I'm so ready to make a change in my life and my mind. I am with no doubts in my mind a food addict. I remember being 8 or 9 and asking my mom for a chicken sandwich at McDonalds after I finished my entire happy meal. I've dreamed of that moment. I've thought about it over and over. It's the moment I believe, started a downward spiral. I remember being 16 and walking to the deli and getting a giant meL of 5 pieces of fried chicken and 10 potato wedges, a jar of pickles And a half gallon of chocolate milk.i grew to love that feeling of fullness. I could t stop once I started. To this day I still tell myself all day that I'm going to do good and eat well. Some meals I do. Today for instance I woke up early and made oatmeal and put fresh Blueberries in it. All day I told myself how good I was going to do, but at lunch I sorta left my body and drove to mcdonalds and ate a whole value meal and two McDoubles. This scene has played out a million times in the last 20 years. I hate it. I tell myself I don't want it and I honestly don't! I'm talking myself out of it, even while I'm eating. I realized a year or two ago that I lied to myself everyday. I've been so full before that I've had to call out of work. I'm a glutton. I eat like a demon. I never have leftovers. I have eaten whole boxes of hamburger helper and still ate more. It feels like a curse. I'm 32 and if I wasn't naturally hardy and a little athletic and still young, I would be crippled. My weight won't come down no matter how much I work out because I eat and eat and eat. I am reAdy to change. I'm ready to be healthy. I'm ready to live for the first time in my adult life. I want confidence, I want normal, I need to be better or I'll die and I'm not sure why that isn't enough motivation!"
"Hi all. New to the forum. Welcome Steven52 , I am sorry that you are struggling with this . Do you have support in your life ? The constant urge to do something that we know is harming us is a difficult thing to battle . I found that making a plan of alternative things to do when the compulsion struck helped me greatly . Getting compulsive behavior under control is a process . Be patient with yourself and acknowledge your successes . I found that asking myself why I was experiencing the urges helped to identify the situations where the craving for the addictive substance ( gambling , in my case ) was triggered . In my case , stress and boredom were my two biggest triggers . I started to make lists of things I could do to distract myself when the urges hit , and put those distractions into action . In the beginning , it worked one out of five times . I made myself celebrate that one success instead of focusing on my four failures . Within a month , the ratio began to change . It was the start of regaining control . I wish you well - you can do this !"
"Chocolate and cheese addiction... I know I'm wrong, dead wrong! But I feel I can't get enough. For instance, I'll buy a whole pack of cheese, say to myself I'll eat just a little and most times it's gone before or by the next day. Same with the chocolate. Of course I know it's not good for you, especially your heart (I have diastolic congestive heart failure), but I feel I don't care. I mean, maybe I do care but I feel I MUST have it! My therapist calls it binges. I keep telling myself that I'm going to stop, but I can't."

"I'm a food addict ugh and I hate it! Hey Guys, Long story short I'm a food addict! It is so annoying! The thing that sucks is I know how to beat addiction! Well not all addictiions are the same I guess. I hate eating sometimes! Hell I'm not even hungry and I don't even want anything to eat and its like my brain wills my car steering wheel into the store and I just find myself buying crap I don't even want! Like today I didn't even want subway I even told a friend I'm not going their and 10 minutes later I was their! I know my triggers! I just cant stop. I don't binge eat either I just eat when I don't really want to, but never binge eat I just eat a meal and move on! The thing that sucks is I was a dipper for years and one day I woke up and said no more and well with some help I have been tobacco free for 18 months, but man this food addiction is tough all I can think about it subway, and doritos, and mountain dew, and Oreos and anything else that I can eat to get My mind if eating. I feel like if I quit dipping I should be able to quit eating, but I know that being successful by yourself is usually a no go. I am the type of person that needs accountability other then myself! I'm not concerned much about weight or scales I just want to kick this food addiction. Any one got any tips other then identifying the triggers, and the emotional attachment. I think that I need to treat this like tobacco and just meet it head on, and suffer through the crap of quitting! Any other ideas would be helpful!"

"I think I have a food addiction... Ever since I was a young girl I have been struggling to lose weight. My mom always felt I was overweight and so did my doctors. I am now 24 and 270 ibs and going up. I've always had disordered eating. I would lie about my food habits and hide food in my room to snack on. I have always prided myself on being someone who never did drugs or got into alcohol. I still don't drink and have only ever done drugs (weed) a few times. I always thought I was fairly strong to never get into these habits, because with my depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, I always really felt like I was exactly the type of person who might end up like that. The only problem I realize is now, is that I actually do have an addiction, only to food. I wish I had a clue where to start, but nobody really talks about food addiction and nobody can tell because I hide it, and eating is a normal activity. I know I am unhealthy and this is only making me feel worse. I recently went almost 3 weeks without eating any sweets (which are my main comfort food), and I fell right off the wagon during thanksgiving. I hate myself for this. I want help. Eventually I would be willing to go to real life meetings or something to get help, and I already signed up for therapy, but this is all really scary and I would like to start here. Hopefully I can find some helpful support from people who understand what I am going through."
"I think I have a food addiction... Welcome to the forum Briiiana , I think addiction to anything is hard to talk about at first . It takes courage to admit to ourselves that we don't have control over some aspect of our lives . I am a gambling addict and also a woman - I viewed my addiction as ""weakness"" , which just depressed me more and I beat myself up a lot because I couldn't ""just stop"" . Seeking outside help was the best thing I ever did . You are not alone and you don't have to deal with thing alone . I agree - opening up about an addiction in front of others is really scary , until you hear them opening up about theirs and you realize that these people aren't judges , they are allies . Post here any time ! This isn't a super-active forum , but I'm here if you want to talk , or you can just write things out . I found writing to be very healing for me . All the best , NSR"
"I think I have a food addiction... I understand your feelings to some extent..You used food as a drug, when you're anxious, you want eating food, when you're stressful, you want to eat more...maybe thing work like that.I suggest that you can listen to Tony Robbins program ""the body you deserve""(there's a free version online), it works on me and I think it will help you,good luck"
Weight loss and food addiction My friend is addicted to food and he is fat. He want to cure his addiction of food and at the same time he also want to lose his weight. How is it possible to do two thinks together. Help him to make it possible.
"Weight loss and food addiction That's something he'll need to discuss with his doctor. If there's an element of emotional eating he'll need some psychological help to go along with whatever diet & exercise regimen his doctor recommends. He'll probably need emotional support while making the changes and that's where you come in Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Weight loss and food addiction Hi ladyswan, I think you are right. he'll need to discuss with his doctor about his problem because doctors are always a best adviser and should take some psychological help to go along with whatever diet & exercise regimen his doctor recommends. Hope, your advice is worth for him, Thanks for suggestions."
"Weight loss and food addiction Going to a doctor is ideal, but myself, personally, I don't have alot of time for that sometimes. My addiction wasn't food, but I found that when I do seem to get past one addiction - I have only addicted myself to something else. Which is one thing your friend will need to be careful with. What helped for me, when I choose to take the time to work on it, was the 12 steps of NA or AA. Mainly the first few steps - turning it over to your higher power of choice. Just substitute the drug or alcohol aspect for food. It is more of a self realization - helping you to find what makes your addiction take over and work on that area. ""It works if you work it,"" and if this person is at their wits end, I believe it will help. If not, at least it didn't damage anything, or cause worse health problems. Good Luck"
"Weight loss and food addiction That's a very valid point, seven. An addictive personality will seek something else. ABA helped me to realize that as well and there were people there who had histories of various other addictions too. It's quite common. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Weight loss and food addiction Hi seven124, I think concerning doctor will make the things easy to understand about food addiction. After that we can get the better solution to cure this addiction. Instead of doing anything wrong it is better to take an advice of doctor in this case. It will make easy to cure the food addiction"

"Addicted to Food Long story short, growing up as a figure skater, never overweight, but had terrible self image, always shopping for clothes thinking ""that won't look good"" or ""if I could lose 10 lbs that would look great"" etc. On I go into adulthood, still look great - realize that now at 45, still having thoughts that nothing looks good. About 10-12 years ago I met some friends that were all quite overweight and after a while thought to myself ""I have always thought I was fat so maybe I should try it"" -these girls seemed relatively happy. So on a bender I went and gained about 50 lbs. OK so now I AM fat!! I have 2 girls 13 and 15, I would like to be a better role model for them. Lately I have been starting weight watchers again and again and after a few days I get to thinking ""Oh what's the use"" and start eating way too much. I can't seem to kick the old thoughts out. Does anyone have any suggestions???"
"Addicted to Food Hi Shaz, How do you feel when you eat food? (Particularly foods that are not so healthy, or when you eat when you are already full?) Maybe it gives you a particular feeling that you crave? If so, could you find a substitute? Is there something other than food that could you make you feel the same way? I eat too much chocolate when I am sad or stressed. I have heard that feeding ourselves can be a way of giving ourselves love. I try to beat the craving, and do something healthier than stuff my face. But I don't always succeed. If I were you, I wouldn't focus on my size or weight. Don't think of yourself as fat - it is not important. Concentrate on your health (physical and emotional). Work on getting healthier. When you are living a healthy lifestyle, you will probably lose weight with much less effort than it would otherwise take. Then you will have to change your user name. No diagnosis, lots of opinions, and a bunch of issues that I haven't quite figured out."
"Addicted to Food So Platypus thanks for answering me. My brother has been addicted to drugs for a long time, so I think we are in the same boat. I have tried the eating healthy and not worrying about the weight, but it only takes one trip clothes shopping to bring me down. I would like to know why. My father was verbally and physically abusive to my brother, so I get his deal. My mother is a very interesting person - don't quite know how to explain her. She is a good person, but did not have very good parenting skills - not her fault. She will make things happen if you give her enough rope. She's been my biggest supporter when I am thin, but there is always the ""I just found this new diet, you should try it attitude"". I have no relationship with dear old Dad. Anyway I love chocolate and chocolate ice cream - always have. I haven't found anything that's a substitute, and we're not going down the yogurt path!! Anyway, thanks for listening. Appreciate it."
"Addicted to Food Ugh, I hate clothes shopping too. And it's not that I hate my body or think I look ugly, I just find shopping to be a dehumanising experience. The exorbitant prices for goods that are assembled in factories in China probably make me dislike it even more. I buy my clothes online now. Yeah, my parents were obsessed with my sister's and my weight when we were kids. Whenever I see them, normally the first thing that comes out of their mouth is a comment about my figure (for good or for bad). I think they just can't comprehend that weight and body shape is not the most important thing to most people. My father boasts that he weighs himself everyday to ensure he never gains weight. Wow Dad, that's awesome, you're some kind of superhero - not. He makes horrible audible remarks about fat people that he sees in public. I don't like to go anywhere with him because he is so rude and intolerant, and I am ashamed that he is so inconsiderate of obese people’s feelings. You don't need to keep your mum's attitude to dieting and weight loss. Next time she says something like that, listen carefully, and ask if her attitude sounds healthy. Ask yourself if it makes her happy. You can reject her views on dieting without rejecting her. Learn from her mistakes; be smarter. Treat yourself better. You may like to read about Obsessive-Compulsive behaviour to see if a type of compulsion is driving your behaviour. There is an OCD forum here. I imagine people there would have good tips on how to deal with Compulsive behaviour if you think it could be relevant. No diagnosis, lots of opinions, and a bunch of issues that I haven't quite figured out."
"Addicted to Food Shaz, I too was a young athlete and of course having a good body image was always something I strived for but the constant issues with my parents especially the too and fro because my father would be all about maintaining peak physical fitness and ensuring I could do the training - he also was a very good young athlete and his drive to succeed was past onto myself in particular which is unfortunately the cause of many of my issues. My mother on the other hand was totally opposite, she would pile my plate with food and would always make sure I ate every bit - A growing boy needs his energy and with my father training me all the time she just kept piling the food in. Eventually of course the young athlete grew older and had much less time for training and was more often working than not but he still had time to eat. I know that clothes shopping for a guy isn't as demeaning as that for the ladies because wafer thin super models have caused a massive shift in dress sizes and of course the worlds women are not all that thin and to be honest I prefer mine with some meat on their bones. Of course a lot of those body image issues are societies fault because they put too much emphasis on how things look. I know that what is important really is what is inside a person not what the outside is like. The thing I find is a look can be so very easily faked and altered but what a person is on the inside is much harder to fake. The bright light at the end of a dark tunnel could be an oncoming train, but it could also be the way out of the darkness..."
"Addicted to Food Hey,I think every one has the central decision from brain , you get full and eat more it is not the demand from your stomach but the brain.Habits come from brain and I do comment to get some healthy exercise,activity to make you busy and change the mind inclination towards your habit.Pass some time with your friends and join some gym ect."
"Addicted to Food Hussey, I would eat and eat and eat... my body fat content was the same as a marathon runner and I was an athlete, so I was always training, running and using weights at the gym but it didn't change why I ate. For me the eating wasn't because I needed fuel for my body heck I already had my diet working nicely, I was eating because it made me feel good and that is reason why I ate to excess. Naturally sometimes we over do things when eating and we can end up unwell. I have been unwell before and I found that I couldn't stop eating, not until I wanted to stop. I have been physically ill from eating and then eaten more because I wanted to eat and it just made me sick again. The bright light at the end of a dark tunnel could be an oncoming train, but it could also be the way out of the darkness..."
"Addicted to Food Hi, There is the influence of illegal drugs, legal drugs like prescription drugs and alcohol. These influence some, not all, of the addicts in our midst at work, at home and at play. Most often, these are ""functioning"" addicts those who manage to pursue a career, get to work on time every day, pay their bills, be married and raise and care for their children, and do everything that society deems as moral. Thanks"
"Chocolate Additction Hi everyone, I am addicted to chocolate. I just love it. I eat more than one bar (Milka) of chocolate every day. One bar by the way takes less than 5 minutes to be eaten. I just dont take one piece - I take the whole thing at once. I am not ""big"" by the way - don't know why. I generally eat a lot more than other people do (2 plates when other people woulnd't even finish one). I have an average weight. I work out a lot, too. But I am truly addicted to chocolate. If I don't have it - I need it. I feel uncomfortable when there is no chocolate available. WHAT could be the CAUSE for that? There is nothing more humane than the will to survive."
"Chocolate Additction Comfort eating, perhaps? I do the same thing, but like you, I'm not sure why. I'm just 5'3 and in general a very petite person, healthy weight and all, so you wouldn't guess that I constantly binge on junk food. chocolate is definitely my weakness too. *Won't be very active over the next 3 weeks* There's no such thing as true good or true evil, its all relative to the observer. My previous username is Corgis."
"Chocolate Additction Chocolate actually has some addictive qualities. Look up ""chocolate hormone release"" in a search engine and read some bits. I am just copying this short tidbit: Chocolate releases serotonin and another feel-good hormone called dopamine. Because of that release, people crave the feel-good and can become addicted, much in the same way people can get addicted to caffeine or nicotine. So yeah, people joke about chocolate being addictive... it is! And sugar by itself is terribly addictive. Currently working on my upcoming signature."
Chocolate Additction One of my friends is also having the same addiction for chocolates. He just can't live without chocolates and all the things made from chocolates. He makes different items at home as well as sometimes order from wholesale restaurant desserts at wholesale prices. I will definitely tell him this reason for a chocolate craving. Thanks for sharing your views here.
"Chocolate Additction You asked what could be wrong, since you know what's exactly wrong with you. You've chocolate addiction problem, because of that you'll gain heavy weight in no time. I think you should personally consult with a doctor before this addiction turns into a heavy burden to overcome."
"I'm a sweet food addict and can't stop it I'm 25 and I can't stop eating sweet stuff. I'm not fat, I think I'm chubby but this bad addiction of mine is going to make me fat if I don't do something about it. I'm 5'7'' tall and weigh 185 lbs. Actually I'm not sure where the weight comes from, because if you saw me you would NEVER think I weighed that much. The thing is, even if I go on diets and stop eating sweet food, I double my sweet portions when I stop being on a diet. If I don't get to eat anything sweet during 1-2 days, I lose my cool and might become really angry for no reason which unsual for me, because I'm a very nice person normally. I feel satisfied when I get to eat something sweet. It's not just on mental level, it's even more on a physiological level. I can't explain, but it feels like my organism's asking for sweets. For example, o an average working fay I can eat (apart from normal food): 8-10 chocolated-covered cookies, 6-8 sweets, 4 waffles, 4-6 marshmallows, and probably a whole bar of chocolate in the evening. And I could eat even more if I didn't try to stop myself. I have a weak stomach, I have allergies, I have all sorts of problems with health and I know damn well that I'm going to ruin my health even more if I don't stop eating sweet stuff so much, but I just can't stop. What do I do? Are there any good books on it? Any good articles, advice, whatever? I desperately need help because I know I won't be able to just cope with it alone, and I'm ashamed to tell my friends about it. I'm losing confidence, because I'm gaining weight slowly, and I feel stupid euphoria when I eat sweets to the point I don't need anything in life."
"I'm a sweet food addict and can't stop it Cresendo,sugar is addicting.Studies have shown it acts on similiar receptors in the brain as cocaine..so dont feel bad when you lose control.Its not you but it IS the sugar. What is worse that so many companies shove so much uneeded sugar,salt,dyes,preservatives in their products with the sole intention of getting the buyer addicted. Try starting cutting back.Sugar is behind so many health problems..Corn syrup is even worse then cane sugar.They say sugar is sugar,but it is not.Corn syrup,which is plastered in everything now,even supposedly ""healthy"" labeled products,and is broken down and stored by the liver differently then cane sugar,is most likely coming from genetically altered corn,which makes it even quadruple worse.I believe corn syrup nation is behind the obesity problen in America.The corn industry denied this though of course. Maybe read some info/books/ebooks on how to break the sugar addiction.Try getting involved in cooking/baking.Making homeade is healthier,plus homeade doesnt have the preservaatives for shelf life,and you can control whats in it.Baked goods can have the sugar cut back,egg whites can be used instead of whole eggs alot of times,applesause can be used as fat replacement too alot of times.. And dont feel ashamed...Most of Americans eat way too much sugar and are probably addicted to it to some extent.The comppanies want us addicted so we come back for more and make them rich,plus we make the medical field rich with all our sugar related health problems. And last but not least..dont buy the stuff.If you dont have it you cant eat it.XX"
"I'm a sweet food addict and can't stop it I agree with starbright333. Corn Syrup has a lot to answer for. It's very difficult giving up sugar altogether, because, as you have said, you feel terrible and get bad headaches. It's a 'withdrawal'. it takes a very strong minded person to go through with it, perhaps for a week, when it's in almost everything. However, at least if you do cook your own food, you can be in control. One other thing.....in recent years, when TV programs bang on about 'junk food', I used to react by saying 'food is food'. If you are hungry, you will eat almost anything, and there's no such thing as 'junk food'. After all, poor people from poorer countries don't get the choice. In the Western World, we do. A bit too much choice sometimes. However, binging too much on the wrong things is always bad news. Keep visiting the board. Knowledge is power. Someone who posts on here may just be the one who inspires you, or points you in a direction that you can handle for your own success."
"I'm a sweet food addict and can't stop it Hello! I'm not in a position to give advice because I'm overeating on everything, especially sugar, but in my experience it seems like fruit can cure a sweet tooth at least for a few minutes. When I lived at home, my mom made me substitute strawberries, bananas, and raspberries for ice cream and cookies."
"I'm a sweet food addict and can't stop it My BMI says also that I am overweight...and I am trying to go low carb so cutting on sugar is a must.I ate like two pieces of chocolate today and I drinked on coffee with sugar. But I am trying to cut even more sugar due to the fact that I might have insulin resistance... This si very serious.Think about your health.Look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself if you want to get sick and be controlled by some sweets or if you want to take control over your life. Right now I am searching for healthier choices when it comes to chocolate(high in cacao),I am gonna replace the sugar with all-natural honey and I am gonna cook myself everything I eat just to be sure I don't eat salami with all types of chemicals. I am discovering the taste of good food that is not actually unhealthy."
I'm a sweet food addict and can't stop it I'm a sugar addict too. The worse thing is that I'm diabetic and can't stop eating sugar. I try to stop myself but impulsively buy sugary foods. I'm gaining weight too. I hide my over eating of sugary things from everyone. Esp my husband. I need help
"I'm a sweet food addict and can't stop it You're not alone friend. I'm also a sweet food addict. No doubt eating sweetness is enormously helping me gain weight. Now recently I went to my doctor and after measuring my weight, she suggested me to stop eating sweet and salty things both together. Advice me to eat only fruits and non oily foods. Now I'm feeling totally alien after not eating sweet things for more than 10 days."
"Depression, Stress, and Food Addiction *TW* trigger warnings: overeating, binge eating, depression, anxiety and stress, criticisms from others, cultural ideas of fitness and beauty Hello everyone. This is my first post on this forum. I decided to post here under Addiction rather than Binge Eating because, well, the latter is the symptom of the former, and I don't binge so much as find myself desiring a food so much I can't avoid it. So, yeah, I'm addicted to food. I don't know why I am. It probably has everything to do with chronic low-grade depression that I've apparently had since about age 9, and it gets especially bad when I'm stressed out (which is always for the last oh 10 years). My parent's have no addictions at all, and I don't know anyone in my family that is addicted to anything. Me, I'm addicted to food and anything else that ignites the pleasure center of my brain (movies, tv, hobbies...) and it has on occasion affected my life, but not drastically. My food addiction became obvious to me when I admitted to myself that I hid food, planned access to the hidden food, and ate food in secret basically all my life but increasingly so the last few years. Everyone else I know loves food as much as I do, but they don't cave in to the slightest pang of hunger and run to the fridge. None of them are big people. So naturally I become ashamed and don't want to be seen when I secret-eat. Even normal eating sometimes brings fears of ridicule. I'm nearly fainting from hunger not long after a meal (which is another problem), but I'm hesitant to even go and eat an apple lest I hear about it. ""You shouldn't snack,"" ""don't eat between meals"", ""you just ate"". Sometimes these comments never come, but sometimes they do, from people who do not have the same stomach-schedule as I do, are not weak to their addiction. Hints to the addiction were also seen in cravings. I will crave a food, a specific food so strong that it will put pregnant women to shame. If I don't eat that food, I will remain hungry. This can't be physical, because entire meals aren't satisfactory if I want something else. Today, I had a wonderful, big lunch out. An hour later I felt hungry. Yes, I am PMSing right now, and stressed and depressed because of reasons, but there was not one chance that I was actually hungry after eating a meal I could barely finish! I put off eating a snack until a couple hours later, but still. That doesn't make any sense. In any case, I'm addicted to food, all food really, but of course none of the HEALTHY stuff. The depression tells me that nothing matters and that I should eat whatever I want because in the end I'm going to die anyway, might as well enjoy what I love most (and of course that happens to be food). The stress I have in my life is just worsened by the knowledge that I gained weight, because people aren't ""supposed"" to be fat, and of course most people will not find me attractive. Even my long-term partner (who is living in another country at the moment) I worry will leave me once he sees the weight I gained, because he's French, and the French are morbidly terrified of fat. My issues with him is a whole other can of spam.... It's a vicious cycle of eating to de-stress and stressing because I'm eating. The thing I want most I guess is to stop NOT caring that I'm eating myself towards a heart attack, but I really need to stop being so addicted to the types of foods that are destroying my body."
"Depression, Stress, and Food Addiction *TW* This also sounds exactly like me. Like you, I joined this forum for support and help out. I am exhausted by this, as I can imagine you are. I know this is just the internet, but I am willing to be someone to talk to. I hesitate to use the word 'support' bc that usually makes me feel worse. But there is a way out. Depression sucks, stress sucks...I get that from a very similar background as you. My boyfriend is even a huge health nut - a body builder. Sometimes I wonder if that is the reason I have such a hard time with accepting this. I am ready to go on the journey to dig myself out. I would love a brave companion."

"I'm happy, why do I still over eat? When I was younger a lot of stuff happened which contributed to me being diagnosed as depressed. I hated the thought of anti depressants and in the end I began to self medicate with food. I recently topped the scales at over 20 stone. My life is on track, I am in a good relationship and have been for almost 2 years, I have lost two stone and although some of the issues which arose while I was younger are still there I am Happy. But I cant control my eating. I have tried giving my bank card to my mum, I have tried exercise and diets. But I lie, I lie to myself so much about what I eat that I convince myself that I have been good as far as food is concerned. It isn't getting any easier, I have read books, tried hypnosis to the point of a gastric band and I ate through it. I have a serious problem and I don't think I can face it or conquer it alone It is scary because I have eaten myself to the point where I have fatty infiltrates in my liver which is dangerous but at 26 years of age, I need to turn this addiction on its head before I kill myself with food. I need help from someone who has dealt with this before. Please tell me there is someone here that can help me get past these food demons"
"I'm happy, why do I still over eat? Your message in a bottle was sent so long ago. I wonder if you are even here anymore. I have survived being a junkie, a cigarette smoker, a drinker, and have kicked all of those habits. I have come out of depression and bipolar disorder (I'm now only considered ""eccentric and odd""), worked through all my childhood traumas...and now I'm an eater. No matter what I do I can't stop. I, like you, have tried everything in the book. My metabolism has helped for the most part but now that I'm 40 that's not going to be working for me anymore. I've heard people say that you don't have to get to the bottom of WHY you eat, and while that's true for other things, I don't think it's true for eating. I think there are underlying issues that you and I, friend, have not yet dealt with. Once I figure this eating thing out I won't have many problems left at all. Wish I had an answer for you. Several days ago at Thanksgiving I literally immobilized myself with food. I've never been that full before and it was kind of scary. If I come up with any answers I'll come back here and post them, so that if you're ever in this part of the ocean again you'll see it. Don't give up hope."
"Is anyone else addicted to sugar? Hi everyone, I'm new here, just joined tonight. My food addicted is sugar. It's horrendous because sugar is EVERYWHERE! It's hidden in practically every food on supermarket shelves. I feel like all I can eat is meat and vegetables. From eating so much sugar everyday for the past 8 months (the time I was with my horrible ex-boyfriend) I have developed a yest infection in my gut known as Candida, which feeds off sugar. It is horrendous because if you even try to go a few days without sugar, like to detox, it cries out for more sugar to feed itself because it starts to die off, which of course it doesn't want. I tried detoxing last week and only made it 6 days and then I caved and binged real badly. I need support! The addiction is holding me back in life! I don't really leave my house and it's getting in the way of work. I'm also really self-conscious at work because of the weight I've put on because of my sugar addiction. As far as I am concerned sugar is the worst thing on Earth! Can anyone relate? Please, share your story and your advice."
"Is anyone else addicted to sugar? Sugar is so hard to avoid, and it can be addictive. Chocolate yummm. I'm on a diet (as always!) I've started to play diet hypo tapes every night they both say ""keep away from sugar, sugar is a unnatural refined food that is addictive up and upsets your metabolism, regard as poison"" and, ""only eat natural food, food that roams or grows"" Its helping me get control. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Lao Tzu"
"Is anyone else addicted to sugar? You're definitely not alone with this. I have a love/hate relationship with sugar. I LOVE the stuff, but hate to have it around because it's hard for me to control. Have you ever gone on a candida cleanse before? I've done a few and they're very hard to do because of the detox factor. The bentonite clay & psyllium husk drinks were disgusting too. I find that if you eliminate processed foods it's easier to avoid sugar. Keep writing! Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Is anyone else addicted to sugar? I think in our culture everyone is addicted to sugar up to some degree and I am certainly not an exemption. I've recently cut down the processed food as much as I could and it does reduce sugar craving like ladyswan said. So I am hoping that this will last..or at least that I will just have occasional binges..

Is anyone else addicted to sugar? I like to drink coca cola everyday I dont know why but offcourse it is not really that good their is a thin line between no sugar and no sugar at all the only thing I am afraid of is getting diabites because my mother and some off my family are diabetic I am Jack's broken dream
"Is anyone else addicted to sugar? Hi Wise Monkey Good for you for having the self awareness to note this is a problem for you. I have been addicted to sugar for YEARS so I totally get what you are going through. Sugar is so insidious as part of our western culture and you are right it is in EVERYTHING. I have recently gained a bunch of weight due to feeding into my sugar addiction. When I am under stress I can't seem to control my need to gorge on sugary and starchy things (coca cola; licorice black or red; jube jubes, bagels etc). I too have had yeast infections from over consuming over a period of time. And I am also obese as well. I've tried repeatedly to kick the habit and repeatedly failed. I'm posting 2 brief articles my husband wrote on the topic...at the very least it will help you know that this is a problem of epidemic proportions: ARTICLE #1 A World Without Sugar? by Marc Tardif In November 2011, a substance known as Stevia has been approved by the European Food Safety Authority for use as a natural sweetener in drinks and food products. The United States granted Stevia the “generally regarded as safe” (GRAS) status in December 2008. In Canada, Stevia extracts are not currently approved for use in foods, but Health Canada has approved the use of stevia and its extracts as a sweetener in natural health products. Stevia can be purchased as dried leaves and in liquid format at most health food stores. So what is Stevia? It is a liquid extract from the Stevia rebaudiana plant, commonly known as “sweet leaf” or “sugar leaf”. This plant grows naturally in subtropical and tropical regions of the world. It is said to have up to 300 times the sweetness of sugar, but what is especially sweet about Stevia is the fact that it has 0 calories. Stevia is fast becoming an attractive option in a world where obesity epidemics are breaking out in most technologically advanced countries due to the overconsumption of refined sugar. This is no doubt a major motivator for Western food and drug regulation agencies to fast-track their approval. Stevia is also attractive as a replacement for aspartame and other artificial sweeteners due to the fact that it is natural and is not linked to cancer and other diseases in the way that chemically-based artificial sweeteners are. And for people with diabetes, Stevia is a welcomed alternative as it has a negligible effect on blood sugar levels due to its low glycemic index and avoids the risks associated with artificial sweeteners. As one would expect, Coke and Pepsi are in a race to be the first to bring a Stevia-sweetened soft drink to the North American market, as soft drinks have been identified as major contributors to the growing obesity epidemic. We could soon start to see new versions of Stevia-sweetened soft drinks come onto the market, which has already happened in many Asian markets such as Japan. In fact, health food stores are now selling soft drinks sweetened with Stevia, such as the Zevia product line. The amount of new Stevia-based products coming onto the market is increasing, but currently in Canada you would only be able to find such items at your local health food store. Eventually though, it is likely that Stevia-based products will be available everywhere. ARTICLE #2: Hooked on Sugar by Marc Tardif A minority of people have classified the growing obesity epidemic as a drug addiction issue. Let’s examine the concept of sugar addiction a little more closely for it is one that causes much controversy. Refined sugar is traditionally classified as a food “used to improve the palatability of many foods.” 1 A drug is defined as “any absorbed substance that changes or enhances any physical or psychological function in the body.”1 At first glance, it would appear that the words “sugar” and “drug” are diametrically opposed. But when you consider the effect of refined sugar on physiology and mood, the chain reaction of events is not entirely dissimilar to what happens with other drugs. When refined sugar is consumed, a chemical imbalance follows and the body reacts by pumping out insulin to bring blood sugar levels down to a normal level. For most people, mood tends to become more jovial after consuming foods containing refined sugar. And everyone can relate to the feeling of a “sugar high” and the “sugar crash” that follows. While the physiological and mental effects are different with each drug, the high- low cycle and dependence/addiction are hallmarks of drug-like substances. It has always been said that people feel more jovial after eating sugary foods because eating good-tasting food is more pleasurable than eating plain or bad-tasting food. While this is true, recent studies have shown there is more to it than that because refined sugar “is a depressant and, consumed in large amounts, it affects the opiate receptor sites in the central nervous system.” 1 These are the same receptor sites affected by opiates like heroin and morphine. But unlike other drugs, refined sugar is a tough habit to kick because it is added to most everything and is readily available everywhere. And because it is labelled as a food and not as a drug, the overconsumption of refined sugar is described as an obesity epidemic rather than a substance abuse issue. To find out if you are hooked on sugar, try removing foods containing refined sugar and flour and see what happens. You will probably experience withdrawal symptoms as your blood chemistry reacts to the reduction of glucose and the absence of the periodic surge of insulin into your bloodstream. Studies have shown that withdrawal from sugar can be as painful as withdrawal from alcohol. It has been described by those who have undergone both as ‘worse'. 1 Symptoms include mercurial mood swings, irritability, light-headedness and feeling clammy and sweaty. But in a few days you should eventually notice that you feel more stable and clear-minded now that you have gotten off the roller-coaster insulin ride and your opiate receptor sites are no longer being affected. To be clear, naturally-occurring sugars like those found in fruit are not the problem, it is refined sugars that are. Thankfully, Stevia is emerging as a better sweetener alternative which can go a long way to helping in the fight against obesity and addiction to refined sugar. Look for it at your local health food store and use it in place of refined sugar. Be careful though, it takes a lot less Stevia than the amount of refined sugar that would be required to achieve the same sweetness. 1. “The Reclassification of Sugar as a Drug” by Marie-Hélène Lyle, University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. http://www.lurj.org/article.php/vol1n1/sugar"
"Is anyone else addicted to sugar? I know what you're talking about. I have been struggling SO much with this. it's hell. I just went three weeks without eating sugar. The physical cravings did subside and it was really great to look at that kind of food and not feel like I wanted to have it. I felt like... different... stable. Like ""wow, I can just eat three meals in the day and not be constantly looking forward to my next sugar hit."" The problem is the emotional cravings are another issue. I still sometimes fantisize about breakfast cereals and cookies when I'm feeling depressed. It's kind of ingrained in mefrom childhood ... I don't really know how I'm going to get over that one.... Anyways, don't worry. We'll figure out I'm sure!! Hang in there. One day at a time."
"Is anyone else addicted to sugar? Have you seen this yet? It's reasonably convincing. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM In any event, I sometime last year I learned how to make candy from scratch, and within two or three weeks following it, I had gained 5-10 pound, after years of gaining close to nothing. Typically I've tried to convince myself that white sugar is absolute poison, and if I do resort to sugar, I stick to the darker sugars with less refinement and more nutrients still in it. Sugar isn't all bad, but some of it is just total junk, and too much of it not healthy. If I need a chocolate fix or a sugar fix, I'll grab one of those soy bean chocolate bars which are packed with vitamins, or one of those Boost chocolate shakes they serve in the hospital wards, from the local pharmacy. They do a much better job of satisfying hunger, and sugar cravings at the same time. I mean you can actually fill up eating a soy bar, or a Boost shake, a bag of jellybeans, there is no end to the hunger.

Is anyone else addicted to sugar? Yes I also sugar food addicted and I love to eat sweet and sugar food in my daily diet. therefore may parents scold me lot but i cant' leave this habit so please suggest me how to remove my bad habit. I am waiting fro your positive reply.
"Food Addictions/Struggles Hello, Everyone can call me Bee. I'm here because I've struggled with food all my life. Right now I am 200 pounds. I am here because I would like to talk with other people who understand what it is like to be like this! I love all foods but sugar and starchy foods seem to trigger binges the most. The least I have weighed in my adult life was 155: and I got there by not eating anything with sugar or grains in it over the course of four months. I did no additional exercise at all although at the time I worked at a warehouse building pallets. I kept around that weight for about a year and a half before gaining most of it back again, though I am still below my heaviest. I've since gone back on my ""no sugar no grains diet"". I've been back on about a month and I am down ten pounds from where I started. Anyway a lot of boring stuff, the main thing is that I think that I have something genetic that makes me want to eat all the food I see. When I see food I am always worried it will go to waste or I won't have any to have later: when I child there was sometimes not much food around! Anyone have any tips or hints to kick this thing? Does it ever get easier?"
"How do others seek help? Hello! Over the course of my life, I've always had one addiction after another: anorexia; an assortment of drugs including alcohol, heroin, and benzo's; cutting and other self-harm. In addition, schizoaffective disorder. Now, it seems I'm having trouble with overeating. I eat when I am not hungry. I eat to cope with every mood, happy or sad. Instead of eating one portion of a meal, I eat four or five or more. I'm not eating healthy food, except the occasional banana or broccoli. I've gained an extreme amount of weight, and I still can't stop. My family is disappointed in me and I'm disappointed in myself. I desperately want and need to get healthy before I get diabetes or have a heart attack at 26 years old. I literally eat myself sick. Where do I go? I've seen nutritionists; I follow their plans and menus for up to a week and then binge eat. My psychiatrist says it's from my antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, but I can't stop taking those. Is Overeaters Anonymous helpful? Should I try another nutritionist? At least, can anyone relate? That would mean a lot! Thanks!"
"How do others seek help? HI Kiki9!!Please dont be so hard on yourself.Its not your fault.Mental health medications are notorious for putting weight on people.I dont know why.The only thing I can think of is its about the alteration of the brain chemicals.I have only taken benzos for anxiety,so am not familiar with your meds.But I know alot of people have complained about being hungry all the time..not being aware they are full.Speak to your doctor about changing your meds.Tell him you are NOT happy with what the current meds are doing to your body.Make your point known. I have struggled with bulimia since my late teens.I am in my 40s now.Its better,but I still have an occasional off day..I know all about binge eating.My mind goes blank..numb..and I literally have no concept of the amount I have eaten or why.I know why,someone triggers me,the stress builds,then the binge comes on.One of the best things I find is to not have easy access foods,junk foods,snack foods in the house.If they arent here,we cant eat them.Plus the companies put things in their foods to cause addiction,so that the consumer keeps coming back for more.Eat natural,organic if you can..I started walking.I have to force myself sometimes.But I go and really do llove it.YOU have to make the time for YOU.Start slow.It works and helps. I have had plenty of addictions over the years too.I come from a very abusive childhood,and self medicating and numbing was how I learned to deal.Plus my father would call me fat at any given chance.I weighed less then 110lbs and he would call me a big girl..fat..and say all I did was eat.His cruelty and abuse weighed on me deeply.I have found one of my best tools for my eating disorder is meditation/prayer.I am NOT a churchy person..or organized religion,but consider myself spiritual,and have found meditation to help me immensely.(I meditate to Holy Spirit/Infant Jesus of Prague). I wish you peace,happiness,and joy in life.I hope you find answers and solutions soon.I found it sad that you said people were disappointed in you.Weight should be dealt with best you can for health,but weight doesnt make a person who they are.Kindness..compassion..acceptance..forgiveness are what makes a person a beautiful soul..Hugs XX (:"

"Newbie Hello, my name is Tia and I'm a 32 y.o single woman that never had a weight problem until less than 10 yrs ago due to my food addiction. Spent my ENTIRE life eating whatever I wanted until it caught up to me. I am a glutton and I have a hard time resisting most foods, good and bad. But of course I crave carbs and sugars the most. I also have an issue with portion size, I eat large portions. I'll be full and still eat just because food is available. I am overweight and I really want to lose but my food issue has me conflicted. Often convincing my self ""oh this won't hurt"" or ""I'll be good tomorrow"". I work out 3-4 days a week but they say 80% of weight loss is the good you consume. I look at my mother, who just had gastric sleeve surgery and tell myself that I'm not gonna let my love for food send me to the operating table or diabetes. I'm pre-diabetic now & this is what really concerned me. Ironically, since I researched food addiction and realized I had almost all the signs I find myself not having cravings for the last 2 days. Hopefully I can keep this going."
"Sugar detox Hi everyone! I'm new here and looking for some support kicking a very severe sugar addiction. I'm sure this is something a lot of people can relate to at least on some level. I am stopping sugar intake altogether starting tomorrow and I know it's going to be really tough for me. My mum and I are doing it together but I am far more dependent than she is and both of us have very little will power. We have dieted on and off pretty much our whole lives but never tried cold turkey before and I am really hopeful that we can keep it up. I have found a lot of help, advice and support on forums for other things before so I am really hoping that people here will do the same I thought maybe I could use this thread as a sort of diary and anyone else who wants to join in can? That way any time I am feeling rocky I have somewhere safe to turn and keep on track Anyway, hope to hear from others soon!"
"Sugar detox Good luck on your quest! Sugar is included in an awful lot of products. Perhaps you've already heard that but you have to be really vigilant here. For instance, all sorts of mustard except Dijon include sugar. Light yoghurts often include extra sugar to compensate for missing taste. I recommend reading the labels carefully on everything you purchase. I'm lucky -- I don't actually like the taste of sugar. But when I went sugar-free I discovered how difficult that actually was. Almost all processed food contains sugar or fructose/dextrose. I will be keeping fingers crossed for you and I look forward to your posts. Currently working on my upcoming signature."
"Trying to Find a Path to Recovery! Hi, hi, hi. I'm Gatsby. I live in LA and I'm mid-twenties (and a chick). I'm here to learn healthier eating habits so I can lose weight. I've known for a while that I'm emotionally dependent on food -- when I'm excited/happy/celebrating something, I go straight for food. Likewise, when I'm upset/anxious, I go straight for food. I love food, which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing on its own -- I love to try new foods the way I love to visit new beaches, you know? BUT I'm not emotionally dependent on beaches. So, I desperately want to learn a healthier relationship to food. Dieting simply doesn't work for me. I actually eat well in the home, I rarely get myself junk food. But when I'm offered junk, or I'm at a party or restaurant where there's junk, I have zero willpower. And the thing is, being young and single and living in the city with friends, we go out to eat a ton. I want to hang out with my friends without it equaling be ordering the junkiest thing on the menu and then feeling bad about it afterwards. I'll be getting ready for a party and think, 'I will have one serving of dessert' (there's always plate after plate of cookies, brownies, pie, in my friend circle) -- and then go there and have four cookies, not one. I've recently realized I'm addicted to food, to the way it can change my mood. So I'm here to make friends with people with similar struggles and those who've been there and have advice to impart to me. But in the spirit of not sounding super depressing, I think this is the thing I need which will help me to get better! I've been trying to address the physical side -- dieting, working out -- for years, but I think it's the mental side I need to address before the physical will work! Come say hi, impart your wisdom, or share your struggles! Gatsby"
"Caffeine Addiction I didn't really know what category to put this into but I need help. I know how lame it sounds to say ""hey, I'm addicted to caffeine"". I almost wish - almost - that it was something more believable like Diazepam or Morphine or Alcohol, where people accept it more. But it's caffeine, and people don't really accept it as a serious addiction, even though it is. Because of this, I have told none of my friends or family; also, this is partially because I feel certain they would just brush it off, in the same way as some people brush depression off as 'being sad', or they brush fibromyalgia off as 'faking it'. This is especially likely as I have Asperger's Syndrome which may make people think I'm just 'confused' or 'doing it for attention'. I know I need help, but I do have physical medical issues as well so I'm reluctant to see a GP in case he/she decides that my physical issues are no longer relevant in light of this. I know it sounds really, really tame, and I know people bang on about how one can simply drink less coffee, or wean themselves off but that is not working for me. Can I have some help here, please?"
"Caffeine Addiction Caffeine is seriously addictive and withdrawal is pretty terrible. The main difference between caffeine and sugar vs morphine, heroin etc. is that caffeine and sugar are socially accepted. But it is possible to die of caffeine overdose: http://abcnews.go.com/Health/teen-death ... d=24397704 I have no clue what your issues are, but if you are afraid (do you have reasons to think so?) that your GP isn't going to treat you seriously, maybe you could try a different one? No idea how it works in your country. Maybe this would be helpful: http://www.wikihow.com/Quit-Caffeine Big hugs, and I hope you can overcome your addiction.

"Could I Have A Food Addiction? New here and wondering if food addiction could be my problem. If you don't mind reading this I'd appreciate any insight. Since I'm new to this so I'm just going to put it out there **this might contain triggers**. I'm a 36 year old female,and am significantly overweight. I've been increasingly overweight since my 20's. I've tried diets and exercise programs but I always manage to put back on everything I've lost and then some. Food feels like my only happiness in life, and I've admitted as much out loud. In the morning the only reason I ever want to get out of bed is mostly because I can't wait to eat something. I'll lay in bed and think about what we have in the fridge/pantry and my excitement for whatever we has is what gets me going. If it's a lean week and we don't have anything good (ie; chips, candy, string cheese, soda, ice cream) I become so depressed that I don't want to get up. Once I'm up all I do is think about what I can eat next. All day long. I wear a path in the floor from the couch to the kitchen. When I'm in front of other people I'll eat a normal amount, at a normal pace, and leave a normal amount on my plate all hoping to avoid judgement (can't be the fat girl who cleans her plate), but I'll go home and stuff my face. I rarely ever leave the house. I dread it. I feel so fat, so unattractive, that I don't want people to look at me. I don't even own any decent clothes that fit me anymore and I refuse to buy clothes for my fat self. She doesn't deserve it. She shouldn't even try. I live in fear of being invited to anything. I ended up quitting my full time job because I always had so much anxiety about going out in public and being judged. And I struggled with trying to look nice and professional while I hated myself so much. I would never eat lunch in front of anyone, I rarely ate anything in front of anyone. Which is lame, I'll admit, because OBVIOUSLY I love eating...no one becomes this overweight suddenly or by accident. So now my husband and I are struggling to live off his income alone which means no vacations, no fun outings, no fun purchases. Thankfully we can afford pizza. I don't have Facebook or any kind of social media account because I used to be really pretty and I don't want anyone from my past to see what I've done to myself. I'm basically hiding from the world. I don't feel like I deserve to go out anyway. I go to great lengths to hide from friends and family because I worry there will be cameras and pictures of Fat Me will end up on Facebook, and I worry about how my friends and family might judge me. In fact my sister asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding and initially I said yes but now I'm trying to think of a good reason to back out. I can't imagine standing up in front of 150 people and be judged, never mind that she'll plaster pics all over Facebook (as is her right as the happy bride) and people will see what I've become, how far I've fallen. I'm just hoping to avoid all the anxiety and depression that I know will come with trying to ""pretty up"" myself and, naturally, fall short. With all of the ways that my eating habits have ruined my life (more than I've mentioned here) it occurs to me that I've allowed it to happen. And continue to allow it. But most of the time I feel powerless to eat less or more healthfully. Junk food feels like my only happiness. Even if it's just a moment of happy here and there. Going to the grocery store almost feels like (what I imagine) going to buy drugs feels like. I'm wondering if I could have a food addiction. If I do I definitely came by it naturally...before she passed, my mother was a (recovering) drug addict and alcoholic. Somehow I seem to have sidestepped those issues but I'm SO fat. I'd almost rather be an alcoholic or drug addict because at least those people don't WEAR their addictions, not all of them anyway. Anyone who looks at me, instead of through me, will assume I'm weak, suffering, lazy, unhappy, etc etc... It's so embarrassing to be overweight. Do I have a food addiction do you think?

"Could I Have A Food Addiction? i hope you will get this message. i am here to listen and support you and am currently reading your message. i too have been hurt by no responses, particularly on here. you are not alone in your pain. i will respond more when i finish reading your story. i care. -- Sat Jan 03, 2015 8:27 am -- my opinion is you could say you have a food addiction. you can also say, as i will say for myself, that food helps you deal with your pain, as it does for mine. i am so sad that i did not reach you in time for you to get off of this site, if you have. i will pray for you. i understand the fantasies of food that you have. i have them too. my husband and family do not understand nor struggle as i do with food. i too don't want to go out and finding clothes in my closet that fit is becoming harder. i am slowly gaining weight. i just want you to know that your story has helped me not feel so alone in my shame. i also didn't get with my family for christmas, my b-day, thanksgiving, and new years because of my weight gain. my husband has lost a lot of weight which makes me more obvious. i go to the same local store every day and so i'm humiliated and have panic attacks and anxiety about going and them seeing my gain. i hope and pray we both can get out of this rut and pit. there is hope."
"How do I tell my mom I binge eat? I'm 16 years old & I'm a female. I tell my mom everything. She's my best friend. We tell each other absolutely everything. I'm just not sure how to tell her about this. There's a huge back story to this, but I think it's mostly due to stress. One year I lost 6 people who were very close to me within 5 months. I don't talk to one of my brothers anymore because he uses/makes crystal meth (he doesn't live with us anymore). My aunt can go to prison for 10+ years because of meth charges she has, my parents fight a lot, money is a big problem, my therapist doesn't help, my grandma is dying, my dad is dying, & it's making a huge impact on me. I was vegetarian for over a year, but my binge eating has gotten so out of control that I started eating meat again. (I became vegetarian for personal reasons, not health problems.) I spent 15 minute typing the whole story earlier, but it didn't save. I attempted suicide in February, I've dealt with self-harm for about two years, I've suffered with depression even longer. I was always a bit overweight throughout my life, but it's never been to this point. When I was on my vegetarian diet I was very happy and confident in myself, but a lot of family problems started going on and my school work was getting ridiculous. I would spend 3-4 hours after school working on school work & I would give my all in every class, but I would still just barely pass them. (I'm in 10th grade.) But recently my binging is beyond out of control and I've gotten to the point that I started eating meat again. The last thing I ever wanted to do is start eating meat again. One night it was so out of control I didn't even realize I was eating meat. My body soon got use to it and that's when I started gaining a lot of my weight back. I started going on late night drives to McDoanlds, only a mile away, & I started hiding food in my room & car. I would eat secretly & constantly eat when everyone was sleeping. I would eat an entire cheese pizza at least 3 times a week. I would drink over 2 liters of coke a day. I would eat multiple ham & cheese sandwiches throughout the day & still snack in between. One night I ordered five double cheeseburgers from mcdonalds & hid them in my room. I baked & ate an entire cheese pizza in one sitting, ate two bowls of ramen noodles, ate a ham & cheese sandwich, & drank a gallon of sweet tea. After that I went & ate two of the five cheeseburgers then threw up because I was so full, then continued to eat the rest of the burgers, & made a grilled cheese sandwich and drank 32oz of coke. My food addiction is out of control. I feel disgusting and hate myself after binging, but I continue to do it and I don't know why. I current go to therapy for severe depression and anxiety. I'm on Lexapro for my depression now, and it does help my mood a bit, but my therapist doesn't really help me. All she says is ""Oh, tell me more. Okay. I see. When would you like to schedule your next appointment?"" We don't really have a conversation, she just seems to pretend to act interested. My dad frequently makes comments on my weight like ""Damn, you're getting fat!"" ""I can't find the TV remote. Did you eat it?"" & things like that. I understand I'm overweight, but his comments still really hurt. I tend to wear over sized, baggy clothes to hide my body. I'm so tired of it. I know I need help and I really want to tell my mom, I just don't know how. How do I bring it up? What do I say? How do I tell her I binge to the point that I hate myself? My mom & I can talk about anything from drugs & sex to depression & suicide. (I've only ever smoked pot, which I haven't in a year, & I'm not sexually active.) I appreciate everyone who takes the time to read & reply. Thank you so much."
"How do I tell my mom I binge eat? i just wanted to let you know i don't know exactly how you can tell her. if it were me, i would write her a heart felt letter that is loving toward yourself and her. I wanted to let you know that i feel for you. i struggle with this myself. it is so painful to gain weight from it particularly. I eat so much i get sick. i am slowly gaining more weight. my parents knew of my binge eating but just told me to replace what i ate immediately. that was hard to maintain and do, particularly without a car. i would like to think that we just really like food, but when it comes down to it harming us, it's different. i hope and pray you can find peace and recovery. -- Sat Jan 03, 2015 8:15 am -- i would also like to say i feel for you in your dad's comments about your weight. my family was very critical of me my whole life, whether over or underweight as i go from one extreme to another and have off and on my whole life. it has really hurt my body. i also have several diagnosis and have stuggled with finding a good therapist. i have shopped around. i understand you must feel very alone. i understanding hating yourself. you are not alone in that. i binged in the last two days on a lot of fattening foods and foods that i'm allergic and intolerant to and am very sick. I have gone to the extremes you are in binging. i appreciate your honesty. i am older now though and its taken a toll on my body and i have to binge on a limited amount of types of foods, because my body rejects everything else, due to the abuse over the years, as well as medication side effects. I too have struggled with finding good meds. I hope this day finds you feeling better. you can pm me if you'd like. my username will be changing soon however. but i will identify myself to you when it does change."
"hoarding + food? I am wondering if its possible to have a food an hoarding problem. this ironically is not being asked for myself it is actually being asked for my mother. I live with my mom...and even though she does not care to admit that she has issues of her own..like I do. she does seem to be a hoarder. the cubards in our kitchen are completly full all the time! if you were to take all the stuff out of them you would probably find dates on them that go all the way back to the 80's and i know that I have found things in the freezer before. that have freezer burn...she even has a HUGE outdoor freezer that literally things from when i was in elementary school. and she claims that she is saving it for special occasions and the words ""that was mine"" are heard quite a lot also. in fact the key to the outdoor freezer I have frankly not seen it in several months. what hurts even more is she knows I have an eating disorder. I do not always eat as often as I am supposed to or when I am supposed to. And I don't really always consider oh is this mine or is someone else's my mind set has almost always been if its in the house and its in the kitchen then anyone there can have it. but this is not how things work. I just heard her step into the kitchen and she is already complaining about the milk nearly being gone. My boyfriend and I drink milk....but he is getting paid tomorrow and has completely no issue what so ever in going out and getting new milk for the household. I get that she just got it a day ago...but honestly food is not a decoration its there to be in fact EATEN this behavior drives me nuts and is one of the main reasons why i am working so hard at putting in extra hours and looking for a second job. So we can get out of this house. My mom refuses to see her faults will not try to get help or admit maybe she just like me has mental health issues. and I can not possibly move forward in my life dealing with my mental illness around someone that does not take care of theirs them selves."
"Not sure if I'm a sufferer Maybe others can relate, I'm not sure if I'm really suffering from a food addiction. My parents in law are suffering an addiction problem at the moment. My fiance's dad was diagnosed with lung cancer earlier this year but is finding it extremely difficult to stop smoking as is his wife. Speaking to the pair of them I've noticed similarities between my own attempts to lose weight. I've struggled with my weight as long as I can really remember, I was always a bit podgy and was bullied in school due to this. I had a rather ""hearty"" appetite and Sunday lunch was always two largeish bowls of pasta, tomato sauce topped with cheese at my grans house. As you can probably imagine high school was pretty hellish even though I wasn't hugely overweight. My parents made attempts to address my problem as I'd always opt for baggy clothes. Unfortunately I think that only made matters worse and I started scoffing in private instead. My mother and grandmother always seemed to be at some weight loss class or another. Both enjoyed some short-lived success at times but I just kept quiet regarding my weight. As an adult I've tried a few classes and like my mother and grandmother found it too difficult to stick to any plan. Over the last couple of years my habits have gotten worse, I find myself constantly craving fast food, crisps and sweets. I reckon I must spend around £100 on fast food each month (which I can't afford to do). I shudder to think of the number of times I've opted to use £20 our weekly food budget on a take away rather than buying raw ingredients (which would give us far more meals). As a result we've then ended up having very little to buy proper food and ended up eating the same couple of cheap meals for a week. I frequently eat until I feel extremely sick, often think about food, have many many foul moods where I can only really focus on how weak a person I must be and this is pretty much ruling my life right now. Over pretty much my whole life I've gotten bigger and bigger and am able to pack away a disgusting amount of food. I'm well into the obese numbers on the BMI chart and avoid going to my doctor in case he says anything about my weight. My poor fiance is at a loss so I'm hoping that maybe this is indeed what I'm suffering and I can perhaps find ways to help myself. My first step is to change my daily eating habits to ensure I have three nutritious meals a day with small snacks in between. At the moment I often don't eat until I get home from work at night then end up eating far more than I need. Second step is to start making meals from scratch again. I always enjoyed making curry and pasta sauces but have gotten very lazy about this recently and have been buying jars from the shop (which are generally full of rubbish). I'll have a look at other threads for more ideas."
"Just sharing my way of dealing with an eating disorder Growing up, I was forced to take a lot of antipsychotics. As a lot of you may know, theh cause extreme weight gain Mainly due to the appetite increase. i became a tyoe 2 diabetic at age 19 because of it, and my appetite was never the same even after stopping to take the drugs. I've managed to lose about 220lbs since 2009, and Im still overweight and battle food obsession daily. Taking lithium now, which increases appetite a little bit too. I've found a few techniques that seem to work, though some of you might find them silly or extreme. Number one: dont count calories. Or plan meals. Or get a strict diet. Im serious. We all worry so much about the food we eat that we end up thinking about food way more than we should. Dont take note of what you ate, dont count calories, do t beat yourself up to keep it under control. The mere stress from doing this is enough to open an appetite. It obviously KEEPS REMINDING YOU OF FOOD. and really, spend 5 minutes telling yourself ""i will not eat my favorite item on burger king's menu, i will not eat my favorite item on burger king's menu"". What do you feel like doing now? Number two: Medication. if your appetite is too extreme, consider taking medication. Or stopping. Dopamine antagonists, antihistamines and serotonin increasers are usually the main culprits in appetite increasing. If you take antipsychotics, antidepressants, allergy medication or sleep aids, you might be getting your appetite from them. And honestly, its unlikely it will subside as long as you take the meds. Rry switching around medications until you find one that impacts your appetite too much. Dopamine agonists (aka stimulants) and other dopamine increasing drugs are in my opinion the best appetite supressants. Number three: now, this is not healthy at all and outright gross, but.... ever considered NOT SWALLOWING? lets be rational... any kind of food above your necessary daily calorie intake will become fat. On the other hand, your unconsiderate brain doesnt stop begging for more and more food. Why dont you give it what it wants and buy a huge ammount of food? Go all out on a favorite food shoppjng spree. Get that delicious, ever so desired piece of delicious heaven on your mouth, chew it, savor it, chew it some more.... and spit it out. Do it. I do it. I chew it and spit it on a plastic cup. I chew an entire pizza by myself and spit it all out. Ebentually I get tired, satisfied ans grossed out. Buys me more time without eating or thinking about food, and my brain gets what it wants without screwing up my body. Number 4: try reducing simple carbs. I know i contradicted tactic number 1 here, but honestly, sugar is bad. It is addicting, it is very caloric, it is very easy to digest, it messes up appetite by itself and it is delicious. Going cold turkey on sugary foods, pasta, bread and so on works best for me. You cant really stop a cocaine binging habit by reducing a few grams per day, I believe... the cocaine itself will make you want more from it. So will sugar make you want more and more sugar. *mod edit* Anyways, this is what i do. I still battle a never ending appetite and food obsession daily and have trouble losing weight, but this is what worked best for me.

what are your stories how did this all start? i feel like i may have had food addiction or bed basically my whole life but about maybe 5 or 6 years ago is when it has gotten really bad. and i think it may have gotten bad because of something that happened at that time but its not something i think about so maybe not?
"what are your stories how did this all start? Welcome. When you read the posts, there's a lot of people who can relate to something from their childhood, or teenage years, that they feel may have caused this. I don't think anyone is entirely sure. I too seem to have been a 'hearty eater' to put it politely, since as far back as I can recall, but I was not aware of it being a problem, and I wasn't a fat child, or teenager. However I was never skinny either. When you are young, you are usually active, (in my case walking to school) there weren't the same amount of fast food places then either, (I'm of retirement age so I only remember sweet shops, bakers and the fish & chip shop), and there wasn't the cash around to spend on too much, (in my particular case). So.....there were less temptations I guess. This may then suggest lack of willpower being to blame. Again it's not that simple either. I have been visiting the forum every day, since I joined last week, and look forward to your posts and replies."
what are your stories how did this all start? so update on me. im trying to recover and i havnt had fastfood sense monday and im starting to withdrawl and i feel like $#%^. and of course my cravings are insane. but right now im not working and ive been at home so i have no way to get fastfood so that helps.
"what are your stories how did this all start? Dear Macdoublethefat, Since my last post to you, I've had my share of ups and downs, as we all do on this forum. I'd like to say I don't think of food every day, from the moment I get up, to the moment I go to bed, but I'm afraid I still do that. Some 'ordinary' eaters would say I must be bored then. I should find something else to do that would excite and stimulate me. I've always been a simple person. I enjoy my family, walking, shopping, reading, watching TV, gardening etc. When I'm doing these things, I'm feeling content, so why am I still thinking of food? Crazy, isn't it? However, there is always hope. Never forget that. I gave up smoking around 12 years ago, and although I regularly pat myself on the back for that success......I still have a sneaky feeling that my eating probably increased round about the same time, as they say smoking is an appetite suppressant. One of the reasons people don't give up smoking, as they are worried about putting on weight sadly. However, I overate a lot then, even while smoking, but I was a lot younger then and a lot more active, so I was burning off the calories. Now, I've got lazy too. I have recognized the food items that I crave, and try not to buy them. I walk past the fast food places (who shall be nameless, but you know who I mean), as, just like an alcoholic, if I go in and eat one?.....I'll crave one the next day and the next. I am convinced that the flavour enhancers are addictive, just like other drugs. I also believe they are intentionally so. I also believe that if you stop.....and it will take about a week to hopefully get over the addiction....your taste buds will get used to unadulterated food items, especially if you can hang on until you are really hungry before eating. Please re-visit, to tell how you are doing."
"One Meal a Day Walking Hi there, I wanted to share what I have been doing to lose weight and get some feedback. I eat one meal a day in the evening, something healthy and I walk a lot. I did my research and this is healthy according to my sources. The articles said no one has time to prepare six small meals much less eat them and it's too costly. They said if you exercise i.e. aerobics, it makes you eat more and move less than you would have throughout the day. They said people can lose weight the hard way (lots of exercise, frequent small meals, lots of fruits and veggies) but because it's so hard, people have a hard time keeping the weight off. I feel like I can eat this way for life. I have lost 14 pounds so far. Malcolm X ate one meal a day for 12 years. The people who did the autopsy and he had the cleanest insides they had ever seen. Thoughts?"
"One Meal a Day Walking I think it's unhealthy, and here's why. Eating one meal per day or restricting in general might cause the insides to look clean, it will have an impact at the cellular level. Your body needs a constant source of energy to draw from and eating only one meal per day is going to cause it to go in and out of survival mode. Gradually this will mean that your body's metabolism slows down. There are some bulimics who don't throw up and use laxatives. We restrict food until a binge happens, then exercise as much as possible or avoid eating altogether. Most bulimics are average or above average weight, and part of that is because of a messed up metabolism. Muscle burns more calories. Of the times I've been healthy and tried to lose weight in a good way, building up muscles was the way to go. After I got stronger it seemed like the weight came off quicker and the inches came off fast. Walking is good but your heart is going to need a little more than that to keep strong for the rest of your life. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"One Meal a Day Walking I'm no expert on how our bodies can be so different, and after many years of reading up on stuff, I'm still none the wiser. If our personalities can vary so much, why can't our bodies? I joke sometimes with my husband saying I must have a bigger stomach. Or the valve inside my stomach doesn't work properly. (the valve that tells my brain that my stomach is full - I forget what it's called, but it is in there). Hormones also come into play in the stomach. In other words, it's all so complex. I find personally, that if I'm going to cut out some calories, I'm better of cutting down in the mornings and during the day, because at night? Oh boy!. That's when my cravings kick in big time. And, for those reading this who say that if I'd had a good nutritional breakfast, with fruit and a good lunch, I wouldn't be so hungry at night? All I can say is that I've been trying that for years, and I still have to fight the cravings and the empty, hungry feeling again at night, no matter how much I eat during the day. I'm sure that somewhere in the World there are people who cant afford more than one good meal a day, and who have to work very hard indeed, just to afford that."
Addicted to SPLENDA i really hate to admit this and it is the first time i am ever admitting this but I am pretty sure I'm addicted to splenda. I prob go through 100 packets a week. In my coffee it is 2 packets but i seem to dip alt of my food in it. For example when I'm eating pretzels i pour a packet into my hand and dip it onto the pretzel. i guess i like the salty and sweet taste. now please don't tell me I'm going to die.. i know how bad this is for me and i know that i eat a lot more food then i normally would because i like this combination i just don't know how to stop. advice?
"Addicted to SPLENDA Do you think it's the Splenda itself, or the sweet taste? Maybe if you try altering your habits a little bit at a time it'll be easier to cut down. Like avoiding pretzels if you know it will make you use the sweetener, or count out the packets for each day and gradually take out a couple at a time. I had a hard time eliminating aspartame from my diet. It's in so much stuff, and i know that sucralose is too. I had headaches for a while but they did go away. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Addicted to SPLENDA Artificial sweeteners are sweeter than sugar, this is true. Some of them make sugar taste dull. I've found that I can't drink anything that's been artificially sweetened now because it tastes way too sweet, almost chemical. That's exactly what it is, too, my tastebuds can pick up on that again. I think that if you try to cut down on splenda and replace it with more natural options, eventually your taste will come back to a level where you don't need such an intense sweetness in your food. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Addicted to SPLENDA To elizzy12345 When a particular food, (in your case Splenda), is all you focus on, I would say that this is an addiction. Can I ask if you had any unwanted side-affects? eg having to visit the lady's room more frequently? or tummy troubles? Although, when you like the taste or the feeling in your mouth for a particular food, (as I am with some things), it's so much tougher to give it up, and almost impossible to cut down. I think cutting down is even more difficult, unless you stop buying the item. If the rest of the family like the item, what can you do? Everything boils down to being able to over-ride the feeling of hunger, the cravings, and having copious amounts of will-power. Hopefully, one day, I'll find the answer here, because I don't think there are any answers out there in the medical profession."
"I am a Food Addict Hello everyone I stumbled upon your website after trying to find someone to talk to about my problem, I'd like to start off my introducing myself. My name is Alex I am and 23 years and I have been overweight since the 5th grade. i came to this website because I have a food addiction problem. It might sound silly but I like playing video games a lot and last month I made a topic on my friends gaming forums where I said I was going to try to start losing weight. The first month is over now from when I started on 1/24/14 *mod edit* I have been trying to get advice from the people that post on the forums there and I'm not really getting much help nor the support that i'm seeking. As you can see I was starting out at 369.3lbs and my goal is trying to get down to 180lbs, I am 6'0 and I realize that goal is going to be super hard but I am ready to do it. I have never really tried to lose the weight before because I've never really had a reason to or at least thats what I told myself. I want to start getting healthy to be able to support my family. I have 5 brothers and 2 sisters all who are younger and I want to be around to be able to take care of them and I realize I won't be able to do that if I die at age 30 from a heart attack which is the road that I was on. So during my past few weeks I have been weekly pictures of my progress which I'd like to share. *mod edit* (First week is over 1/31 and i'm 363.) The end of my second week *mod edit*. By Feb 10th I am at 355 *mod edit* (my toenail fell off after my grandma dropped a plank of wood on it .) Now finally by 2/25 the month is over and i'm down to 353 *mod edit* So for the past month I started my goal I lost 16lbs and I know that I could have done sooo much better. On every chance I had I cheated and had no regrets until I was done snacking on whatever it was. I realized the most important part of losing my weight was actually wanting to lose the weight which is why i'm here seeking knowledge and support. I am looking for any tips on what you might do instead of eating when your hungry because I can go the entire day eating 800 calories or so and then when it hits like 8PM-9PM I get urge to start eating whatever I can find and thats when I crash and end up eating another 800+ calories sometimes 1000+.. During my diet, I wake up and have a normal sized bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios with skim milk and for lunch and dinner I have a lean cuisine which are about 220 calorie each putting me around 800-900 calories a day. I stopped drinking soda and all I drink now is water. Any tips or motivation would be great and I would really appreciate it. Thank you.

"I am a Food Addict I've only joined today, and the post was during February, so I don't know if you're still in the forum to read any replies. All I can say to you is that it's good to talk, and I hope you continue to visit the site and listen to how other people are doing. If you read the posts, you will see that there's an awful lot of people in the same boat. I don't think I'm wrong in saying that evenings and night times seem to be the most difficult time. Some people think it's boredom, or loneliness that drives us to raid the kitchen. Others have read that eating heavy meals late at night isn't good, but still do it. Some feel the need to actually get out of bed and eat. Some have already been diagnosed with diabetes or high cholesterol, and still cant control the cravings to eat more. Unfortunately no-one has an absolute answer. I'm visiting the forum to try to learn more about myself and others. Maybe one day there will be an answer."
"Late night Munching I constantly eat late at night ranging from 11-2am and i am just sitting around doing nothing when i should be sleeping because I am so tired. I am a student, 22, who is recovering from bulimia and I get up every morning at 8:30 and I am fine though out the day but wheneverI am in my apartment and the food is there i constantly eat whether I am hungry or not. I have gone from 2/3 daily binging to 4 times a week, and i am ready to kick this last bit which occur during these munching periods late at night. i don't know how to stop this problem! I don't know how to transition to sleep without munching the 2 hours prior. Also whenever i do fall asleep i find myself waking up the 2 or 3 hours during the night and the only way i can get back to bed is by eating something..anything.. whenever i munch for a while i will start to feel guilty and finish a full out binge and then purge (sometimes) This eating a lot late at night is making me gain weight like crazy!! Can someone help me?"
"Late night Munching Hi Elizzy, Sorry for taking so long to reply. I'm recovering from bulimia as well (I always say recovering because it's easy to slip into relapse) and find myself in a pattern of eating too much at night as well. Eating food at night usually leads to an uncomfortable sleep. If you eat salty foods before bed, you'll get thirsty at night. Sugary foods will cause a sugar drop during sleep and will cause you to wake up in a panic. You've likely already noticed this. If you're anything like me, eating to calm down an emotion is like an automatic reflex, so when that panic or disturbed feeling sets in, I want to stuff it down with food. It can be a taste, a texture, or just the action or chewing... I want something else to focus on. You've likely already tried all the obvious solutions like keeping binge foods out of the home and eating a larger meal. One thing that's helped for me is to drink strong herbal teas. The sweet taste curbs my appetite a bit and it seems like a treat too. Hang in there. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Finding Coping Mechanisms I have been told by my GP that I have an addiction to food (mostly sugary foods) as well as a binge eating disorder. I was put on an anti depressant to help dampen the obsessive food thoughts which has helped a little bit. There didnt seem to be much open to me without spending money I do not have so I started researching the crud out of it. I googled and podcast searched my little heart out and found some really helpful stuff. I found that trying to completely cut it out sugar increased my want for it, but eating a lot of it also increased my want for it. I had to find a safe medium where my urges for sugar are more controllable. This is a very fine line, if I accidently go over I basically start again. I am not sure if this is food addiction, binge eating or both. But it is a start. I have all the knowledge for weightloss, but putting it into practice is proving extremely difficult. I keep making terrible food choices though. I gained 10kg last year...now 127.8kg which I think is about 280.8 pounds."
"Finding Coping Mechanisms Hey dgirl I understand how difficult it can be to have a food addiction. It feels really good to binge eat after sticking to a healthy diet. I have studied nutrition and sugar is the worst thing you can eat. Eating foods with fat and carbs is actually very good for your body because they make us feel full when sugar makes us want more and more. Sugars serve no dietary purpose for our body and gives us no energy unlike protein, fat and carbs. So my first tip of advice would to see if you can go a day without sugar. You can still eat whatever you like to eat to make yourself feel full. Now see if you can go three days without sugar. If you can great and give yourself a pat on the back. Then why not go three weeks without sugar? And eventually it will be easier to go three months (90 days) without sugar. If you relapse don't feel bad and go on a binge. You have conditioned your mind to resist impulses and have made mental progress. The magic number is 90 days and that's usually where your mind reconfigures itself. After that point your sugar eating is no longer a habit and you may choose to stop eating completely or eat in moderation. But at that point I doubt you'll ever want to eat sugar again because you know that it just harms you. You may have to eat sugar around friends and family but you'll be able to prevent yourself from going on binges. My second tip of advice is to create a realistic nutrition plan which you can implement using the method above. Use an online Body Mass Ratio (BMR) calculator like this one: http://exrx.net/Calculators/CalRequire.html I am assuming that you are a age 25 female with a body fat ratio of 30% (slightly overweight) who spends 23 hours resting and spends 1 hour everyday walking and running. Your estimated number of calories you need a day is 2605. 2205 is the number of calories you need everyday to lose weight without exercise. You can eat more if you exercise and the heavier you exercise the more calories you will lose per day. It is intimidating to start exercising if you haven't done so in a while. If you feel too self conscious to go to a gym try going to a park and doing light jogging. If you feel too self conscious for this go during the evening or night time, given that your area is safe. I was a chubby kid and did this for 1 year until I got confident enough to exercise in the morning and eventually sign up for a gym. Remember that you will always have time to exercise and use getting healthy as your motivation. The fastest way to lose weight is to build muscle. If you are overweight this body will consume your natural reserves to build muscle. If you are a woman others will not notice this muscle due to the lack of testosterone which makes muscles bulge. It will be only when you flex really hard that the muscle will be slightly visible. Your body stores fat in your hips and butt making these areas stand out when you exercise. For a person high in fat, adopt a ""keto diet"" high in fat and protein and low in carbs. You can eat as much chicken, peanut butter, eggs, avacados and olive oil as you like. Your body will go into ketosis and use up your body's fat reserves very quickly."
I need help but I can't get it Hey everyone! I happened upon this website and I'm hoping someone can help me. I have been a binge eater for years now. I used to weigh 140 pounds and in just 5 years I am now at 260. I can't stop. I tried talking to my dr and she referred me to a psychiatrist. I work 7:30am- 6:30pm during the week and I can't even manage to get a hold of these people! We keep missing each other's calls and finally she just stopped calling back. Even the psychiatrist gave up on me! What do I do??? I'm spiraling even further out of control and I'm about to lose it!! Help! Suggestions? Anything! I have a 4 year old daughter also. So it's not likely that I can just remove detrimental food completely from my home. If I do.. I just go to a gas station and spend 20 bucks on wrapped food items and eat them in my car before I even realize what I'm doing. I don't know what to do!!!
"I need help but I can't get it Hey there, I'm sorry to hear about your struggles and can definitely see why you are concerned. Is there another psychiatrist you can contact that could see you on a weekend? There are support groups that often have meetings at night or on weekends. Have you tried Overeaters Anonymous before? They might have some call-in meetings too. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"All I think about is food All I want to do is lose weight, I want to feel beautiful and go shopping and fit into normal sized clothes, but I can't stop thinking about food and eating. The more I try to track my calories and watch what I eat, the more I end up going crazy and eating everything I get my hands on. I don't even get full anymore. I tell myself I will quit when I'm full, but I just do not get there. I've thought about eating until I was sick. That if I just ate until I threw up that would take care of the problem. But I know that isn't the solution. I wake up thinking about food, that is one of my first thoughts, what will I have for breakfast. And I treat every meal like my last. Even when I don't like what I'm eating. I hate myself and I don't know what to do."
"All I think about is food HEY, i used to be in the same situation.. think about food all the time.. no matter what i was doing or where i was - nature, friend's birthday, talking to my boyfriend - all i thought about was food. it was driving me crazy and i felt so bad.. i felt like a loser. i felt so embarrassed... what i was also thinking was how to lose weight. i wanted to be skinny,i wanted to be slim; i was dying to be beautiful. i counted carbs and calories and i did everything but the more i tried to control it and the more i hated myself the more binges would be back and i just felt like that was it.. like i was going to be bingeing forever.. anyway, my message to you is that you can be healed and you can have a day in your life where you DO NOT THINK ABOUT FOOD ANYMORE. What helped me (and i am telling you - i tried every single thing - EVERYTHING) was getting down on my knees and praying, asking for another way... i knew that the way i was - i could not help myself anymore. and so i asked for a miracle.. i said - universe, please, help me.. and i cried... and i cried and i cried.. what happened after was my healing. it took time. of course it took time.. you do not heal from a disorder in a week or 2 weeks - but you know what - YOU HAVE TIME... healing is getting open with yourself and your soul and realising how much you have been hurting yourself - not just with food but with your THOUGHTS!!!! healing takes a lot of self forgiveness.. healing takes forgiving everyone else who have hurt you in the past.. it is about surrendering everything to a higher power that is flowing around you and just taking one step at a time... i am almost crying as i write this because i am healed.. and i thought i will never ever recover.. i feel so blessed now and i feel like each day is a blank canvas that i can paint on. from 22 years of self hate i managed to wake up in the morning, look into my eyes and say - i love you. you are going to have a beautiful day! and so i am here to tell you - you will be fine.. just get into your space and ask for a new way of thinking.. ask to be led... ask to be shown a different way.. i am sharing my healing on youtube - i have uploaded some videos where i talk about self forgiveness and love and my recovery so please feel free to stop by and say hello. my name is freeyoursoulfromfood http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWaTCHTGvTo ask me questions. because my mission is to help men and women with binge eating to find their REAL SELVES.. this is what i found and this is what i want to spread to others..."
"All I think about is food Seek and ye shall find. Ask and it shall be given unto you. Sayings that contain no specific way to control thoughts. Thoughts are hard to control, and the ways I know involve effort, the effort needed to control your attention, to focus your mind, to stay with anything including controlling or reducing weight. An excellent way to learn to control your mind is simply to count your breaths. Losing count tends to give almost immediate feedback that you've stopped paying attention. I do it a lot. I stopped at 600 when I started this. Counting breaths also interferes with other thinking, such as thoughts of food. Gradually it can almost entirely replace thoughts of food. I'd suggest you try it. Should you do so, I hope you'll tell me how it works for you. Some tell me it's useful. If you'd like to talk to me further, the next paragraph tells you how. Click ""General"" at the top of the page, then ""Living With Mental Illness""then scroll down to my topic ""I'm frustrated..."" and reply in that topic. That's the only way I will see what you write. I will reply."
"All I think about is food Regardless of the situation, the basics for survival never change. Shelter, water, fire, nutrition and medical care are the life essentials needed in any situation. To ensure you have the vital supplies to survive any disaster you must be prepared, and preparedness is not a seasonal concept. Preparedness is a state that must be maintained continually."
"All I think about is food, I feel terrible Wow, what is wrong with me. I use to never be this bad. Well, not that I can remember. Almost 2 years ago I was going through a lot and part of it was a divorce and restraining order and etc. I focused on just going on my treadmill constantly. Every time I had a horrible thought, just go on the machine, and start adding weights. At first, I couldn't even handle 3 min on the treadmill. So I made it my goal that every day for a week that I would try to speedwalk on the treadmill for 3 min a day. Then every week after would add either 2-5 min. It worked, I also done what I always dreamed was to be able to jog a couple miles without feeling that I was dying. Plus I joined WW, that all helped and I found a wonderful man. I lost 80 pounds! Awesome, right? Wrong, after I accomplished all that I got almost to my goal and for some reason I just sabotaged it all. All that work and lost all that weight in like 8 months. But afterwards, I quit everything and started eating and eating and eating, even if I'm already full. I keep eating till it hurts so bad that I rest for awhile. Then like 15 min later, I go eat something else. I feel terrible because all I have is food on the brain non-stop. I feel like I'm going crazy. Well, in about 6 months, I gained over half of that weight back that I worked so hard to lose. People said I was on the stress-diet and that's how I lost it. After all that work and to gain 6+ sizes back in only 6 months. What is wrong with me? I try not to go out anymore or hang out with my friends because I feel so disgusted with myself. My friends tell me I need to be surrounded by them but I don't want to it just makes me feel more like crap, seeing them all skinny, happy, not a care in the world about food, that I so constantly have on my mind. I feel crazy. Can someone out there please give me some words of advice? I feel like I'm slipping back into my cave under my blankets in my bedroom again. I've been doing that for the past few months now. I need help. My doc just keeps prescribing more meds. But I don't want that, cover it up and a pill will make it all go away. There's got to be something else to do. and yes I know about the God thing and to just keep praying but its hard for me to concentrate on that when I'm thinking about food and yes I tried reading the bible and its hard when I'm thinking about food. So please, spare me the gospel preaching. I'm so sorry just rambling on and on. I honestly, do not want to offend anybody. I just feel like crap and this is the first time me going on these post forum things. So please bear with me. I'm sorry. Feels like I really don't know who to talk to about this because I'm so embarrassed and disgusted with myself. One of my friends first answered my text with; ""What's wrong now? """
"All I think about is food hey, that is not bad. but the thing is what kind of food you are eating. if you feel hungry again and again, then make a list of food (good food- calorie burning food) which you should eat. You can eat every 2 hours to maintain faster metabolism- Nutritionists say. Eat nuts,fruits,oats,brown bread..these are very healthy and help burn off calories."
"Sugar controls me. I get up in mornings; I used to start my days with gin or vodka. Now I don't drink as I used to, but I start my days with three or four big pieces of cake with whip cream. It is very difficult to get going without sugary food in mornings. I feel dizzy and strong headache. When I intake sugar, I feel energy and I can start my days. I went to a supermarket, and the staff was very mean to me, but I went there just to buy five pieces of cakes. I don't buy veges and other healthy food, but I buy sugary food. I usually can't wait until I get home, so start eating cakes at the bus stop."

"Craving My craving is huge. I crave for sugary and fatty food. Tonight, I was treated badly by a male staff member at the shop. He took away my receipt and did not return me. Also, he looked creep. I had a negative experience with him at the shop. After that, a strong craving started and continued about 3 hours. I binged my dinner and binged blueberries."
"In pains... Nowhere to vent except here... I am in pains. White sugar is controlling me. Craving for it is tyrannizing my life. I binged my dinner. I knew at what point I should stop eating, but I did not stop. I did not eat white sugar, instead I ate three big pears. Now I feel a strong stomachache; I cannnot move. Craving, craving, craving... This is one of the most uncomfortable physiological and psychological action. It is not a hunger. It is just craving. I cannot coexist with craving any more."
"Pains pains pains repeated pains, suffering Craving is a great pain for me. I went to the supermarket today. I did not go to the aisle for sweets and snacks, but they caught my eyes. I had a great urge to approach them and grab them. I dreamed of munching them in my room. It will be so euphoric! This craving is killing my heart. Every time I go to the supermarket, do I have to feel the pains of craving? My mind wonders around and cannot concentrate on shopping. I can't! It is very irritating not to be able to concentrate. I felt like screaming in the middle of the aisle, ""WOOOOOO HELP!!!"" The craving in my mind is making me very uncomfortable. Every time the craving comes into my mind, I lose confidence, for this is the proof that I am a sloven and greedy person. Sugar sugar sugar, sweets sweets sweets, snack snack snack. I know and understand how they damaged my health. It contributed to my obesity, and created mood disorder. I lost majority part of my teeth and three roots due to sugar. I know that they are evil."
"Pains pains pains repeated pains, suffering Hi gato1116, very sorry to hear you feel this way. I've read that sugar is actually one of the hardest addictions to kick. Are you getting help with this -- a support group or counselling? Big hugs. Currently working on my upcoming signature."
"In pains... I've been suffering from a strong craving for sugary food. I am under a lot of stress. When I deal with mean people, I tend to eat sugar. I tend to binge. I get emotional and I get hurt. I need to solve this problem... What can I do?"
"Seroxat to cure Food Addiction (OCD case) Here is my life experience. I tried ALL methods to stop my food addiction but none worked. I once went to my psychiatrist to cure my general depression, and she prescribed me ""Seroxat"", this medication finished my food addiction. Another medication which normalized my food appetite was ""Zoloft"". Both of them worked for me, but it is not guaranteed that they will work for everyone as is the case with all antidepressants. But never take them without the prescription of doctors. Food Addiction is simply OCD case which can easily be cured by OCD medications."
"Seroxat to cure Food Addiction (OCD case) So are you free from food addiction now? and if so, for how long? I've read in a few research studies that SSRI medication has reduced binging frequency but only in the short term (e.g. 12 months). A follow up study found that many of the patients taking the SSRI relapsed after 1 year even though they we still taking the medication. Obviously I hope this is not the case with you. The second issue is the side effects of taking such drugs and possible dependency issue. P.S. I've tried to find this study (which I'm sure I saved on my computer) but can't find it anywhere"
"Any help would be greatly appreciated! Hey all! I'm new here and I believe you could give me some advice! I don't even know where to start but I will come right out and say it that I'm addicted to good. The past month has been a horrible every other night restrict/binge cycle. Starting back in December, I started a diet that was extremely restrictive and lost about 30 pounds, put 5-7 back on now due to the bingeing. In some way I feel like I'm making up for lost time and eating all of the foods that I ""didn't eat"" or stayed away from. I find myself not wanting to go places because I'm embarrassed with the way I look. I'm 26, 135, 5""5. Maybe you might think well this girl doesn't have a problem, but whatever is going on is NOT ME! I feel trapped."
"Any help would be greatly appreciated! I could write your post almost exactly except that I lost twice as much weight. I've been overeating for about 2 or 3 days a week (I don't really technically binge, but I do eat fairly continuously and eat crap when I'm off the wagon -- I'm always either ""on plan"" or completely haywire, never just eating sensibly) for about the last five weeks. I took the california bar exam at the end of july and just haven't been able to get into a groove since. I think I had to hold everything together until after the test and then I just lost it. My ""plan"" is also extremely restrictive, but it is the only thing that works for me and I'm happier when I'm doing it. I need something that will address my weight issue (still around 25 pounds above ideal), food addiction and work with my type I diabetes/insulin, and a normal calorie counting type diet doesn't do it at all. My way of eating *really* works well for months at a time, but then if I fall off the wagon it can be so hard to get back on. I do hope that it's not the restrictive nature of the diet that's the problem. I actually don't think it is. I ate this way (worse, bc it was every day and maybe a bit more severe) for a long time before I figured out my way of eating, so it might not be a reaction to it in my case. How about you? Did you eat this way before dieting? Do you think it's a reaction to it? In what sense is your diet restrictive? Do you think it's healthy and provides enough sustenance for you?"

"Too difficult to stop I tried erythritol, but it doesn't satisfy me. I think I am addicted to white sugar, and I feel so good with white sugar, and the combination of white sugar, white flour, egg et cetera. I know that I am addicted, and addiction is problematic. White sugar, white flour and egg are not good for my health. I feel it is impossible to stop eating them, but I want to stay away from unhealthy food. What can I do? I go to the supermarket just to buy sugary food and eat them on the way home 'cause I do not have patience. This is absolutely an addictive behavior. I am not comfortable to see myself who is in the middle of eating white sugary food. It is not like me; I feel I am becoming someone else."
"Too difficult to stop What foods are you actually eating? I'm wondering about what has egg in it, I guess. I am also very much addicted to sugar and flour, and anything starchy, really. I love potatoes, too. Pasta actually kinda bores me (unless it's like really good homemade or something), but it does satisfy my addiction. Anyhow, I agree that sugar and floury things are generally pretty bad for your health, especially in largish quantities. I do believe, though, that eggs are great for us! So, if your problem is that you want to eat a big skillet of eggs, I say go for it! Anyhow, how long has this been going on? Sounds like a new thing? Has there been any other big changes for you? Can you remember how you ate before this problem and try to do the same for a few days? If something like that doesn't work, I kinda think you should try cold turkey on the wheat and sugar for a while. If you are still having trouble with no wheat and no sugar, then you might want to go further and cut out all starchy foods and sweets (including fruit!). But I'd just start w the wheat and sugar. Have you read Wheat Belly? Very eye opening about the addictive qualities of wheat, and it has all been true for me. If I eat wheat I just want MORE. If I can stay away from it for a few days, it does get easier, though I do think, like any real addiction, I will always have lingering cravings."
"Wow! I'm not the only one??? Hello all, I am shocked, and relieved, that I'm not the only person in the world that is hooked on food. Right now I'm seeing a psychologist, and she's helping me figure out the reasons why I eat so much. Number one reason: I grew up with an alcoholic mother (also an undiagnosed bipolar), and I never ever knew what to expect from one day to the next. Really the only thing ever constant in my life was food. Food was my friend. It was available when my mother was smashing things against the wall or screaming at me in a rage. Food made me feel better. The only time when I was ever ""slender"" was when I smoked, which I quit years ago. So I grew up relying on food to soothe emotions. When I'm happy, I eat. When I'm stressed, I eat. When I'm sad, I eat. My therapist is trying to help me with replacement behaviors for eating all the time. Go for a walk. (Really? When grabbing a cookie takes 5 seconds?....lol) Yes it's an uphill battle. Yes I like food, and good food too. Anyone else battle this? BTW.... today I had to go for my annual exam at the doctor's office. I stepped on the scale, and I got so pissed off that the nurse couldn't get my blood pressure reading correctly. Then I bought a bathroom scale for the first time in 6 years."
"Wow! I'm not the only one??? Hi, anemone999! I'm glad your therapist is helping you figure out why you have a food addiction. Maybe making a habit out of walking or exercising every day might help, even though a cookie is easier to get haha I think I often ""fix"" my emotions with food too. forum-rules.php I am sorry I am not on the forum as much as I used to be, if I do not reply to you quickly, please contact another moderator/supermod/admin as well."
"Wow! I'm not the only one??? You are so far from being alone. A very large percentage of our population is addicted to food. Food really does soothe and calm, so it's completely understandable why it's so common. The thing is, it's easier to replace an addiction than stopping cold turkey. Exercise is an excellent replacement because endorphins act as a natural mood balancer. I know it takes more time, but the effects of a good workout tend to last longer than a yummy snack."

"Wow! I'm not the only one??? I know that I tend to fix some of my bad feelings by eating one main thing.... chocolate, it's my comfort food and if there isn't any of it there then I will just go for any food. Usually my food of choice is something sweet and energetic so as to drive me on and try to motivate me I guess but that rarely works and I need more. I dunno if it is an addiction or just a compulsion when I am feeling down and in need of a pick up. The bright light at the end of a dark tunnel could be an oncoming train, but it could also be the way out of the darkness..."
"Wow! I'm not the only one??? Hello anemone999, Yes, you are not alone. My mornings start with eating cakes with whip or butter cream. My stomach is always heavy. I need to stop and I want to stop. I am trying to find the ways to stop it. First of all, I need to admit that I am a food addict, but it's difficult to admit it. I have a negative image about the food addicts who are big and fat sitting down on the chair, eating junk food and processed food all day long. I want to believe I am not like one of them, but I am... I cannot control eating. Once I carry food into my moth, I cannot stop. I think that I need to shed light on the negative part of me. Eating too much is negative and I have this negative habit, and I am a food addict. I sit all day long and keep eating junk food and processed food."
"New here,need to vent... Hello, I have been searching the Internet lately for more support and I came across here and thought I would give it a try. I know a lot about healthy eating and exercise. I have lost weight many times in my life, I have even lost weight recently. I get to a certain point and I sabotage myself. I get so motivated and feel so good and then I cave. The worst part is I rarely enjoy all the food I stuff in my mouth. It is just the act of eating it that I love. I have no energy and my weight is out of control. I have battled this all of my life and I am now 28 and it seems worse then ever. I know I am an emotional eater but I am just waiting for the ah-ha moment and its not happening. I have a husband who loves me but when we met we were both a lot lighter and I am afraid we are not helping one another. I think I have to change first in order for my husband to see that he needs to be healthier as well. He is not crazy overweight so he doesn't realize that it's for health reasons he needs to eat better. I am just seeking support and a place to vent where I don't have to admit these things to the people who know me. I know there are others like me, I am hoping we can support each other! Thxs!"

"help..my father is eating excessively I'm looking for any advice....my father is in his mid 50's, my mother the same. My Father is a large, obese man. He has gotten so big that he has to sleep with a machine every night strapped to his face to give him air because he can't breathe at night. My dad works two jobs, my mother one. My dad loves to eat out so much that he spends all the money eating giant meals. $400 a month average. Me and my mother when we DO go out, we try and split something or we order something small. My dad loves buffets, giant drinks, and he eats out every meal. Its taken such a toll that my mother has moved out. She refuses to stay in that house where he doesn't do anything. Because of his eating he now takes blood pressure pills, which me and my mother do not agree with as we believe in natural medicines. The pills make have turned his face beet red and made him tired which now causes him to do NOTHING but sleep, eat even more, and watch TV. I have been taking care of him (cleaning, cooking, etc) but im at the end of my rope. Any food i cook, he doesn't eat..he wants to eat out. Has anyone been in this situation before? Anyone have any advice...... I've come to think that there's nothing I can do as the fact is my dad doesn't want to change. He LOVES his machine at night. he loves eating. and the subject angers him...his mother was the same way and his sister is too..he has only recently become this extreme.....any advice?? thank you"
"help..my father is eating excessively Food addiction is the same as drug, alcohol. Its a an illness that kills slowly, like evry other addiction. There are few ways of stoping this madness. First for him to understand that this source of pleasure will cause pain from illneses and even death in perspective. So he needs to find happineas in other things. Hobby, sport, satisfing activity(not other addiction like sex, videogames, drugs, and so on). Second thing that us up to you, dante is to pray to God that your father would change his way of life. You might think that I just screw around or mean something else, but im not. Try to pray in your thoughts to God,for example in the morning and before sleep, so that God can help your father to stop destroying his body. Once agsin its not a joke. If you care for your father just do it and see. Pray everyday till you see results. It all is abouy faith. Your father right now belives that he will be happy by eating extremly too much food whitch will have dramatic effects on his body."
I wanna stop. My name is Devany and I've always been an emotional eater. I learn it from my mom and my grandmas. It's not like I blame them or anything I just wanna know how to stop. I'm mostly addicted to sugar but I really overeat when it comes to food in general. It's gotten to where I don't even wanna eat anymore because I'll just feel horrible afterwards. When I go out to eat I eat more then what should be possible and diffinently not heathly. On top of that about half the time I'll be hungary again a few minutes later. Then I just wanna puke and have considered it several times but I chicken out due to fear of being found out. I'm overweight to the point where sometimes I'm disgusted with myself which makes me want to eat even more. Its a horrible cycle that I'm in although I know I'm not acctually stuck in it. I just dont know any other way or how to stop.
"I wanna stop. Hi Devaney, Is it possible that you're feeding emotional hunger instead of physical hunger? It's really easy to get the two of those mixed up and equally hard to figure out what to do about it, which I'm sure you already know. Focusing on what you're feeling and thinking when the urge to binge happens can help you figure out what is causing you to crave it so much. I still sometimes can't figure out where the trigger came from, but that moment of reflection will often stop the binge from happening. It takes a lot of practice but is worth it. You've learned to binge from two generations of family members before you so healthy eating is going to feel foreign and uncomfortable for a while. I went through something similar and there are methods of learning how to eat normally that do work. Eating by rote is one of them, but that comes after catching the binge before it happens and figuring out the triggers. Keeping your binge foods around will mean having to deal with constant temptation. Sugar is my crutch as well, and I try to keep none of that around. If I do, it's a small amount. Anything more than that is setting myself up for failing. For instance, I bought some Halloween candy that was meant for trick or treaters, but I knew it was there and ate it. I'll have to buy more but will have to make sure I do that the day of Halloween. Anyhow, I hope this message helps a little. Let us know how you're doing. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"I wanna stop. Hi there, I've battled food addiction for years while working as a substance abuse therapist. I have three things that have allowed me to take some control back. 1. If we let ourselves get to the point where we are so stressed that immediate relief is our top priority, then we will do whatever brings that relief in the fastest, most efficient way possible, and the reality is that food, especially sugar, brings it a lot faster than going for a walk. The key is to find ways to reduce stress before it gets to a crisis point. Once we are in crisis, adrenaline robs our brain of the ability to maintain a healthy list of priorities and the need for relief overpowers every other consideration. 2. The brain is always trying to communicate things to us, dragging them up from unconsciousness to consciousness. Because these messages are longstanding, the brain has lost the ability to communicate them in a direct way. This means that our unconscious communicates with our conscious brain in ways that can be confusing. We are left to infer from our feelings and behavior just what it is that our brain is trying to tell us. Ask yourself, what is it that my brain is trying to tell me by triggering this urge to eat? What is the source of the stress? 3. Don't waste time after you eat beating yourself up. You have not been in control. It was not a wilful decision. It was an automatic reflex. Instead of berating yourself with an accusatory ""Why would I do that to myself?"", insert the words ""I wonder"" in front and you now have an actual question to answer, posed out of curiosity instead of condemnation. What was the sequence of events and feelings that led up to the act? Start to keep track of these sequences and see if any patterns emerge. Your life is a goldmine of data. Start using it to your advantage. Anyway, I have applied these insights and have recently turned the corner not just on my eating, but on my overall health. I hope this is of benefit to you."
"I wanna stop. hey, I used to binge because i wanted to fill every emotion i experienced - anxiety, depression, fear, unhappinness, boredom, any emotion that was not great.. food would become the thing that need to fill that gap inside of me... i struggled so much.. its not that i did not know how to eat - oh hell i did... it was totally different... i will tell you now that the only thing that saved me and helped me to recover was spiritual practice and creativity.. i started meditating every day; i started forgiving myself for a binge and moving forward, slowly very slowly.. i started being GENTLE with myself instead of slating myself every single morning... i started forgiving others and letting the story that i picked up as a child go... leave me! i started turning inside instead of outside whenever i felt bad.. i found a place within myself that was REAL and beautiful.. and i realised that i am part of this amazing big divine universe and that because of my childhood events i got disconnected from that place and decided that i needed fixing.. and because i needed fixing i went onto food. but the truth is way different. nobody needs fixing - you dont need it, i dont need it - nobody needs it!!!!!! we are perfect creations of universe.. we are loved and no matter what others are telling us we will always be loved. i dont care what your parents did when you were growing up or what story you picked up - you are great just as you are.. and once you realise this you can then start looking at some healthier options and exercising.. thing is once you will feel whole and complete you will be full of LIFE and you wont be reaching out for food as your saviour. so try it - i am happy to connect and to talk and share xxx lots of love J xx"
newbie I'm not really sure what to say other than i'm new hear. I wish i could say there's a reason for my eating like i do maybe there is and i just can't find it i don't know. but the fact is i have an amazing family a beautiful home i'm getting good grades in school there's no real reason as far as i can see. but i cant seem to control my eating it's like i'll do good for a while sometimes days sometimes months one time it was even a year but in the end i always go back to what i can best discribe as binge eating. it's like i have to eat everything in sight i don't know anyway i've reached a breaking point i have to do something i just am at a loss as where to start.
I am addicted to eating outside dman I never knew their was a forum for eating I like to eat outside and enjoy it now that I am living with my parents when I did not I also did I d ont see myself not enjoy it I know not everything that you eat outside is not good plus you spend alot aof money on it but it does not sems to bother me yet I also like cocacola but yeah I mean it does not seems to bother me but people call me fat names and $#%^ for me offcourse I gain wiat but for me mainly I just got a big belly but this seems to bother other people more than it bothers me and that is what I hate about it I am Jack's broken dream
"I am addicted to eating outside Hi Bandelero, Do you mean that you prefer to eat in restaurants or order food outside of your home? That's a very common habit people have. It does end up getting expensive and unhealthy though. Does it upset you that others view you negatively for doing this? Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Addycted to MacDonalds: screaming for mercy I will start by making an important observation: that I am regarded by mental health professionals as being ""hyper-vigilant"" - that means I am very alert and watchful all the time. The problem is I am addicted to MacDonalds. It's not that the food is unhealthy in small amounts, but the quality of the sugar and the salt and the oil in their fishburgers and so forth, has permanently warped my mind. I think about it all of the time. I even have the discipline not to go there again, but I still think about it. It's because the pleasure of it is so intense. I thought about it, and I would rate MacDonalds to be as pleasurable as anything but Holy Communion and Desire itself. Now Holy Communion, for those of you that don't know, is the highest point of the faith, there aint nothing that beats it - if anything beats it, it is because God lets it and He doesn't do that often. Desire, you would know, is constant pleasure. So how does something become that pleasurable and not be illegal? The thing is, being hypervigilant, and realizing that MacD was addictive, I actually started to take steps to see if I could ignore it. For example, I bought the burgers and walked away from the store, looking down at the ground and when I was at home, then... I ate them. Only this did not erase the memory of the store from my mind. Then I shrugged it off, and just ate them normally. Then I let those two memories conflict... and you know what? My memory couldn't tell me there was a time when I was not at the store! That's when I knew I had a problem: the pleasure of ... had redefined my memory - I do not take that lightly. So I am left with two weapons: Holy Communion and Desi and I have one enemy: MacDonalds. Somehow they have manufactured their food to be completely exciting, like obscenely exciting and no one thinks they are doing the wrong thing!!! I have started to rule out eating foods that even look like MacDonalds! I'm not sure if you know a secret to the mind, that lets you override pleasure or something, but it would really help. Undoubtedly, a lot of you would have had MacD. If you see nothing wrong with it: ask yourself ""Do I make my choices, or does my food make my choices?"" I am not even trying to be confrontational there. Of course, I know its not the end of the world, and for those of you who don't have the self control to even stop anything, I have prayed for you. It may be that prayer is the only answer."
"Addycted to MacDonalds: screaming for mercy Thanks for your replies guys. It helps to know that being violated does not necessarily mean being excommunicated! Also, you give perspective: yes, restraint is a precious thing (I never realized that till now, but no, I guess some people do not have much - no offence!) and yes, food addiction is a pandemic throughout society that does not regulate corporate chemical manipulation. What I have realized is that, the enjoyment of food, is not just eating it: it is also forgetting about it, not thinking about it, and then rediscovering it, in the light of all the experience you had without it - just when you think you are going to starve, more food! So, I guess now I have been forced to develop a philosophy of food, which is good..."
"Addycted to MacDonalds: screaming for mercy I think that you are obsessed with Macdonalds for the fact that you do not want to think about it at all. I think you should relax and if you wanna go get a burger once a week, then do it, do not push yourself to do something that it is not remotely wrong to the things that are really going on in this world. I think that once you do not pay that much attention on why you are thinking about it all the time, eventually you will slow down and then stop thinking about it as much as you do now, and then you will just go because you feel like having a burger at MACDONALDS, lol. Try this ""I want to think about Macdonalds less everyday while falling asleep, like a lullaby"" Good luck"
"Two Days w/o Chocolate Two whole days w/ o that scrumptious delicious product, nor did I have my usual 4 pm twinkles. I have been battling food and sugar addiction for the last 10 years. And losing I might add. I've tried OA (which I hated),hypnosis, even that ridiculous thing Winona Judd tried - brain balancing or something, supplements, iridologists, and a few naturpaths. I have diabetes type 2, pcos, alopecia, adrenal fatigue, edema, arthritis, depression and probably some other stuff they haven't found. I also did not binge and I ate foods today that usually trigger a binge for lunch. I am 50 lbs overweight but have the problems of someone 100 lbs overweight. I realized a few yrs ago I had a problem and that I always had a problem but b/c I had an active lifestyle I managed to stay fairly thin. Then I moved to the burbs, drove everywhere (NYC u walk everywhere) did not cook (all there is Italian and fast food), lost my artistic community (not too many bohemians in the burbs, so few friends and eventually none), and two jobs (so no time to be healthy). I was eating out of loneliness, stress, despair, and convenience. Recently my fingers and toes began tingling, a sign of neuropathy for diabetics which can lead to amputation. Even this could not keep me from the twinkles as a matter of fact the anxiety made me buy two packs. Last year I lost 20 pounds but it was all consuming. All I did was shop, cook, and menu plan. It was intense. I could not sustain it and gained it all back quickly. I don't remember why I did this. I am such a dramatic extreme person as u can c from the previous strategies. I vaguely remember praying to God, who I have a love/hate relationship with. Anyway I decided to binge on water. Not my usual tentative sips, that barely drained a cup all work day, but 4 to 5 of the starbuck's Venti sized cups that I use as my water container. 4 o clock came and no twinkles, no chocolate even my cubicle mate noticed, which made me noticed. Even today I last ate at lunch, which is a friggin mracle. I can barely go for two hours without food. They call me greedy at work b/c I am always eating. I told a former boyfriend (from my thin days) that I didn't sweat, it was something I rarely did, even after strenuous exercise. I was actually proud of this. I remember he shouted at me fool b/c u are dehydrated! I still didn't take heed (I was thin then all I listened to my dress size). I google dehydrated a few time before thinking could it be so simple but it didn't reflect me, vomiting, cramps, etc. Howevr even thin I have always been wane and lethargic, never the pic. Of health. Today I feel some vitality life essence not totally depleted. Something so simple cost me ten years."
"Two Days w/o Chocolate July 713 - Hi Patchoulijade. I love dark chocolate and have a couple of blocks per day. As for weight gain, I have recently discovered something that sounds ridiculous, yet it is working for me now. Down the road, who knows. I was hit by car a few months ago on bicycle, now wear a back brace and it has a cinch line on it, so I can tighten belt to point where my stomach has stopped sending all those crazy lying messages to my brain that I am hungry, when I am not. Shocked that I have lost about 25 pds. or so in the past few months this way . I know know most can't go out and purchase and start wearing a bulky back brace, but I looked on internet, and there are abdominal binders that are used after surgeries, to help strengthen stomach muscles, etc., also used after a c-section, and after hysterectomy to help draw in the stomach to strengthen muscles. Material is porous and air can flow through material, also velcroe to cinch abdominal binder. Haven't tried binder yet. Do not know if it will cinch as tightly to stop the feeling of hunger (empty tummy) as well or at all, like the belt does. Patchoulijade. Sounds crazy, I know, yet I am losing weight. I had lost 100 pds. prior to 5/5/12 wreck; gained 58 back, now have lost"
"""Real/Solid"" Food Makes me Feel Sick...? I don't have what you would call the healthiest diet. I am a binge eater. I am constantly nervous, and my nervousness is translated by hunger...that feeling in my stomach must mean that I'm hungry! I tend to get double of what I need and eat it all in one day...A family sized bag of chips can be gone in a single sitting with me holding onto it. It's a nervous reaction- I ate one chip, so it's okay if I eat another, and another, and another...till the bag is quickly gone. It's okay though, there's another bag of chips in case I want more. I consider myself addicted to milk products. Breakfast, lunch and dinner (unless I'm eating sweets for breakfast), 8/10 times will contain excessive amounts of cheese, cream or sour cream. When thirsty I will forgo water and choose milk instead. I am in adoration of those two things to the point that people like to ask me--- ""you going to have some noodles with all that cheese?"" or ""you going to have some potato with all that sour cream."" To give you a picture, one tube of sour cream for a potato at a restuarant is never enough, I always have to ask for more sour cream because I don't like the taste of the potato without sour cream on it. xD My sandwich HAS to have cheese. I won't eat it without it, and if it doesn't have it, I'll put some on it. xD And so on and so forth. One of my favorite lunches is ramen noodles with sour cream, which, to your probable horror, involves me putting half a cup of sour cream in a single bowl of noodles. The fact is, I might as well be starving myself. I get almost no nutrients in a day, it's all fat and sugar and water. That's it. That's what I eat every day. It's a wonder I function at all with my lack of nutrients and junk diet... Now though, it's getting to be a problem. I do not consider myself overweight, I am only a small amount over the weight I should be. So even though I eat tons of fat, it never goes anywhere on my body that I can tell. The problem is that real food has started to make me sick. Meat, vegetables, I used to be polite and eat all of them on my plate though I didn't like them. But now, I can't stomach meat. I can eat maybe three bites of meat and I feel full, any more meat and I feel sick. It isn't just meat, it's practically anything solid...I can eat junk food all day and feel fine, but put real food in front of me, and I can't finish my plate. It is beginning to stretch over into solid foods in general. For example, I take a few bites of a sandwich and I feel sick to my stomach. I have been forcing myself to eat. The only thing I haven't been forcing myself to eat has been, of course, junk food that's nothing but air and salt or sugar, because I don't feel anything after eating junk food. Does anyone know what could be causing the the sick stomach after eating even small amounts of solid and real food?

"""Real/Solid"" Food Makes me Feel Sick...? I don't know what this could be down to, but wonder about the ""solid food"". Are you trying to eat soon after eating junk food? It could be even though your stomach isn't registering junk as food, it's filling you up and preventing you eating anything else. And, when you say you can't manage a sandwich, is that a cheese sandwich with mayo, or are you trying to eat something healthier and not being able to stomach that? “ We think too much and feel too little.

"Food addict/binger diabetic I have a little bit of a problem. I am diabetic and my meds have almost stopped working. My blood sugar is constantly around 500. I think the meds would work if I quit binge eating every night. I only eat one meal a day, at night. The reason for this is that if I eat earlier in the day, my body bloats out and I'm so uncomfortable I can't do anything and my clothes don't fit. I mean like 9 months pregnant kinda bloat...and no stomach/gas pills don't work. It's more of an inflammation than a gas prob. I have Crohns and Fibro and a bunch of other probs. Seriously if I eat one piece of lettuce this happens. Also, if I eat...I can't stop eating. I also can't say no to many foods so I don't keep much around that's pre-prepared. SO...it's become habitual to eat at night after all the work and excercizing are done. Problem is I binge and eat 3 meals worth in one setting. I also take my evening meds around 4 to 5 and they give me kind of a buzz that makes me really not care so that adds to the prob of binge eating. I'm also OCD so now this has become a part of a ritual. I'm to the point with the diabetes that I am jeopardizing myself and doing more nerve damage constantly....and yet I eat. I excercize A LOT. I mean way more than most people do. 3 miles a day fast walking, gardening ...en mass, I have an iris farm and right now do all the work myself by hand. You'd think I'd burn up the excess but it does'nt work that way. Calorically I eat a normal amount for a day...just all at once. Now, if I cut down on that which I have not been able to do psychologically...I would not be getting enough calories or nutrition, but i could get my diabetes under control which is the main objective. I have tried to psych myself out by filling myself with low glycemic food....but inevitably I crave fruit and carbs...and end up binge eating those. My mind rationalizes everything, especially after my night meds. I looked for an overeaters annymous chpter near me but there isn't one. I also don't drive and have nobody to drive me. I live way out in the boonies. I looked for an OA message board but there isn't one that I can find which really surprises me. Right now...my body is tingling and numb even though I've had my diabetes meds. I'm about to do my walking/gardening and that will have no effect. Food is the only pleasure I have in life. How do I work my arse off all day and settle down to a lean cuisine once a night ?"
"Food addict/binger diabetic Hi Bitterdregs, This is a very serious situation, and I do hope that you're able to find something that helps you out soon. I suggest that you meet with a nutritionist and devise a meal plan that is safe for you. There could be an anti-inflammatory diet that helps and doesn't aggravate your diabetes. Something doesn't sound right about how your body reacts to food. Please speak to your doctor about this ASAP. It might also help to talk to your pharmacist to see if this might be caused by one of your medications. Sorry I can't be of more help. This does sound like something you need to have addressed professionally. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Food addict/binger diabetic Thank you ladyswan, I know it is serious which is why I decided to find a message board. Part of my problem is that I have not been able to find a doctor who will really listen to me. I move a lot and you'd think one of the docs I've been to would do something other than prescribe protontix for acid reflux but that's all they do. I hav'nt found a shrink with any suggestions either. I pay out of pocket for medical. Can't find an insurance that will accept pre-existing conditions. Because I have no insurance perhaps the doctors just don't take me seriously. I don't know. They can see that my blood sugar is high but just want to throw pills at me instead of help me with the problems that cause me to overeat in the first place. I am at the point of needing insulin but I am scared to use a needle. You'd think my fear of needles would override my other probs but it does'nt. I have recently moved again...am hoping this is the last time. I'm 48 and have moved 78 times in my life. I looked for a local doctor but nobody will take me due to the insurance issue so it's back to the clinic...the nearest clinic is 40 miles away and I don't drive so that should be amusing. It will be weeks before I can get in. I can find a shrink closer but it will also be awhile before I can get in. In the meantime, I thought I'd post here and maybe it will help me in some way. I did fairly well last night...for me. I had a bacon cheeseburger, sweet potato fries ( baked ) and asparagus and 3 sugar free ice cream bars. I actually stopped there. Usually I would have eaten another full meal on top of it. Unfortunately I seem to do better with low glycemic foods that are fatty...it gives satisfaction...but then I have spankingly high cholesterol too...ugh. About the only things it's safe for me to eat with all of my conditions are turkey and lettuce/spinach. That gets old very fast."
"Food addict/binger diabetic Hey there, That's an awfully complicated situation to be in regarding insurance & trying to find help. The only thing I can suggest with that is to keep trying. Does your state offer some kind of program for people with expensive medical conditions? Nobody here will be able to offer you professional advice. The usual suggestions I'd give to someone with binge/fasting patterns doesn't apply to you because of the diabetes. It's possible anything I suggest could do more harm. If you're looking for generalized tips on how to stop binging though, you could always check out the binge eating disorder forum. I'm not sure what kind of help you've sought out aside from regular doctors, but here are a few suggestions that may or may not be feasible for you. I hope one of them is able to open a door to getting the treatment you need. -Diabetes clinics & education centres -Naturopathic doctors -Licensed nutritionists/dieticians -College/universities (sometimes their students need patients) -Call social services and see if there's something nearby you haven't thought of -Support groups -Websites for diabetics Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Food addict/binger diabetic Thank you for your suggestions. Right now with my transportation situation I don't have access to any of that, but hopefully the situation will change soon. I really just came here for support until I can get professional help. I thought maybe if I was part of a community people might say "" good job"" when I manage to eat right. I just need some company in all of this. The things that you tell yourself, will kill you in time. ~ Elliott Smith ~"
"Food addict/binger diabetic Hi, Having been an out of control binger myself - i hear you. Stability will be elusive until you can get some assistance with brain chemistry balance. The imbalance is what robs you of your ability to resist foods and soothing. So you will likely have to pay out of pocket for this but it is possible, I am living proof of incredible freedom from both all those physical symptoms, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgial etc. I say don't keep trying to stop the eating but put your energy into getting the assistance you need. OA.org has podcasts, online meetings and telephone meetings and can be a great support, but in itself not enough. Good luck *Edited* Last edited by salted lipstick on Fri Jun 08, 2012 4:05 am, edited 1 time in total. Reason: for privacy reasons please don't give out your full name on the forum"
"In the grips of bulimia My name is Juliette and I guess, in a nutshell, I am addicted to food. I have always been overly aware of food, from an early age. Slowly, this obsession became worse and worse until I would already start thinking of when my next 'fix' would be, before I had even finished my current meal! My days are now ruled by food; If I'm not eating, I'm counting down the hours to be able to eat. I hate that my life has turned into something that revolves around food. I even have particular obsessive compulsions regarding my food... If it doesn't fall into the following criteria, I will excuse myself from whatever social situation I'm in and go and find the next fix. 1) I simply cannot bring myself to eat without some form of movie/show on in the background. I don't think I've eaten a meal without watching something for years and the thought of trying to wean myself off this habit scares me to death. 2) I need to have huge amounts of salad with my meals. I don't know why... It developed when I started trying to lose weight a few years ago and switched from sandwiches to salads. At first my salads would comprise of cold meats and some lettuce/spinach (say 200g). Now, I currently eat 800g of salad (lettuce, cabbage, carrot) with EVERY savoury meal, no matter what it is. I buy bags of salad by the boatload from my local grocery store, and am known as the 'salad girl'. I heard one guy behind the deli even placing bets with his friend one day as to how many bags I would buy . I know it's not the worst habit to have, but try eating 800g of salad out at a restaurant and looking normal. It literally takes up 4 huge bowls. So basically, I eat by myself, or with my partner (who still looks at me in shock when he sees how much salad I eat). These two things aren't very condusive to a normal social life, and many of my friends have fallen by the wayside (which is my fault, because I'm too 'scared' to eat out with them). Is there anyone else out there that has stupid quirks like mine that go with their eating disorder? Please tell me I'm not the only one... the lone 'salad girl' . I developed bulimic tendencies about 2-3 years ago. It never got out of control though... I made myself throw up (most times, rather unsuccessfully) maybe once every month. Fast forward to today... I have 2 marathon purging sessions a day about 6 days a week. It has gotten to a point where I almost LIKE it :S. My weight is slowly creeping up, as the amount of calories I am putting through my mouth is so huge, even the vomiting won't stop all the damage. And there is realy only ONE thing that I keep bingeing on... It used to be anything and everything (mostly junk), but over the last couple of months it has been one particular thing: Yoplait Le Rice (vanilla flavour) Puddings. I don't even know why! But I can't get enough of them!! I eat about 22 a day . I try to throw it all up, but I'm never sure it all comes out as rice is tricky . It has gotten to a point where I WEIGH my damn vomit to see if it matches what I just ate. Then I will keep on eating, and then purging, and then weighing... and the cycle continues. I am at my wits end . The amount of times I have promised myself that this is 'the last time' and 'tomorrow is a new day - you can beat this!' are just ridiculous. I know now that there is no such thing as 'one last time'. I just want to stop thinking about food! I have written this after a day of 22 rice puddings (along with a few bowls of ice-cream and some normal meals such as lasagne (with the requisite 800g salad)). That is not a normal day of food. None of it is normal. I just wish I was normal . Thank-you to whoever takes the time to read my sad little tale. I would love to hear about your experiences/weird obsessive quirks/recovery... anything! Instead of making some grand plan of attack (complete with meal plans and times etc etc), I am simply going to take tomorrow very slowly. Hour by hour... I can't think beyond that or the thought of no more damn rice puddings will drive me insane. I can't truly say, as I have never been addictedto cocaine or heroin, and don't want to undermine people who actually are addicted to these substances, but I feel as if I am truly in the throes of an awful addiction that is spiralling out of control. Food is my drug!"
"In the grips of bulimia Hi JulieDee, Sorry to hear you're having trouble with your food compulsions. For a while during my eating disorder all I would eat were bags of popcorn and veggie soup. They were my ""safe"" foods. Do you feel as though the salad & rice puddings have somehow been marked as safe in your mind? People did notice the amount of popcorn & soup I was buying as well and it was embarassing. Eventually my friends began to ask questions but my denial was so entrenched that I denied having a problem. At least you've already admitted that this is a problem. If you haven't done so already, I suggest you see a doctor about this. What you're describing sounds ritualistic beyond what most people with ED experience. You may have an anxiety disorder, such as OCD, that is manifesting itself in food rituals. Binge/purge cycles are really hard on the body too, so you'll want to get the doctor to check and make sure there aren't any urgent issues which need attention. Are you able to identify what is going through your mind if you aren't able to eat the rice pudding or salad? Recovery is always possible, so keep trying every day even though you feel it is ridiculous. One step at a time. Sometimes it seems like you're moving backward, but it's a process that does that before moving forward again. Take care, keep writing. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"In the grips of bulimia Oh Juliette, i so pleased you’ve written about it, and, i can definitely identify with your behaviours and “addiction”. You said you were overly aware of food from a young age. I too found that i took solace in food, eating to mute emotions that i wanted to hide and it was personal...not being confident in who i was; food was quiet, did not judge me and it seemed to comfort. Have you had any help with your relationship with food... it’s obviously distressing as you know that it is controlling you and impinging on your quality of living...? I find myself, like you needing something to watch, or read when i’m eating. The more i think about not doing it; thinking of it as bad the scarier it is not to. I basically live on fruit and vegetables and the odd bit of gestural carbohydrate and protein in between b/p-ing, anyway...if i can’t get, or don’t have access to fruit i go a bit mentally unstable...the overwhelming need to ‘correct’ it or i cannot do anything else. Conditioning, as it could be described. Food must fill about 80% of my thoughts which really could be filled with better things, particularly as that 80% is a repeat of a repeat of a repeat of a repeat... it is frankly insane. Living for merely brief moments of satisfaction with desperation and loneliness in between. Is the mind that tries to control what you eat and how you eat ever sorry for taking you away from the party or concerned about how you are experiencing life or say kind things about you... does it give you the support that you’d give to a friend... or the respect? Great that you’re going to approach your day hour by hour, remember this can be broken down further and you can restart your day whenever you want...the clock is only a guide for a bit of structure i suppose. I hope you can get some support, someone that can help you see the rational; your successes when you can’t, and help you keep yourself motivated when times feel sore. Big reassuring hug."
"Nervous about this post After years of battling with myself ...I cant do it alone anymore. I need some inspiration from people who know what I am going through. I am letting food rule my life...and to be specific...greasy, fatty food. During the day I eat three healthy, clean, home cooked meals. EVERY DAY I ski, snowshoe, go the gym, walk my dog. I lead a very fulfilled , happy life...during the day... At night the problem starts. As soon as dinner is cleaned up I crave grease. chips, dips, McDonalds...ANYthiNG FATTY! Im not even hungry. I hide food, sneak food, pretend i'm going to the store for milk and sit in the car and wolf down food so no one will know. If I try and go a few days without snacking at night i'm angry, snarky, pouty. In the day I daydream about what i can eat at night. If i cant get what i want im ready to cry. my lowest moment was two weeks ago. I had to sit for a neighbours child. The mother put out a few bowls of chips, cheeses and pretzels for me to snack on. I mean tiny bowls with just a handful of goodies. I went through her cabinets looking for the bags...I wolfed down food from the bags so it wouldn't look like i ate out of the bowls. WTF!!!! What is going on here??? i am 3o years old and food is controlling me and my mood"
"Nervous about this post Welcome to the forum The food addiction is serving some kind of purpose in your life. It could be to fill an emptiness, fill loneliness, or curb anxieties, it's doing something for you. Unfortunately it starts to harm as well. The reasons are different for everyone. Are you getting any kind of help for this? Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
"Nervous about this post thats what i dont understand... Im not anxious, nervous, concerned.... I really love my life. No i am not getting any help yet. Trying to figure this out on my own. I keep reading information on this...There is advice such as do yoga, exercise more, eat fruit, get a hobby. I do all of these things...I always have im just so frustrated"
"Nervous about this post It's great that you love your life and are happy If you don't feel this is a mental issue it could help to go see a doctor and have some tests run to make sure you don't have a physical condition that is causing you to binge. Hope you get some relief soon! Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota."
Internet addiction treatment and recovery One of my friend is addicted to internet. He have an habit to spend 10-12 hours on internet. His health condition is also going down and now he is suffering from many health problems. I have also seen some changes in his behavior. How can he cure his addiction of Internet. What type of treatment of most effective for Internet addiction
"Internet addiction treatment and recovery As compare to relative terms for example, if we compared to other addictions such as alcoholism and drug addiction, internet addiction is a very new phenomenon. The treatment can be effectively provided only after we identify the reason behind the increased internet usage; it may be depression or anxiety."
"Internet addiction treatment and recovery I'm addicted (or at least obsessed) with the internet at the moment. Partly to do with boredom, not working/studying, loneliness, social anxiety and low mood. There are times when I wasn't addicted: ~ when my computer had a virus and I couldn't go on the internet ~ when I was travelling abroad ~ when I was working ~ when I spend a lot of time with friends ~ when I was very busy and had other things to do I think getting hobbies which are more interesting than the internet can be helpful. Maybe planning to do something in life like working/studying/volunteering. Or thinking about the time wasted on the computer and how we only have one life?"
"I am a food addict! I'm gaining weight again. I went on 3 major diets in my life, and after the 3rd one, I am gaining weight. I lost 160 pounds the 3rd time. The most I ever lost on a diet. But I am pigging out again, I wish I can stop eating too much! I know why I overeat: Boredom. I eat to have something to do that makes me feel good, except when I am done eating, I want more! Then I feel guilty for eating so much. Disclaimer: Any advice or comments that I give are not meant to cause harm or upset anyone. And if it does, I apologize.

"I am a food addict! Hey! Is there anything else that you think you might enjoy doing? You have to change your lifestyle a bit, if you ask me. Maybe scheduling walks every day or a couple of hours when you'll just read might help, so you won't think about food so much. How about making a list of what you'll eat that day and trying to stick to it? forum-rules.php I am sorry I am not on the forum as much as I used to be, if I do not reply to you quickly, please contact another moderator/supermod/admin as well."
"I am a food addict! I recently realized that I had a food addiction. Ironically enough, it was while I was teaching a ladies addiction class in my church. I was listening to another kind of addict talk about how her addiction affected her, and I realized that in exactly the same ways, I was that way with food. Today I realized that I have to burn more than half a million calories to reach my goal weight."
"I am a food addict! Hi gang, I'm new to Psychforums message boards, but I have plenty of disorders! It's very nice to be able to talk with other folks who understand. I've been addicted to food since I was a kid. I started overeating to make myself feel better. I was depressed and very insecure. Of course as I got heavier I got teased and put down by other kids. In the 6th grade I decided to pretend I was sick (factitious disorder) so I wouldn't have to go to school. I pretended my stomach hurt. To keep up the pretense, I had to eat much less and ended up losing enough weight to be in the normal range. I was finally seen by a shrink (although I didn't know it he was a shrink), who told my parents there was nothing physically wrong with me and to make me go back to school. But he told my parents they may have trouble with me later on - but I didn't know he had said that. And I had lots of problems as a teenager, but that's another whole story. I'm a carb addict because carbs help release seratonin in the brain, which makes me feel a bit better. That's why they call food that's high in carbs ""comfort food"" - but it also packs on the pounds! I take an antidepressant, and have been doing so for many years. The bad news is that some antidepressants actually contribute to weight gain! But I don't think I can blame the one I'm taking. I just love carbs! I'm overweight at this point in my life (57 yrs old), but not obese. I'm trying to get back into the ""normal"" BMI for my age and height, but it's really hard. Now I'm losing my job, and I live alone so I really need to have a job. All that makes me want to eat even more!!"
I am a food addict! My friend was also suffering from food addiction. he had always interested in crispy and spicy dishes. After some times He realize that his weight is increasing and he is enable to stop eating such spicy foods. After that he had visit one counselor. But with the great combination of medicine and proper exercise helped him to come out of food addiction. You should also try this food addiction.
I am a food addict! Hey !! I guess everyone is foodie and it is good to be but everything done in certain way is good and beyound that. The addiction thing you are talking is also bad whether it is of food or drink or smoke .Every addiction effects in some or other way and here it is of food so you may gain moire weight r build some problems. I can suggest you to do some physical exercises which will solve your problem to some extent and another way is to keep yourself busy in some other work which may interest you so you may not get anytime to think about it.
"Addicted For Life All my life I have been addicted to two branches of the food world --- milk products and salt. I refuse to eat certain things unless they involve cheese or sour cream, and usually A LOT of cheese or sour cream. I will eat normal food if I have to, but when alone or when a type of food like tacos or pasta presents itself, I will make sure that I add at least four tablespoons of sour cream and two handfuls of cheese to what it is I'm eating. I'm addicted to the taste, I can't give it up...without the condiments, the food tastes disgusting! I've been eating way too much cheese and sour cream since I was a toddler, and still haven't given it up because I love it so much. I cannot tolerate low fat milk or sour cream. The lowest I ever go is 2%...otherwise it tastes gross. And taste means the world to me for some reason, like I actually want to ENJOY my meals... As for salt, I eat way too much chips than is good for me and also add sprinkles of salt to almost everything...I even add salt to my sour cream, that's how bad it is! I can go through a bag of chips that should last three days in two hours, because I just have to keep munching, it's like a need. But the problem is is I can't get away with it anymore. I've stayed slim my whole life eating an unholy amount of fat and salt...until now. Suddenly I'm gaining weight. I've gone from 159 to 170 in a half a years' time. The indulgence has to end but I have no idea how to make myself stop when I'm so in love with these particular tastes. Schizophrenia, Depersonalization Disorder, Manic Depression, Self Harmer.

"Addicted For Life Heya, The amount of weight we gain depends on your age and level of activity (amongst other things...). If you are going through puberty, then your body is still developing and it requires a lot of energy. equally, if you regularly exercise then your body needs the energy to not only carry out the exercise but also to repair itself afterwards. your eating behaviour come across as a little 'obsessive'... you feel that you have to eat certain things and that there are no other options. The truth is that there are countless other options and the best way to get through this is to replace what you currently eat with other things. For example, the salt that you use could be replaced woth something 'lighter' (pepper, basil, thyme, etc). The sour cream can equally be replaced with some other type of sauce that is much lighter. So, it's not about stopping eating what you're currently eating... ... it's about replacing it. Take care Kevin psychforums.com rules: http://www.psychforums.com/forum-rules.php Please send me a private message if you need help with anything."
"Addicted For Life Oh, thanks! I have replaced before, for example using another seasoning instead of salt, and I can see how replacing sour cream with another form of sauce could do wonders! Maybe I should experiment a little to find something I like that's not so fattening. However, I don't think i could ever replace the cheese in my life!

"Addicted For Life Well, as delicious as cheese is - in all its varieties - you could still aim to replace it with other things. My eating behaviuors are also addictive but I am capable of changing things. Equally, I am capable of telling myself to eat slightly less than I do if the addictions ever go out of control. Basil is my favourite herb, and I think that it would go very well with chips.

"Addicted For Life Food addiction is now a days very common and weight loss is the main cause of it. Eating unhealthy foods continuously is the main reason of food addiction. Eating only diet but healthy foods are very good for health and it can help to decrease the food addiction. Food addiction is can't cure immediately, it will take some time to recover. But concern your doctor before it will take the dangerous stage."
"what happened?? Hello to all, Unfortunately the society in the US (and maybe in other countries too I dont know) has based beauty upon how thin you are. I have fallen prey to this problem I suppose. I know I'm a bit young to be worrying about health issues but I do nonetheless. My senior year in high school was the best ever I guess because I was in the best shape of my life, or so I thought. I went from 145 pounds to 115 pounds over the summer break. I was/am a runner and had the best season in my six years of running. Everyone was amazed and proud at how good at running I became. Then, as the season was halfway through, I noticed that I still looked good in my opinion but was always tired and irritable. People started commenting on how ""thin"" I was and wondered if I was starving myself, which I wasn't ( I was eating six times a day!! though they were small snacks). Some said I ought to maybe eat more because I was coming up on having to stay over 110 pounds. I am about 5'5"" so that is considered almost underweight. I was worried about eating things with ""bad"" ingredients.... So what happened is that I DID start to eat more. I ended up running my best time at my last ever cross country meet and could have even gone faster! Then I joined powerlifting and then track for my last seasons. I kept gaining weight because I was eating more than I did. Then, it happened...I got injured halfway through track season and was confined to a bed for days and not able to run for weeks. All of that extra time was an incentive to eat more. Turns out, things have been getting worse since then. I struggle with the sport that I once loved and feel helpless about it. I hope I can get some support to regain my life once again and feel good about myself. Thanks from Texas, Oncearunner"
"what happened?? Hi, oceanrunner! You will find support here, you deserve it! Are you struggling with your sport because of your weight? Do you remember exactly what you used to eat before you started eating more? Maybe you could make lists of what you'll eat every day and concentrate on running more too, if it's possible. Or you could find a sport that's easier to do with your injury. This must be painful to go through, but you will get your life back! forum-rules.php I am sorry I am not on the forum as much as I used to be, if I do not reply to you quickly, please contact another moderator/supermod/admin as well."
"what happened?? I know this is an old post, but it reminded me so much of myself! I'm a swimmer. At one point I became anorexic, it wasn't after I swam I felt the effects. When I got to class I'd feel so dead, just EXHAUSTED. Now I'm over that, I regained my energy, personality, and now I beat some people in my lap swim group If you want to continue exercising, may I recommend swimming? Running is a hard-impact sport, but swimming is low-impact. In a matter of fact, a few people I know with physical disabilities use swimming as therapy."
what happened?? Weight is very serious problem but now a days it will become an easy with some weight loss pills but then also I always go with the natural remedies which shows the result without harm to your body. I thing swimming is also one of the best way for weight loss. Along with that you should plan about your diet or daily meal which will help you to live healthy but at the same time helpful for weight loss.
"Its so quiet in here WARNING: This is a very long (and probably somewhat confusing post). I completely understand that most people won't take the time to read the novel I just typed up, and I don't blame them one bit lol but if you do I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm surprised at the lack of activity in this particular forum. I got on the internet today to find a sort of support group when it comes to food addiction. This is the closest thing I could find, to my surprise. I just hope this forum is still active enough to provide what I'm looking for. I just recently discovered that I have a food addiction or binge eating or whatever you want to call it. It seems every site and specialist classifies it as something else. Basically i think about food 100% of the time. When I'm eating I think about what I'm, going to eat next. I binge eat in private; i.e. i eat a lot more when there's no one around. I never really feel full and I'm never hungry. I just obsess over food all the time. I can sit for hours debating on what to eat. When i finally, impulsively, choose something to eat i often times don't feel satisfied with my choice and eat whatever the other option was after finishing what i chose. I am on a fast track to death really, in the past 7 months I've gained 50 pounds. I've been on every diet you can think of. I do well on some of them for a short period of time but then i talk myself into a short of break (i.e. i can eat what i want on my birthday because hey, it's my birthday!) then I never get back on my diet. I'm weary about visiting a psychologist because they all want to classify and analyze me the same as everyone else. I mean maybe there is some underlying reason for why I am obsessed with food, maybe there is some traumatic thing that happened to me in my childhood that causes me to find comfort in food, but i just don't feel that that's the case. I do have some resentment towards my parents for certain things involving food or my weight but i don't feel like i eat when I'm sad or depressed or whatever feeling you want to insert. I just eat because I love eating. But I feel absolutely terrible about myself after I do eat. Until about 2 days ago i didn't know such a thing as a food addiction existed. When people hear the term eating disorder automatically what comes to mind is a super skinny girl that either doesn't eat at all or eats then purges. Which obviously isn't me. Funny enough what got me thinking about food addiction is watching the show Intervention (people addicted to drugs/alcohol or with an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia) I started paying attention to the basic principals they were teaching the individuals on the show and started applying them to myself and much to my surprise, they all fit! I had the same sort of behaviors as these meth addicts and alcoholics! (You know what i mean). But I felt crazy bringing this up to anyone. Trying to explain to someone that I needed the same sort of help as a heroin addict? Yea right. So I tried bringing this up to my mom (I'm 20 years old so she's still a big part of my support circle), not that I'm addicted to food, but that i needed some kind of help; that there's something that's just not right. But it was the same song and dance ""You just need to have some self control"" she said. Of course she didn't really know the extent of my binging seeing as I do most of it in private. So maybe, just maybe, she would help me if she knew. (Or at least i try to convince myself of that for my own emotional well being). That being said, I do have spurts of depression. Being a binge eater/food addict and not a bulimic makes me over weight, as you could have guessed. But i have been over weight me entire life. I think the last time i was at an average weight was when i was 5 yrs old. Every picture and memory i have after that age is of this over weight girl sticking out like a sore thumb. I try to blame my parents, asking myself why they let this happen (I mean I'm not cooking myself huge portions of food when I'm 6 years old ya know). But it's not their fault, they weren't forcing me to eat the amount that i have been since i was able to voice how much food I want. Anyways, back to my point, I have pretty low self esteem. I say pretty low because i am 100% confident in myself when it comes to brains and the like but I am so self conscious of my weight. I avoid people a lot these days because I'm afraid for people to see me, even my friends. Which only makes things worse because if i was out with people i wouldn't be eating! It seems like everyday i feel lower and lower. I'm at my largest right now so i don't have many clothes that fit anymore. Which makes me feel worse but I won't go shopping because that just results in me standing in the mall sobbing because nothing fits. I'm sorry if I'm getting off topic here I've just never talked about this before, it has all just been random thoughts inside my head. I just wish i knew why I'm obsessed with food. I don't want to be. It's like a switch in my head, as soon as the thought of eating enters my head I'm on a mission to get food as fast as i possibly can. Then after I'm finished I feel absolutely terrible. I mean i can be on my way to eat lunch and i will tell myself ""You are only going to get this, you aren't going to get more than you need. You are not going to over eat anymore"" but then as soon as i get there its like a different person enters me and i HAVE to eat as much food as i can. Its almost like I'm trying to fill myself with things i wont have in front of people. I will eat before I go eat with friends or family because i know I can't eat that much in front of people. I feel so ashamed about it. There's so much more I feel like I could add to this but I know this post is INSANELY long as it is and all over the place so I'll leave it as it is and hope someone will a) be willing to take the time to read it [If you do i thank you dearly] and b) understand the jumbled mess I've typed up lol"
"Its so quiet in here Firstly, brittcan, it's nice to meet you I am a fellow sufferer of BED and have an overwhelming food addiction. I know how you feel when you say that food is on your mind basically all the time. Sometimes I can stand there for a good 10 minutes deciding what to eat, and have the other thing afterwards anyway, because I wasn't satisfied with my choice. I can spend HOURS in a food shop. Being indecisive, telling my brain to say no. but it doesn't work. I read somewhere that food addiction is pretty much like another addiction like smoking. And it's a HARD to kick! Suffice to say - you are not alone and we can all fight this together. The fact that you have come on here, and searched for this means that you are one step closer It's good that you've typed up a lot of things whirling around in your head.. have you thought about seeing your GP maybe for a referral? Hope you're doing ok x"
Its so quiet in here Allibear is right. Food addiction is just like a drug addiction in which in early stages it is normal but after some time it will become very hard to cure. Many people are aware of it they ae addicted and they are enable to stop eating and they can also suffer with weight loss problem. It is better to visit any consultant at early stages of food addiction.

But more importantly, what is making you do this? do you feel your body isnt what you want it to be? sports?depression?

I had a good life but i still ended up ruining it on drugs. addiction isnt one of rational behavior, but mostly irrational behavior. but what is behind that addiction?addictions are usually the result of something else. if i slap someone, I had a reason. i didnt just slap them cause i slapped them. I either wanted to pick a fight, I didnt like what they said, I have nerve issue where i cant control my arm, or i didnt like the way they looked. Regardless there was a reason besides ""i dont know"". why did you start the your first ever bulimia action? I was addicted to drugs because i wanted to change myself. I wasnt happy with how i was. Keep looking and find out why you like eating, besides i just like eating. is it comforting to you? are you trying to self-destruct yourself? eating away abuse or something else in your past? are you insecure about your body image(you feel this is the onl way to keep weight off)? do you get a thrill out of it? you could always try a therapist if your willing.

"bulimia?! need someone to talk to Bulimia is one of the most dangerous type of Food Addiction. This is just like a eating disorder in which the person binge eats. You can recover from bulimia, but it may be a very long and hard process. There are number of treatment centers are available to treat Bulimia."
"Hi, my name is Sara, and I am a food addict. Well, I am finally going to admit this to myself, and the world. I am a food addict. It all started as a child. I was not fat, but somehow, everyone starting acting as if I was. I started skating around the same time and perhaps, was a little chunkier than the other kids (10 lbs more) and people went crazy. Suddenly I was on a diet. This of course, just made me look for any opportunity to eat more. But still I skated so much.. I wasn't that fat. I was about 20 lbs more than the other kids. At the same time I had a very self esteem trying thing, a backbrace. It is amazing I am not a serial killer given what I went though with that... but, still it made food.. the easiest and most normalizing things. When I was 18 I stopped skating, went to college, and got the brace off. I went wild. Doing exactly what I wanted, and I would have kept doing that too but I realized I had streach marks. I put the breaks on and started dieting but I was never able to lose the weight all the way. Thus began a 20 year up and down and obsession with food. Dieting, not dieting, thin, not thin. Finally recently I got down to the closest point yet... 48 lbs gone. Until I just couldn't get down there, not to the point I wanted to be. And I boomeranged back up 40 lbs. The slide began long before this, but recently I lost both my parents and now... literally my life revolves around work and food. And there is some part of me that doesn't want to be denied anymore, denied anything, eating until I am sick, eating when I feel like what I feel like. - when I can't go to lunch on time at work I get insane. - I hired someone to run my errands because I didn't have the food I wanted in the house - I spend my weekend thinking of what else I can eat - every monday I start a diet and that lasts until 12 noon - I don't do any exercise I work the drug and alcoholics and now, I really am starting to see that I don't have control over my life... food does. Food tells me when to get up, allows me to survive work, is on my mind 50% of the day. It is, my life. I haven't had a life in 20 years.. it has been on hold due to my battle with food. At least the first step is accepting you don't have control.. that is something I have never admitted until now."
"Hi, my name is Sara, and I am a food addict. congratulation. that is the first step. But all i can say is that you need to come to terms with yourself. You cant let other people dictate how you feel about yourself. You will have to come to terms with yourself, that you are beautiful regardless of what others say. Since you have realized you have a problem, you could try talking to a therapist and see if they will be able to help you overcome whatever is making you overeat. I wish you the best of luck and hope you are able to overcome this. This sloth doesn't understand the statement. --Zausel, Camelidae requested. ""But who prays for Satan?

"Food addiction. No posts??? I'm really really surprised about this, and at the same time I'm not. I've looked up over eating websites, and I'm afraid I haven't found much. On the other hand, I have found quite a bit about anorexia and the like. Are we really that scared to talk about the compulsion to eat excessively? I KNOW I am not the only one out there that struggles with this. I've have overcome addiction before. I used to smoke pot night and day, I used to smoke cigarettes, and I used to be hooked on prescription meds too. But overeating.... I'm still addicted to that. It really is hard. I mean ...you can put down a pipe, a cigarette, or a pill, and never pick it up again without having to worry that you might die...even if it feels like you're going to. But food... we need it to live! We use it for entertainment! There are holidays dedicated to preparing it , and pictures of it everywhere! Why doesn't anyone talk about this unless they are selling some weight loss ""secret"" or showing off their before and after photos? I'm glad they finally see it as a physical illness, and have surgeries to help people correct it... but what about those of us that don't want to go under the knife, but feel that some support would do us some good? I don't know.. it seems that people are trying to hide ...and that is sad to me. My heart is an open book"

"Food addiction. No posts??? I once went on one of those all natural diets where all you can eat are whole grains, vegetables, and organic foods. I thought that doing this would give me more leeway with the amount of food I could eat. But....I ended up addicted to avacados, and would eat one every day. Apparently that wasn't good, because I gained a LOT of weight. Now I eat whatever I wantwith the occasional binge, and I have manged to maintain my weight without gaining any more. I just need to know how to stop binging! Stress reduction helps a little.. so do digestive enzymes, and chromium, multi-vitamins, and drinking lots of water. I'm not binging as often as I used to.. now it's only once a month or so....could be hormonal. My heart is an open book"
"Could use some friendly advice Hi all, This is my first time posting on this forum, but I am a little torn, and only fellow food addicts could understand or give me practical solutions to this problem. I have been a food addict since I was 14 when my mother committed suicide. I have had some really hard years including a few short (luckily) bouts with bulimia. For the last month I have actually been doing really well. I am feeling more mentally healthy than ever before, and since my mind has been so clear I have been able to eat healthier and stick to a workout routine. Though I am moving slow in weight loss progress I am finally starting to feel like I have control again. Enter my problem. My husband wants to go up to visit his family this holiday weekend (its about a 6 hour drive). We will already be visiting them next weekend for his Sister's wedding, but since a whole bunch of family from Alaska is in town he (and I) really want to see them as much as possible and go both weekends. Because of this I have started to have severe anxiety. His family are big social eaters (and drinkers) and at this early stage in my recent mental health I don't feel mentally strong enough to attend a big event without bingeing and ruining all my progress. We are already committed to the wedding, but two events, two weeks in a row is giving me anxiety attacks. Luckily my husband is the most wonderful man on the planet, and I told him how I was feeling and he totally understood and said it would be fine if we stayed home and went to the wedding only. Now I am having major guilt because he was willing to give up something so important to him so I could continue with my healing ... which makes me want to go to see his family even more because he deserves so much to be with them. I have told him to go without me, but he doesn't want to. It's almost like I am an alcoholic and I've been sober for only a month, and all of a sudden something really important to my husband is taking place in a bar. Do you guys have any suggestions? As for the moment we aren't going. I have came up with many ways that I could practically prepare myself so I don't run into any sticky situations (packing my own snacks and fruit for the trip, making sure to walk every day, excusing myself when drinking is present, etc.) however, I don't feel that I have any practical ways to prepare emotionally, which is why I am so scared. I know exactly how to eat healthy ... that has never been the problem ... my emotions and social pressures are the problem. What do you think? Do I stay at home with my supportive husband ... or be the supportive one and go with him? If I go with him how do I make sure I don't ruin all my great progress and physically and emotionally binge? Do I stay home and play it safe or go and test my willpower?"
"Could use some friendly advice Gee that is a tough one! It is great that you husband is so supportive of you... I personally have less of a tendency to binge when I'm surrounded by loads of nice food and lots of thin people eating small portions... Can you identify your triggers for binging? Is it the fact that there will be a lot of food there? Are his family big eaters? Will they be pressuring you to join them? If you went (hypothetically) would you want to eat the food that they have there? I feel like I need a bit more info from you so that I know what you are like a bit better before giving you advice. I think eating disorders seem to have very unique effects on each person. Each person seems to be triggered by different things for example... In a way, I am not defined by my dissociation. In a way, I am. FORMER admin moderator. For current list please see: forum rules and list of active mods"
"Could use some friendly advice Thanks for your reply! My husband's family is the typical southern ""eating"" family. They are big eaters and all functions are centered around food, which is part of the reason why I am so indecisive. For me, all food is a trigger, so it is a constant battle. I have found in the past that when everyone is eating I will let myself binge because I am disguised and it doesn't look out of place. I think about food all day, everyday, so it is an ongoing battle for me to moderate myself and eat healthy. Fortunately, I have been doing SO well lately, better than ever, which is why I am so nervous to possibly set myself up for failure and have to pick up the pieces all over again. I have trouble with support from my side of the family because it doesn't look like I have a food addiction, so when I try to talk to them about it they don't really take me seriously. I am not horribly overweight (only about 20 pounds or so) and I actually am pretty healthy, but my mind is sick. My mind has the disorder. I have used food as a drug since I was 14 ... but many people just don't believe me because I am not 90 pounds or 300 pounds. My husband is so wonderful and supportive, but as much as I would like not to admit it, this issue seriously affects our relationship. I would love for him to see me one day as a woman ""untormented"" by food. He thinks about me in every food decision he makes, which is SO thoughtful, but I don't want him to have to. Logically I know it's just food, he knows it's just food ... but even the thought of bringing a trigger food within 100 feet of me can make me panic that I might lose my progress. (When I refer to progress, I mean mentally) I am also going through therapist withdrawals because my husband and I just moved to a new state so I had to leave my amazing shrink behind. I am looking for a new one now, but I think this adds to the reason as to why I am so jumpy and nervous about going. I think the problem is that I have failed so many times. I usually had a short-lived success before each failure, but this time is different. I feel SO good, and I am actually backing up my words and living life like I want to, and I have been reaping the rewards like I never have before. I know that at some point I will have to venture out and test the water to see if my resolve is as good as it feels, but I am nervous that it is too soon. I hope this wasn't too ""ranty"" and gives you enough extra info. As of right now we decided not to go to his family's for the 4th (although we will still be going up there next weekend for the wedding) so though the immediate threat is gone, we will still see them very soon. How do I emotionally prepare and keep my mind in a healthy state?"
"Binge eating accompanied with chain smoking and alcoholism A pack of cigs and a case of beer are great, but even better and almost neccesary on a full stomach. Luckily im still young, in shape, and highly capable. Its depressing that aside from my addictions and the repercussions of them im only feeling good when completely indulged in stuffing my face. I cant quite quit the three though I hate indulging and aspire for a healthy in shape body void of fast food and excess fats/sugars. Is there a correlation regarding eating accompanied by drinking and smoking which in combination prohibit goals of a healthy lifestyle?"
"Binge eating accompanied with chain smoking and alcoholi Hey! Since you really like all three of them, maybe they're making you even more addicted.

"Gastric Bypass and Food Addiction December 23, 2010 I had gastric bypass surgery, I was 18 years old and 350lbs. Thankfully everything went really well, and I have had no complications since then. It has been a little under 9 months and I have recently hit my 100lb weight loss. Normally this would be a cause for celebration, but right now I am scared shitless. my surgery may have changed my body, but not my addiction to food. I have stretched my stomach out and am now able to eat large amounts of food. I am so scared, I CANNOT gain the weight back, not only for health reasons, but because I am a 19 year old female, and have not gotten to fully experience life or the true joys of living yet. I am literally so scared and I don't know what to do, how to combat my addiction, and maintain/continue weight loss. Please someone help me."
"Gastric Bypass and Food Addiction Hi! Please ask your doctor where you can find some therapy to help with your addiction. Maybe there are centers for people who have food addiction in your area too, where you can find support groups and counselors. You shouldn't have to go through this alone, it must be scary. You could make a list of reasons why you want this to stop, a nice reminder for yourself and maybe keep things that remind you of the life you want to have with you at all times too. Try to reply eating with something else, have something to do when you get the urge to eat too much. forum-rules.php I am sorry I am not on the forum as much as I used to be, if I do not reply to you quickly, please contact another moderator/supermod/admin as well."
Help! Ex NFL player! Dont know where to start.......But I know I need help! I find myself eating about 10 times a day and cant seem to stop. I am an ex NFL Player and have always been big. ( 6'4 290 playing weight ) Now I am about 330 and it has no end in sight. I own a grocery store and we are Very well known for high end meats and bbq. I cant stay away from sampling everything. I have everything I need at the tip of my fingers to keep me healthy but I still eat the bbq and go out to fast food or people come and want to take me to lunch. I have as of latley stopped working out as well. 80-100 hr work weeks seem to take the energy right out of me. Im just looking for tips to try and get back on track. I will never be a small guy. Last dec I got my body fast measured and they said if I got down to 7% body fat I would be 260 lbs. So I know im never gonna be small again I just want to be able to see my abs again and stop eating so much. I also just got married and my wife is having the same problem. She is about 5'11 145 and shes at about 170 right now.
"Help! Ex NFL player! Hi, dlm8383! Well, you could look into losing weight on sites that help you figure out how many calories certain foods have and how many calories you should have every day so that you lose weight. I heard that you're supposed to eat about 1500 if you're a woman and maybe 1600-1700 if you're a guy (I'm not sure though) per day, no more, and work out a few times a week. Apparently cardio like running or jogging is good and 30 minutes of jogging burn about 200 calories so you could try doing it about 4 times a week. But if you're out of shape right now, you could try walking for 30 minutes every day, walk to the store, go for walks in your lunch break, maybe walk to work if it's possible. That way, you'll slowly get in better shape and train your body for working out. And remember to eat less calories every day. You can still eat food you like, but control the calories, figure out how small your portions have to be. There are sites that help you find out how many calories a certain food or product has per 100 grams, I think, google it. I think making a list of what they plan to eat every day or of what they ate and figuring out how much more they can have helps people with eating problems and people who want to lose weight too. forum-rules.php I am sorry I am not on the forum as much as I used to be, if I do not reply to you quickly, please contact another moderator/supermod/admin as well."
"Help! Ex NFL player! I know how you feel... I can't stop eating. I joined a gym and can't stop... If you can isolate WHY you're eating, it helps. I eat when I'm sad, bored and stressed out... not really ever because I'm hungry... I don't give myself much of a chance to GET hungry... If you isolate the WHY you can determine HOW you can avoid eating. Takes some practice... I'm still working on mine... And you will fail the first couple of times.

Since before my coke addiction, or cigarettes or weed (which doesn't really help the food addiction, huh?) or anything.

Know what I mean? You HAVE to eat... so you can't just break the addiction like cigarettes or something... I love food... I hate food...

"*triggering image* Me & My Addiction Hi Smile, Glad to see you opening up. Don't take me altering your thread title personally. But I saw the casserole dish and wow, that looks good. Like, TOO good. I had to grin @ the ""cold turkey"" comment. I'm gonna be honest: I can't relate. I mostly avoid things and consciously starve myself of a lot of things. One of those things used to be food. ...Actually, I CAN relate. When I would myself in one area of my life, I would binge in another. For example, while I was busy controlling food, I would binge on cigarettes and clothes. While I was working on stopping my sexual anorexia, I suddenly (and compulsively!) started to control money instead. Binging and control are related in the sense that they are both replacements for something bigger. So the question is: what are you trying to ""fill""? You mentioned feeling empty, emotionally. What's missing? --Frayed Do not take my advice before talking to your doctor/counselor/other professional. Depending on where you live, you may be able to find free, confidential care.

"*triggering image* Me & My Addiction I'm not sure what I'm missing... I mean I can speculate... I have an empty place where a father should be... that started when I was 2 and then got filled by 2 people and then the fillers died in rapid succession... I have an empty space where confidence should be... I'm unsure of everything I do unless I'm doing something for someone else... I have some empty space where my ""useful"" gene should be... I constantly need to be useful... I have to do things for people... all the time... or I'm useless and I can't deal with that... I learned eating to fill the emptiness from my mom. She was so depressed when I was younger... like middle school to high school... It's a bad day when your 10 year old looks at you and say that you remind her of the paxil commercial. I don't fault her, though. She did what she could alone and with what we had. I was always a happy kid, just liked to eat... I dunno.... Sorry about the triggering image...

I have a difficult time maintaining friendships that aren't based on therapy, usefulness or entertainment...I have a hard time just enjoying someone's company. I feel a compulsion to listen to them, encourage them, feed them, make them laugh, etc. An amazing thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago: I had a friend and her boyfriend over for game night. It was awesome. I was actually able to enjoy Monopoly for the sake of playing it! I don't know how I did it. I think it starts with defining what I want. What *I* want. It took me a long time to realize that by constantly trying to be useful, I was actually constantly justifying my own existence. Well, I've got the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness just as much as any other person. The U.S. Declaration of Independence is an empowering document, specifically in a personal sense. You know, the other day I finally took a shower for ME, for the first time in months? Not because my being clean would be useful to someone else (like if my fiance wanted to get intimate, or the cashier at the checkout line would think I smelled nice), but because I enjoyed the shower. It hit me several months ago: I didn't know what was ""fun and comforting"" for me. For you, it sounds like food. So I figured it out. I made a list of things that I actually like. And it started to fill that emptiness. I've lost people who were ""fillers"", too. Those people made it easy to be myself. Fortunately, I've found my fiance--but the most important thing was learning how to be my own mentor...how to be USEFUL TO MYSELF. --Frayed Do not take my advice before talking to your doctor/counselor/other professional.

"*triggering image* Me & My Addiction Actually I super hate food. I like looking at food, though. I only eat because the bf makes me, at this point. I used food so much to try and fill the empty space that I got tired of eating. It sparked a strange thing... if I go without eating, I get less hungry. As soon as I eat, I get super hungry, though, which makes binging a real problem. My things are reading... stars... roller derby (watching not play, cuz I can't skate only rollerblade)... I'm slowly incorporating these things into our lives, now that I'm fairly sure he's not going anywhere... I'm not sure how much he's enjoying them, though. Seems I may have to get him accustomed to it. The only thing he's enjoyed, for sure, is going to the gay club. He likes to see how many numbers he can get, how many guys buy him a drink... it's funny. I go after the lesbian and we compare who got more at the end of the night. So fun! Anyway... I dunno... As my life goes on I'm less sure of who I am everyday... I'm more stable, but less sure of myself...

"*triggering image* Me & My Addiction food. Addicts can go from a period of completely indulging their addictions to a sort of anorexia from them. And then the cycle continues again. If you don't eat for a period of time, your body goes into ""starvation mode"" and starts building up fat...sometimes digesting muscle. Been there...not a pretty sight. The stomach shrinks, all kinds of bad $#%^ happens. So when you start eating again, your body is like, ""Oh, there's food available? Better stock up now."" So, yeah...the best thing to do is plan out small meals. I know myself well enough now that I sometimes just munch on oyster crackers just to keep food in my system. I never thought I was fat; I just had control issues. I'm getting better by the day, though. stability/identity. When I became more stable, which meant that I stopped constantly living in ""crisis mode"", it became pretty clear to me that I didn't have a really good sense of who I was without that ""crisis mode."" Right now, there's no immediate, looming need for me to fill a specific role. So for a while, I was lost. My brain doesn't have the fight-or-flight response to which I have become accustomed. Now it's a matter of learning to live with that. Goes back to ""feeling useful."" I'm talking with my counselor about it. I'll probably talk more about it tomorrow when I see her. I hope this helps for now. Kick-ass hobbies, by the way. --Frayed Do not take my advice before talking to your doctor/counselor/other professional.

"Difference between BED and Addiction? Out of curiousity, I wanted to ask this question. What is the difference between Food Addiction and Binge Eating Disorder? Technically speaking both could be viewed to mean the same thing. Or maybe the distinction is that one is a constant and emotion based and the other can come and go and is based on chemical triggers...? I find that I don't think about food all the time, I've slowly learnt not to 'obsess' over it. However, even if I eat a piece of lettuce out of place it could 'set me off' to enter a trance of eating, eating, eating and not being able to stop even when I can't physically move anymore because I'm so bloated. I know I have a direct addiction to sugar and white processed carbohydrates (think freshly baked white bread...) - so I've learned to accept that I just can't have these things ever again because with them my life is harder and actually DOES become 'Tunnel Visioned' on food. Without these I can control myself a little better - instead bingeing on lettuce and vegetables - I find I eat when I'm stressed, bored, depressed, happy or as a coping mechanism when I'm severely distressed. So for me it's all - chemical and emotion based. ... Would I then have both? O.o I dunno, I would like to hear some opinions on the difference between Addition and BED. ...Be patient... ...I must keep reminding myself of this... ~Tool."
"Difference between BED and Addiction? I think that this is the first post I'll have replied to in the Food Addiction forum. In my opinion, there is a distinction between the two. BED is about eating when you are stressed, depressed, etc - it's 'comfort eating'. However, a person with a food addiction might not necessarily be depressed when they eat food. Just like any other addiction, they just do it because they cannot get the thought of food from their minds. In BED, food isn't always on the person's mind though - only when they feel sad/depressed does the thought of food come. That's my perception...

Could the two be linked in any way? Because I often feel I have elements of both, addiction and BED.

"Difference between BED and Addiction? You're making sense indeed, but i'd go further to say that all eating disorders are there-or-thereabouts the same.

However, going back to what you're talking about, I do agree that Food Addiction and Binge Eating Disorder are similar. It's complex to explain in words, but I know that I understand it in my head... if that makes sense. I've been through it all. psychforums.com rules: http://www.psychforums.com/forum-rules.php Please send me a private message if you need help with anything."
"Difference between BED and Addiction? In my opinion, I suffer from both. I binge eat under stress and anxiety... But I'm addicted to food in the sense that if I'm not hungry or stressed out, but something I like eating is around... I'll eat it... I'll eat it until I can't cram anymore down my gullet and I'm physically ill... I battle food... and yet it comforts me... It's friend and foe... It's the Magneto to my Professor Xavier... (if you're an Xmen geek you'll get that) It's my love-hate relationship from hell... crimsonandclover wrote: Sometimes the greatest source is from within.

"Gotta Quit Caffeine!! Help!! I have quit so many times! And I'm trying to loose weight got about 25lbs to shed. I found that I CANNOT loose weight no matter what I do if I am drinking caffeine! I drink it for the kick, the taste, (love coffee) but mostly the lift I get cuz I have battled ADD, depression, food addiction (mostly sugar and fats), and it seems to lift me temporarily. But thats the key, only a temp!! It spikes my blood sugar and I CRAVE food 10X worse especially the bad foods. Its the ""fight or flight"" thing! I have quit before for 9 months and lost all the weight. I have satrted to decrease my AD med too cuz my therapist is really getting me thru some tough Dissociative issues. Wow, has that been an experience! But I'm ready to quit caffeine, I just am looking for mothers that have done it or a support system, its so ahrd doinbg it alone!!! I so need your help!! Please!!! Thank you!! Dijoy"
"Gotta Quit Caffeine!! Help!! Hi Dijoy, I love the taste of coffee too. But caffeine seems to affect me strongly, and I end up not being able to get to sleep all night. Thn I feel like I need coffee the following day because I'm tired! What kind of coffee do you have? My suggestion: get rid of all your nice coffee. Buy the cheapest, nastiest instant coffee that they have at the supermarket. Make that the only coffee you're allowed. (So if you really need it, it's there.) Buy yourself some really nice teas. There are lots of delicious herbal teas. Find some you like. Then when you're craving caffeine, you'll have to choose between that nasty instant coffee that doesn't taste very good and mucks up your day, and the yummy teas that are good for you. It makes it easier for me to kick the habit. (Although I still love a strong black coffee now and then. ) No diagnosis, lots of opinions, and a bunch of issues that I haven't quite figured out."
"Gotta Quit Caffeine!! Help!! Thx Platypus, Yes I have got some alternatives and to slowly detox off. I dont drink alot except for tues and thurs when Im at work all day. Its there, freshly brewed and if I have any down time its even more tempting. Plus I use the powdered creamer which I know is bad, and sweeten it with stevia. At home when I need the caffeine I try to use Yerba Mate tea which does have caffeine but its much healthier for the body. Or I have green tea bags on hand too. Those are all the lesser of the evils but coffee is the worst for me. I'm just gonna have to bite the bullet and let it go completely. It makes me impatient, volitle, irritable and Im a single mom now raising a 13 and 11 yr old, Lord knows I need to deal with them the right way and not be constantly yelling at them Thanks so much for your help! Dijoy"
"Blech! I have a food addiction. I use it when I am bored, lonely, sad, mad, happy, etc. I eat constantly. I eat when I am not hungry. I eat when I am full. I eat when I am uncomfortably full. I have tried to make myself throw up and I can't. I get so f*cking mad at myself for not being able to throw up after I eat. I view myself as a failure. I also cannot starve myself. I try and try and try to say no to food and I can't. I f*cking hate myself for not having control over something so simple as food. Can you help me remember how to smile? Make it somehow all seem worthwhile. www.bewaretherants.blogspot.com"
"Blech! Mommy_dearest, you shouldn't try to throw up or starve yourself. Have you tried making a list of what you'll eat that day and doing your best to stick to it? Find something that distracts you, anything not related to food. forum-rules.php I am sorry I am not on the forum as much as I used to be, if I do not reply to you quickly, please contact another moderator/supermod/admin as well."
"Blech! Hi Mommy dearest Count your blessing that your body and subconscious mind knows better than to let you starve yourself or throw up. You may not see so now but believe me you don't want to end up with bulimia or anorexia. If you think things are hard to control now, getting either of them will just add to your problem not make it any better. It seems honey that your have B.E.D Binge Eating Disorder and the only way to recover from that is to get specialised treatment. I would strongly recommend that you see a counsellor. I did and its helped change my life. Try not to be too hard on yourself. At the end of the day its just food. You're still a good person, you haven't hurt anyone or done anything wrong so please stop beating yourself up. Good luck!!!!!! Emer xxxxxxxxxxxx"
"Blech! Hi there. Have you ever thought of your feelings as hole your trying to fill with something comforting? If so, what would that hole be caused from? Often we use food as comfort. It feels warm and nurturing. Something we need and if it is lacking we crave. If we get to the painful thoughts behind those feelings and learn to understand and heal them, food no longer needs to be the solution. Your hurting very deeply and them feeling guilty for trying to make it stop. I think your looking for healing-its just not going to be food that helps though. You need to comfort the old injuries directly. One thing that helped me connect with that dark place was a letter. I said something like this: One, I know you hurt so much and no one understands I know that you just want to feel loved and safe I know you need to feel valued and beautiful You have not been given what you deserved THEY were wrong, not you. You deserve comfort and peace now I am on your side now I am the adult who will care for you You-the younger in me, need me the older to be strong to help you I will no longer treat you pain as an enemy I will listen to you and we can cry and grow together I will begin now to choose the best for us and not the least \ I could go on but you get the idea. Perhaps speaking to your inner pain like this will help. I hope so. For what ever you are carrying, you can choose to let it go and move forward. It can be done. It takes time, mistakes, binges etc, but slowly loving yourself will help that pain go away. With Hope, One Two men looked through bars. One saw Mud, the other saw Stars."
Food & Sex Addiction Has anyone come across someone whom also included both into their addiction. I know that I have had both addictions fire at the same time. Is it that different to use food as an object which later we would both eat. Would like to hear about others and what they did too. Airplane

"Another link for NPD... Hello, I just joined, as I am married to an NPD. You've got a lot of great sites, but here's one that is a must. It is one site that is just as informative for mental health providers as it is for people who know or live with a NPD or even for the NPD person themselves. My husband found out about this site from a book he bought (he was recently diagnosed as NPD) called Malignant Self Love, by Sam Vaknin. http://samvak.tripod.com/ I hope this helps, Donnie"
"Links For Narcissistic Personality Disorder As a warning to all those that see mental health matters at the top. It's full of Sam Vatniks ramblings. Steer clear of it for NPD issues. Or if you decide to go please remember his ""doctorite"" is from a degree mill, and in Philosophy. Because here the victims become the monsters and need the help."
"Links For Narcissistic Personality Disorder Anything written by Sam is a waste of time. He made some weird video some time ago, in which he made an ass out of himself. Okay, I have a serious question. A bunch of the sites posted were for family/gf/etc, Sam=(not worth your time), and general stuff you could probably find just googling. I'm new and I've noticed that over 4/5ths of the threads follow similar trends. If you're the narc, and I am, what's in this site for you? There aren't any threads, posts, etc that actually cover HOW TO MANAGE this thing. Is there anything anywhere that actually covers this?"
"Links For Narcissistic Personality Disorder I like how all of the above posters discredit Sam. His mental maps and ""ramblings"" actually make 100% sense to me. I can follow them and am constantly surprised at how accurate they are. The difference between low and high functioning narcissists, self-awareness included. ""The human must become an artist, and his art is his own view of life and of himself. He must create value for himself to fill the void that the intrinsic lack of value leaves."" - Nietzsche"
"Links For Narcissistic Personality Disorder Sam Vaknin is not a narcissist, his degree is fake, and much of what he says about himself is a lie. These are all facts. They do not, however, change the fact that much of what he's written about narcissists is true and remarkably accurate. He's quite perceptive and you don't actually need a doctorate to understand people (especially since anyone competent enough to get a doctorate in a real field would never get one is psychiatry)."
"Difference between narcissism and NPD? What distinguishes a narcissistic person from someone who has NPD? Is it based on the number of diagnostic criteria that a person meets? Or is it a matter of severity? At what point does narcissism become a personality disorder? Is it black and white, or are there people in between who are sort of halfway there?"
"Difference between narcissism and NPD? Those with NPD are quite a bit different than plain old narcissists. Some easy ways to differentiate.. NPD - Lacks empathy - sees no wrong in personally attacking others, or completely ignoring you - Being told ""no"" comes off as a personal attack - Is oblivious to his own disorder - Treats others as sub-human, but sees it as ""they way it should be"" - Has few friends - Is asocial when no attention from others is available Basically, NPD is narcissism in all aspects of life - it is all pervasive. It is woven into the personality of the individual, and no amount of love or introspection can change their own opinion about their god-like self. Yes, people can have it worse than others. Narcissism (most all college kids) is very common, especially in fields like law and business. NPD however, is quite unique. Some will argue NPD is on a spectrum with psychopathy, the psychopath being ""very narcissistic"". But i understand why you ask.. NPD is very hard to spot. They are slick, kind, charming, whatever they need to be to get you to respect them. Your average narcissist will look like an a$$hole standing next to someone with NPD who is trying to make a good impression. Most with NPD do not come out from behind the mask until they are very close to you. They guard their inner world every second of every day. They are directing a movie in which they are the lead actor and the director. They manipulate their words, emotions, and thoughts in order to create a self that is ideal. They are utterly fake, but do not even know it. You will never see what is inside of them, until they act out in such a way that contradicts all that you thought they stood for.

"Difference between narcissism and NPD? My Username wrote: Some will argue NPD is on a spectrum with psychopathy, the psychopath being ""very narcissistic"". NPD and psychopathy are quite distinct. Psychopathy is about a total lack of prosocial emotions (emotional empathy, guilt, remorse, altruism) as well as secondary features such manipulativeness and inpolsiveness. NPD is mostly about the egotism being completly obssesed and in love with themselves, being unable to admit inperfections, they also may lack empathy and be manipulative."
"Difference between narcissism and NPD? To clarify if you're talking about narcissism as a personality trait i.e. ""grandiosity"" I think that conversation has been done 100 times over, lol. Though if you're talking about narcissistic defence mechanisms, personality structure, or ""narcissistic disorders"" they come in many shapes and forms not all of which might tend to attract the NPD label. Some might be considered to be covered better by other PDs, some might tend to fall under NPD."

This should be required reading for everyone who wonders about Narcissism. Two of the biggest myths about NPDs are 1) that NPDs are just selfish, spoiled people who don't think of you because they're selfish and spoiled, and 2) that NPDs are totally awesome people who are so rich, handsome, and lucky that their lives have been a cakewalk and they like to lord it over everyone else. The truth is far different. Most NPDs aren't going to be identified as a man-child throwing a temper tantrum, or as a rich, handsome guy talking about how awesome he is. True Narcissism is something that afflicts an individual from the inside. The NPD is not just someone spoiled, shallow, and vain, it's someone tortured on the inside by lifelong fear, and by an unyielding superego. The NPD is more likely to be the middle-aged chubby guy in the board room than the hot movie star. The NPD's actions are motivated by his own internal torture, and they come out in ways that are subtle so that they remain unidentified by most people. That's why so many people are turned into emotional wrecks by NPDs. If the NPD was just a silly overgrown spoiled child, they wouldn't have the ability to do the real psychological damage that they do. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb5dEtNIKZk"

Everyone sort of ends up in fly under the radar mode."
"Difference between narcissism and NPD? 2 main messages I got from that post: ""people with NPD are not successful showoffs who everyone hates, they're more likely to not fulfil their potential and may be none of the things they see themselves as. they're tortured inside, they're damaged people"" ( NPD is not about those people you can't stand - these people are not spoilt children they are genuinely deeply damaged .) And ""a spoilt child wouldn't be able to create that kind of damage!"" ( People with NPD are superior at manipulation. The spoilt child is too inferior for NPD .) Is anyone potentially afraid of being (or being seen as) that spoilt child? Has anyone been treated as if they were a spoilt child if they ever tried to get recognised/validated/praised, etc. ? If anyone is, being afraid of being that way or being seen that way doesn't mean that you are like that btw. The same way being afraid of being a histrionic wouldn't make me one."

If anyone is, being afraid of being that way or being seen that way doesn't mean that you are like that btw. The same way being afraid of being a histrionic wouldn't make me one. Most Narcissists, I suspect, rarely have their feelings validated. Narcissists wallow in self-pity. Every slight, every bruise, everything that's happened in our lives that fell short of perfection, or that's left us less happy than we could be, is something that we ruminate on and voice our displeasure about. What if I had talked to the girl at the subway? What if I had gone out with the prom queen? What if I had majored in this subject instead of in that subject? What if I made more money? These are things that Narcissists will frequently complain about, and of course very few people are going to validate all of these complaints. Others will simply call the Narcissist a whiner, or someone who thinks the world owes him something. The Narcissist, then, is used to not having his feelings validated by others. This begins at such an early age that it's nothing new to the Narc. But it will never change the Narc's mind. The Narc will continue to believe that he is owed everything that he's ever wanted and more, and will dismiss the opinions of those who refuse to validate his feelings and devalue them immediately. It's important to understand the role that other people play to the Narcissist. They are other objects and nothing more. When they get in his way of what he wants, they are like a vending machine that swallowed his quarters. The Narc will ""shake the vending machine,"" so to speak, in order to get what he wants, i.e., manipulate those around him without concern for them. The Narcissist, of course, needs other people to praise him, admire him, respect him, have sex with him, or do other things to feed his ego and give him supply. But that should not confuse the Non into thinking that the Narc values any of their opinions and needs them to validate his emotions. He does not. Their praise, respect, admiration, love, or giving their very bodies over to him are nothing more than the candy falling from the vending machine. Once he has eaten the candy he will throw the wrapper away and forget it ever existed. The Narc does not need others to validate his emotions. His emotions are valid simply because he feels them and is experiencing them. This makes them prima facie valid. Anything else will not be considered, because the Narc cares about one thing in the entire universe: himself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb5dEtNIKZk"
"Sub-types of NPD. Deadratt - thanks for the link to Michael Holdren's paper; I have just read the first thirty pages of it. It brought to mind a recent session I had with a psychotherapist employed by the university at which I am currently a part time student. We talked about personality disorders, and I expressed scepticism about the validity of the classification in DSM IV, because I could see quite plainly, elements of all three 'clusters' in my own disordered personality. She readily agreed, saying her view was that personality disorders are deeply embedded maladaptive 'scripts' that people develop, hold on to, and live by. Each person will forge their own unique 'script', formulated as a result of painful early life experiences, in the context of their individual neurological makeup. Hence it doesn't really make sense to try to erect a taxonomy of mutually exclusive, separate personality disorders (and this comes through in places in Holdren's thesis). Instead, we should say there are a number of recognisable elements which are commonly incorporated into people's scripts, but each person will have their own unique blend in their personal script. Have you come across this viewpoint, and what is your own view? cheers Paul"
"Sub-types of NPD. Hey Paul That's a really interesting viewpoint and I'm sure it must have some validity - human beings are so complex aren't they and of course everyone's defences and motivations are different. Username feels there is also a genetic predisposition towards PD's and that must have some influence too? Perhaps it is like an individual who has a problem with food:- they may become anorexic, bulimic, binge eat or go through a variety of all three positions during their life. They may even exercise manically. At the root of the problem though is the food? That being the case - what do you think is at the root of the cluster B disorders? Any ideas?

They are probably too complex to be boiled down to one thing, but my vote goes to attachment. Human bonding. Love. Whatever you'd like to call it. My understanding is that most of the personality disorders are chiefly evidenced in interpersonal relationships. Similarly, you can't boil down an eating disorder to a problem with food (no pun). An addiction to the pleasure induced by food might be a component of bulimia, but anorexia is much more about self-image which has become predicated upon physical appearance. It's been argued that it can be a form of self-injury and -punishment. The anorexic is typically an obsessive perfectionist. Food is involved only as it relates to metabolism, esp. lipid production, thus relating to appearance. There might be an OCD-type anxiety component."

My understanding is that most of the personality disorders are chiefly evidenced in interpersonal relationships. They are evidenced most obviously in interpersonal relationships because that is the most directly observable aspect of a personality. But the fundamental disorder is lack of a stable sense of self. Attachment and interpersonal issues are just one part of the problem, the bigger problem is that a PD personal struggles with self-identity and can't know himself very well. It's impossible because he doesn't have a single stable personality, his instability makes him act like different people depending on state of mind. You could almost say it's a little bit like a mild form of multiple personality disorder, where different parts of your personality come and go (although unlike true MPD the personal still has a single continuous consciousness) I think that's one of the fundamental causes of attachment issues that PDs have. Being in familiar, comfortable place surrounded by people and family and things you are comfortable with can eliminate a lot of the stresses that fling the unstable personality around. Having enough control of his surroundings to keep things stable makes it easier to deny the unstable personality, because external stability causes somewhat improved inner stability for as long as it lasts. Workoholism and serious hobbies can help too, I think of all these things as ""anchors"" that help me remember who I am without drifting too far into insanity."
"Sub-types of NPD. deadratt wrote: Similarly, you can't boil down an eating disorder to a problem with food (no pun). Hey Deadratt I was thinking more that the psychological problems are expressed through a relationship with food - and wondering which 'vehicle' NPD might use to do the same? I think Sfguy is right - it is in interpersonal relationships that NPD is most obviously manifested isn't it? They may be the 'conduit' through which NPD expresses itself. sfguy75x wrote: It's impossible because he doesn't have a single stable personality, his instability makes him act like different people depending on state of mind.

The lack of a 'stable' personality - and the awareness of this lack possibly - is at the core of NPD. I wonder if it is only the most self-aware Narcissists that realise the lack of correlation between what they say/think and their behaviour - or if they are all conscious of it to some degree. If so I expect that it is extremely frustrating and disorientating. I also wonder if the gap between the true and false self becomes more obvious as a Narcissist ages and recognises the 'flip-flopping' between one kind of behaviour and another.

"Sub-types of NPD. I think this is based on Sam Vaknin's website. He points out there can be two distinct personality types in narcissists. -Somatic type: Obsessed based around beauty, ideal looks and so forth. -Cerebral type: Values their knowledge to an extreme. Both characteristics can be present within the narcissist, but one may be more dominant than the other. Trust all the things I tell you are true, dress up in your best so I can be proud of you, and never believe I won't turn on you, and never believe I do this for you. You're leading me on again and I find it, yeah I like it, and I'm reeling in awe for sure, now I know it was given to me."

"Questions about Family situations from Nons Hi all, I'm new here and still learning- please feel free to move this to the 'family page' if this is needed. Just thought I might get some good info here. I believe my Dad has got narcissistic tendencies, and undoubtedly other mental health disorders too. We walk on egg shells around him as any perceived slight could trigger his full wrath. This can be anything from being abusive, to his favourite punishment, “The Silent Treatment.” He can also be highly sarcastic and nasty, and if he know you have a sensitive spot will really go for it. The silent treatment really does not work on me anymore, as I moved out ten years ago and can really take him or leave him. I think that because he does not have any control over me he basically is on his better behaviour around me. This year, he was angry because early on Christmas Eve, my mum decided to go to the shops early, around 8am and believed he was still asleep. Later, when they discussed this, Dad went totally mental when Mum said, “You were still asleep when I went to the shops.” This made Dad very angry, because in fact, he was “dozing.” (Not asleep, just ‘dozing.’) Because of this, Dad hasn’t spoken to mum for days. When the rest of our (oblivious) family arrived for Christmas lunch, dad said hello but didn’t look up from his book. He didn’t sit at the table with us, instead reading at the couch. During Christmas lunch, he interrupted us all to come and get a breadroll from the table, making a big performance about putting butter on it before taking it and returning to the couch to eat alone. The rest of the family was obviously very uncomfortable but didn’t know what to do. He hadn’t bought anyone gifts, but accepted many gifts off multiple family members without even saying thank you. This behaviour is all basically because my mother dared to use what he perceived to be the wrong term to describe the correct level of his wakefulness. I am not an expert in any mental disorders, and I am sure that he is eligible for many!! I don’t think he would meet all of the characteristics for narcissism, and please feel free to correct me if I’m wrong but I feel he meets some. I am quite sure he has depression, and probably ptsd. He is ex-military, and was in a horrific motor bike accident when I was very young. He has extensive health issues as a result. He has a gambling addiction too. While these things are not easy, I believe his personality Theres really nothing anyone can do, as I don’t think he is open to any sort of support. My concern is more for my mum, as she is stuck with this crazy irrational tyrant. When he is not in his bizarre bad moods, he can actually be very pleasant and helpful. These bad moods strike suddenly, without warning and for no logical reason. He has lots of issues at work, and is always complaining about how stupid this or that co-worker is and what he has to deal with. My younger brother is properly psychologically messed up too, and obviously this sort of upbringing has had an impact. He is making really silly life choices and has zero interpersonal skills. It’s so sad, seeing this all play out and being reasonably helpless. Thanks for reading, if you made it this far  If you have any input I’m happy to hear it!"
"Questions about Family situations from Nons Hi and thank you word shaker for you response! There is a lot of things going on with him at the moment and I have decided to see a counsellor myself for some strategies to cope with this stuff. Unfortunately, I can't make either my mum or dad seek help although it would be highly beneficial. The counsellor I saw said based on my descriptions he could match having borderline personality disorder, not narcissism. I am fairly hung up on having a label, because it will help me to have something to research and understand. Unfortunately, without him getting assessed properly I'll never know. I am just worried that a disaster is imminent as he seems very unhinged at the moment. I hope you have a great year ahead too"
"Questions about Family situations from Nons butterflysj wrote: Hi all, he was angry because early on Christmas Eve, my mum decided to go to the shops early, around 8am and believed he was still asleep. Later, when they discussed this, Dad went totally mental when Mum said, “You were still asleep when I went to the shops. I would become more upset if an earlier incident had upset me, and then when it was discussed I was told I was doing something that I did not think I was doing, ***and*** I was being told my supposed actions were being used to justify the incident. A question arises here which you could put to you father. If he is asleep or appears to be asleep is it OK to wake him up? Where importantly, because he appears, to you, to be angry 'sometimes', you are not wanting to experience him being angry with you. Could he understand what is being explained to him or is just too irrational to understand that? After all, if your parents are still married just how irrational can he be? Can you talk to him or is it just impossible? Much depends on how you talk to him, where blaming him must surely provoke him."
"Questions about Family situations from Nons Hi Im new on the forum & wondered if anyone can advise... We have a 17y/o daughter who for several years now we have noticed she doesn't show empathy or express concern or interest for others in the family. She is totally self focused and does not appear to consider how her wants / demands might affect others be it plans or inconvenience. Ive noticed other make reference to walking on egg shells and this is now the saddening norm in our home. Most conversations somehow turn onto how she 'needs' something or how we her parents have 'failed' to deliver on passing suggestions. What is also extremely concerning is how her recall of situations frequently differs hugely from what really happened -thankfully im not a single parent as if I was I would be questioning my sanity. She appears not to have the ability to reflect on situations and offer an apology which worries me and has done for some time as she truly believes she is always the one in the right. She refuses to do anything at all from walk the dog, washing up, clean her room or lies that she has done things which blatantly has not been done eg feeding the dog whilst we went away. Occasionally she has thrown cushions or small items like pens when the blind anger strikes but today it has escalated to smashing a plate and saying at least it wasn't aimed at you! (we have never thrown anything in anger) There is no chance she would consider counselling (we offered this a number of years ago and as she doesn't have an issued its who we have made her? it was blankly refused) at the age of 17 what else can we do. Any help or advice would be hugely appreciated as we are worried what will happen next - as far as we know in college shes progressing well but does seem to rotate around different groups of friends which we are wondering if this may be linked to similar self focused/importance behaviour. Look forward to hearing from you"

"Questions about Family situations from Nons This is my first time to this forum, great so far. My mother has not been formally diagnosed as NPD but she exhibits all of the traits. I am trying to get some feedback on how to handle a situation where my mother forgets my sons birthdays. I am confused about what I should do. Should I remind her of their birthdays or just let it be? She lives a state away, only sees them a few times a year, never calls, I always have to call her to get the boys on phone with her. Should I let her find out later that she forgot her grandsons birthdays? Is it I my responsibility as a parent to remind her? She even forgets my birthday on occasion. Has any one run into this and if so, what do you do? Thank you and advance"
"NPD/BPD Affair Partners I have been here before, just haven't posted in quite some time. The last time I posted I was in distress and was accused of being a troll. Well in order to be concise, I am a diagnosed BPD that is the mistress of a diagnosed NPD. We both found out throughout the course of our roller coaster that we are both disordered. Which explains a lot. I've know him 24 years. His entire family is disordered, as is mine, just in different ways. His mother is a narcissistic witch and attempts to control his every move as he is her beloved precious. He is a covert. He states that he married his wife because it was what his family wanted. Which I do have evidence of outside of him. We have a child and he has one with his wife. Both are infants. He doesn't really connect with children. I don't know how he will be with that portion of this, although it does concern me quite a bit. We discuss being together. We have done this dance for YEARS, no matter who either of us have been with, and have gotten to the point where we realize we will only keep hurting the others we keep bringing into this....lunacy. But does he mean it? Is it possible that the seemingly self aware conversations are just more NPD lies so that he can stay married and still have me? I know that none of you know him, but its kind of a if you were him, what would be your mindset? He says that I am the only person who makes him FEEL. So....thoughts?"

"Definition, Causes, Symptoms & Treatment Definition An individual with narcissistic personality disorder exhibits extreme self-importance, inability to empathize with others and heightened sensitivity to criticism. Self-involvement and lack of empathy characterize this personality disorder. People with narcissistic personality disorder are frequently perfectionists and need to be the center of attention, receiving affection and admiration, and controlling the situation. To get the attention he craves, he may try to create crises that return the focus to him. Like patients with antisocial personality disorder, this person places entitlement issues at the fore. He feels that the world owes him, regardless of whether he makes a contribution. Alcohol and other drugs (AOD) can induce states that mimic a personality disorder, but if an AOD-using person with a personality disorder abstains, only the symptoms of the personality disorder will still be evident. AOD use may trigger or aggravate a personality disorder. The course and severity of personality disorders can also be made worse if other psychiatric problems, such as mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders are present. A patient with a personality disorder frequently uses AODs to relieve her symptoms: to raise self-esteem, decrease feelings of guilt and amplify feelings of diminished individuality. Narcissistic personality disorder often leads to use of drugs, particularly stimulants. As a disinhibitor, alcohol may help lower anxiety and alleviate depression. A shy person with narcissistic personality disorder may depend on marijuana to relieve her social anxiety, while others use steroids to boost confidence in physical perfection. Without AODs, a person with narcissistic personality disorder may believe that others are overly critical or do not adequately appreciate her good qualities. In a crisis, she may become severely depressed. Symptoms Overreacts to criticism, becoming angry or humiliated Uses others to reach goals Exaggerates own importance Entertains unrealistic fantasies about achievements, power, beauty, intelligence or romance Has unreasonable expectation of favorable treatment Needs constant attention and positive reinforcement from others Is easily jealous Causes The exact cause is not known. Although onset of the disorder is usually early adulthood, it is likely to be in response to childhood experiences. A psychological evaluation may be performed. Treatment Psychotherapy may be useful in getting the individual with narcissistic personality disorder to relate to others in a less maladaptive manner. The following guidelines may help therapists working with these patients, especially those who are also AOD-dependant. Engagement Therapists can actually use the narcissistic features of their patients to engage and assess them. To avoid angering the patient, it's important to work with, rather than belittle, the narcissistic ego. A therapist should, for example, address a patient's heightened self-importance and desire for control by saying such things as ""Because you are obviously such an intelligent and sensitive person, I'm sure that, working together, we can get you past your current difficulties."" Narcissistic personality traits can also be used to provide motivation for therapy. The patient may be induced to change negative behaviors: a better appearance, improved career prospects, or romantic and sexual conquests can been viewed as a reward for recovery. Therapists will need to address thinking errors—which may reflect inflated self-esteem (""I'm the star of the office"") or hypersensitivity (""My coworkers are trying to get me fired"")—that interfere with the patient's ability to work. While empathizing with the patient, the therapist should offer reality testing. If a patient complains that, ""things are really going wrong"" or ""everyone is against me,"" the therapist might sympathize, but tactfully point out the reality of the situation and how it could be improved by behavior changes the patient could make. Crisis stabilization In a crisis situation, the therapist should assess the patient's defenses, and to put them to therapeutic use. For example, when a patient blames his wife for ""calling the police on me,"" the therapist can mention that the best way to avoid being arrested is to stop getting drunk and hitting her. Patients with narcissistic personality disorder are often perfectionists. For them, the best way to approach their problems is from a ""no-fault"" disease perspective. This removes blame from the patient and allows her to perceive her illness as a biochemical disorder, reducing the sense of failure that can make treatment more difficult. A patient with narcissistic personality disorder tends to become depressed when his feelings are badly hurt, when his defenses have let him down and when he believes his world is collapsing. When wounded, he is at the greatest risk of acting out, either against himself or others. A patient experiencing a narcissistic rage may become homicidal, particularly if he has a need to seek revenge. Because of the intensity of the narcissist's emotions, the counselor needs to deal very carefully with this anger and avoid a power struggle. Patients believed to be suicidal should be asked to sign a safety contract. To stabilize the patient, a brief, goal-oriented hospitalization may be necessary. Because HIV-positive patients with narcissistic personality disorder are likely to view themselves as expert lovers, therapists should establish contracts with them to practice safe sex. Otherwise, the wide-ranging sexual encounters that often accompany the narcissistic ego, puts them at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases. Longer-Term Care Individual Counseling Ongoing therapy is needed to manage not only the self-aggrandizement, hypersensitivity, and need for control and attention found in narcissistic patients, but also their anger and depression. Individual and group treatments for patients with antisocial personality disorder, including 12-step programs, are often helpful for patients with narcissistic personality disorder. In fact, therapists may want to approach an individual with narcissistic personality disorder as a hypersensitive version of an antisocial personality disorder patient. Group Therapy Group therapy may be helpful for patients with narcissistic personality disorder, but the therapist should, tactfully but firmly, place limits on their speaking time so that they cannot control the discussion or focus all the attention on themselves. Explaining that members of the group need to share the time, therapists may want to make a contract with patients with narcissistic personality disorder before each session to encourage pro-social behaviors. Some of these behaviors include: Limiting speaking time Not interrupting other speakers Respecting the feelings of others Responding to other group members Listening objectively to responses and feedback from others It is important to continue to use the patient's behavior traits rather than to attack the narcissistic ego. It's best to be empathic while confronting the narcissist: ""I can see that you are hurt to hear that not everyone in the group believes you."" Continuum of Care For patients with narcissistic personality disorder, the least restrictive treatment environment is preferable. It permits patients to feel that they are in control. These patients are normally moved quickly from inpatient to outpatient levels of care. If they do not like the treatment, they will stop participating. Thus, it is critical not to over-pathologize the patient's disorder with constant criticism. However, acute hospitalization for psychiatric emergencies (such as homicidal or suicidal plans) may be necessary. Narcissistic patients generally enjoy the attention they receive through involvement in outpatient treatment. Long-term outpatient involvement is critical to maintain a narcissistic patient's pro-social behavior and sobriety. Therapists who strive to build narcissistic patients' strengths and who pay close attention to them in therapy will find them active participants in the recovery process. In addition to their personality disorder and AOD use disorder, some patients may engage in compulsive sexual or spending behaviors that should be addressed therapeutically."

"Definition, Causes, Symptoms & Treatment Both my parents are narcissistic. It's rubbed off on me to an extent. I'm damaged and don't think it'll ever go away. I accept this. It's okay, though. In what I focus on, I excel because of my condition. It's lonely, but just the way it is. The hardest thing for me to learn over the years is that for all of my gifts, I'm still quite idiotic in many things. Even what I excel in, there are still people out there who can do better. I'm not sure narcissism is entirely incurable. My mother has come around after having a hysterectomy. I guess her hormonal balance was really out of whack before, but after than and the death of my little brother, she finally let go of her pride. Before this, she rarely listened to me if at all. She basically treated everyone as objects. My father rarely listens still. Their lack of decency in many matters has truly damaged me. I'm a hypocrite. I find most things that people do to be idiotic and meaningless. I find myself unable to empathize with people in many circumstances. Oh well."
"Definition, Causes, Symptoms & Treatment It's good to keep in mind that there are concepts like 'healthy narcissism' as introduced by Freud, even a Wikipedia article for it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_narcissism Where it goes bad is when one is unable to conceive other's emotions, or when one is unable to see some of the benefits of acting in the interests of others or for a more stable society in regard to their own long-term benefits. I really think this is something easily overdiagnosed, it's obviously used often by laymen as a pejorative. In many cases, I believe people who accuse others of narcissism are also experiencing cognitive distortions. The stereotype of a narcissist is that they ""can't empathize"" or that they ""think they are omnipotent"". To me, descriptions like this imply that someone is engaging in exaggeration, describing (and perhaps thinking) in an all-or-nothing manner. It is more realistic that these people simply have ELEVATED ideas of their potency, and have DIFFICULTY empathizing (or perhaps just apathy towards it, or they choose to disregard their empathic instincts for fear of misinterpreting them). People are so blinded with anger at people who think highly of themselves (so ingrained are we in cultural habits of humility that we absurdly believe the non-humble to be predominantly inferior beings) that I believe they think of them in black and white terms. In this way, treating so-called narcissists in a hostile manner, I ponder if perhaps the attempt to diagnose this condition is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consider this: when someone perceives someone as narcissistic and treats them in an impolite or condescending manner or is angry with them. A narcissist reflects this behaviour back at them (as persecuted defensive people tend to do when attacked) and this response is then classed as 'symptoms'. Thus confirming the diagnosis which may have been made prematurely, but is then cemented by the response to other's prejudice. When observing how people come to such judgements, the ""narcissist"" looks down upon their evaluatory skills and feels misjudged. He then thinks ""I would not misjudge myself like this"" and thus feels superior in that sense. Many people are vulnerable to falling prey to cognitive distortions such as ""Falsum in uno, falsum in omnibus"". In a more reserved sense of what a subconcious thought like that would represent, a person may think ""if this person misjudges here, why should I have confidence in their other advice?"" At that point, it seems unfair to diagnose resistance and hostile defensiveness to criticism as a symptom of illness when it may simply be a symptom of an unsatisfactory analysis. This is something I'm very concerned about when you consider that these episodes of 'narcissistic rage' are described as temporary. When it comes to temporary situational episodes, I think much attention should be paid to the situation and the history of interactions between all parties involved, lest we risk generalizing specific kinds of disputes as 'how they always react to any kind of X'"

Can Vulnerable Narcissists be charismatic? MindfulThoughts wrote: Iznahs wrote: I probably have traits of covert narcissism. I think I'm charismatic when I feel like I am in a supportive surrounding. I think most of us will be charismatic (or at least perform better) when we are supported Yeah probably though I'm guessing a non doesn't need support to be charismatic.
"Can Vulnerable Narcissists be charismatic? It really depends on who Is talking about this and what theory they are operating off. Ellinor Greenberg has a bunch of really good writing on Quora about this. In the system she uses they believe that there are essentially 3 distinct types of a narcissist. A grandiose type, a vulnerable type (covert), and a malignant type. The grandiose type seeks to be the center of attention attempts to drown out other people so they are the only ones anyone sees and is generally more likely to address confrontations head on and in person. A vulnerable type is more likely to attach themselves to things or organizations to appear like great people, to get adulation by proxie of the causes they attach themselves to. Think a lot of social justice warriors, church Karen’s that think they can do no wrong because they are doing Gods work, these people don’t actually care about the issues they just care about how it makes them look but they don’t know this because they don’t really understand why other people do these things. We are living in a phony superficial narcissistic echo chamber as a society. These types will usually avoid direct spotlight as they don’t have the grandiosity and believe they are defective and will be exposed as a fraud (as they usually are). This kind of a person usually attacks people indirectly, spreading rumors behind people’s backs atttempting to smear them and discredit them etc. I’m sure you know the type. Then you have the malignant type I believe my grandfather was this type, they are always trying to destroy other peoples self esteem. Casting doubt in their minds, nothing is ever good enough for them. You do them a favor and they try to belittle you. I remember my father buying him some brand new slippers for around the house my father was very particular about which ones he bought him but he said he hated them and he would probably fall and break his neck in them to take them back and bring him something he could wear. It was a game he played, it kept my father coming back to visit him and he kept criticizing him over anything he tried to do."
"Do I have NPD? I (34M) was married since 2014. No kids. I fell in love again in February 2022. I told my wife (38F) pretty early about the affair, understandably she was upset and angry. I could not stay in our co-owned flat because of the tension. I impulsively decided to leave our flat and my wife was alone. She moved to a different flat in August and I helped her move. I asked if I could stay for a few day at my girlfriend's (39F) flat. These days turned to weeks and weeks to months. I am a peaceful guy normally, but there were times when my girlfriend (now ex) had provoked me multiple times accusing me of things that are not true. I had this habit of bursting out and saying hurtful, condescending things to the other person when I feel cornered. I have done this to my brother, parents, to my wife even. My wife has forgiven me multiple times. And she has seen a nice side of me. Me and my ex-gf had actually a few fights in the span of 7 months. Additionally, there were times where due to my own insecurity I used to write stupid messages to her while at work. She was burdened by this. When she gets pissed at me, she has yelled at me, multiple times in front of her son and people too. So, my coping mechanism was WhatsApp messages and hers was yelling and getting out of her system. She was a difficult person to be with, in the beginning I was patient, but it grew thin pretty fast. Beginning August we moved into a bigger flat (it was her choice, I had almost no say in this decision), and there were tensions in the next weeks. But there were super nice moments too. She told me she's pregnant in 2nd week of August. Since, I wish the best for my kid, I suggested things like private school etc. I know it's far fetched but I wanted to see if she respects my opinion or not. She disagreed. This was our biggest fight, I exploded said mean things and she was hurt. After a week, we mutually decided to end the relationship. I was a bit upset because the timing was not great since she was pregnant and instead of saving the relationship she chose to move to a smaller apartment with her son. A day later she was infected with Coronavirus. She did not text me anymore. Last week she sent me a mail that she was in the Hospital and that she had a miscarriage and it's over. This was the 2nd miscarriage since we were together. First was in May. Our relationship was very special. I never experienced things with anybody else the way I did with her. She has also told me that no one else has made her so happy like I did, which was the reason we both wanted kids. I feel she sees only the negative side of the coin and somehow refuses to see the sweet moments we both had. Perhaps, we both needed more patience with one another. I still have not received closure because it seems like she has made up her mind. I am seeking therapy because my temper and impulsiveness costed me 2 relationships. I cannot sleep, I dream about my ex-gf and wake up at 2, 3 am. I regret my actions deeply, I wish I went to therapy more than a month ago. I still miss her a lot and regret my behavior towards her. I informed her about therapy, but she doesn't acknowledge it. And I feel this burden of guilt for running everything to the ground. Right now I stay in our co-owned flat which has almost nothing. My wife allowed me to stay there, this flat was supposed to be sold by now, according to plan. I feel more terrible because I do not deserve my wife's generosity. Is there any way in the future to revive this relationship?"
"Do I have NPD? We can't know from your story whether you have NPD or not. You seem to exhibit some traits but your therapist is in a better position to judge. As for your relationship. You say you still haven't received closure but what exactly are you expecting? You both agreed to split up, that's the end. You are obsessing over her because you are thinking if she takes you back then you don't need to feel guilty anymore, and you also want to avoid accepting the finality of the rejection because your ego can't take it."

My therapist also tells me I have traits of NPD. After this event, I started reading a lot about Personality disorders in general. I would say I have traits from BPD. Because of the love hate cycles I experienced while I was with my ex-girlfriend, impulsivity, mood swings. But I never had thoughts of harming myself, neither did I have feelings of emptiness or suicide. I believe I am a fully functioning adult.

Yes, you are right. My ego is hurt by the rejection. A part of me still obsesses about her. But, there's this other part which does not want to go back to her. While I was with her I have had thoughts of leaving, running away. I don't think one would feel this way, if it was actually ""True Love"". But, I could not. Because I knew I would be alone and I was scared. I was emotionally dependent on her. She knew this well and used it to her advantage. There were times clearly when I told her ""I want to leave"". She responded with things like ""I love you"", ""I don't want to fight with you anymore"". I didn't really man up and set boundaries or leave. I was blinded by love and did not know what I was signing up for."
"Do I have NPD? Hi abtom87, Reading your first post... here some thoughts: Some people in this forum use to talk about ""narcissism"" for something that I would call ""destructive narcissism"". I mean : it seems that some people become destructive with people close to them - or depending on them. On the short term, they ""win"". On the long run, their projects tend to fail. Or cost a lot to people around them. Besides, narcissism - as love for oneself - seems to me something positive. For me it's sort of energy that you need to manage. It's something that is often learned with experience and I think can be called ""maturity: taking own space, allow space to other, thinking on the long term, not be afraid to ""lose""... From what I read, you seem to have kept a good relation with your wife. That's good for both of you. The outbursts of rage seem to be a problem for people around you. And for your girlfriend, it seems to be difficult to handle.It seems to me that it's typical impulsive destructive attitude : you feel bad and want the other person to feel bad, hoping you feel better. Some partners can handle it if they are very strong. Of course it's better, if possible, to find quieter ways to express your needs. What calls my attention is this: I know it's far fetched but I wanted to see if she respects my opinion or not. Not sure of the meaning of ""far fetched"". Do you mean that you discussed about the future mainly to ""win""? Maybe there are other ways to feel respected. You seem to have strong emotions and you seem a little lost about how to find your space and your wants. I hope time and therapy make you feel better. (sorry for the mistakes in english)"
"Do I have NPD? By far fetched i meant, i started discussing private school and things like that in the 2nd month of pregnancy. The thing is, I gave up so much to be with her and I really wanted to see if she would be ready to make compromises for me, for the relationship. I was not seeking to win a silly argument. She has manipulated me many times, like asked me to expedite the divorce with my wife, in the 3rd week we were together. And i confronted my wife with this, because i was so blinded by love. She convinced me that I'm her knight in her shining armor, how her previous lovers were losers and how she's convinced that she could start a family only with me, etc. And I felt bad, listening to her stories, watching her taking care of the kid alone, i wanted to support her and I have. I believe I was the codependent empath who graduated to narcissist which destroyed the relationship. Our core principles were different. She is a social worker. She didn't mind sending her son to a school in a not-so-great part of the city. And I'm more of a capitalist. So I believe if you work hard, you deserve to have good living standard. But I'm sure in the long run I'm going to live a better life than her."

"Can you admit when you are wrong? My instinct is to deny, deny, deny.

"Can you admit when you are wrong? I have extreme difficulty with admitting it to others and myself. Even if I can verbally do so, I can’t fully embody and accept it.

I’m so concerned with protecting an image that at this point is damaged beyond repair and it’s not helping me or anyone else, but I just can’t seem to let it go. It’s as if any act to fix it feels like I’m being personally attacked by either others or myself. My ego seems to be exceedingly fragile. I question if I’m a psychopath a lot of the time as well. I don’t know why it’s so hard when I actually put in more effort doing toxic behaviors than going against them. It could be something as small as assuming what someone’s meaning as if it has anything to do with me, to getting snippy at others because I had a bad day."

"Does singer Morrissey seem like a Narcissist? I've long found Morrissey a very intriguing person, and liked a lot of his songs. I only watched the second video to a little past 4 minutes, but he looks excruciatingly awkward. He may be a narc, or very close to it, but the thing is, as with all narcs, he has his complexity. I'm too schizoid and introverted to ever be able to undergo those kind of interviews, but I guess he's developed some skill with them. Still, I wonder if it's hell to always have to be so clever with people, to constantly have to put on a witty performance. He looks pretty uncomfortable, and if he's a narc, that itself is very much a part of his narcissism. I don't think the people who interview him, or his adoring fans, really know how awkward he feels, and as he's gotten older, it's probably gotten worse. I wonder if he might start going into seclusion. The inner life of the secret schizoid is incommunicable."

Just my opinion but i think it would be incredibly difficult almost impossible for someone with a true Avpd to be in the spot light and be a star id think they would avoid it like the plague. Grandiosity in narcissists can ebb and flow surge and fall along with the self esteem of the narcissist. If they think they are doing something special they may be over the top obnoxious but if they feel like a failure they may appear more avoidant.

Yup. Someone with AvPD would definitely avoid drawing attention to themselves. I've been on a stage to deliver a thankyou to someone in front of a hall full of people, tripped over my words and hated every moment of being up there. Did it because the person really deserved the recognition and thanks for going above and beyond for me, but I couldn't get off that stage fast enough. Almost every music performance I ever did (I was never facing the audience directly), even though I love my music, I always hated being the one at the centre of attention. I desperately wanted to hide or blend into the background- or not be up there. It was easier accompanying another musician, but as a soloist or front and centre, nope. Would be freaking out the whole time. First rule of mental health: Learn to distinguish who deserves an explanation, who deserves only one answer, and who deserves absolutely nothing.

"NPD Hello everyone, I haven't been diagnosed with NPD, but I've been incredibly worried that I have it for years now! I've been doing so much research on this disorder recently that I realised I resonate with a lot of the traits, and this sent me into a depression and wanting to isolate from my loved ones to protect them! I have empathy, but I feel it's circumstantial, like for example I feel deeply for homeless people, if I see one, I become tearful because they look lonely and depressed and I think about them all day hoping they are okay! I feel sad when someone else is sad and I want to console and help them! I can't stand to see animals suffer and I cry if a family member kills an insect in the house, feeling bad for the life lost! Now the reason why I feel it is circumstantial is because there are certain situations where my empathy is lower and I try to feel something but it just isn't there, and so I instead feel dismissive towards the person! I don't get mean to them, but I just come across as uncaring and uninterested and this makes me feel awful, I feel both shame at myself and guilt for the person and I apologise to them and try to explain how my brain is! The narcissistic traits I feel I have apart from inconsistent empathy is a need for validation that I'm worthy, and this takes form in dressing up in a certain way when I'm going out so that men look at me and find me attractive! This is all I want, but when I get it, I start having thoughts that I'm the sexiest woman out there! I don't actually think I'm sexy at all, I find myself incredibly repulsive, but when these men look at me, whistle at me, honk their horns, however they show that they're looking and liking I get a high from it and start thinking I'm better than other women, and then feel embarrassed for thinking that when the high crashes! I don't experience rage if I don't get the validation I need, but I go home and cry in private wondering why I just can't be beautiful like other women, why I'm so ugly and disgusting etc and don't want to leave the house anymore... but this just repeats and it is exhausting to the point I've just wanted to end my life! The next trait is a fear of rejection and abandonment, and due to this I experience debilitating anxiety about being rejected, ghosted or cheated on and this causes me to need a lot of reassurance that I'm still loved and valued! Also, due to the abandonment/rejection anxiety, I experience excruciating jealousy, and I say excrutiating because it triggers a painful wound in me, a wound from being left out/excluded and bullied when I was growing up, both at school and at home! So, if a partner is showing love to someone else they care about, instead of being happy for them, I panic that I don't mean anything to them anymore, I'm jealous that it's not me getting that love and my brain convinces me that the love I get is not the same and is actually less than what others get, and so I cry and say to myself see? you are nothing! I don't have trouble holding myself accountable, I understand when I've made a mistake and done wrong and try to correct it! If I hurt someone, I feel guilt and apologise to them! I confuse myself so much because I have this good side of me, and then this horrible side comes out, this wounded child that I can't calm down! I've tried my best but I just can't regulate my emotions and I turn to others breaking down! I have a diagnosis of ADHD and I thought for the longest time my experiences were related to that, but NPD (particularly in vulnerable form) makes so much more sense because of the flip flopping between grandiosity and feeling worthless (not seen in ADHD)! Every day is a battle between healing and surviving (narcissism) and whichever one of those dominates varies from day to day, and situation to situation! It is truly exhausting! :'("

Yeah it’s different now but like I say the 5 symptoms that they required before would have to be causing all sorts of pretty sig dysfunction before they would be considered clinical symptoms. From my experience they don’t really diagnose like that anyway they pretty much look for core issues. There are things that are present in all personality disorders they look for first, things like black and white thinking, thinking in extremes and being unable to see or comprehend nuances or gray area. Not having “whole object relations”. Which is just the ability to understand that just because you’re mad at someone doesn’t mean they are evil they can still be good and even care about you while still arguing with you. People with a PD have a very difficult time understanding this. Once you establish that a personality disorder is even present they look for what drives the behaviors as they can look the same. If it’s centered around a fear of abandonment they might look at something like BPD or if it’s centered around needing to be the center of attention and adored by your friends while being completely unable to accept criticism then perhaps it’s NPD but usually they just give a diag of PD nos meaning not otherwise specified"
"Thought I was HPD... Now realizing I'm a covert narcissist Hi. So, as stated in the title. For years I thought myself to be histrionic because of my attention-seeking behavior. But I didn't realize until the last few weeks that I am in fact more likely a covert/vulnerable narcissist. I realize that my motivations and behaviors might be more in line with that. I've been in denial for years about the severity of my behaviors, desires, lies, half-truths, fantasies. But certain things lead me to believe that I'm NPD. For example, two of the three times I was hospitalized for mental health reasons I was panicking and unsure of how to handle certain situations and I think more than anything I was looking for a way out. I've thrown people under the bus in an instant to save my skin or my reputation, including a sibling. I haven't been great to my family. Actually, I've been quite mean. I used to have pets but I feel I did the bare minimum for them. Like yes I fed them and everything and made sure they were alright but I never wanted to play with them giving them that connection they need. I feel I can be a bit neglectful. Like wanting to be left alone and such. I notice more my emptiness and how I'm trying to be real but can't bring myself to be. I'd like to be someone who is capable of having normal relationships. I've lost friends. I've lost a lot actually. I read that this is God's punishment. I thought I had a moment of having a repentant and contrite heart but I'm not sure. Today in private I threw a mini tantrum when something didn't go my way but I caught myself and tried to calm down. I took a nap and felt better after. But I'm not sure if I'm capable of being a legitimately good person and it hurts to feel that. I'll likely never be someone who is healthy and has healthy relationships. I'm questioning how much capacity for empathy I have and if I'll ever be able to be content with life. I got a good job but I'm already screwing it up and becoming lazy. Self-sabotage I've always struggled with. I don't feel content. I don't know if I ever will. I feel I'm always playing or portraying myself as the victim and I know I crave that sympathy that comes with that. I don't know why. I want to be cared for. Rescued. Things like that. I have a lot of rage that was dormant for many years but has been coming out for the last few years. I don't like who I am. I hope God can forgive me as I try to change."
"YouTube therapists demonising people with NPD I'm sure most of you will be aware that when you search for information on NPD you'll be met with a ton of results that are often very hostile towards people with NPD. This is very true on YouTube, where a bunch of grifter 'therapists' make videos like ""Unmasking a Covert Narcissist Is Absolutely Dangerous. Just Run!"" or ""Narcissists: Wolves in Sheep's Clothing"", and so on. How does it make you feel to see that? The lack of respect for the fact that we didn't choose to be like this, or for the reasons why we might be like this, pisses me off. I can't help the way my brain was wired. The BS annoys me too. Lots of talk of people with NPD 'targeting their victims'. Do they think that when we're meeting people we're mentally rubbing our hands together with anticipation while we try to identify which person's life we're going to ruin? Yeah that's not how it works, at all. The hypocrisy of these people who chose a supposedly altruistic profession sitting there spewing a bunch of dehumanising BS just so people in the comments - who always seem to be women for some reason - can use it to justify why their boyfriend dumped them because there's no way it could be their fault."
"YouTube therapists demonising people with NPD I've seen similar with those with other PD's too. And it's not just YouTube either. Sure there are those who have genuinely been in a relationship with someone with a PD, but I agree there seems to be a thing where the relationship has gone south and they are not willing to admit or accept that a relationship is a two-way street, and they start looking for ""excuses"" as to why it didn't work, and look to blame the other party and label them with a personality disorder. Rather than accept any responsibility at all for their own actions and contributions to the relationship failing. Or maybe they just were two people not meant to be together. But I suspect the percentage of people who have actually been in a relationship with someone with a PD is not as high as those on the internet would have us believe.

That the behaviours are not intended maliciously, but are a learned protective response to having dealt with a lifetime of trauma, threats, instability and abuse. And you're often not conscious of even doing it. I have a different PD. Mine is not demonised as much as NPD is, and I have a different range of behaviours I get accused being difficult with, but I hear you.

"YouTube therapists demonising people with NPD You must be a hippie. To answer the question, yeah, it's how I first learned about personality disorders but I think my perception changed over the years. And a part of me thinks it's not the wisest idea to get diagnosed with a PD but maybe it's the other way around and I'm not thinking in a completely healthy way."
"YouTube therapists demonising people with NPD I’ll be completely honest, I don’t really care personally because I don’t go around talking about any diagnosis I’ve had and I just see that as someone’s opinion about me anyways. I think psychology in general is a bit of a pseudoscience to begin with but with that said when you break down what it actually means to be diagnosed with something like narcissistic personality disorder…. They don’t give perfectly healthy and nice charming people who get along and are perfect little saints with something like that. Narcissists are combative, controlling, argumentative, difficult and in many cases physically and mentally abusive.. This is just the reality, it’s not a mental health disorder as much as it is your $#%^ personality that you can’t seem to change. It’s pretty dramatic and unprofessional for a clinical psychologist or whatever to say $#%^ like covert narcissists masks run. It’s stupid actually but NPD as is the case with all cluster b disorders have earned a lot of stigma."
"Request for Insight Hello, I’m a 27 yr old female. I have a roommate who goes through hell every day because of my issues and is now at their wits end. I may possibly also be a psychopath, I’m not sure. I have been so for such a long time that a lot of the behaviors I can identify are so ingrained into my everyday behavior that I do them without entirely thinking about it. I assume things are about me, assume what they think, make excuses instead of owning up to my own actions, have difficulty having genuine regret/remorse for them, and have been using the helpful “tools” that my support circle has given me for disingenuous reasons, lying to myself as well as others, belittling, bullying, antagonizing, taking down to others, delusions and denial, being a “troll”/cruelly cheeky, using my autism as an excuse, among a myriad of other issues. Everytime I think I’ve taken a step forward, I’ve actually taken 5 steps back. I’m worried there’s no fixing or helping me at this point. How am I supposed to go against the grain, the waves, when I’m so used to going with it that I have difficulty noticing until they get upset. How do I notice it better before I cause a problem? How do I force myself to not run away when I hear something or am asked a question I don’t like and don’t want to answer but need/have to? I have a lot of self-image issues and play pity party and self-degradation instead of doing anything about it as well. Yes, I’m the dreaded complainer who doesn’t put a lot of effort, if any, into trying to change. I get into these grand motivations when confronted but they never last long. And it goes into the same cycle over and over. How do I actually start? How do I change my goal and mindset so I’m not just going through the motions to manipulate people? I want to stop but I feel so stuck. I’m a self-admitted coward as well. I as you to be gentle with advice but I also know I need a good kick in the butt-reality check."
"Looks and Personal Identity Recently I’ve seen a few photographs of myself that totally devastated me. One was a driver’s license photo and the other a candid photo of me crossing a finishing line at a local race. Both were absolutely awful. It seemed I was in the full throws of geezerhood. Since then I’ve been able to convince myself, as usual, that it was the lighting, the angle, and the general circumstances in which these were taken, and that my much better---or less awful---looking mirror images were more true to life, by reading some articles and watching several YouTube videos. I suppose I cherry-picked all these to console myself. At some point, I felt better, as I usually do, and went back to a more positive facial self-image. Everything was fine. I was grossly over-blowing it. Hey! I could pass for 30! I was uniquely, almost disturbingly, youthful! (Of course in the back of my mind, I knew this was probably just another fluctuation, reality would smack me in the face once again, and I’d be due for another round of despair.) The larger issue is---and there are plenty of people who sneeringly ask this question---“why do I care so much about how I look?” Am I more obsessed about this than most people? Most men? People sneer at “vanity”, yet it doesn’t take much searching to find how many products there are on the market to improve personal appearance, not just to stave off the signs of aging, but for younger people too. Attracting a mate is surely part of this, but I think it’s much deeper and more nuanced than that. I also think blaming it on advertising, media and society is ultimately a copout. Oprah Winfrey once had Luther Vandross on her show after his radical weight loss. She declared in amazement that he looked like “a completely different person”. No, not the same person who’d just lost a lot of weight, but again, “a completely different person”. After a large weight loss at about 30, my brother made the same comment to me. It’s hard to explain, but there’s something very significant about this perception. I think it’s called “the halo effect”. It’s not just how you’re “seen” by others, but how you’re “felt”, and in some inexplicable way, who you are . A YouTuber by the name of Danny Mabley did a video on his weight loss journey. He went from looking middle-aged to a youthful 20-something, and yes, it was like he had become a “completely different person”. To me, even his voice and mannerisms seemed younger. Reality, or illusion? Where does outer beauty end and inner beauty begin? I don’t see any easy answer that question. It’s ageless. Luther Vandross on Oprah https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOzoiP3pMqE Luther After Weight Loss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snXaYujtDUc&t=64s My 140 lb Weight Loss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxoqoGphvO8&t=70s The Halo Effect https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCzZ6HvFHBk Okay. So, what? This is what: most of us want to be seen as the inner self, the inner person, that our body matches. There’s a certain enjoyment, sense of well-being in that experience. If you’ve got looks, you can shrug at this. But you neither know, nor probably care, what it feels like to people who don’t and never have. Or to those who had them but are losing them. When I was young, I scoffed at all these hair transplants and face lifts, but as they say, “you don’t know what you got ‘til it’s gone”. Maybe some people don’t feel this at all. Maybe some feel it only a little. But I think a lot more of us feel it much more, despite the tendency of most people to deny it out of the social conditioning that it’s vain and shallow. They are satisfied with the unreflective platitude that “beauty is only skin deep.” I am not . Will I ever accept my aging face and body? Will I ever be able to re-invent myself? Will I ever be able to accept my new niche in society, as I drift ever further towards its margins? Will I let go of all my old youthful fantasies? I’m working on it. But it won’t be easy. I’d be a fool to think it will be. The inner life of the secret schizoid is incommunicable."
"Looks and Personal Identity Hi Heracles, I find your post very interesting. I can relate with how it's difficult to be aging. You talked about identity. I like when people think I look a little younger, but I wouldn't like to mix with much younger people ""as if I was their age"". I would have the impression of fake, I wouldn't feel comfortable. And I don't know why, I tend to feel comfortable with older people, sometimes very old. Will I ever accept my aging face and body? Will I ever be able to re-invent myself? Will I ever be able to accept my new niche in society, as I drift ever further towards its margins? Will I let go of all my old youthful fantasies? Personnally I always felt comfortable in a niche. Much drama inside, I prefer the margins, where they don't ask me too much and I can find some space. And look at trees and birds, sometimes. I find the question of feeling inside /outside very interesting. Why do I feel so lonely in a crowd ? That impression of being outside. With what does that resonate inside me?"
"Looks and Personal Identity Philonoe wrote: Hi Heracles, I find your post very interesting.... Thanks philonoe. I’ve posted the OP on several forums, one being YouTube’s, A Random Millennial’s, Getting Old and My Thoughts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM5ltCKMGlk&t=249s I posted a number of comments on that video under Jethro Bodine, and I think another. He seemed to be alluding to many similar gerascophobic thoughts I’ve had, groping for the essence of the problem. Many are very elusive and hard to pin down. Very nuanced and complex. Unfortunately, even though he invited engagement, he seems to have abandoned the threads he started. I appreciate your kind words but I don’t want attention from people who like old people. They wouldn’t like me, but a demographic they’d idealized. I don’t care much for endearing old-people stereotypes, even when society considers them positive. They’re very un-me. I also find them condescending. Sorry. I don’t mean to be harsh. But when you’re wrestling with these kinds of problems, you’ve got to be brutally honest.

"Looks and Personal Identity I used to think I'm okay-looking but there are plenty of better looking people around me so I'd say I'm average. Can't say I think about it often, I only try not to stand out in a negative way. Attracting too much compliments based on looks (or anything) makes me feel like I'm faking it (because I had enough inspiration that particular day but I won't on the other days)."
"Doubts on being a ""covert"" narcissist I apologize in advance for possible grammar mistakes. Today one of my therapists (a psychologist) suggested that I could be a ""covert"" narcissist, or at least that I could have some traits of that disorder. Honestly it was the first time I heard of this word, ""covert"", although I knew the word ""narcissist"", so I was a bit confused and after the meeting I started searching online for clarification. Long story short, the two important things for me aI'm very competitive intellectually by nature and I was bullied at high school. Also, it's important to mention that in high school I was very bad in Maths but, when we started Calculus, I became interested in it and started studying it, also for social ""revenge"" and ""glorification"". That led to me starting a Maths degree like three years ago, of which I completed with average results a little more than one year of study before entering therapy for what I suppose was depression (I studied too much alone, did not follow lectures and tried to avoid social life in general). After that, I changed like three or four degrees because of confusion and anger for what I felt was not right. Now I recovered, and I'm back into Maths in some way. Despite that, I'm still focused on what happened in that strange period and in high school, which I consider an unforgettable failure in my life both academically and socially. Although I have few ""real"" friends (3,4), I'm now active socially in a group of people without any problems. After this data, I ask about what should I do about these words of being a ""covert"" narcissist: should I, for example, ask for clarifications directly to my therapist or should I simply ""trust"" him/her, work about it at therapy with the chosen path and forgetting the curiosity of the possible ""level"" of the disturb ?"
"Doubts on being a ""covert"" narcissist Now I'm pursuing an Engineering degree as I've found sone peace with an hobby. My scheme was very simple: as an intellectually superior individual I would be justified and able to damage my ""opponents"" with violence. That would be preceded by a necessary intellectual damage, the degree by itself or something more involved."

"Marijuana for Self-Regulation I am curious about other narcs experiences with using marijuana to self-regulate or control parts of the disorder. I am a medical marijuana user. I find that it really loosens me up and allows me to be more open to my experiences, less likely to rage at others, less likely to get caught up in my sadomasochistic self-destructive situations, etc. It also helps me sleep - which is REALLY important, because I don't sleep much. It's almost 4am while I type this (I didn't smoke tonight). I'm not suggesting that NPDs go try cannabis or anything of the sort. I am just asking about the experiences of others - and I am also curious... Do you think this is a healthy choice? What did your therapist tell you about marijuana and NPD? From my reading I Lol... Noticing I, I, I as the starting word for the first three paragraphs... ME ME ME! From my reading, I (lol) am led to believe that marijuana is often the 'drug of choice' for those with NPD.

Marijuana for Self-Regulation I love the culture and the image that comes from being a pothead. Makes you seems cool and you can get N supply from it. Would be scared $#%^less of being chased by a dealer with a knife. Never smoked weed but wih I could try toke just once. I know a narcissitic stoner who always brags about his association with drugs. Dx: NPD
"Marijuana for Self-Regulation Thanks - that's good stuff. So like I said, I am a medical user with a doctors prescription. There are literally dozens of medical marijuana dispensaries in my area - so I'm not dealing with drug dealers or being chased with knives Also, NO ONE except only like two people who know me know that I smoke pot. It's NOT a narc supply thing. It actually helps... at least it has the appearance of helping from my perspective. I hold fast to the idea that cannabis has been used for medicinal purposes for something like 10,000 years. It's FAR healthier (if vaporized or eaten) than a lot of prescription drugs and has WAY fewer side effects (like cotton mouth). I prefer that over side effects like 'anal leakage' or 'may cause instantaneous death'. The length and nature of the side effects listed for many prescription drugs is REALLY scary to me. Especially after you hear these stories years later - the ""oops, we though it was safe, but now you've permanently lost your olfactory senses"" type stories or worse..."
"Marijuana for Self-Regulation Well, my personality obviously clashes a lot with the beliefs shared by many people in the pot smoking culture, but I love smoking weed. I'm not exaggerating when I say that my temper would probably land me in jail if I didn't smoke. It really helps me with anger, so I pretty much stay high all the time. It doesn't really prevent me from being motivated or cause any problems in my life, so I don't see a problem with it. Things that would usually cause a lot of anger or at least a rude remark from me, I'm more able to just let slide when I'm high. It was just legalized for medicinal use here last year, but I only know one person who has a prescription, and they haven't opened any dispensaries. My state supposedly has the strictest regulations on medical marijuana out of any other state that has legalized it, and there are no mental conditions listed as being able to qualify you to get it. I'll probably be getting mine illegally for quite awhile. DX: NPD"
"Marijuana for Self-Regulation I just smoked weed yesterday and saw the movie gone girl. I was cracking up about what people might think of me and I was so blunt with people (dry humor) I probably came across as a d1ck. I like smoking though it takes my mind off anger generally and I just seem to enjoy whatever I'm doing. Dx-NPD with strong ASPD traits. ""In a prison environment, you would be labeled a psychopath""-psychologist"
Marijuana for Self-Regulation It also makes me feel open and less angry like you guys stated. Also things are less annoying. There's not much more to add than what you guys already said. Just came here to show my support for cannabis! PS I'm living in a red state. So no legal or decriminalized weed for me sucks having to deal with people that don't know how to run a business.
"Marijuana for Self-Regulation Understanding marijuana and using it properly is important. Years ago i used to smoke a lot of pot, but all I knew was that I was smoking pot. When I picked up my medicinal card earlier this year, I started to learn about this magical healing herb. The two dominant strains are the Sativa and Indica strains. Everything else is a hybrid variation of these two strains. Sativa's are best used during the daytime. Different strains will have different effects, but in general, sativa's offer a more energetic effect. Indica's are best used at night. Again, different strains will have different effects, but indica's generally tend to provide a sleepier effect. I tend to buy Sativa's that are 25% or more Sativa dominant and Indica's that are 25% or more Indica dominant. I don't generally play in the middle ground, with a few exceptions. The best methods for consumption are either as edibles, or via Vaporization. Joints, pipes, etc are all fine, but they include much higher health risks. If you are already a smoker you may not care, but if weed is all that you are smoking, use a vaporizer. I LOVE my Pax (by Ploom). Vaporization is immediate and will provide a peak effect for up to an hour (depending on the strain and quality of your bud) and a residual effect that could last up to two or possibly even three hours. Edibles take anywhere from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours to kick in, but when they do it happens all at once. Edibles can provide a peak effect for 4 to 6 hours or so, again depending on the quality of the material that the edibles were infused with. It ramps down from there, but it's not unheard of for edibles to continue having an effect that last 8 hours or more. You MUST be careful with edibles - sometimes it's tempting to eat one quarter of a pot brownie and say 'I'm still not feeling anything', so you eat the whole thing. You may not get the effect you were looking for if you overdo it like this - plus, you're just wasting your weed! I prefer not to use edibles anymore. I WILL NOT DRIVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE. Taking an edible means that I am stuck for pretty much the entire day - or I need someone to cart my ass around from place to place. If there's an emergency I may not be able to drive... I just don't like the limitations it imposes. Edibles are good if you're going to be somewhere all day anyway though. I also avoid edibles late at night - it often gives me a hangover of sorts the next morning. There are also concentrates and a whole host of additional forms of consumption available, but for the purposes of getting some relief from cannabis, the above approach has worked wonderfully for me. Favorite Sativa: A really nice Durban Poison! Favorite Indica: Doesn't matter - I'm going to sleep Links: https://www.leafly.com/ (database of strains and dispensaries)."
"Marijuana for Self-Regulation Well - based on my reading a lot of pwNPD end up self-medicating with their drug of choice because the internal difficulties are so difficult to deal with 24x7x365xLife. Marijuana has a higher rate of usage amongst those who've tried it. Based on my experience, alcohol always just made things worse. Marijuana on the other hand - has actually helped on a number of levels. It may even be a part of why I'm here typing this. Maybe it gave me the distance from my problems that I needed in order to be able to start accepting them... I don't know. By the way - I haven't smoked for the past two days. I still have plenty - but I feel like right now I need to be with this thing - no matter how hard it is! I don't want distance - I want LIFE!"
"How do other NPD feel about the prospect of dying? I'm at the point in life where health issues start to crop up. Some friends and people who I went to school with have died already from cancer and various other things. I've developed a growing uneasiness about my own mortality. The knowledge that over half my life is over and that it's pretty much downhill all the way from here is something I'm struggling with. The idea that I will cease to exist and the world will go on without me as if I never mattered at all...I feel a mix of anger, self pity, and fear. Mentally I want to block out the inevitable finality of it. I know it will happen, but I find myself searching for reasons why it won't - reincarnation, afterlife, etc. My NPD brain cannot accept that my destiny is a hole in the ground. I wish I believed in religion, I really do. How do you guys feel about it?"
"How do other NPD feel about the prospect of dying? I don't think you have to have NPD to pretty much think everything in the OP is a massive bummer.

"Is there any hope for us narcs? I am a self-aware covert narc who has made minimal progress in improving myself over the last 10 years. The problem is that I only want to deal with my disordered personality when I'm going through crisis. My latest crisis is that I took Jordan Peterson's 5 domain personality test, and the results really concern me (even though there's nothing there that is a surprise). I am extremely high in neuroticism, very low in consciencetiousness, middle in openness and extraversion, and low in agreeableness. I literally have the worst personality profile possible in terms of being horrible, unhappy, predisposed to all kinds of mental health and physical problems, and I just kinda feel like giving up. Is there any help for someone like me to actually improve themselves and live a somewhat bearable life?"
"Is there any hope for us narcs? Those things are not set in stone, they can change. They can even change with your mood, so one day you might show so results, the other day the opposite. Like if you feel bad, you probably won't be high on agreeableness. But yes, you can have reasonable expectations of yourself and not shoot for the stars, don't follow ideologies, always stay grounded, try and appreciate people as independent from you and equal, not as tools. Reject envy as a motivation factor. Certainly don't follow Peterson, because he is highly narcissistic himself, in the sense of quite pathological."
"My disturbing supply today I'd just finished a mowing job for one client and was on my way to the next. (I'm the owner-operator of a lawn & garden service.) As I was driving down the residential road, someone started calling out to me. It was a man on the curb. It was kind of an awkward place to stop, but I stopped my truck in the road---which wasn't busy---and walked over to him. He was sitting with a friend. He wanted to know how much I'd charge for mowing a heavily grown over lawn across the street. I gave him a ""bid"" and he began to haggle a bit. We agreed on price. He wanted to know if I'd do it right now. I told him ""no"", I've got two other people right now. I told him I'd give him a ""soft"" promise of about mid next week. Then he started to give me the usual ""old man wisdom"" about the work ethic and how the time to make your money was when you're young. He made a point in all this that he was 70. His friend looked about the same age, maybe a little older. I told him that sometimes you have to be careful of taking on too much work because it can damage you're body. (This, I know from experience.) He said, yeah, if you're old,like me, but ""you're only 30!"" I was a little amused, but I decided to just accept the compliment---or was it a joke???---and not tell him I'm 57. Now, of course, I know he could've been just being facetious, but the reason I suspect he may really have been serious is that these kinds of comments aren't isolated incidents. I'll admit there's some shameful boast in my posting this. But on another level there's a dark side to this phenomena, if it is indeed real, and the evidence, not all of which I'm revealing, suggests it is. There's a rush of ""supply"" when I get these comments, but there's also sense of unease in them too. It's kind of creepy. It's not natural. It feels almost ""evil"" sometimes. And how long will it last? The shoe has to drop some time. And when it does, will I be ready for it? The inner life of the secret schizoid is incommunicable."

"My disturbing supply today dune 1 wrote: Hello, this is my first post. heracles, do you feel uneasy because you're thinking of Dorian Gray? (I believe I have npd by the way, although it's hidden very well as far as I can tell.) I did read The Picture of Dorian Gray recently, a few months ago or so. I'd been intending to for quite a while. I enjoyed it a lot. There was a lot that I didn't identify with in Dorian, and a fair amount that I did. I don't want to come across as elegant or decadent, and I don't seek the hedonism he did either. In fact, it's a bit confused exactly what I'd want to do if I could be physically young again, whether forever or some extended period of time. But one thing I could relate to is the sense Dorian had that something was very, very ""wrong"" in what he'd attained. Something disturbingly ""off"". His sense of being irredeemably evil . This was expressed by Wilde in his own cultural concepts and images, which included religion. But this obsession pre-dates my reading or even really knowing much about Dorian Gray. I think I've explored it enough in my blogs and posts on this forum. How much is the perception that I look much younger delusion, wishful thinking, exaggerated, and how much, if at all, is it really true? Why should it matter to a man of character? Is it just crass vanity? I think the psychology of and experiential sociology (if I may coin a phrase) of ones personal looks, of ones personal physicality is more than just vanity. I don't think BDD or NPD theory really delve into it, really explain it that well. One part of it is that you really do become part of a different world as you get older. You're more invisible. And this is much more so for aging misfits and socially marginal people like me. But I'm still not quite sure why I have this mixed reaction of ""elation and relief"" on the one hand when I get these ""you look a lot younger"" comments followed by shame and dis-ease on the other. Am I in the real Twilight Zone, or am I only there in my deluded mind. I haven't quite cracked that nut. The inner life of the secret schizoid is incommunicable."

He eats very well and looks after himself, and he has lost all of his hair so the fact he just shaves his head helps him keep his youthful look, too. But yes, definitely weird supply. They showered you with their hoovering and compliments for you to take it all and happily go about your day, sticking to your own plan.

(Less so in recent years.) I also relate to your feeling of something being 'off', and I worry people will pick up on it, but they rarely do."
"42y/o just realized im covert narc Hi I'm a 42-year-old male and I've recently come to the realization I may be a covert narcissist. I've struggled in my life - very shy, withdrawn, introverted, anxious, negative intrusive thoughts, resentful, petty, cowardly, grandiose, I could go on and on. I have no friends or any real relationships, I just don't feel comfortable around people. The only time I feel comfortable around others is when I feel I am in control. I've been like this my entire life but had no idea the cause behind it. I thought I was suffering from trauma/cptsd which was causing of my issues. But learning about covert narcissism has fits me more accurately. I came to this realization recently from experimenting with psychedelics, this was after trying traditional forms of therapy and getting nowhere. The psychedelics have opened my mind up and I can see things about myself that I was completely oblivious to before. I see how I am manipulative and sneaky. I can't believe I am seeing these things about myself. It's humbling but also quite liberating. My life finally makes a little more sense. I believe I picked up this narcissistic wound very early in my life 2-4 years of age. I think my mother has a similar wound and my father was an aggressive alcoholic. I decided very early on, to not be myself. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest. But I also wondered if real recovery is possible. A lot of information out there makes you believe narcissists are doomed to live their lives in this way forever. However, following the breakthroughs I've experienced with responsible psychedelic use, I feel recovery is a possibility. Any thoughts? Thanks for reading if you made it this far!"
"42y/o just realized im covert narc It depends on what you define recovery as. Personality disorders are hard to treat and take ridiculous amounts of time in therapy to get anywhere. Since they usually use psychodynamic approaches the sessions can seem onfocused and seem not to work on anything in particular basically indefinitely, especially if there is lots of dissociation going on and you dont consciously perceive what you are working on. Ive myself been in therapy now for 5 years or so and while some stuff definitely changed theres other stuff that I feel has not changed at all. So I think you need a high level of thick-headedness (and depending where you live lots of funds) to go through with it. Not being able to control the outcome of it and - possibly also unconsciously - starting to learn to depend on someone else is also part of the process. dx: SPD"

"Schizoid Narcissist is not Covert Narcissist Just sounds like a representation of closet narcissism. Depends on what diagnostic system they use some see them as unable to coexist and others not. Some narcissists will be more higher functioning than others. Able to pull off the grandiose image while other can’t. I guess it depends on if you think more sub types and labels are needed, I personally don’t some narcissists are absolutely loners, there are plenty of example of psychopaths and anti socials being loners and lone wolfs it’s pretty common as well."
"""rebuilding your bubble"" Hi all, dunno if I should post this on the avpd forum or the trauma forum this one but here goes... To preface it I am not fishing for compliments but I am asking for advice or help. So recently I've been feeling kinda bad about myself and I feel that my confidence has been knocked from offhand comments and bullying, like the bubble which I lived in that protects me from feelings of inferiority or low esteem has been popped, and I am kinda struggling to even find footing or grounding resources or anything of the like, or how to get back to a stable place of self esteem. I have seen two therapists before for this sort of thing and also social anxiety, which ig is comorbid with VN, as well as looking for a new therapist, and talking to two close freinds who understand. That vaugly helped and I had rebuilt some of my esteem but I still don't feel the same. That mixed with a loss of self from emotional abuse which I (mostly) recovered from makes it basically impossible to find and footing in myself or what is going on around me just makes it harder to keep my own boat afloat if you get me. I think I have a tinge of c-ptsd now, or some form of disorder related to emotional abuse, so my shaky sense of self still feels a bit fragmented, and it's a total mess from an ex who completely f*cked me over, intentionally exploting my weakness. I am alright these days but still don't know where to turn or what to say. Idk. BDD and vulnerable narcissism/avpd traits. (possible psychotic traits/undiagnosed, or trauma/anxiety(?)"
idolize or accept reality? i have a question. sometime one has idealised vision of someone. for instance a parent. it's good to idolize because one can feel quiet inside. Do you think it's important to see reality? to be aware of how they are? or to quietly keep that sort of delusion.
"idolize or accept reality? If you have doubts about the person you're idolizing, then you should explore them. Delusions are rarely good (or never?) for us. It's easier to stay with them maybe, lazier, but ""better,"" no. It takes courage to explore them, and it does feel scary. Sometimes what we see will totally rock our world for sure, which feels terrifying. But if we just hang on and go with it, in the end everything gets better. Or at least that's how it has been for me. My worst example of this toppled me into a full year of cataclysmic change, but I came out on the other side SO MUCH STRONGER. It was absolutely worth it. And it all started with one small lifetime delusion about my mother that suddenly got shattered. -- Thu May 20, 2021 5:58 am -- If you have doubts about the person you're idolizing, then you should explore them.

"idolize or accept reality? Thank you pajaro. I don't know how much i idolize. I think i need to keep something good from them, inside myself. There was sort of earthquake some years ago and i needed much help from several people. I was confronted again with past. I think now most important for me is sort of freedom. Own freedom If the path leads to more awareness and freedom, reducing fake, guilt and internal tension it's good for me. If it's entering other's lives in a way i had succeeded in avoiding till now, maybe i'd better go for a walk and enjoy sun or rain. For the time being i think i need to rest from those people anyway. i'm not sure the post is clear. i'm sort of joining thoughts."
"idolize or accept reality? I think it depends what it does to you. Having idols can be a good thing, when they're people you look up to, when they have positive qualities you want to grow to have yourself - I guess having a personal ideal somewhere to work towards can be a good anchor point for a lot of people. Idealization on the other hand side can often just be a way to ignore everything negative and it doesnt really lead to you wanting to actually become a more mature / better / healthier etc person, but to put everything negative about the other person (and probably yourself) out of the picture. dx: SPD"
"idolize or accept reality? ""and probably yourself"" ... you mean that through idealizing the person i might idealize myself? So accepting more complex reality with that person could lead to accepting more complex reality in myself and might help me find that freedom i'm looking for, instead in trying to be good all the time."

So accepting more complex reality with that person could lead to accepting more complex reality in myself and might help me find that freedom i'm looking for, instead in trying to be good all the time. Im not sure about the cause-effect situation in your case, but I think its the other way around. Through maturing and growing as a person we becoem more open to the different aspects of both ourselves and the outside world, including other people. Something like idealization has the secondary gain that one doesn't have to face negative sides at all. So you dont have to worry, dont have to be anxious, dont have to be angry etc because your object is perfect and can't cause any of those associations or affects to arise; indirectly - by freeing you from having to perceive all those other aspects of your inner world (and the person) - youre then facing a very onesided version of yourself, too, which might seem perfect. So in that regard as a defense its very effective and thats what I would think also sets it apart strongly from idolizing somebody as an ideal, forming an aspiration to grow all the positive features one sees in the other person in oneself - as that requires one to be aware of what is missing. I think the ability to do that and ultimately to not fall into that need to idealize somebody / to split reality, is a result of personal development though and more an effect than a cause. But I dont know, it might be possible to work on the object-side, too? I guess you have to find out which one works better for you or what you think will work better in the long run. dx: SPD"
"idolize or accept reality? The person idealizing idealizes their own feelings through the idol.

Thank you for your comment, Akuma. I think that sometimes - say for instance with a parent - idealisation can put some pressure on oneself. I remember having read a book where the author perceived sort of relief, learning that the (distant) parent wasn't the perfect person he imagined. In case of distant parent (be dead, traveling, distant, busy, emotionally unavailable etc.),i think a child has no other choice then idealizing. Positively or negatively. In my case, i think i need to feel something good towards that person. Some people around me talked very negatively, describing that person as evil. Because of some anecdote, i was somehow confused. I think i need to keep some sort of bubble with good image. Maybe it's a bit exaggerate. Some years ago, someone who i knew very long time ago and didn't like, contacted me and offered to talk of the past. I didn't answer. Because i didn't like them. And an other reason was that i didn't want to break that bubble. -- Sat Jun 05, 2021 12:10 pm -- 1PolarBear wrote: The person idealizing idealizes their own feelings through the idol.

That's what I see in people that do this. I didn't understand that comment. Well, it's not about a known public person in my case. Can you explain what becomes toxic?"
"idolize or accept reality? ^ It was more a comment on Akuma's idea that idealizing idealizes yourself. I saw a lot of people idealizing, but it does not imply a personal perfection, and sometimes quite the opposite. It can be that you are so below the person idealized, that your imperfection is almost swept away because its for the cause, or for some altruism. Let's take a few examples. Sick children, they are usually idealized. So sports players will visit sick children, in order to show they are caring people, but it does not imply they are perfect, but when they do something wrong, like send another player in the hospital, then they can justify their existence by saying the visit sick children, so they aren't all that bad. Who else will visit them? Or plenty of people idealize Jesus, who they think is perfection, so they are nothing in comparison, but then again, others are also nothing. So then they go on abusing children and tell them that Jesus would be nice and would not defend himself. The person will admit readily being a sinner, but somehow they think they should get a pass, because they worship the right person. Toxic is all the bad stuff you impose on people and in this case, it is made worst, because it is not owned, it is blamed on the idol. So the person feels justified, because it is seemingly altruistic, and the victim cannot fight back either, because it would mean fighting the idol, and if they do, things just escalate because the idol is sacred and cannot be touched. So it is toxic, there is no resolution ever possible and it is bad for at least one of the parties, usually both. People still fall for it though, they never learn. The whole schtick is pretty obvious though, but people only see it when they don't believe in the idol, but don't question the need and usefulness to have some in the first place. They just want it to be the right one, the one that their feelings want, the one they emote about. That one they will fall for it, and become toxic and allow other like minded worshippers around that are also toxic. So then the will fight each others through the idol. And if it is a person that is idealized, then they will simply abuse the authority, because it is beyond reproach, up to a point of course. Politics is the same. People idealize their party, which gives them cover for whatever bad stuff they want to do. It does not make them perfect, just a conduit for their emotions to be carried through the idol. Same with ideas, ""values"". Climate change for example. People will use it to tell people what to do, what to eat, what to wear, what to consume, where to work, etc. Not because they are perfect themselves, most aren't and are oftentimes worst than the people they accuse, but it gives them cover for every little emotion they have and want to impose on others. If it is someone you know, their perfection may be used to do all kinds of things in the same way. You are just following orders. That is the defense the nazis had. Or it could play out in other different ways, but the idealized person is seen as a sacred object. It cannot be changed, so others have to change and be forced to change in the name of the idol. Parents can be seen like that of course. If they are idealized, children will fight through them. If one does not worship the parent, it becomes the black sheep of the family, not part of the play. It's a bit of a natural human behavior and most parents probably want it that way, because it gives them more power, but it changes when children grow up, or should. Then they start worshipping something else, or worst, someone else. It's why their is adolescent crisis, the children learn the parents are not all knowing, and all wise, and in fact are quite lacking. It creates narcissistic rage, because the reality is confronting the delusion. So there you have the answer to your question. Reality always win, and whatever quiet you think you may get from idealizing, not only it will be confronted by reality, but you will use it to abuse people and be abused in that same way."
"Question about delusions and some personality disorders It's common in most of them, if not all. But it plays out differently. Like the antisocial thinks he can get away with things, that life is a competition and there is no rule, so everything is permissible. That people can't hurt him, because he does not feel guilt and can endure pain. So strictly speaking, it's a type of delusion, or different belief. I think it is central to narcissism. It's basically the delusion that your image is your self, what you project is truly who you are, and that you can control that image. People are there to mirror you as an example, and therefore they become an extension of yourself which can be exploited since you are also in control of the image. So you could go on and on with all the others, I am sure they all have their specific delusion. Strictly speaking the societies we live in are also delusions, they are make believe things that don't necessarily mesh with reality. So they are delusions in that sense, but since it is a ""normal"" delusion, it is not called that. It might be called the ""current thing"" or the politically correct. or the faith, sometimes the customs. You need that to have a society, because the bondings are in themselves illusory, it's just habits, which can change, so in order to have ""something"", you have to create an illusion that it is. The only question is whether you can realize when it starts to be true, or stops being useful. But in the sense of different belief than the normal, all personality disorders are delusional, pretty much by definition. It's a different belief of the self and social relationships. In and of itself it means nothing, it's more useful if you look in the detail of what difference? but it is not the type that makes it problematic, it's that it is strongly held and inflexible."
"Question about delusions and some personality disorders In a way but not the same way as with schizophrenia where you might believe that the fbi is poisoning your food because they believe you are onto their schemes etc. Identity issues and a realistic sense of self and who you are and where you fit into the world can be distorted. Thinking you are more or less than what you are. Also it’s in how you perceive things, disordered people tend to find the negative in almost every situation even when there is really nothing there. Perceiving slights and personal attacks that aren’t really meant that way taking constructive criticism that is meant to help as an attack on your character etc."
"Good diagnosed NPD youtube videos? Hello, I've been recently diagnosed with NPD. It was an interesting realization to have. But I want to hear other diagnosed Narcissist's experiences.

Any recommendations? Thank you"
"What happened to this place? It’s barren, deserted. Hopefully, this means you’ve moved on with your lives and become better, more mature and wise adults. Some things you will always struggle with, and that’s ok. Struggling is what reminds us that we are alive. Imagine a life without struggle, with no hardships. Without pain. A life filled with comfort makes a soft vulnerable brain. Perhaps you were dealt a bad hand. Most of us were. Our brains have calloused and hardened from our hardships. Making you stronger, much stronger than those who’ve been cuddled all their lives. But at the same time, it has also made you develop toxic and dysfunctional behaviors that keep you down. Patterns that destroy those around you, but most importantly of all, yourself. Whether you agree with that or not will depend on how willing you are to gaze into the darkness of your mind. Can you accept the truth about yourself? Or do you still desire to cling unto your defense mechanics to protect you from the harsh reality that is your life? Because relying on your defense mechanisms to block out the bitter truths is the same as the person who lives life in ignorant comfort. The same as a person who forever stagnates, or sinks lower and lower in a landfill of their own garbage. There is great potential within you, if you’re right of mind. We choose our own paths. If you’ve never thought about it, your subconscious has been walking you down that path already. You are being lead by your fears, insecurities, pain, and all the negative patterns you formed from an early age. All those protective layers that helped you as a child and teen, still control and reign over you to this day as an adult. Because your brain chose the path of least resistance. If you realize you’re on the wrong track, change course. It is never too late. Seize your potential, heal yourself, and EVOLVE. Best of luck and I wish you all the best I don't fake it. I just make it."
"What happened to this place? Thanks for this text. As for the being on the wrong tracks, I had this feeling most of my life and still often do, sometimes it's the truth, but sometimes it's just my mind playing tricks with me and I simply need to invest more energy/dedication etc. Not always easy to tell which is which."

"Fear of the N injury Hi all, wondering if anyone else here shared this same ""fear"", like you have this subtle fear that others will detect or somehow figure out that you are an VN and are ""easily wounded"" (several people irl I suspect have detected this) and they will try to get a ""reaction"" or ""Injury"" out of you, like triggering a shame attack (VN/narcissistic defenses is a cover up for feelings of shame imo), and you are so hyper-anxious about having your grandiosity shattered/being humiliated (say horrible/invalidating things to you), and you know that others know your weakness, you can't fully like relax around others or something, could get thicker skin would be a solution, but anyway especially with those who you think or do actually know you have buried feelings of shame they will trigger you. how do deal/do you relate. BDD and vulnerable narcissism/avpd traits. (possible psychotic traits/undiagnosed, or trauma/anxiety(?)"
"Fear of the N injury Thank you for sharing, it's interesting question. I was very shy in the past and afraid of any attack. I see some directions to feel better: 1. Realise that not all people look for vulnerabilities. Learn how to identify them and avoid them or protect you from them through - for instance - be very polite and say nothing meaningful. 2. Learn to sort what you say and what you hide. Prepare a narrative for what you need to hide. 3. If possible, share your vulnerabilities with someone you can trust. Trust in the sense that they will not talk, that they will respect you. 4. Take care of yourself I don't know if it helps."
"Fear of the N injury Not really, if anything I think I would just deny it all together. I do think shame is an underlying emotion that is a factor in NPD but it’s usually covered up by other emotions like rage or contempt. Narcissist typically will jump through all sorts of mental hoops to not even justify the existence of shame or embarrassment. The answer to dealing with it of course is to accept yourself for who you are and who you are not. It’s ok to have flaws, it’s ok to accept criticism and sometimes other people (other narcissist) will try to tear you down because they are insecure about themselves. You have to realize this is about them, their issues and has little to do with you."
"How borderlines differ from me I'm constantly filled with rage. I feel no other emotions besides anger and it's so intense it's dangerous. I LOVE THE FACT I AM DANGEROUS. I always feel like I'm above people unless there's something special or unique about the person I'm comparing myself with and undoubtedly it's in relation to how much physical power the person wields. My criminal record says I've been arrested for assault but I never feel any remorse when I get mad in the moment or afterwards. I mean damn, I lost my dog of nearly 15 years and all I can feel is searing rage If someone crosses me irl (don't have enough care to deal with online threats) I WILL destroy them in any way I can and if I'm unable to do so I'm the most irritated and angry you can get. I'm aware I have NPD or a facet of that disorder because I don't care about being alone and when I rage it's because someone either laughed at me or did some other thing that makes me think they THINK they are above me and my main motivation is to SHOW THEM where they belong which is below me"
"Should I be checked Recently I read about PDs, when I had an existential crisis or whatever, and felt related. This confused me even more and now I want to figure out if I should be worried about something or not. So, my story: I had severe schizoid behavior when I was a child. I almost didn’t talk to anyone, only with my closest relatives, I was a closed child, I practically didn’t express emotions and maybe didn’t feel them much. Jie, as a child, I began to feel as if detached from people: I did not have a special need to talk with my peers, I was more attracted to adults, I wanted to find out and listen to what kind of conversations they had, what was happening to them; I did not understand why the children around expressed such strong emotions, it seemed to me that they were doing it for purpose, but I never could understand why; I wasn't empathetic back then, I didn’t understand why others immediately began to calm someone who was crying, I didn’t understand why they had such a strong desire to communicate with someone that they did it right during class, why did they go everywhere together. Along with this, I was kinda neglected child. Mli parents may not appear at home for days, sometimes even a month. and as I learned they did it even when I was a baby, I was looked after by the aunt with whom we lived. But it seems to me that at the age when I began to realize myself, I didn’t care about their adventures outside the home. More importantly, I never felt love, attention, care, praise and so on. But I wasn't abandoned at all. My parents actually cared and still care for me. they tried to make me happy. I always knew that they loved me. but this knowledge wasn't helpful at all. My mom has always been easily irritable and impulsive. At the same time, she is distrustful of the new and therefore the first reaction to my hobbies was very unpleasant. She often yelled at me. Now this is my trigger. I often provoked my mother into emotions, I think that was the only way to get attention from her. By middle school I realized how much I am addicted to attention and praise when my teachers did this to me. By the age of 14-15, I realized that this was not enough and that being a gray mouse was not effective, and I began to change. I became quite a socially active person. At first glance, very open and emotional, empathic, confident. Probably the perfect person. The changes went unnoticed and quickly. Later this caused a lot of problems. I no longer understand who I am. There was a feeling of emptiness inside. I realized how shallow my emotions were. I realized what a strong emotion of boredom haunted me all this time. I realized how much I satisfy my desires, nothing can stop me on the way to them. It started ruining my life because I had no control over myself and I still have no. I became disgusted with myself. And with that, I had a hard feeling that my whole personality is one big lie, like I never had it. Like all my thoughts, action, emotions were because of boredom. I did not know and still do not know who I am, what I want in long-term and what I really like or love. Also I realized I feel nothing for people. I never was attached to someone. Tho once I was addicted because of the attention a person gave me at the start of the relationship. Much earlier, I realized that I feel nothing for my parents, they are like strangers to me, but close simply because they know what I really am.And this is the only factor by which I determine how close a person is to me. I need people only to satisfy my needs of attention and entertainment. I often say strange or inappropriate things, twisted their words just to put them in awkward situation. Tho I do not only negative thing (But actually I don't think my behaviour is wrong). but I don't like negative attention to myself. This hurts me a lot. Recently I realized when I behave inappropriate I always blame otherns. Like they made me so and I have the right to those feelings, they hurt me, so I will act like an asshole. I tried to feel myself bad person, but I never can. I know that in the first place for me is me. I don't think I ever be able to care someone as much as for myself. As a child I felt myself I was better than others. Much better. Then I had some contradictory feeling -- I was best, but sometimes I had feeling of low self-esteem. Now I have no problems with low self-esteem, and I feel more superior that others again. Even tho I know I am a grand loser and feeling self disgust sometimes. I always feel like I'm a normal person with some problems, now I feel like I'm one big wrong. But I still love myself. That just drives me mad. I doesn't ever feel myself alone even tho I never had someone close to me even a little bit. And I don't think I will ever had. I don't have trust issues just because I don't care about others thoughts or words. Even tho I have superficial emotions, I am really an irritable person, and that is not superficial. I always have strong irritation inside and I'm always ready to show it. It's really intensive. I hardly can restrain myself from bad actions. Often I want physically hurt someone or something. And now even myself. I have no past or future influence for my actions or feelings, only now exist for me. I am very gambling and addictive to things that bring pleasure. And even more I am addicted for atteion and praise, I think I don't even need care or love. It is good to have only for not doing something yourself. I never felt guilty, regretful or remorse. But I felt ashamed. One or two times I guess. I don't remember any of these situations. But I know I felt that because someone knew something I don't want anyone to know. I think that was not really a shame, but some kind of sad. Also, I have tested on the internet. That was a test for Person's character accentuations. Not sure if that exists in the English language. But there was the first time I heard about Haltlose behaviour. So, there was such a diagnosis like Haltlose PD in past. That's just me with only one amendment. It's not easy to influence me. I have had this #######5 problem from my early childhood. I'm about to be diagnosed with depression. It makes me feel hatred towards myself, but the I like myself again. But (almost) all this stuff I write above was with me from my earliest memories, so I believe it's now because of depression. I think vice versa I have depression because of this. Yeah... A very large text came out that I did not plan. Anyway thanks for reading and answering."
"Covert vs Overt Narc Is it common for a girl who was with an Overt Narc, to fall for a Covert Narc? One of best friends was marriage to an Overt narc and has spent 2.5 years, healing after her divorce, met a really great guys (who we all loved), and now seems to have totally fallen head over heels with a Covert narc. The love bombing was from the very get go and she felt like they were soul mates and the mirroring was so transparent. I met him once and saw straight through him once he tried to convince me they shared ALL the the same. I tried to carefully voice my concerns as other fiends did and she has basically said she needed to take a break from our friendship she felt I wasnt being supportive. I cant help but to worry because she came so far since her marriage."

This whole post just exudes the problems with the narc abuse internet culture. You aren’t qualified to diagnose people, love bombing and mirroring are not symptoms of clinical narcissism and can appear in anyone. I think you are seeing narcissists everywhere.

This whole post just exudes the problems with the narc abuse internet culture. You aren’t qualified to diagnose people, love bombing and mirroring are not symptoms of clinical narcissism and can appear in anyone. I think you are seeing narcissists everywhere. It sort of sounds like you are abit jealous and not able to see your friend happy? I don’t mean to be blunt but this post is all sorts of inappropriate"
"Covert vs Overt Narc I did exactly this. Went from an overt to a covert. This was shocking to me at 1st until I realized studies show that you have a 90% chance from going to one narc to the next. 90!!! They are both one in the same animal, only difference is confidence. If the covert had the confidence the overt has, I know he'd be just as bad with the triangulation & wouldn't feel an ounce of guilt for any drama caused. I haven't been in contact with the OVERT for a year and a half because it got to a point where everything he said was not based in reality, ""liar"" is an understatement... however I'm still in touch with the COVERT as it's really hard to let go. We are no longer dating, but still talk as friends, but I'll be happy once I can cut off contact for good without feeling like he will turn on me in some way. How it's going.... Well, today is a weird day for me as last night I was on phone with the COVERT (who has driven 9 hours to visit me in person at least 5 times now) who told me that my pictures don't match who I look like in person. If I'm so ugly, why come back 5 times? Then today, the OVERT (who I haven't spoke to in a 1.5 year) has posted an away status that says ""you can put makeup on a pig but it's still a pig"". Like is my phone tapped or is this narcs just narcin? LoL. Strange coincidence right? At the end of the day, I'm older, aging...I'm no spring chicken anymore, but the truth is I have made money off my looks for the last 20 years & still do, but I've never based my value on my looks, even tho they clearly do. I got both the OVERT and the COVERT telling me I'm ugly, yet one keeps coming back to my state just to see me & the other keeps posting away status messages about me even after 1.5 of no contact! I'm so ready for a happy, narc-free life!"
"Covert vs Overt Narc Arguably it is typical of covert narcissists, they seek other narcissists in order to feel whole. It's why you see repeat victims, but they aren't real victims, it's just part of their inverse grandiosity as being selfless and not worthy. But yeah, sharing all the same would be a clue there is unrealistic ideation which will eventually fail once the covert reasserts herself or fails the expectations, whichever comes first."
"Who am I? I am a 43 years old male, divorced twice, both of the relations i simply left them, no discussions no arguments no try again. I have a narcissistic personality, I stopped my relation with all females (sisters and mother) in my family, firstly because they have this habit of sniffing around mine and other people's life and try to manipulate it, which I simply hate. I have no friends because of my inconsistency in life which made me move around country by country (live in europe), and so I kept losing contact with the friends or is simply hard to keep a relation. During my living I have destroyed my life completely several times, like quitting on really nice jobs, abandoning fully furnished houses where I used to live, leaving plenty of my stuff behind. Now I have a life which I am very thankful, I have a nice job, a house, food, great colleagues at work and I try to be as good as I can towards others. But.. I am aware of my fear of being judged by others, I tend to think that this fear of mine comes from the fact that in my kind i do judge others , I find no way to stop this cycle. I am aware of my negative traits and would like to find a way to be better and stop hurting myself."
"Who am I? Iznahs wrote: If we never judged others or ourselves, perhaps we'd never improve. Or perhaps life would be better or at least easier, I don't know. Not sure what to say but - hang on despite all of it. It is a mood thing. When I am in a good mood I am ashamed at the criticism I direct towards others who derive joy from traditional events, like births, christenings, weddings, piss-ups, sun/beach holidays. My reaction to most is ''i couldnt think of anything worse' and tend to look down on people who get a kick out of such events which I consider boring, tedious, unendurable. Really, they are lucky and I shouldn't hate them for it. But God it is so easy to hate ... when we are low in ourselves."
"im in hell hi from russia. im 29 and with every day as im ageing i feel more an more PAIN because i never had sex and the expirience for the sake of having which i lived and did everything. when i see young couples i feel that which if i describe it i'll go to jail. my shortest biogrpahy: --------- All i wanted in this life was two things: to be busy with work i like and, being socially demanded with it, to be sexually desired by a desired female peer when we are18-25. The first one became composing music and the latter one - impossible thanks to the life i've come to because of the first one. What with my interests and the way of life, i just stayed at home all the years since 2005 and i wasn't needed in the society by anybody, or my work wasn’t demanded and so I didn’t need anybody. That's all. The result is biologically natural: despair and aggression. I'm going to end up very badly. I consider all this topic important, so i write autobiographical chronicles. ---------- other content about me 2,5million word long diary, video diary, music *mod edit* people on the internet say i could go on a killing spree. but i cant do that because i need to do music. im in hell *mod edit* Last edited by lilyfairy on Fri May 27, 2022 12:33 pm, edited 1 time in total.

"Narcissistic injury Narcissistic injury, also known as ""narcissistic wound"" or ""wounded ego"" are emotional traumas that overwhelm an individual's defense mechanisms and devastate their pride and self worth The source is Wikipedia but I hope it will do for this thread, I was looking for a simple-clear definition, feel free to add more meaning to it. What is a narcissistic injury and what does it look like (in terms of behaviour and emotional state) as it is happening? What is the difference between simply feeling emotions such as sadness or anger or confusion, and having a narcissistic injury?"
"Narcissistic injury Sadness is when you loose something of value, anger when there is an obstacle between you and something of value. Confusion is when you don't know what to think. Narcissistic injury is when you self-image is attacked or devalued. Self-image is what you project outward to others. So what are the defense mechanism when someone attacks you? There are plenty. You could devalue the other preemptively. You could tell yourself they don't know you entirely. You could justify and therefore deflect the attack. Or you can empathize to know where the other is coming from and identify with it temporarily. Or you can ignore or explain, knowing the truth. From the top of my head, those might be the possibilities. If they fail, there is usually a rage, which is untargeted anger. Untargeted in the sense there is no obstacle, but there is a loss. So it's really shame and humiliation, but with no remnant of self-respect. Like when someone rage quits on a video game, it's similar. I think."

I am also not sure how much is self-image and the need to defend it related to having (or not having) a strong sense of self, but that's another, or not-NPD topic perhaps. ps. thank you for the insight"

The ice cream paragraph - I think people often get hurt or angered by ice cream comments when there are deeper unresolved issues in their relationship that they then project during such seemingly insignificant arguments. If there are no deeper problems, and the person reacts with rage, then I'd perhaps describe it as a narcissistic rage/injury. The negative emotion itself is not so much an issue in my opinion, and can be considered some sort of internal energy. I am just not sure to what extent is it possible to control or consciously focus the energy into something constructive in such a state. I will also check out the other thread you mention."

It can stay there for years, most of the time unconsciously. It's because it has to do with your own self image and self esteem, so it just comes back here and there and can literally change your life. That's a narc injury.

Perhaps someone at some point stole your lunch money, so now you hate lunches. So you deprive yourself of an activity, it is strong and out of control. A good example right now is Trudeau. He is acting out a narc injury, which makes him take irresponsible and irrational decisions the whole world can see and denounce. So his narcissism is biting him in the arse.

It's especially the case if it is not true, or barely true. Let's take Trudeau again, he sees one confederate flag, so he portrays a whole group as racists, so the conversation is over, they are discarded, so there is no way to get a conflict resolution, which only leaves violence as a recourse, which is what happened. If he had done like others had done, just denounce the flag, then it is a totally different ballpark. It's a more mature way to address things, and was less likely to create conflict.

But anyway, the point is that it tends to take the whole person, so it's a type of black and white, and the discussion is over at that point. Like in that case, it can work if your goal for the person is to stop acting like a dictator. Name calling then becomes justified, but some other things might not work, like saying he is the son of Castro. But yes, I think we carry many such injuries, and in many ways, they create who we are. Oftentimes, when someone can overcome one, they become a better person. So it's a good thing to be able to recognize them and address them, especially since after that, you then can avoid the same type in the future. It festers like a virus too. So if your mommy called you lazy, you might get a narc injury, which is not treated, will be there in your unconscious, and you might end up calling everybody you don't like lazy, or use it as some argument in the wrong places, or accuse everybody of it, say the whole world is lazy and you are the only one that's not. You might end up writing books about how to overcome laziness and do talks. Now, it might all be good and perhaps even true, but it does not solve your problem that eats you inside. You might wake up at night in sweat, having dreamt of someone calling you lazy, or perhaps a whole crowd of people in a party, they all turn suddenly towards you and point in your direction, and say ""there is a lazy person here!"".

Thanks for clarifying it, I did imagine rage in my head as a strong and loud outburst of anger. What you're describing sounds like supressed anger. Not sure how much of that do I have in my subconsciousness and whether it's better to somehow release it or not disturb it at all. I've unlocked some supressed emotions during meditation and it felt overwhelming at times. Perhaps in a form of exercise, therapy etc, under safe and controlled conditions. Perhaps it's better to focus anger on lunch/activity/place than on a person? Or not. Didn't think this through. It becomes a problem when you always do it and it's your main way of functioning.

And yes, I know there are always ways to justify it and rationalize it, and it's part of a syndrome. A lot of Trudeau in this paragraph, in a constructive way though, to convey psychological ideas. I don't know too much about his work, but I got cca 70% of it (without knowing the context and details). A different type of personality comes to my mind when I imagine a narcissist or a dictator (Trump, or Putin). Trudeau('s public persona) seems milder than that, mostly decent, fair and agreeable. I also admit I know very little about Trudeau's politics and not enough about politics in general. I am also never sure if the politicians act/speak freely (in public) or are tied to their political party. Relating to next paragraph - so if I want to stop a non-dictator acting like one, I only need to call them a dictator? Doesn't say what might happen if they are a dictator. Right. I mean it is not always a narcissist injury or a lack of arguments, but often is. I gave one example where it clearly is, but when people would call Trudeau a dictator, it isn't, because it's a good argument against him.

If it ends in writing a book (etc) and doing talks, it sounds like a mature way of dealing with the injury imo. I think creative activity might solve half of the problem, therapy maybe all or most of it. I am not sure what people were using before psychology was invented to deal with trauma. I also remember reading something about psychoanalysis and the term wounded healer, it's what this story's ending reminded me of, healing yourself as you are healing others. Maybe it's also difficult to perceive progress in such a scenario, perhaps it can only be measured from a time-distance, or in terms of constructive things done, or in improved relationships with people, even though the issue lingers on to eat us inside (meaning to say perhaps the progress is externalized somewhere in the world around us). I'm not sure if we can at least partially choose what will define us, there are probably numerous things people called us throughout life, both good and bad, why focus only on some of it. Or perhaps it needs to come from a parent, or at an early age. If parents have such a strong influence on their children, they could also positively influence them. I wouldn't say this story above on laziness has a sad epilogue, there seem to be ups and downs, and some struggle, which builds personality. From what I know of subconscious mind, it's not easy to make sense of these things as they are happening, but it becomes more clear with time/experience. Yes, that's a good point. There might be some other reasons, so then it could be displaced anger, or just using whatever to create a drama. But I was thinking once, I had this thing. Someone asks if we read a person, so I said ""yes"". But then in the convo, I ended up having a small criticism of the thing said, and the other totally lost it.

It's not always a problem. I get upset when I see lines, so I just use that energy to get back home faster. I am not sure if the purpose of a successful text/book etc is to have people agreeing with it/each other or to spark discussions. But I think a common language can be found in both cases, and I don't think you 2 were arguing (just) because you disagreed in opinions. So any case of getting disproportionately upset (along the anger-rage spectrum) is some sort of a narc injury? Are there even people out there who've never experienced them? Not trying to relativize, but I'm also wondering if psychologically/mentally/emotionally healthy person actually exists or whether it's just an abstract ideal we should strive towards. Even if they do exist, I don't think they're as common. I caught myself subconsciously replaying the situations that happened to me with other people (e.g. someone humiliates me, or is rude, and I do or at least attempt to do the same/similar to another unrelated person). I think it can be prevented by expecting a chain-reaction after any such negative incident in my life and by having some coping mechanisms ready to use (instead of creating further conflict). I tend to replay other people's positive effect on me as well, not as often though. Not sure how much effect do people generally have on each other, and what does it all depend on."

It's more that it can be suppressed also, but it is not strictly speaking anger. Like I said in the first post, anger is wanting to destroy an obstacle. But someone not validating your self image is not an obstacle to a good, because self-image is not a good in itself, or should not be. It's something that should be in sync with your actions and how others perceive you, so in the end, rage is against oneself. It's like in the story of Snow White. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqmIMvWnIV8 She thought the mirror would tell her she was the fairest, but it didn't, so it causes her a narc injury and rage, where she tries to poison Snow White. It's not really anger, because it is not SW's fault. She is not the cause of her not being fair, just the fairest, so it is envy and jealousy that drives her, not pure anger. It's her own sense of superiority that is in danger, her own self-image. So it looks more like self-hatred projected out on others. But that is the whole consumed thing. Just the narc injury could cause suppressed anger too, but it's not rage itself. In other words, it does not always cause rage, but in the narcissist it will. And I suppose in theory the right use of the word is when a narcissist is injured, it is narcissist injury, but it's a bit of a circular definition that does not tell much if you don't know what those type of injuries are. Iznahs wrote: Not sure how much of that do I have in my subconsciousness and whether it's better to somehow release it or not disturb it at all. I've unlocked some supressed emotions during meditation and it felt overwhelming at times. Perhaps in a form of exercise, therapy etc, under safe and controlled conditions. Perhaps it's better to focus anger on lunch/activity/place than on a person? Or not. Didn't think this through. You should. Yes, it is better to focus on acts than the person if possible. But at least it should be the bad act itself. Like for example a thief. It's the act of stealing that is the problem. Calling the person a thief might be legit. But if you don't like the thief and then call them a racist, it then makes no sense. Or in the case of Snow White, she did nothing, she just happens to exist, so it is a great example. The Queen should focus on being fairer, or just drop the competition she cannot win. Iznahs wrote: A lot of Trudeau in this paragraph, in a constructive way though, to convey psychological ideas. I don't know too much about his work, but I got cca 70% of it (without knowing the context and details). The context is how he dealt with the freedom convoy. Give the silent treatment, project and caricature the opponents, denounce them as such and then take measures that are disproportionate because it hurts his own image of a good responsible leader. People don't recognize his greatness, so it can't be because he sucks, but for some other reason. It's in the public domain, so if you want to see a narcissist injury and what it looks like in real life and in real term, it is the typical example. Iznahs wrote: A different type of personality comes to my mind when I imagine a narcissist or a dictator (Trump, or Putin). Trudeau('s public persona) seems milder than that, mostly decent, fair and agreeable. Yes, he is the good narcissist, but even then he can't fool all people all of the time. It causes him trouble, and in this case, a kind of trouble akin to a natural disaster like floods of famine. In his mind, it is the same, for a lot of people, it is an incompetent that is over his head and is grandiose. It also shows another thing about the narc injury, it is an existential threat subjectively speaking. Either the image is restored, or the whole thing breaks down. That is why the rage or the violence can be extreme. Just like the Queen, she has to get rid of Snow White, her existence threatens her own because all of her existence is invested in her image of being the fairer. If she is not the fairer, she ceases to exist. Iznahs wrote: Relating to next paragraph - so if I want to stop a non-dictator acting like one, I only need to call them a dictator? Doesn't say what might happen if they are a dictator. Yes. Well someone that is in good faith and has principle, if they make a mistake, will recognize it. If they are in bad faith, they will know they got discovered and will lash out and will call the cops. It's a narc injury for an undercover agent. His real goal was to bust you all along, so talking about it just alerted the Man. Iznahs wrote: If it ends in writing a book (etc) and doing talks, it sounds like a mature way of dealing with the injury imo. Depends. I was just watching a documentary on Hitler's henchmen. Goebbels was a bit of the typical fragile narcissist. They portray him as having that narc injury, which happens to be a real one, his leg that was not good. So it is a constant humiliation for him, and he seeks to overcompensate and attach himself to a more grandiose figure from which he seeks constant attention, plus he sends his rage on others, in that case mostly the Jews but also other cripples at first, which he wanted to exterminate. I don't think you could call it mature, but as the Minister of Propaganda, he was doing movies, doing talks and so on. He also burned books that disagreed with his own. Iznahs wrote: I am not sure what people were using before psychology was invented to deal with trauma. The question is more whether psychology does anything. I know for Catholicism, there is the sacrament of penance that does the trick, because basically you end up forgiving yourself, and are forgiven by the world at large. So it is designed for that. Otherwise I am not sure. Shamans had kind of animal quests, which also does some of that, especially when it is communal in structure. Mostly it happens in family structure and grooming more generally. It reinforces the good identity and allow the bad to be evacuated through sadness. Iznahs wrote: I also remember reading something about psychoanalysis and the term wounded healer, it's what this story's ending reminded me of, healing yourself as you are healing others. Yes, there is that archetype going around, and I am sure it exists. But more often than not, I think it is a kind of living their narcissism, like Goebbels. I am watching the sci-fi serie Farscape right now, and the personality of Zhaan is the wounded healer. She does not write books or do speeches though, she attends people individually no matter who they are, and I think it is the main difference here. She deals with real people, while the Goebbels type deals in ideology and archetypes. Iznahs wrote: Maybe it's also difficult to perceive progress in such a scenario, perhaps it can only be measured from a time-distance, or in terms of constructive things done, or in improved relationships with people, even though the issue lingers on to eat us inside (meaning to say perhaps the progress is externalized somewhere in the world around us). I'm not sure if we can at least partially choose what will define us, there are probably numerous things people called us throughout life, both good and bad, why focus only on some of it. Or perhaps it needs to come from a parent, or at an early age. If parents have such a strong influence on their children, they could also positively influence them. I wouldn't say this story above on laziness has a sad epilogue, there seem to be ups and downs, and some struggle, which builds personality. From what I know of subconscious mind, it's not easy to make sense of these things as they are happening, but it becomes more clear with time/experience. Yes, sounds good. Most of it is unconscious, you only basically know when you fixed it, and how you do that is a bit of a mystery, but time is a big factor. Iznahs wrote: I am not sure if the purpose of a successful text/book etc is to have people agreeing with it/each other or to spark discussions. But I think a common language can be found in both cases, and I don't think you 2 were arguing (just) because you disagreed in opinions. Well, I was, I don't know about the other guy. I suppose he was not. The point is that it could not be about me, because he didn't know me at all. Sometimes it is less clear, but the idea that some people invest in some ideas and take it personally when it is attacked is a sound one. It's especially the case in personality cults. If you criticize the dear leader, you can expect a lot of resistance, and it has nothing to do with you or the person resisting. They simply have invested their self in the other. But it can be about ideas too, and many other things, that was what I was pointing to. Iznahs wrote: So any case of getting disproportionately upset (along the anger-rage spectrum) is some sort of a narc injury? Well, I would say it is an ego injury at that point. Whether it is a narc injury has to do with the lack of defense mechanism against it, plus seeing it as an existential threat. Then it starts looking at a narcissist injury, and it is even more the case if it is about envy, then you know for sure. So Goebbels was jealous of people that had good legs for example, or the Queen was about one person being fairer. So that's the complete archetype, but there are many steps along the way to get there. Like I don't think Trudeau is envious of the truckers, but I still think it qualifies because of the lack of defense mechanism, and ability to communicate properly. He could be envious of others though, like Trump or Xi Jinping , but I can't read his mind. But given his overall personality, I would say it is. In other words, there are gray areas, and no, it is not just any disproportionate reaction. Some people are just explosive in their very nature for instance, or you might truly hate something for subjectively good reasons. The big tell tale is the existential threat I believe. Rambo might kill all the commies because they killed his new girlfriend, but they aren't an existential threat per say, although it kind of plays close to narcissism. It's more obvious in the first movie, where now the police is portrayed as an existential threat to his freedom, and that looks more like narcissistic rage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtWHgkNH5yU That and some PTSD thrown in, but for the viewer, it looks more like rage. The cops outside and the whole society are the existential threat, so the war never ends. Iznahs wrote: Are there even people out there who've never experienced them? Not trying to relativize, but I'm also wondering if psychologically/mentally/emotionally healthy person actually exists or whether it's just an abstract ideal we should strive towards. No, which is why I said you probably had hundreds of examples in your own life if you look broadly enough, depending of course on your age. Possibly the most important ones, you don't even know consciously. You probably only know the ones you can deal with consciously, and the others might come in flashes here and there in your memory. You don't know they are significant, or just how much. By digging, you will find more, that is guaranteed, but you have to have a broad enough understanding and not just look at Rambo style stuff. As for what is healthy, it's just that there isn't a real universal definition, it's a thing you know when you don't have it, just like national identity. You can tell Rambo has some issues, or the Queen, and this and that. You could avoid their trap and still have other issues, and some people might have their issues and still do fine overall. Just the same, you can tell Chinese food is not American, even if you don't know what an American is and what it eats. Iznahs wrote: Even if they do exist, I don't think they're as common. I caught myself subconsciously replaying the situations that happened to me with other people (e.g. someone humiliates me, or is rude, and I do or at least attempt to do the same/similar to another unrelated person). I think it can be prevented by expecting a chain-reaction after any such negative incident in my life and by having some coping mechanisms ready to use (instead of creating further conflict). I tend to replay other people's positive effect on me as well, not as often though. Not sure how much effect do people generally have on each other, and what does it all depend on. It's best to deal with problems as they happen and in a restricted way to the problem itself. This way your sense of self is not affected, because it's just one issue, not an existential threat. Since it's on the spot, there is no need to brood over it, or having it go into the unconscious and fester there, and being restrained allows the possibility of a resolution, so if it does not happen, you did what you could. Anyway, it's a long subject, and plenty of people talk about it, but overall, the bad defense of the narcissism is to attack the whole person, or the whole history of the relationship, and not the act itself, so it forces separation, or else you get into a very toxic relationship."
"Narcissistic injury 1PolarBear wrote: It's more that it can be suppressed also, but it is not strictly speaking anger. Like I said in the first post, anger is wanting to destroy an obstacle. But someone not validating your self image is not an obstacle to a good, because self-image is not a good in itself, or should not be. It's something that should be in sync with your actions and how others perceive you, so in the end, rage is against oneself. It's like in the story of Snow White. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqmIMvWnIV8 She thought the mirror would tell her she was the fairest, but it didn't, so it causes her a narc injury and rage, where she tries to poison Snow White. It's not really anger, because it is not SW's fault. She is not the cause of her not being fair, just the fairest, so it is envy and jealousy that drives her, not pure anger. It's her own sense of superiority that is in danger, her own self-image. So it looks more like self-hatred projected out on others. But that is the whole consumed thing. Just the narc injury could cause suppressed anger too, but it's not rage itself. In other words, it does not always cause rage, but in the narcissist it will. And I suppose in theory the right use of the word is when a narcissist is injured, it is narcissist injury, but it's a bit of a circular definition that does not tell much if you don't know what those type of injuries are.

But not at all a pleasant feeling (speaking from experience). What I'm trying to say is - I'm questioning whether narcisisstic injury should always have such a negative connotation, injuries are to be treated and healed I guess. You should. Yes, it is better to focus on acts than the person if possible. But at least it should be the bad act itself. Like for example a thief. It's the act of stealing that is the problem.

If she is not the fairer, she ceases to exist. I am not sure how to understand the term good narcissist, something like covert/vulnerable narcissist I assume. I don't know where the difference lies between being human and making mistakes, and then being either a covert or overt narcissist. If I try, I can find some narcissistic traits in almost everyone I enounter, which sucks because I started doubting the DSM criteria and the psychology in general. If we're all narcissistic, then nobody is. Yes. Well someone that is in good faith and has principle, if they make a mistake, will recognize it. If they are in bad faith, they will know they got discovered and will lash out and will call the cops. It's a narc injury for an undercover agent. His real goal was to bust you all along, so talking about it just alerted the Man. Not completely sure how to understand the term in good/bad faith, but I think I got the core of it, what you wrote makes sense when I apply it to various situations I've experienced in my life, taking the responsibility is not what always happens in any kind of relationship with a non-narcissist, but it never happens with a narcissist. It takes a mature personality to take responsibility. Depends. I was just watching a documentary on Hitler's henchmen. Goebbels was a bit of the typical fragile narcissist. They portray him as having that narc injury, which happens to be a real one, his leg that was not good. So it is a constant humiliation for him, and he seeks to overcompensate and attach himself to a more grandiose figure from which he seeks constant attention, plus he sends his rage on others, in that case mostly the Jews but also other cripples at first, which he wanted to exterminate. I don't think you could call it mature, but as the Minister of Propaganda, he was doing movies, doing talks and so on. He also burned books that disagreed with his own. I was watching/reading a lot of interviews by Putin these days, not sure how to understand his need to get rid of the ""nazis"". Projection perhaps. Or a conscious propaganda. Or being severly misinformed. The question is more whether psychology does anything. I know for Catholicism, there is the sacrament of penance that does the trick, because basically you end up forgiving yourself, and are forgiven by the world at large. So it is designed for that. Otherwise I am not sure. Shamans had kind of animal quests, which also does some of that, especially when it is communal in structure. Mostly it happens in family structure and grooming more generally. It reinforces the good identity and allow the bad to be evacuated through sadness. I had a phase in which shamanism seemed like the way to follow, and religion/spirituality/mysticism in general, not sure what to make of it these days but it still helps with all kinds of fears I think. Forgiving oneself as a form of therapy makes (a partial) sense. Yes, there is that archetype going around, and I am sure it exists.

I've always been a verbally gentle person as well as physically gentle and aggression and venom were always foreign, poisonous entities to me which I have always resented having to resort to on the odd occasion I have. With about a hundred guys in my school I hung around, ONE, Only ONE I could say was similar to my ethics. All the rest would try and belittle or mock each other and myself whenever they could. This was enough proof I needed to KNOW that I was nicer than 99% of people. Despite all this grace and honour, I'm still a narcissist. My superego demands I am nice to people always but at the same time I don't care about them. I don't have anyone, I don't need anyone and I don't properly love anyone but myself. Yet I am the polar opposite of the classic narcissist. I despise bullying, I hate cowardice and I hate being manipulative and abusive and I am not any of those things. I have to be in the same bracket as these lowlife, parasitic flag bearers for the term when I shouldn't have to. I'm a good guy and believe that I am far moreso a victim for being a covert narcissist and far more deserving of success than your classic overt narcissist who is stealing money, screwing his best friends wife and beating his children. I pity myself intensely and often cannot believe how little I have compared with how nice of a person I am. I think bravery stems from believing and knowing you are morally right and my inner monologue is constantly showing me proof of how more kind than everybody I am so I thus have this siege mentality and core of bravery which fuels every drive I have to do things. I shock myself at how impressive I am when this is in full flow. Does anyone else think and truly believe they are a GOOD GUY and believe they should win at life because they're more kind than everybody?"

Are you a good guy narcissist? Perfectlynumb. Your profile isn't very narcissistic really. Being right or kind gives you intrinsic self worth. You aren't using anyone or requiring a win over someone or needing anyone to value you. Check out OCPD. Addx has identified with your story and he has more going on with OCPD. Life doesn't always reward who is right or kind. That sense of injustice might rile you. Envy is about wanting the success of someone else that you feel you deserve. You might think the people who are kind are deserving. Adopting a moral code gives one a sense of certainty that they are doing the right thing. You have organized your life around this principle of kindness so you feel more in control and more content. Life just hasn't rewarded the same principle with those external symbols of success. You just have to reconsider what really is your currency to gauge success. Marg
"Are you a good guy narcissist? When someone says jealous, I interpret this as negative. When someone gets something like a promotion or something or if someone is hard on his luck, peoe will throw it in a person's face. Maybe the person expresses some resentment with or without justification. But even if a neighbor is filthy rich and throwing tons of expensive parties or outings that you can no longer afford due to a job loss or a sick family member or something, you want to participate in them too like before. But you cant. And you dont want it thrown in your face everyday. If you were to express frustration over it, a common thing to say, especially in a condesending voice is ""oh whats the matter? Are you jealous?"" He wants you to say yes. But is this really wrong? Especially if you dont want to sabatoge or kill him or anything. But he acts like you do."
Are you a good guy narcissist? margharris wrote: Perfectlynumb. Your profile isn't very narcissistic really. Being right or kind gives you intrinsic self worth. You aren't using anyone or requiring a win over someone or needing anyone to value you. Check out OCPD. Addx has identified with your story and he has more going on with OCPD. Hmmm I've read up on OCPD and that doesn't seem like myself at all. I'm not sure why you've seen a link tbh.
"Are you a good guy narcissist? Read the 3rd page of my dissecting NPD thread, there's an explanation of OCPD-like behavior in covert NPD. covert NPD features the ""good guy"" philosophy. the covert NPDer is unable to keep the ""subject""(controller) status for long, he always reverts to ""object"" status(controlled). As a controlled object he resents the controlling subjects and in this resentment ""moral fiber"" is found. The controlled object resents how its treated, don't the controlling subjects know the covert NPDer is a special(perfect) object, only to be used in special ways that prove how special it is. i'm not sure overt NPD can feature ""good guy"" philosophy, not that in touch with overtness myself if I had to, i'd postulate that covert NPD can gravitate towards the good guy philosophy and overt NPD can gravitate towards sadistic philosophy."
"Difference Narcissist and NPD There is something I don't understand about Narcissism. Is Narcissism the same as Narcissistic Disorder? I mean a person proud of their accomplishments has a narcissistic disorder? For example, a Nobel Prize winner who believes himself to be superior to others is an NPD? Is he even a Narcissist?"

I mean a person proud of their accomplishments has a narcissistic disorder? For example, a Nobel Prize winner who believes himself to be superior to others is an NPD? Is he even a Narcissist? Being proud of your accomplishments or feeling good after a compliment would be classified under normal / healthy narcissism. In that context narcissism means any form of positive investment into the self or something that [positively] regulates self-esteem and that is an integral part to mental health. If feeling ""superior"" is already a sign of pathological narcissism is a balance act I think, as pathological narcissism has a lot to do with how much investment there is into your self, how much has been withdrawn from the outside world and how realisic and complex that self-image (and in relation that of the outside) is. A ""healthy"" scientist would aim at superior knowledge for the sake of knowledge and because of a investment into that knowledge, and only secondarily that would be an investment into his self as a scientist - if that makes sense. dx: SPD"
"Difference Narcissist and NPD I don't think it's the same, I'd say narcissists (people with mild NPD if there is such a thing) are a lot more common than people with NPD. My occassional narcissism seems to be triggered by external events, it could also be what they describe as narcissistic injury (getting angry or upset over things?), but I don't think I could fit into the NPD description. I also think I have somewhat unrealistic image of myself, and I do seem colder than an average person. Don't want to make this about me, but I only have myself to analyze at the moment."
"What is a Discard? Is this a description of one? Note to moderator: before you approve this please let me know if the topic is not narcissism - I'm unclear on this. I've heard people talk about a discard in Narcissism before, so I wondered if this would shed any light on: A cognitive process where people are literally discarded in terms of worth. As follows; An individual has a strong overriding schema, and another individual tries to contravene a law in that schema. The other individual has also tried to insult the first person's Agency. Because those two things happen the individual diverts the idea containing the rights of those individuals in line with the overriding schema. The individuals are worthless and do not deserve because they have contradicted the overriding schema. It feels like some sort of discard to the individual. Worth drops out, those individuals have no worth, they are literally valueless. (As living beings) The overtone for the reaction to the schema as a whole is Persons who contravene against the individual's Right (The Law) are in the wrong / they must be prevented and severely harmed. It could also be applied to people ""shutting the door on other people"" if worth is the motivator? I don't know what could shed light on anything in here or make more sense of the concept. Trying to make more sense of what/how/why what is the cause of this."
"What is a Discard? Is this a description of one? The narcissist concept is based on exploitation and idealization. It's like you get a new toy, it is all shiny so lots of attention is given to it, but then the toy eventually fails the idealization, it has flaws, or is used up a bit, so it is thrown away for a new toy. So it is all white one day, and all black the other. The problem is that things rarely are non white, so the idealization phase is unrealistic, and the future discard is just a matter of time. You can see it at play quite easily if you followed Trump's doings when he was president. He would get someone working with him, and he would be all great, if not the greatest, and could do no wrong. That's the honeymoon period. Then the person would show some independence, not act like a total appendage of Trump, so it would create rage, a discard, and a lot of accusations of this and that to justify the discard. What you talk about is pretty different. It's more like an overly rigid ethical stance, or just rigid. I don't think it is narcissism at all, because narcissists have poor boundaries, while this would be the opposite, having strict boundaries. I would say it is more obsessive-compulsive type of personality if it is pathological. But no, it is not a discard, just the same as not allowing strangers in your house are not discard. Of if someone comes in and mess things up and you kick them out, it is not discard, because there is no ""ownership"" to start with, it's simple justice. To have discard, you need a slave/master relationship, where the master ""owns"" the slave to some degree, and then he discards when the slave stops working. The opposite happens too. A narcissist slave might rebel and discard the master if said master does not act according to the ideal, if the image is not the right one. Slave and masters are interdependent, and have porous boundaries, and the justice between them is on a different level than what you describe."

However the description of the disorder seems to hinge on interpersonal involvement; I thought that was only the case in one or two subtypes. I thought NPD was primarily a label for disorders of self (and subtypes of)? It's both, just like any personality disorder. The naming says it. Personality has to do with a construction of the self, and the disorder part is social. The discard is mostly social, or at least it is the easier to spot, and what people usually talk about. But it can happen with objects, jobs and so on as well, thus why I gave the toy comparison. The process of idealization and devaluation can happen in everything. It can also happen in the self image as well, political stances, etc. But if someone does it, nobody will see it, so it does not really bother anybody. So while personality disorders may create internal problems to the person, nobody cares until it affects them. So in that sense, the diagnosis are mostly interpersonal. user1357911 wrote: Having re-read through the part of the book I was looking at, it does say ""need for admiration"". But I read pretty quickly and I previously thought that was only NPD with, is it HPD traits(?) It's usually connected with narcissism. HPD is more about wanting to be the center of attention. Of course they can go together. user1357911 wrote: I expected the discard to be something to do with false/true self or with disorder of self? It does. Idealization is basically the false self. The feature of narcissism, is to identify with the idealization, it's what makes it different than most people if pathological. Most people will idealize, but they keep a kind of secret sense of self. They know they are really different than their social image. So they play roles in public, and another one in private. The narcissist is always the same role at a conscious level. What it leads to in the long run is a denying of the self, the true motives, the true desires, etc. Everything gets subordinate to the image, or the false self. It's also why there is a need for admiration. Since the self image is idealized, then others are expected to see the same thing, otherwise the relationship breaks down. One common example, are people that want to be called ""doctor"" or ""professor"". This is an idealized self and is also a social role. A normal person knows it is just a job, and the status is not the total self, so when they deal with other people, family, friends and so on, or outside their field of expertise, they know they are not that role anymore, that they are equal. But some people think that image, that role, is their whole self, they are invested entirely in it, and they want everybody to acknowledge it as such, and with the same reverence they have towards it. That attitude transposes everywhere and they stop being able to interact simply as human beings on an equal level, so in other words, they seek admiration in all things, even if it does not relate to that status. It's delusional grandiosity. user1357911 wrote: What is rigid, I mean there are only absolutes, if someone steals something from you they take it, or if they are rude to you they have neglected your personal agency. However I wonder if I missed the meaning. I don't think it's an overly rigid ethical stance, but it might be a rigid pattern of behaviour. It's just that to have functioning relationships, you have to be able to give some and forget some. You have to allow for mistakes, or to some divergence of opinions. Someone overly rigid would not accept mistakes or would not accept differences of opinions. It also depends on how close the person is. So yes, in theory the ""stance"" might be fine, but the real issue is whether it is a deal breaker type of thing. If it causes relationship breakdowns more than the normal. Someone might cheat on you, and obviously it is not rigid to say it is bad, but the question is what are you going to do about it? to you denounce it and move on? do you think it is a deal breaker and have to close down all relationship with the other? That is where there is no absolute, it really depends on the individuals involved. Some parents will reject their children if they do bad things, don't live up to their expectations, so they put their principles above everything, but some, probably most, will accept everything in the end. They may not like it, but they will accept it. So someone too rigid, would be the first type, and then again, it would be on small things. Small details, when someone is a little imperfect, or make a mistake. I do think it can happen in narcissism, but the overall thing is broader, it is not primarily that, because if you say it like this, you miss the role of the image, that is quite crucial. There are plenty of people that are too rigid, and they aren't narcissists at all. But when a narcissist would do it, it would be for other reasons. Not for moral reasons, but because the self-image is threatened. They will try an pass it as moral though for sure. They won't say straight up it is not like me, so I reject it, they will find more general reasons, moral reasons, but the reality is different. In the myth of Narcissus, N. meets Echo, and everything goes well, as long as she repeats what he says. She has to mirror him, and essentially be him, and reflect well on him. It's the image, the false self. When Echo shows herself as an individual, as ""different"", once the delusion is broken, it is when N. discards her. And it is a discard like throwing away something bad. He does not try to talk or interact or anything. It is a brutal and immediate rejection, just based on the fact she is not him. The myth is the basis of the narcissist construct. It's delusional because he thinks he is essentially talking to himself, so he ends up being condemned in doing just that, and admire himself in a pond. user1357911 wrote: Isn't that again, codependancy or narcissism where external supply to an idea is needed to help maintain a false self (vulnerable narcissism,) rather than Primary Narcissism, where the meaning of ego as ""fragile"" takes on a completely different psychological explanation?

I think the primary narcissist has the same need, it just plays out differently. It's why I talked about master/slave. The master is not ""independent"" of the slave anymore than the other way around, it's just that the other becomes and extension of the self, so the idealization is not internal, but external. It is about shaping others in your image. If the object resists or shows itself to not be suitable, then it is thrown out, discarded. And by object, I mean people too, primarily. It's still a porous boundary, because two people become one. When the object shows independence, it is not part of the idealized self, and therefore must be cut out. It kind of threatens the self in that way. If you see yourself as a leader, let's say, and it's a narcissist thing, then you will lead always in everything everywhere, and if people don't follow, it is a threat to authority, to the leadership, and needs to be cut out, discarded. That is why in the definition, exploitative behavior is there. It's exploiting people for your own gain and self, not for their own good. And the reason for that is porous boundaries, not being able to tell which is mine, and which is others. It's true that the ideal might be stronger and usually more stable than for the slave, others are not necessary to create it, but there is still a need for validation and admiration. Independent people don't need those type of validations all the time, they are secure in their self, and don't need everybody to accept it. 1PolarBear wrote: I would say it is more obsessive-compulsive type of personality if it is pathological. Rigid idealizations of moral standard?[/quote] Right. The idea of purity, etc. Everybody has to follow the rules, and no exception allowed. It's more of an obsessive-compulsive thing. The thing is that both kind of rejoin together in that it is based on superstition, but the object of worship is different. For one it is the law, but for the narcissist it is the self. Of course, sometimes you get both together. One narcissist might be an enforcer of the law, and avenger. So it gets hard to differentiate in those cases, so the boundary thing to me is more meaningful. It's why I thought your definition was lacking, it does not differentiate well between the two. In practice it is fairly easy to distinguish though. The obsessive-compulsive is coherent with himself and is the first one to apply what it preaches because it is based on a true belief that by doing the right thing, good things will happen. It may create a pathology where nobody is good enough for the standards and some sort of culling the chaff too readily. If you are dealing with a narcissist though, it is usually a rule for thee, and one for me. They don't follow their own rule, thus the delusion of grandeur. And it's because there is no true self, it's all in the image and what others reflect on you. 1PolarBear wrote: To be fair that sounds like the sort of thing the person thinking it would have said about it a year ago. ""It's just simple justice"". But it is a discard because in the action the person is literally discarded - not meaning to say it has anything to do with the cycle you explained using Trump. Well yes, it is discard strictly speaking, just not the narcissist type. What happens a lot in those relationships, is that the person gets discarded, but they don't really know why. It just comes suddenly, and they are left to try and figure it out. Like ""did I do something wrong?"", or ""what could I have done to fix thing?"". One day the person is nice, and the other a stranger. If you do something wrong, and there are good boundaries, you know what was wrong, because there was communication. But if the communication is lacking, because you are supposed to be the same as the other and read their mind, then it is a lot harder to tell if not impossible. It could be anything, but really it is just being different. Showing some independence. Sometimes people will say it is like walking on eggshells. So just the fact you exist, there is the risk of some sort of an outburst, and eventual discard. Of course you won't know, because there is no clear boundary. The discard is not even sure to happen. It might or might not. There is also a game where the narcissist tries to ""reconquer"", so sometimes there is a discard, but then the mere fact the person is now independent will trigger the opposite effect, because the need to control that person is too strong, or there is some jealousy that someone might get the goods. Now, if someone was truly doing it based on some boundaries and rule, that type of behavior does not happen. The rules are known and the discard is final. Just like being condemned for a crime. The laws are known, and the punishment is final. So if there is a discard, you would expect it to be final, or last quite awhile at least. Not some push and pull type of thing, or being threatened for existing. 1PolarBear wrote: Interesting comment on boundaries, again I thought poor boundaries was a subtype issue? (Interpersonality again) Poor boundaries were most commonly associated with codependancy? Although what you have to say about strong interpersonal boundaries is true. There is no codependancy.. Well, it is my opinion, maybe others see things differently. You have to realize that in today's society, people see masters are free people. I just don't see it that way, and lots of thinkers in the past didn't either. It just got lost. So I am not surprised, that they would think this way. I just don't think it is accurate. You would have to give me some links to see by myself what those people are saying. I do think that usually, what people talk about the vulnerable type usually have poorer boundaries, than the other, but the other isn't healthy either. Maybe they confuse boundaries with sense of self too. Of course someone with a poor sense of self will show really poor boundaries in an obvious manner, but it does not mean the reverse is true. You can have a strong sense of self and still have poor boundaries if you don't respect other people's boundaries. It's like a sociopath, they have poor boundaries, but their sense of self is usually just fine. If you steal from someone, it is poor boundaries in my mind, it's the whole point of having boundaries. Now they might have personal good ones, meaning they like to steal, but don't like being stolen. That's what I mean by porous boundaries. And that is what usually happens in the primary narcissist, the one of the DSM. They exploit, so it is poor boundaries pretty much by definition in my opinion. Now there is some other type of poor that is more like none. Can't remember the name, but it's like someone with no identity. Identity diffusion I think. That is closer to borderline pd, and also the vulnerable type of narcissist (some of them). Very often people confuse the two, because they overlap a fair bit. I say that from the people here trying to autodiagnose. And really it is hard to tell from the outside too. So maybe it is what they meant. You have to remember narcissism is a common thing in everybody, it's just not pathological in everybody. So it's not a monster thing that only happen to a few. It's more a degree of adaptability and pervasiveness, which is quite subjective. 1PolarBear wrote: I'm trying to look at the individual psychological processes.

You'd have to provide links or something. I am not saying it is wrong, just maybe not going to the essence of the process. I agree it is possible that it happens. It is common in academia these days. People get a value, they identify with it, it becomes their god of sort, then they try and apply it everywhere without even trying to do it themselves, or actually doing the opposite without realizing, or thinking it is not the same because they are good, while the others are bad. It's a common narcissistic projection. You can look at Melanie Klein, she attributes every stereotypes to some narcissistic projection and black and white thinking. The good object, the self-image, has to be expulsed out of the self, and this is done by blaming others for it. So you idealize others into bad. It's not a discard though in the sense I understand it, because usually there is no real relationship to start with. Maybe that is where the difference is. What I understand by discard is basically the person is in a relationship, then suddenly they aren't. It is the silent treatment. It's how it is usually used here, or was when there was people in the forum. It's about suddenly being treated like trash after a love bombing. And it's the idealization/devaluation cycle."

Isn't it the underlying idealization, importance placed on the idea of the traits and the underlying schema which lead to denial of the self, (actual actions, true motives, true desires etc.?) So somehow the false self (idealized image you explained) ends up in the lead because intent is in the lead and intent is driven by comprehension? I don't know about the need for admiration although I comprehend what you're explaining. Outside of the criteria, an individual could have a completely false self in relation to their own behaviour and go on to rationalize people's reactions instead of needing others to see the same thing to support that ego perspective. (the support to the schema could be internal, denial, rationalization, etc.) Having said it sounds like you explained the false self or image as being a driving factor and not a rationalization, perhaps that is the difference between the two concepts?

Therefore for example if there were cases of the opposite, if the person was not a doctor, they might try to rationalize that they could have been, or even go as far as to pretend to be one.? The two things seem different, that was what I wondered about the need for admiration. However isn't Dr just a job if you are healthy? - and even someone who finds it superior would still not put on an act about their role as a doctor? 1PolarBear wrote: That attitude transposes everywhere and they stop being able to interact simply as human beings on an equal level, so in other words, they seek admiration in all things, even if it does not relate to that status.

I think the idea I posted is more that the person sees red and uses a black and white - not a social discard - more like ""you have done this now you have to die.""

Having said, I can see how acting like someone with a false self and reflecting badly on that person would draw attention to the denied items - presumably in the more general sense it depends if there is anything the individual needs to deny or if there is a second rationalization behind the false self, whether the false self would give way to the second rationalization or whether the individual would suffer/self judge. 1PolarBear wrote: I think the primary narcissist has the same need, it just plays out differently. It's why I talked about master/slave. The master is not ""independent"" of the slave anymore than the other way around, it's just that the other becomes and extension of the self, so the idealization is not internal, but external. It is about shaping others in your image. If the object resists or shows itself to not be suitable, then it is thrown out, discarded. And by object, I mean people too, primarily. It's still a porous boundary, because two people become one. When the object shows independence, it is not part of the idealized self, and therefore must be cut out. It kind of threatens the self in that way. If you see yourself as a leader, let's say, and it's a narcissist thing, then you will lead always in everything everywhere, and if people don't follow, it is a threat to authority, to the leadership, and needs to be cut out, discarded. That is why in the definition, exploitative behavior is there. It's exploiting people for your own gain and self, not for their own good. And the reason for that is porous boundaries, not being able to tell which is mine, and which is others. It's true that the ideal might be stronger and usually more stable than for the slave, others are not necessary to create it, but there is still a need for validation and admiration. Independent people don't need those type of validations all the time, they are secure in their self, and don't need everybody to accept it. That was interesting to read; I'm only familiar with that in a person's theory of mind soft concept for emotion interrelational comprehension, or in their Agency. (rather than as a role which plays out) Can only imagine shaping others in a person's image as a contravention when it comes to what I was thinking of. i.e. the individual would not believe it was correct on all levels. It is as if there is a way of people being afforded different roles specifically - although that happens frequently in the example I gave I can only imagine a person lacking worth, not having a specific role e.g. a mirror. It was interesting to read but at this stage without doing more reading etc. I think I don't understand the topic fully yet. 1PolarBear wrote: Right. The idea of purity, etc. Everybody has to follow the rules, and no exception allowed. It's more of an obsessive-compulsive thing. The thing is that both kind of rejoin together in that it is based on superstition, but the object of worship is different. Cult leaders as an example? Would that make someone like Hitler obsessive compulsive? (massive cult type ideations where everyone has to follow the rules about the Jew? -Assuming he believes he is correct and is skewing the concept from morality so he views himself as a highly moral person? 1PolarBear wrote: For one it is the law, but for the narcissist it is the self. Of course, sometimes you get both together. One narcissist might be an enforcer of the law, and avenger. So it gets hard to differentiate in those cases, so the boundary thing to me is more meaningful. It's why I thought your definition was lacking, it does not differentiate well between the two. In practice it is fairly easy to distinguish though. 1PolarBear wrote: The obsessive-compulsive is coherent with himself and is the first one to apply what it preaches because it is based on a true belief that by doing the right thing, good things will happen. It may create a pathology where nobody is good enough for the standards and some sort of culling the chaff too readily. So the idea I was thinking of sounds more like a trait similar to the obsessive compulsive plastered onto the top or interwoven with a disorder of ego/self with a different issue underneath, hence why the discard example does not look like NPD perhaps, despite being a discard. 1PolarBear wrote: If you are dealing with a narcissist though, it is usually a rule for thee, and one for me. They don't follow their own rule, thus the delusion of grandeur. And it's because there is no true self, it's all in the image and what others reflect on you. Or perhaps not because the same would happen in the example I gave, although it does not contain a need for admiration. Presumably that would be because it would be a ""disorder of self or ego"". It sounds like a cross between the two reaction types. 1PolarBear wrote: What happens a lot in those relationships, is that the person gets discarded, but they don't really know why. It just comes suddenly, and they are left to try and figure it out. Like ""did I do something wrong?"", or ""what could I have done to fix thing?"". One day the person is nice, and the other a stranger. If you do something wrong, and there are good boundaries, you know what was wrong, because there was communication. But if the communication is lacking, because you are supposed to be the same as the other and read their mind, then it is a lot harder to tell if not impossible. It could be anything, but really it is just being different. Showing some independence. Sometimes people will say it is like walking on eggshells. So just the fact you exist, there is the risk of some sort of an outburst, and eventual discard. Of course you won't know, because there is no clear boundary. The discard is not even sure to happen. It might or might not. There is also a game where the narcissist tries to ""reconquer"", so sometimes there is a discard, but then the mere fact the person is now independent will trigger the opposite effect, because the need to control that person is too strong, or there is some jealousy that someone might get the goods. Now, if someone was truly doing it based on some boundaries and rule, that type of behavior does not happen. The rules are known and the discard is final. Just like being condemned for a crime. The laws are known, and the punishment is final. So if there is a discard, you would expect it to be final, or last quite awhile at least. Not some push and pull type of thing, or being threatened for existing. Yes that makes perfect sense, the first half would occur and if any discard the discard would not involve going back looking for the person, unless for example the person changed the action and trait which caused the discard. - As you said just like being condemned for a crime. 1PolarBear wrote: Well, it is my opinion, maybe others see things differently. You have to realize that in today's society, people see masters are free people. I just don't see it that way, and lots of thinkers in the past didn't either. It just got lost. So I am not surprised, that they would think this way. I just don't think it is accurate. You would have to give me some links to see by myself what those people are saying. I do think that usually, what people talk about the vulnerable type usually have poorer boundaries, than the other, but the other isn't healthy either. Maybe they confuse boundaries with sense of self too. Of course someone with a poor sense of self will show really poor boundaries in an obvious manner, but it does not mean the reverse is true. You can have a strong sense of self and still have poor boundaries if you don't respect other people's boundaries. It's like a sociopath, they have poor boundaries, but their sense of self is usually just fine. If you steal from someone, it is poor boundaries in my mind, it's the whole point of having boundaries. Now they might have personal good ones, meaning they like to steal, but don't like being stolen. That's what I mean by porous boundaries. And that is what usually happens in the primary narcissist, the one of the DSM. They exploit, so it is poor boundaries pretty much by definition in my opinion. That part of the definition slipped my mind. Then if you would regard someone stealing or cheating on a partner as having poor boundaries, but this is presumably a different sort of boundary i.e. could be ""you are my property/an object/an extension of me"" in Agency rather than codependency as I imagined it in an idealization and discard.? When I talked about boundaries before, I was thinking about things which were strictly codependency, stealing would mean a boundary is being breached but would not imply codependency? 1PolarBear wrote: Now there is some other type of poor that is more like none. Can't remember the name, but it's like someone with no identity. Identity diffusion I think. That is closer to borderline pd, and also the vulnerable type of narcissist (some of them). Very often people confuse the two, because they overlap a fair bit. I say that from the people here trying to autodiagnose. And really it is hard to tell from the outside too. So maybe it is what they meant. You have to remember narcissism is a common thing in everybody, it's just not pathological in everybody. So it's not a monster thing that only happen to a few. It's more a degree of adaptability and pervasiveness, which is quite subjective. Yes I noticed the similarities to borderline PD in the quote above as well. I was pretty sure its possible to not have narcissism, to simply have an idea of Theory of Mind, other, and a knowledge of self? Is it really normal as such rather than more common that it ought to seem to be? I am not surprised at people trying to autodiagnose though, psychiatry and psychology is very expensive and people here in the UK don't generally get a looking when it comes to psychology (or at least from what I've seen.) - and PD presumably requires a lot of psychology to diagnose. It seems the doctors go straight for axis 1 diagnoses unless its EUPD at the moment. 1PolarBear wrote: You'd have to provide links or something. I am not saying it is wrong, just maybe not going to the essence of the process. I've been reading Personality, Personality Disorder and Violence. (Mary McMurran, Richard Howard.) Its not an online link its printed only as far as I know. Some of it has sunk in and some of it has so far gone in one ear and out of the other. The example I gave is not from the book. 1PolarBear wrote: I agree it is possible that it happens. It is common in academia these days. People get a value, they identify with it, it becomes their god of sort, then they try and apply it everywhere without even trying to do it themselves, or actually doing the opposite without realizing, or thinking it is not the same because they are good, while the others are bad. It's a common narcissistic projection. You can look at Melanie Klein, she attributes every stereotypes to some narcissistic projection and black and white thinking. The good object, the self-image, has to be expulsed out of the self, and this is done by blaming others for it. So you idealize others into bad. It's not a discard though in the sense I understand it, because usually there is no real relationship to start with. That sounds like some sort of syndrome in itself... sometimes you'd just wonder if they're not thinking when they act? Expulsing something from the self, isn't that likely to be something particular that's been taken and applied from a disorder description? - But obviously not everyone would have that disorder. 1PolarBear wrote: Maybe that is where the difference is. What I understand by discard is basically the person is in a relationship, then suddenly they aren't. It is the silent treatment. It's how it is usually used here, or was when there was people in the forum. It's about suddenly being treated like trash after a love bombing. And it's the idealization/devaluation cycle. Yes I've seen it used that way in relationship discussion, but when I saw the psychological mechanism it made more sense that way when I read it. I found it makes a massive difference trying to piece apart the colloquial from what the psychologist is meant to know sometimes helps understand PD properly. (Psychological and psychiatric jargon uses words in completely different ways, so the descriptions written on the pages of clinical manuals are not meant to be read literally in plain English without psychiatric/psychological training. It makes them tricky to read without piecing apart what is actually meant. Yes its awfully quiet in here. I don't know if that is a bad thing though if perhaps no one needs the place? What the hell is a love bombing - there is probably a definition link somewhere."
"What is a Discard? Is this a description of one? user1357911 wrote: I thought idealizations of things were stable in NPD and fluctuated in BPD? There is splitting in both constructs. BPD is rapid cycling. So yes, NPD is stable. Discard is not something that happens all the time, while if you are dealing with BPD it will happen pretty fast. If the image is not threatened, there won't be any, so you can end up with a stable relationship. Think about guru relationships, they can be stable as long as the devotee remains a devotee. But if they stop, then there is devaluation and usually destruction. Might be some attempts to regain the devotee too. One striking example of how it works is scientology. There is done willingly as part of the doctrine. The narcissist discard has been institutionalized. Most organized religions have the overall same idea. Like if you leave Islam, you are on a death sentence. In Christianity it is ostracism. It creates scapegoats too, which keeps others in line. But scientology stands out for its viciousness. user1357911 wrote: Yes true... relationships seem to be most common posts. But there is also a trend for that sort of culture so its hard to tell whether the number of interpretations through PD would be the same without? I am not saying it is the only one, but I assumed it's what you meant. Like I said, I think the phenomenon also applies to everything ""other"". There was a time when everything had some sort of value. If you had clothing, it was loved in a special way, so you would fix it if it broke. Now it is just easier to discard and create some new shiny toy, which does not last long usually. It's how consumerism creates a bunch of narcissist behaviors. Same goes with relationships in general. Why fix one when you can find another more exciting one through an app? If you add a devaluation of the object over the top, or a desire for destruction, then you have narcissist discard, imo. user1357911 wrote: I was thinking subtypes but for some reason I wrote traits, could also have a completely different name,e.g. gregarious or something? I tried to look but for some reason I could only find Millon. I wonder why all this stuff isn't on the boards as lists of relevant theories? Millon isn't exactly mainstream. It is as an introduction, but if you want psychological process, etiology and causality, he is not the go to guy, and it is what people look for the most. Categorization, not so much. Some people might auto-identify with subtypes here and there. I mean, the whole subtype thing is mostly a Millon thing and it's like taking ingredients and mixing them up. It might make different recipes, but not necessarily good ones. They lack practical usefulness. It's a good intro to the idea of spectrum and that type of thing, or to learn how to differentiate. It's mostly diagnosis focused, and people here can't diagnose. I don't know about gregariousness, I think most people with NPD are extroverted, at least the primary type. So they will tend to be people person for that reason, but it could be a limited one, like a ""safe group"" that actually feeds the image. Pathological narcissism can't really take criticism or even differing opinion. user1357911 wrote: Yes, so its where the individual idealizes a certain idea and cannot accept that that is not how they are behaving; the idea is their true self, presumably assuming in some way the ideal is grandiose? (somehow the idealized traits make the person better for some reason rather than just viewing the traits on a neutral level - false self because the ego cannot cohese with the idea of true self? I'll try and rephrase it differently. Usually in people there is a true self and a false self. That's the theory behind. You could say it is the private vs the social, or the superego vs the id. In a normally constituted person, both cohere in some way, but stay distinct. So there is a give and take between them. So people might have a social life up to a point, and keep a private part for themselves. Relationships will be graduated along that line as well, so people don't treat strangers the same they treat a friend. In terms of morality, people might find some compromise between following the perfect rules, and following their own desires. That's the normal, healthy way of creating an identity. So you are not all social, or all private, all moral, or all free. It's a mix, and people draw lines and boundaries between those things. The true self is the id, and the private. It's what you would be with total freedom, if you were omnipotent. The false self, are the self imposed limitations that people put on themselves and that are usually also enforced by society. Now the narcissist does not deal well with those compromises. It's an all or nothing thinking. Black and white thinking. Either you are this, or you are it's opposite. It's binary. So what happens is that the narcissist, being social, invests entirely in it's social image or in some morality stance: ""values"". Now, this is fairly common in all people. They take responsibility and they ""loose themselves"" in a false self. It's so common that it creates existential crisis in life, one commonly know as the midlife crisis, where someone reclaims their true self that was neglected, and it looks like a regression into childhood. Lot's of people's unhappiness comes from this, and it is what mostly Freud and his followers were trying to address. By looking at dreams, they would free the true self, the genuine desires that were repressed, and try to integrate it to the false self, and that would create a more complete individual, an ""integrated"" individual. So psychotherapy is about integration, to integrate those part of the self that are neglected but still there. In a narcissist personality, the false self is idealized so much so that the true self is denied, so there is an integration, but in the wrong manner because it denies reality. Reality being here the true desires, the true longings, but also the true capacity, the true morality, character, habits, etc. So everything is invested in the appearance of such, and this is what I mean by idealization. It's a kind of delusion. And because that false self is considered ""good"" absolutely, the goal is to play the part the most perfectly possible but not from some internal drive, but by some external drive. So you end up with moralities of the sort: ""you can do whatever you want, as long as it is not known"". But of course on the outside, everything has to be perfect, like a Potemkin village. The words and actions you do have to be perfect and no mistake allowed. But the reality behind is usually a mess and the opposite. Plus, the narcissist will denounce his own real flaws, his own true self, that he projects and assume in others, thus the splitting. Cheaters see cheats everywhere, and denounce it, which gives them some moral altitude. So the person ends up thinking they are gods of some sort, or at least it is the image they are selling. So normal people, they see that, and think the person is delusional and grandiose, which is true objectively. Not only what they pretend to be is impossible to attain, but claiming or suggesting they have reached it even worst. So the person acts like a god, perfect, and commanding. It's essentially arrogance, delusional pride. It's what the DSM more or less defines, or what people call primary narcissism. There is a pretty good interpretation of it in the movie ""American Psycho"" if you haven't seen it. As for what people call the vulnerable narcissist, Fight Club is pretty much a good take on it. Both are quite similar, but there are subtle differences. Like in Fight Club the guy is not grandiose himself, but he creates an imaginary friend that is, which turns out to be himself. But those are stereotypes, you can go down further and there are many other forms possible with the same basic personality structure. Delusional thinking is all part of them at base though. The narcissistic image is self-referential, so it cuts the person away from reality and others, and from themselves. And pathologically, the person is not self-aware, that's where it gets pretty bad. The person gets cut from their life force so to speak, and if the image crumbles due to reality, it can create a downward spin that is hard to fix. And it's usually more a question of time than if. user1357911 wrote: If people without narcissism put on an act socially, that isn't really idealization is it? Isn't that just an act? Yes, but the process is the same, it's just a matter of degree. Some people can act, and they know reality still, so it's fine. Might be a problem in the long run, but it's not pathological. They also are free not to act, which is important. It creates some balance. If you can only be your act, then it's pathological. That's why people say it is a spectrum. There is no clear cut categorization that can say this is good, and this is bad. It's got mostly to do with how it interferes with every day life and what the prospects are. But yes, it is idealization. The problem with idols is not that they are idols, it's when they take too much place and blind from reality. You can see it in normal day and political ""thought"". People will think in terms of ""left"" and ""right"", or some other binaries. Those are idealizations that have become idols, and depending on the part of the fence you are in, everything good you will attribute to your side, and everything bad to the other side. So that is splitting in action. It blinds from reality because those words are meaningless, just placeholders, and they resist strong attempt to define them, plus they shift all the time. So it's whatever people feel they are, their own emotions, good or bad. So it's the same here. A narcissist might have an idol of looking good, so it is what they will focus on, and want to be the best looking. Or the more logical, or the more this or that. There are plenty of idols, but here, look is subjective and vain, logic can is meaningless and can be garbage is badly used, etc. Every idealization has flaws, which is why usually black and white thinking inevitably leads to a loss of reality, and in the end, pure emotional drivel, but unassumed. Like its the best because I wear it, or it's logic because I thought it, and of course, all the others are inferior since they don't agree with it. It's idealization plus black and white thinking that is the problem, not just idealization itself, because everybody does it. Any word is an idealization. But one word can't explain all of reality or encapsulate all possible human experience. user1357911 wrote: Isn't it the underlying idealization, importance placed on the idea of the traits and the underlying schema which lead to denial of the self, (actual actions, true motives, true desires etc.?) So somehow the false self (idealized image you explained) ends up in the lead because intent is in the lead and intent is driven by comprehension? I think so yes. Although when it comes an idol, comprehension takes a second seat. I mean, comprehension of reality. It stops happening because you know everything already. You have those handful of values and idols, and you can explain everything and justify all your intents. It's even better when those idols are self-contradictory, then you truly are a god. Nobody can refute you ever, and you can justify every action. Government are starting to figure this thing out, and they also figured out people won't be able to tell. It's not even sure if they can, so perhaps they just lucked on the concept. user1357911 wrote: I don't know about the need for admiration although I comprehend what you're explaining. Outside of the criteria, an individual could have a completely false self in relation to their own behaviour and go on to rationalize people's reactions instead of needing others to see the same thing to support that ego perspective. (the support to the schema could be internal, denial, rationalization, etc.) Yes. Well the admiration is a byproduct, and it's mostly seen from the outside, but often there is an internal need for it as well. Really I think it is at base a desire for validation. But if you follow something that is good absolutely, and try to appear to follow it as well, then it is logical that you would want admiration, or expect people to realize your greatness. I mean the admiration is in the narcissist first, so he will not see why anybody else would think different, and his image is perfect, he embodies that image perfectly. So if others don't admire him, then it means they simply are jealous and failures, and since nobody's perfect, it is easy to see the flaw in others, which distract from self-awareness. When you are busy finding flaws in others, you don't attend to your own. That's what I mean by being totally invested in the false self. Like any personality disorder, it is self-reinforcing behavior, and there is no obvious way out. If the idol is good, and if you are the biggest believer, then there is no other way out. You have to keep promoting and ignoring flaws. Why wouldn't you? everything else is inferior. user1357911 wrote: Having said it sounds like you explained the false self or image as being a driving factor and not a rationalization, perhaps that is the difference between the two concepts? (Not sure at the moment.) Yes, it's the carrot that drives everything in terms of causality. I follow the old philosophical posture that people are driven by good things, not spending their whole life avoiding bad things. But yes, some people consider narcissism as defense mechanism. I think it's a bit too easy and does not explain anything. Here, I am even going to go further, I will say it is a narcissistic theory. Because how easy it is to accuse everybody of being ""defensive""? I could easily say to everything you say that I disagree with that you are being defensive, and if you defend yourself that you are being defensive, then you just proved my point in proving you are defensive. So there is no way out of that mind sexual intercourse. You are always right, and others are always inferior, and they have to agree with everything you say. And behind it of course, would be some idol, like being transparent, or genuine, or authentic, and so on. I am a free person, I don't ever defend myself, and I have no boundary, I am a person of the world, I am everything, I am one with the world in some symbiotic state and things that are different, are having defense mechanism, which is bad and needs to be condemned. You could have the same pattern with ""rationalization"". People that give reasons are defensive, and are hiding their true motives. They are unconscious of their true selves, while the perfect self is totally free and authentic, with no need for reason or morality. Again, there is no need for boundaries which is what rationalization does, it creates division, and everybody that would rationalize them is different and therefore inferior to the true instinctual being that is one with the world and in harmony. All reason must be condemned because they fall short of the ideal. And of course, I am totally free of that flaw, I am a story in the making, totally in the flow, etc. Those two scripts are all based on one ideal, basically the idea of being open and authentic. It's the idol, and it is used to deflect any attempt to correct it, and you could quite easily spend your own life believing this, because who would say otherwise? if they did, they would show they aren't part of the ideal, and therefore not worth considering. They have to be shown the errors of their ways at best, or discarded. They are two examples of what i would consider a narcissist personality. They have that one ideal that explains everything and can't be countered except through common sense of a sort, but logic by itself won't cut it. You can see how easy that carrot can drive everything. Complete self-justification, perfect image worthy of admiration, etc. You can do whatever you want, and destroy anybody you want, so what's not to like? user1357911 wrote: Because the individual genuinely believes ""Dr"" has worth attached to it and therefore makes the person better or genuinely superior. Therefore for example if there were cases of the opposite, if the person was not a doctor, they might try to rationalize that they could have been, or even go as far as to pretend to be one.? The two things seem different, that was what I wondered about the need for admiration. However isn't Dr just a job if you are healthy? - and even someone who finds it superior would still not put on an act about their role as a doctor? Let's see, a normal doctor are yes, doctors in the day, and sure enough, they get deference, which is quite normal because they care about people, or at least they should. People that are sick and go a doctor, they are genuinely grateful if they get well and cared for. But that's a gift of sort, it is not ""due"" to being a doctor, it's just a normal thing that happens. But for some people, it comes with the title, so you have to be grateful because the person is a doctor, because they lower themselves to even consider you. So here's the difference. The good one, his goal is to cure and care for people. They don't do it for the status or to get something back. They are usually the ones that are the good ones, that will actually cure you. The bad ones, they are simply doing their job as a doctor, because it's who they are. They might cure you, or not, but they expect gratefulness, because they see the good doctors are revered, so they want that too, and since both are doctors, there is of course no reason why the other one would get love and not you. In fact, you should get more, because you are a better doctor, since you are the pure ideal of a doctor, with the white coat and all, good salary and so on. You spent all your life, and made lots of sacrifice to be there, so you are owned the same reverence. And then of course you have the grifters that call themselves doctors but aren't. Like a doctor in psychology that want to be treated like a medicine doctor. The word is the same, the merit is the same, so you want the same. Of course it does not work that way. It's a kind of delusion of grandeur. user1357911 wrote: I think the idea I wrote: Yes exactly; if the person is deluded into thinking they are moral when they are anything but, through all sorts of denial, rationalization and reversed calculations (information which literally disappears when it hits a conflicting schema) they may apply the same standard to others, so the idealized self is the operating schema or linked to the operating schema at least. - unless the moral self is a true self, (the person would be lucid enough to want to be that way but also not want to.) Apologies, this part is going off on a tangent and is unclear. Right, it could happen that way. The moral self is always part true, part false, it's a compromise. I mean, by it's essence, it is social. A man alone is never going to do things he does not want to do, out of some social consideration of good and evil. As soon as you start acting morally, there is some falsehood that creeps in. There is always the ideal, and the truth. Most people keep both fairly close together, but not always, due either to circumstances, feebleness in resolve, or just that sometimes you have to make hard choices between two bads. Well, I don't know if it is most people, but let's say healthy people. It's when you start thinking you are completely good that it gets deluded, and you become basically the false self, irrelevant of what you actually do. Almost inevitably it is justified by saying you have good intentions. So the deluded person always has good intentions, because they are a good person with good ideals, then whatever bad happens, you can't be blamed for it, nor the ideal itself. It's the joker card everybody uses. Yes, I may have bombed Hiroshima, but I had good intentions, not like those other people that bombed Pearl Harbor. user1357911 wrote: Cult leaders as an example?

Basically the kind of super socialism where everybody has shiny shoes, is an obsessive compulsive ideation. But then again, it will also happen with narcissists, because they want people to be a perfect representation of themselves. So Hubbard, he thought he was a sailor and an admiral, so everybody had to dress like that in the ""org"". They became extension of himself, and those that failed were discarded, like his son who was homosexual. Or just all those that decided it was not for them. He was even making them sign their soul to him in a billion year contract, which justified whatever he would do to them afterwards. ""Consent"" right? So you see the desire for control, but it's all based around his personality. He did not like psychiatry for obvious reasons, so everybody have to not like it. It is the enemy of the religion and he tries to replace it with his own stuff. So then, all drugs are bad, and so on. It goes from there, but it's all based on one person's desires, himself. And it's based on a few ideals he has, the marine, being ""clear"", and a few others. Of course, he never was an admiral, was never clear and so on, but he presents himself that way, and people have to pretend, that not only he is an admiral, but the best of them, obviously. He is also the best writer, the best psychologist, savior of souls, etc. Whatever he pretends to be is the best, and everybody has to pretend it is true if you want to stay around. If not, you get discarded, harassed, destroyed financially, professionally, etc. Called a deviant. Basically the guy was a tyrant. Hitler I think was more of a perfectionist that wanted unity, he was not into building a personality cult. I haven't studied him much though, but it's the impression I get. Stalin was a narcissist big time. He basically became the Revolution, so whatever he did was the Revolution. user1357911 wrote: So the idea I was thinking of sounds more like a trait similar to the obsessive compulsive plastered onto the top or interwoven with a disorder of ego/self with a different issue underneath, hence why the discard example does not look like NPD perhaps, despite being a discard. It's what I think, or it's a possibility. It's more a question of what you can rule out or not. It can be many things, including narcissism. It could be normal too. I just did not see anything specifically based on narcissism in it. user1357911 wrote: That part of the definition slipped my mind. Then if you would regard someone stealing or cheating on a partner as having poor boundaries, but this is presumably a different sort of boundary i.e. could be ""you are my property/an object/an extension of me"" in Agency rather than codependency as I imagined it in an idealization and discard.? When I talked about boundaries before, I was thinking about things which were strictly codependency, stealing would mean a boundary is being breached but would not imply codependency? Well, if you think someone is your property, it is poor boundaries, unless you are in a place where slavery is legal, and that person is actually your slave because you bought them, and you have papers to prove it. Otherwise it is simply delusional. Right, stealing is poor boundaries that don't imply codependency or a relationship, at least not in the common sense of the terms, but if you think about it longer, the thief is in a relationship with others. He does need other people to steal, so he is also dependent on people allowing him to steal, or on people not being good enough to stop him. So in order to be a thief, he needs a whole system that allows it. He needs property, and property laws, and a whole bunch of things. He isn't independent, he is playing in a bigger game with set rules he can cheat on. And those rules are the boundaries, so he has poor boundaries and is in a relationship with society in general and the people he steals, and he needs them to be as they are. Keeping in the psychiatry realm, the antisocial construct has the notion of parasitic lifestyle. A parasite, in biology is an animal that needs others to survive, and it does not give anything of value in exchange. So it is dependent, and has poor boundaries, because it cannot give back, it is not independent and therefore cannot be just. Now, narcissism is not antisocial so it is not parasitic, but exploitative. So it gives back a minimum, but takes more than it gave. Just like Hubbard, he takes your whole soul for a billion years, and give you some self-improvement courses. user1357911 wrote: Yes I noticed the similarities to borderline PD in the quote above as well. I was pretty sure its possible to not have narcissism, to simply have an idea of Theory of Mind, other, and a knowledge of self? Is it really normal as such rather than more common that it ought to seem to be? Some people think it is part of normal development of the child, as language develop and experience is gained. It seems that way to me. Younger people don't know much, don't have too many tools, so if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, and getting idols is quite normal. Most people grow out of that phase, while some don't. What's not normal is not to grow out of it, to cling to omnipotent ideation or black and white thinking. There was a quote by Churchill. ""If you are young and not a progressive, you have no heart, and if you are old and not a conservative, you have no brain."" It's because as you grow older, you acquire more tools, and more experience, so you can relate to others more readily, get a better theory of mind, and realized everybody before you were not such idiots after all, they simply knew things you didn't, or dealt with life situations you never had to deal with. So that's how people grow out of narcissism, by becoming independent, having to take decisions, taking responsibility, etc. user1357911 wrote: I am not surprised at people trying to autodiagnose though, psychiatry and psychology is very expensive and people here in the UK don't generally get a looking when it comes to psychology (or at least from what I've seen.) - and PD presumably requires a lot of psychology to diagnose. It seems the doctors go straight for axis 1 diagnoses unless its EUPD at the moment. Not necessarily, the tests are designed to be done in a session by a qualified psychiatrist. The reason people autodiagnose is mostly to find an identity, they aren't really interested in the pathological part, and since most of those personalities are vague and common, everybody can see whatever they want. So it either gives identity, justification or both. Or it can be used, which is even more common, in justifying rejection or failure in relationships. So people diagnose their partners. user1357911 wrote: I've been reading Personality, Personality Disorder and Violence. (Mary McMurran, Richard Howard.) Its not an online link its printed only as far as I know. Some of it has sunk in and some of it has so far gone in one ear and out of the other. The example I gave is not from the book. Ok, I see, it is in the context of violence. Like how to explain violence out of personality disorders because there are some correlations. I usually resist that type of approach, especially since the biggest correlation is with antisocial personality, and it's a chicken and egg problem. People get diagnosed because they are violent, then turn around and say that they are violent because of the personality. And in that context, narcissism is mostly seen through the psychopath, so it's an added feature that may help predict future behavior. But in that case, it is fairly simple. The ideation is actually about violence, so the person sees herself as violent. It becomes the false self and the personality, anything else being weak. It's also self-reinforcing, because any act of violence will show the strength and independence of the person at least in the ideal self. Doing violence therefore proves the others are weaker and that you are in control, which in turn justifies the violence, because it is what weak people are for, being victim. Not only that but in some case, it can be seen as altruistic, as in being tough forces the victim into responding and making them less of a victim. It makes the victim into the image of the psychopath, or it is discarded and dies out. It's about culling the weak to keep the strong. The weak will of course be blamed for being weak, thus blaming the victim. There can often be some other factors and ideations, but that's a common one. I already talked about being an avenger. Superheroes are pretty much psychopaths if you look at it objectively. But in this case, the weak is defended, or at least it is the justification. So there is some wrong going on, and someone needs to be saved, whether they like it or not, and it gives full justification to stop the evil and destroy it, beat them to a pulp with bare hands ideally, all that outside the confines of the law. Sometimes it is some other thing, based on some moral value, like pretty much all activism does. Animal rights activism especially, is full of very violent people who think it is fine to do violence on humans, because animals are the ideal here to be preserved. The nice little innocent animals. Of course it proves good intentions, and justifies violence. Now you could say it is after the fact justification. Perhaps, or perhaps they truly believe this too. It sure fools a lot of people. user1357911 wrote: That sounds like some sort of syndrome in itself... sometimes you'd just wonder if they're not thinking when they act? Expulsing something from the self, isn't that likely to be something particular that's been taken and applied from a disorder description? - But obviously not everyone would have that disorder. Well, just take the animal activists. They reject being carnivorous animals, because it exploits animals, give them possibly pain, is bad for the environment and so on. So instead of accepting you have eaten meat, have participated in exploiting animals, are able to give pain and are dirty, then you find a cause, and you project those things on others, which gives you the justification to do the same thing they do. It's just easier to do violence on animal killers than on some innocent people. I don't know if it is a syndrome, but for some people it passes as morality. If you can convince yourself some people are bad, reciprocity will justify them in doing bad things to them. So you paint black and then attack what you just painted, because you are white. There was some experiment, they took a bunch of people, divided them in two, and gave each group a flag of a different color. It did not take long they were attacking each others. They were sworn enemies. user1357911 wrote: Yes I've seen it used that way in relationship discussion, but when I saw the psychological mechanism it made more sense that way when I read it. I found it makes a massive difference trying to piece apart the colloquial from what the psychologist is meant to know sometimes helps understand PD properly. (Psychological and psychiatric jargon uses words in completely different ways, so the descriptions written on the pages of clinical manuals are not meant to be read literally in plain English without psychiatric/psychological training. It makes them tricky to read without piecing apart what is actually meant. Sure. I don't know if I ever saw narcissistic discard in an actual psychology text. Just doing a google search though, it seems like something used exclusively in victim groups. Devaluation is more typical. user1357911 wrote: Yes its awfully quiet in here. I don't know if that is a bad thing though if perhaps no one needs the place? What the hell is a love bombing - there is probably a definition link somewhere. It's said of people acting in the beginning of a relationship. They idealize the other, and send a lot of love, and the other can do no wrong. So love bombing. Some people with poor boundaries will do that. They are all in for awhile, then it stops and the devaluation comes, and it adds up, until everything you do is wrong and your existence itself is an irritant. So love bombing is the all white phase which usually attract people to the narcissist, or psychopath, or whatever. They can do that because they don't care about the real person, the other is an idea. So they will tell you who you are, in flattering term, with lots of intensity. It's what happens in self-help guru things, and cults. They all love bomb you, tell you how great you are. Of course it's not true, they don't know you, but it works."
"What is a Discard? Is this a description of one? 1PolarBear wrote: There is splitting in both constructs. BPD is rapid cycling. So yes, NPD is stable. Discard is not something that happens all the time, while if you are dealing with BPD it will happen pretty fast. If the image is not threatened, there won't be any, so you can end up with a stable relationship. I wonder if presumably most persons with personality disorder won't recognize splitting and for some reason it would be self-reported by persons with other personality disorders less frequently than in BPD?[/quote] Presumably it could happen if a person contradicts any schema but the schema involved in each are unique to the person, unless a split or discard are specific to some modes of thinking. (Though isn't it the case that in BPD, splitting does not necessarily impact the worth of the individual who has been split, and a loss of worth is more in keeping with a discard because the person is discarded? 1PolarBear wrote: Think about guru relationships, they can be stable as long as the devotee remains a devotee. But if they stop, then there is devaluation and usually destruction. Might be some attempts to regain the devotee too. One striking example of how it works is scientology. There is done willingly as part of the doctrine. The narcissist discard has been institutionalized. Most organized religions have the overall same idea. Like if you leave Islam, you are on a death sentence. In Christianity it is ostracism. It creates scapegoats too, which keeps others in line. But scientology stands out for its viciousness. Implying the discard is in fact deliberate not just the result of the schemas involved? The person finds their own decision to have the right to perform the discard? 1PolarBear wrote: I am not saying it is the only one, but I assumed it's what you meant. Like I said, I think the phenomenon also applies to everything ""other"". There was a time when everything had some sort of value. If you had clothing, it was loved in a special way, so you would fix it if it broke. Now it is just easier to discard and create some new shiny toy, which does not last long usually. It's how consumerism creates a bunch of narcissist behaviors. Same goes with relationships in general. Why fix one when you can find another more exciting one through an app? If you add a devaluation of the object over the top, or a desire for destruction, then you have narcissist discard, imo. However for this to be a discard your Theory of Mind would have to extend to Economic Value in line with the lives of others because otherwise the items cannot have worth. 1PolarBear wrote: Millon isn't exactly mainstream. It is as an introduction, but if you want psychological process, etiology and causality, he is not the go to guy, and it is what people look for the most. Categorization, not so much. Some people might auto-identify with subtypes here and there. I mean, the whole subtype thing is mostly a Millon thing and it's like taking ingredients and mixing them up. It might make different recipes, but not necessarily good ones. They lack practical usefulness. It's a good intro to the idea of spectrum and that type of thing, or to learn how to differentiate. It's mostly diagnosis focused, and people here can't diagnose. Yes, diagnosis without causality through psychological process doesn't seem of much use other than for those working in those fields although perhaps traits being highlighted could point people in the right directions. 1PolarBear wrote: I don't know about gregariousness, I think most people with NPD are extroverted, at least the primary type. So they will tend to be people person for that reason, but it could be a limited one, like a ""safe group"" that actually feeds the image. Pathological narcissism can't really take criticism or even differing opinion. 1PolarBear wrote: I'll try and rephrase it differently. Usually in people there is a true self and a false self. That's the theory behind. You could say it is the private vs the social, or the superego vs the id. In a normally constituted person, both cohere in some way, but stay distinct. So there is a give and take between them. So people might have a social life up to a point, and keep a private part for themselves. Relationships will be graduated along that line as well, so people don't treat strangers the same they treat a friend. In terms of morality, people might find some compromise between following the perfect rules, and following their own desires. That's the normal, healthy way of creating an identity. So you are not all social, or all private, all moral, or all free. It's a mix, and people draw lines and boundaries between those things. Yes, so the Id Ego and Superego are ways of describing/categorizing functional personality aspects, but would surely not be false self? As I understood, In a healthy person the superego only conflicts with the Id in internal debate (The superego is not a false self, it is more of the individual's social responsibility and conscience.) 1PolarBear wrote: The true self is the id, and the private. It's what you would be with total freedom, if you were omnipotent. The false self, are the self imposed limitations that people put on themselves and that are usually also enforced by society. (Or what you would be if you had no superego.) To need a false self, either society would need to be incorrect or the individual would need to feel or find them self constrained in some way. Now the narcissist does not deal well with those compromises. It's an all or nothing thinking. Black and white thinking. Either you are this, or you are it's opposite. It's binary. So what happens is that the narcissist, being social, invests entirely in it's social image or in some morality stance: ""values"". 1PolarBear wrote: Now, this is fairly common in all people. They take responsibility and they ""loose themselves"" in a false self. It's so common that it creates existential crisis in life, one commonly know as the midlife crisis, where someone reclaims their true self that was neglected, and it looks like a regression into childhood. Lot's of people's unhappiness comes from this, and it is what mostly Freud and his followers were trying to address. By looking at dreams, they would free the true self, the genuine desires that were repressed, and try to integrate it to the false self, and that would create a more complete individual, an ""integrated"" individual. So psychotherapy is about integration, to integrate those part of the self that are neglected but still there. Description of what mid life crisis is about reminds me of the comment on society and enforced ideas of self or functioning. Society creating too much socialization seems to cause problems - I think there was more of this around in Victorian times? Self-crisis? Due to very strong constraints and expectations. 1PolarBear wrote: In a narcissist personality, the false self is idealized so much so that the true self is denied, so there is an integration, but in the wrong manner because it denies reality. Reality being here the true desires, the true longings, but also the true capacity, the true morality, character, habits, etc. So everything is invested in the appearance of such, and this is what I mean by idealization. It's a kind of delusion. And because that false self is considered ""good"" absolutely, the goal is to play the part the most perfectly possible but not from some internal drive, but by some external drive. So you end up with moralities of the sort: ""you can do whatever you want, as long as it is not known"". Idealization as delusion makes sense. 1PolarBear wrote: But of course on the outside, everything has to be perfect, like a Potemkin village. The words and actions you do have to be perfect and no mistake allowed. But the reality behind is usually a mess and the opposite. Plus, the narcissist will denounce his own real flaws, his own true self, that he projects and assume in others, thus the splitting. Cheaters see cheats everywhere, and denounce it, which gives them some moral altitude. So the person ends up thinking they are gods of some sort, or at least it is the image they are selling. So normal people, they see that, and think the person is delusional and grandiose, which is true objectively. Not only what they pretend to be is impossible to attain, but claiming or suggesting they have reached it even worst. So the person acts like a god, perfect, and commanding. It's essentially arrogance, delusional pride. It's what the DSM more or less defines, or what people call primary narcissism. That makes sense particularly with some of the people you gave as examples later. 1PolarBear wrote: There is a pretty good interpretation of it in the movie ""American Psycho"" if you haven't seen it. As for what people call the vulnerable narcissist, Fight Club is pretty much a good take on it. Both are quite similar, but there are subtle differences. Like in Fight Club the guy is not grandiose himself, but he creates an imaginary friend that is, which turns out to be himself. I recently saw a film about a con artist with an analysis which also seemed to make sense with some of the explanation points, but was presumably more about the person maintaining their true self, rather than the primary example given above. 1PolarBear wrote: Yes, but the process is the same, it's just a matter of degree. Some people can act, and they know reality still, so it's fine. Might be a problem in the long run, but it's not pathological. They also are free not to act, which is important. It creates some balance. If you can only be your act, then it's pathological. That's why people say it is a spectrum. There is no clear cut categorization that can say this is good, and this is bad. It's got mostly to do with how it interferes with every day life and what the prospects are. Presumably most people only act if they have a reason or requirement for it. 1PolarBear wrote: But yes, it is idealization. The problem with idols is not that they are idols, it's when they take too much place and blind from reality. You can see it in normal day and political ""thought"". People will think in terms of ""left"" and ""right"", or some other binaries. Those are idealizations that have become idols, and depending on the part of the fence you are in, everything good you will attribute to your side, and everything bad to the other side. So that is splitting in action. It blinds from reality because those words are meaningless, just placeholders, and they resist strong attempt to define them, plus they shift all the time. So it's whatever people feel they are, their own emotions, good or bad. Not sure how idealization or the creation of an idol is not a ""problematic item"" in itself, if an idol by nature has weak or poorly defined boundaries because it is not the item itself which is focussed on, the item is a function of something else, be it guilt, ego, self-image etc. I'm not sure what causes the B&W other then e.g. the idea is right or that the person can use B&W in that way (self-justification of an idea) which is not generally going to be the correct explanation. The splitting /B&W depends on the idolizations? So the idolizations are control structures or mechanism through which the splitting operates. 1PolarBear wrote: So it's the same here. A narcissist might have an idol of looking good, so it is what they will focus on, and want to be the best looking. Or the more logical, or the more this or that. There are plenty of idols, but here, look is subjective and vain, logic can is meaningless and can be garbage is badly used, etc. Every idealization has flaws, which is why usually black and white thinking inevitably leads to a loss of reality, and in the end, pure emotional drivel, but unassumed. Like its the best because I wear it, or it's logic because I thought it, and of course, all the others are inferior since they don't agree with it. It's idealization plus black and white thinking that is the problem, not just idealization itself, because everybody does it. Any word is an idealization. But one word can't explain all of reality or encapsulate all possible human experience. The actual idol is probably the narcissist's self image itself? B&W thinking leads to a loss of reality because reality has already been lost in the individual's operation of logic - is true, is not true, is operated rather than observed. (would normally seem to require contextual aphasia which I have heard of occuring in PD.) 1PolarBear wrote: I think so yes. Although when it comes an idol, comprehension takes a second seat. I mean, comprehension of reality. It stops happening because you know everything already. You have those handful of values and idols, and you can explain everything and justify all your intents. Or if comprehension happens through those values the individual would have the idea they are open to comprehension when they are in fact doing what is described. 1PolarBear wrote: It's even better when those idols are self-contradictory, then you truly are a god. Nobody can refute you ever, and you can justify every action. Particular schema underneath, I wonder? 1PolarBear wrote: Government are starting to figure this thing out, and they also figured out people won't be able to tell. It's not even sure if they can, so perhaps they just lucked on the concept. Was that an analogy...? 1PolarBear wrote: I mean the admiration is in the narcissist first, so he will not see why anybody else would think different, and his image is perfect, he embodies that image perfectly. So if others don't admire him, then it means they simply are jealous and failures, and since nobody's perfect, it is easy to see the flaw in others, which distract from self-awareness. When you are busy finding flaws in others, you don't attend to your own. That's what I mean by being totally invested in the false self. Like any personality disorder, it is self-reinforcing behavior, and there is no obvious way out. That's what I thought about how Narcissism/disorder of self worked - the person's ego is in control of the devaluation of the concepts the other person has and the person or value is judged on the first person's ego. The individual is totally invested in the false self. 1PolarBear wrote: Here, I am even going to go further, I will say it is a narcissistic theory. Because how easy it is to accuse everybody of being ""defensive""? I could easily say to everything you say that I disagree with that you are being defensive, and if you defend yourself that you are being defensive, then you just proved my point in proving you are defensive. That would be the idea if an individual said other persons always reacted in a certain way (provided they do not actually do it for their own reasons rather than as a result of the first person's behaviour) 1PolarBear wrote: And behind it of course, would be some idol, like being transparent, or genuine, or authentic, and so on. I am a free person, I don't ever defend myself, and I have no boundary, I am a person of the world, I am everything, I am one with the world in some symbiotic state and things that are different, are having defense mechanism, which is bad and needs to be condemned. So behind that ideal would be something else? For example the moral person example I gave would have a potential other motivation other than morality? 1PolarBear wrote: You could have the same pattern with ""rationalization"". People that give reasons are defensive, and are hiding their true motives. Surely the reasons would have to be different every time, and the reactions to each would have a subtle difference? 1PolarBear wrote: Again, there is no need for boundaries which is what rationalization does, it creates division, and everybody that would rationalize them is different and therefore inferior to the true instinctual being that is one with the world and in harmony. All reason must be condemned because they fall short of the ideal. And of course, I am totally free of that flaw, I am a story in the making, totally in the flow, etc. This reminds me of what I couldn't get my head around when I was thinking. I figured everyone would have to be disordered to rationalize deny etc. And I then realised this would actually mean people DON'T HAVE Id, Ego, Superego, it is just a description of what is built one on the other in comprehension; First understanding of personal desire, then comprehension of self, then comprehension of social responsibility, getting more complex piece by piece. Contradictions to these only mean a person ""wants not to have to stay at work half an hour late due to a headache (Id) but does so anyway (Superego.) All very simple. No complex psychology. Then I ask is Rationalization inferior, but if I am loading an incorrect schema myself when I think that (the ability to edit data is not meant to be seen as an advantage) But its the way people edit data which makes me think they are not necessarily doing the same thing, for example as you get older your theory of mind gets better, perhaps so does a person's rationale. You don't have to evade concept if you do not really use it. - No that might be a bad argument. Instead of imagining Id Ego Superego as conflicting false and true selves? 1PolarBear wrote: They are two examples of what i would consider a narcissist personality. They have that one ideal that explains everything and can't be countered except through common sense of a sort, but logic by itself won't cut it. You can see how easy that carrot can drive everything. Complete self-justification, perfect image worthy of admiration, etc. You can do whatever you want, and destroy anybody you want, so what's not to like? I was going to go with Logic won't cut it because it contests itself (And requires e.g. CBT as Schema therapy to cut through it?) If there are any two conflicting issues and false self-true self is a conflicting issue. 1PolarBear wrote: Anger is totally normal though. People get angry when someone else does bad things. If you want the person to die, then it's hatred. Again fairly normal reaction to badness, although hatred starts to come up in the idealization. Because now it is not the act itself that is the cause of the anger, but the person in its entirety. So yes, a case could be made it has something to do with a kind of narcissistic response. I mean, ultimately, it is like playing God, deciding who lives and who dies. Playing God deciding who lives who dies; ""you are my object, I am your object""? 1PolarBear wrote: But also, it is again about porous boundaries. Going from anger to hatred usually shows some boundary problems. Lack of differentiation between the act, that can be changed, or the person, that cannot be changed. Boundary problem as in I am alive-you are alive (you are an extension of me,) therefore I have the right to change data about you. But the person is right or wrong in the same way as the act, therefore the person could be changed or edited if you would also change the act.? 1PolarBear wrote: So there was this guy that killed his wife because she kept putting the milk in front of the butter. The guy snapped and killed her. Probably he took it personally every time she did that and he thought she was doing it on purpose to spite him. Now I don't know if it is narcissism. Could be, or could be something else. He could have been paranoid or a puritan. All that I could say for sure is that he did not deal well with boundaries, either too rigid or not enough, and lacked justice because of the disproportionality of the act. On top of being illegal of course. There is just not enough data to tell the reason. It could be the upbringing too, if he was punished in the past for doing the same by parental figures, or it could be the other way, the parents always did that too and the killing was a way to free himself. I don't think I would put hatred necessarily in the narcissism construct on the face of it. But it happens. The part above got me thinking. So boundaries between the act on the person and the person become blurred which seems semantically impossible if looked at scientifically, but semantic aphasias can occur across the PD spectrum (and psychologically, obviously.) - the blurred semantics would surely have to affect other things as well. Exactly like the guy with the milk and the butter, but where it could have been something particular about what he did, not just it being done to spite him or being something which had been done to him before. Something very particular in his thought process, but what would depend on what it was. 1PolarBear wrote: Right, it could happen that way. The moral self is always part true, part false, it's a compromise. I mean, by it's essence, it is social. A man alone is never going to do things he does not want to do, out of some social consideration of good and evil. As soon as you start acting morally, there is some falsehood that creeps in. There is always the ideal, and the truth. Most people keep both fairly close together, but not always, due either to circumstances, feebleness in resolve, or just that sometimes you have to make hard choices between two bads. Well, I don't know if it is most people, but let's say healthy people. It's when you start thinking you are completely good that it gets deluded, and you become basically the false self, irrelevant of what you actually do. Almost inevitably it is justified by saying you have good intentions. So the deluded person always has good intentions, because they are a good person with good ideals, then whatever bad happens, you can't be blamed for it, nor the ideal itself. It's the joker card everybody uses. Yes, I may have bombed Hiroshima, but I had good intentions, not like those other people that bombed Pearl Harbor. Yes that's exactly what I meant, but it also depends why Hiroshima is bombed, if it is a wartime justification it can remain correct, moral etc, but if it is an illegal invasion/aggression surely the rationalization falls apart and the false self has to disintegrate in some way? OR the person would end up feeling shame about their self-action? (If not or even possibly if, the person would be found to have a different schema underneath the first.) 1PolarBear wrote: It's my opinion, yes. I think Hitler had that personality, but lots of cult leaders are narcissists, like Hubbard, that one is a classic. Mussolini in the same period clearly was as well. Basically the kind of super socialism where everybody has shiny shoes, is an obsessive compulsive ideation. But then again, it will also happen with narcissists, because they want people to be a perfect representation of themselves. Whereas those persons with the obsessive compulsive ideation would see themselves as perfect because they are innately perfect themselves and do not require a representation?(Their ideals are perfect.) Because the focus is not on the person's self, errors are human error and not in the ideal; the idealized self-image is projected onto the ideal and not referenced to the person. In fact the person becomes irrelevent? And therefore any mistake can be made by the person without damaging the ideal? 1PolarBear wrote: So Hubbard, he thought he was a sailor and an admiral, so everybody had to dress like that in the ""org"". They became extension of himself, and those that failed were discarded, like his son who was homosexual. Or just all those that decided it was not for them. He was even making them sign their soul to him in a billion year contract, which justified whatever he would do to them afterwards. ""Consent"" right? So presumably if this is an example, his values were that he was a sailor and an admiral, the values are pushed off onto those values rather than literally being about his self, he believed himself to be those things and for those things to be the right application to the situation (himself, everyone else, etc.) makes sense of the billion year contract, other than lifespan. (Although the contract is probably seen differently by many persons in those settings?) 1PolarBear wrote: So you see the desire for control, but it's all based around his personality. He did not like psychiatry for obvious reasons, so everybody have to not like it. It is the enemy of the religion and he tries to replace it with his own stuff. So then, all drugs are bad, and so on. It goes from there, but it's all based on one person's desires, himself. The argument would be if a person believes something to be correct they would support it? Some people would argue against things they believe to be incorrect in logistic terms (and would outlaw them) - to the point of editing the people concerned? 1PolarBear wrote: Hitler I think was more of a perfectionist that wanted unity, he was not into building a personality cult. I haven't studied him much though, but it's the impression I get. Stalin was a narcissist big time. He basically became the Revolution, so whatever he did was the Revolution. The personality cult because of the focus on self? Whereas Hitler's narcissistic ideal if he had one would probably be pushed off onto the ideal of the Aryan Race? 1PolarBear wrote: It's what I think, or it's a possibility. It's more a question of what you can rule out or not. It can be many things, including narcissism. It could be normal too. I just did not see anything specifically based on narcissism in it. Because the ideal is pushed off onto something else, not on attention/admiration toward the person's self or feedback to that self? The involvement of ""self"" is not about the person. If in Narcissism the discard happens when you break the person's ego schema (false self) the discard happens when the person's Agency is interrupted (the person sees their right as being the Law,) then the person's false self is interrupted when the discard occurs - so the individual rationalizes (or diverts the idea to) the idea it is correct? The person is still in the Right even if the discard results in an action which makes no sense? (I think I am oversimplifying the last part.) 1PolarBear wrote: Well, if you think someone is your property, it is poor boundaries, unless you are in a place where slavery is legal, and that person is actually your slave because you bought them, and you have papers to prove it. In which case it is no longer poor boundaries Reminds me of the NHS criteria for diagnoses. (Only a disorder if disruption is noticed.) 1PolarBear wrote: Otherwise it is simply delusional. Right, stealing is poor boundaries that don't imply codependency or a relationship, at least not in the common sense of the terms, but if you think about it longer, the thief is in a relationship with others. He does need other people to steal, so he is also dependent on people allowing him to steal, or on people not being good enough to stop him. So in order to be a thief, he needs a whole system that allows it. He needs property, and property laws, and a whole bunch of things. He isn't independent, he is playing in a bigger game with set rules he can cheat on. And those rules are the boundaries, so he has poor boundaries and is in a relationship with society in general and the people he steals, and he needs them to be as they are. Of course, but these are all practical dependencies. 1PolarBear wrote: Keeping in the psychiatry realm, the antisocial construct has the notion of parasitic lifestyle. A parasite, in biology is an animal that needs others to survive, and it does not give anything of value in exchange. So it is dependent, and has poor boundaries, because it cannot give back, it is not independent and therefore cannot be just. Now, narcissism is not antisocial so it is not parasitic, but exploitative. So it gives back a minimum, but takes more than it gave. Just like Hubbard, he takes your whole soul for a billion years, and give you some self-improvement courses. I would have thought narcissism does not have a particular bearing on being parasitic or not, and in some cases exploitation is not central other than as a result of any function of narcissism? Unless exploitation and the ability to do it are associated with positive ego. 1PolarBear wrote: Some people think it is part of normal development of the child, as language develop and experience is gained. It seems that way to me. Younger people don't know much, don't have too many tools, so if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, and getting idols is quite normal. Most people grow out of that phase, while some don't. What's not normal is not to grow out of it, to cling to omnipotent ideation or black and white thinking. There was a quote by Churchill. ""If you are young and not a progressive, you have no heart, and if you are old and not a conservative, you have no brain."" It's because as you grow older, you acquire more tools, and more experience, so you can relate to others more readily, get a better theory of mind, and realized everybody before you were not such idiots after all, they simply knew things you didn't, or dealt with life situations you never had to deal with. So that's how people grow out of narcissism, by becoming independent, having to take decisions, taking responsibility, etc. Sounds like a different sort of narcissism to the type which is built into a person's personality structure? Perhaps Less good theory of mind would allow a person to be more ""frivolous"" by doing things like putting on an act without it being pathological? (Playing with ego as a mode of interrelation to have a 'good life'?) 1PolarBear wrote: Not necessarily, the tests are designed to be done in a session by a qualified psychiatrist. The reason people autodiagnose is mostly to find an identity, they aren't really interested in the pathological part, and since most of those personalities are vague and common, everybody can see whatever they want. So it either gives identity, justification or both. Or it can be used, which is even more common, in justifying rejection or failure in relationships. So people diagnose their partners. The criteria are also a nightmare to work out and understand properly, but not all psychiatrists seem to apply an understanding of the criteria, some just ask the patient questions to see if the patient agrees with the question (with no clarification for the nature of each). I am surprised though because one of the criteria for PD is that it causes damage in the person's life in one way or another. So unless the person is recalcitrant about change/therapy, even if only information, it would surprise me that not many people seek assistance. 1PolarBear wrote: Ok, I see, it is in the context of violence. Like how to explain violence out of personality disorders because there are some correlations. I usually resist that type of approach, especially since the biggest correlation is with antisocial personality, and it's a chicken and egg problem. People get diagnosed because they are violent, then turn around and say that they are violent because of the personality. And in that context, narcissism is mostly seen through the psychopath, so it's an added feature that may help predict future behavior But not so much so if you see it as a secondary feature perhaps, like the guy with the butter and the jam - perhaps the reaction is violent and could have been something else, but the trigger is specific and the trigger may not be antisocial. (But surely all PD has psychology.) 1PolarBear wrote: But in that case, it is fairly simple. The ideation is actually about violence, so the person sees herself as violent. Rather than seeing them self as Correct and being violent or the disruption of another schema(butter and jam), regardless of whether the individual is Rationalizing/valuing violence as strength? 1PolarBear wrote: It becomes the false self and the personality, anything else being weak. It's also self-reinforcing, because any act of violence will show the strength and independence of the person at least in the ideal self. Doing violence therefore proves the others are weaker and that you are in control, which in turn justifies the violence, because it is what weak people are for, being victim. Not only that but in some case, it can be seen as altruistic, as in being tough forces the victim into responding and making them less of a victim. It makes the victim into the image of the psychopath, or it is discarded and dies out. It's about culling the weak to keep the strong. The weak will of course be blamed for being weak, thus blaming the victim. But the question would be what would make the strength and independance ideal a narcissistic or false self rather than a belief or value the individual has? Like avoiding the concept of immorality, the individual would have to be avoiding something through making the individual a victim rather than simply reinforcing for there to be a false self? Not suggesting the avoided issue has to be vulnerable, only that it has to be rationalized out for some reason to do with self. 1PolarBear wrote: Sometimes it is some other thing, based on some moral value, like pretty much all activism does. Animal rights activism especially, is full of very violent people who think it is fine to do violence on humans, because animals are the ideal here to be preserved. The nice little innocent animals. Of course it proves good intentions, and justifies violence. Surely if the individuals involved believe in it there is all sorts of psychological error going on unless they are actually psychotic in some cases. 1PolarBear wrote: Well, just take the animal activists. They reject being carnivorous animals, because it exploits animals, give them possibly pain, is bad for the environment and so on. So instead of accepting you have eaten meat, have participated in exploiting animals, are able to give pain and are dirty, then you find a cause, and you project those things on others, which gives you the justification to do the same thing they do. It's just easier to do violence on animal killers than on some innocent people. I don't know if it is a syndrome, but for some people it passes as morality. If you can convince yourself some people are bad, reciprocity will justify them in doing bad things to them. So you paint black and then attack what you just painted, because you are white. (classic projection) 1PolarBear wrote: There was some experiment, they took a bunch of people, divided them in two, and gave each group a flag of a different color. It did not take long they were attacking each others. They were sworn enemies. Surely that doesn't happen every time... 1PolarBear wrote: It's said of people acting in the beginning of a relationship. They idealize the other, and send a lot of love, and the other can do no wrong. So love bombing. Some people with poor boundaries will do that. They are all in for awhile, then it stops and the devaluation comes, and it adds up, until everything you do is wrong and your existence itself is an irritant. So love bombing is the all white phase which usually attract people to the narcissist, or psychopath, or whatever. They can do that because they don't care about the real person, the other is an idea. So they will tell you who you are, in flattering term, with lots of intensity. It's what happens in self-help guru things, and cults. They all love bomb you, tell you how great you are. Of course it's not true, they don't know you, but it works. I've actually noticed quite a few people doing that."
"What is a Discard? Is this a description of one? user1357911 wrote: I wonder if presumably most persons with personality disorder won't recognize splitting and for some reason it would be self-reported by persons with other personality disorders less frequently than in BPD? It's a fair assumption. The rapid cycling and direct contradiction makes it more obvious in BPD, so they know it is part of the problem. In narcissism, it can be hidden, because it may be always in the same direction, the direction of idol = good, others = bad. While in BPD it will be idol = good, idol = bad, and then again in cycles. So quite clearly in BPD, it will destroy relationships pretty fast, but not in narcissism. user1357911 wrote: Presumably it could happen if a person contradicts any schema but the schema involved in each are unique to the person, unless a split or discard are specific to some modes of thinking. (Though isn't it the case that in BPD, splitting does not necessarily impact the worth of the individual who has been split, and a loss of worth is more in keeping with a discard because the person is discarded? I am not an expert, but what I saw in BPD, is that the cycling is not clear. There is lots of doubt in it, so it is more ambivalence than total splitting. As soon as the other is split in a way, the contradictory idea comes to mind, and then another split, so making decisions and sticking to it becomes impossible. Also it usually ends up tearing the person apart, and then they will do the same to themselves, which eventually leads to low self-esteem. I think in the end, they blame themselves for that ambivalence. So discards are not real discards, but the BPD mind ends up being afraid of itself and will flee the other, or others. But then there are some that use this in a predatory manner and a way to manipulate. user1357911 wrote: Implying the discard is in fact deliberate not just the result of the schemas involved? The person finds their own decision to have the right to perform the discard? I don't think splitting is deliberate in the strong sense of the term. It happens, and the person may not know why at first. Later on perhaps the blackening becomes deliberate, like it is indulged in. It's hard to tell really. I see people that clearly brings narcissistic injury for a long time and it becomes their poles of identity, and they will split the bad object forever. How much of it is deliberate and bad faith, I don't know. I think it varies, but if it is pathological, I would say it isn't. It can be both too. The initial blackening might be instinctive, but the details deliberate. You just add to the stuff. There was an example in WW2. Basically, Jews would be split for some reason, either because they were bankers, or not Germans first, or not Christian. So then there would be punishment, and then the result of that punishment, misery, would be used as further proof they were worthy of despise. So in that case, probably the first was not deliberate, but the second was. You see the same happening today with the covid superstition. At first there was a split. The vaccinated blamed the unvaccinated for being non altruists, not part of the group, not getting with the program, etc. Then they were punished and excluded from those activities, so the vaccinated propagated infection through their licensing passes and getting back to normal. Then some of the unvaccinated ended up in the hospital, which was further proof they were causing the problem, which means they needed more punishment and a final solution. Again, I think the first split is not deliberate, but the second is for most people. user1357911 wrote: However for this to be a discard your Theory of Mind would have to extend to Economic Value in line with the lives of others because otherwise the items cannot have worth. Not sure what you mean. The value of a thing is not primarily economic, it is simple usefulness. Some object are useful, even if they are not perfect. What I meant here, is that the idea of ""caring"" in the ideologue is simply not there. Like if you want to clothe yourself, you can figure out stuff that will do the work, but may not be the best looking, and won't be in fashion, but it works, and it is cared for for what it is. When it becomes an ideal, then it is not the thing itself, but it's representation that matters. So you don't buy a car because it gets you from point a to b, and it is useful for that. You buy it for the image it puts on you, so it might be the girl on the hood, or the freedom or whatever, but the car is secondary. If the car stops doing that, if it is now seen as for old people, or not as free as others, then the car is discarded like trash, even if it still can go from a to b. So the car was never cared for as a car, bur for an ideal. A used car is just as good as a new one if what you want is to go from a to b, but not if you have it from other purposes. In the same way, you can care about the care to make it last longer to go from a to b, but you are not likely to be able to improve it to get girls or to be more free. It's why the image is black and white, while the reality is more on a spectrum. But a lot of people also do extend the value of people in the economic realm. Take the covid example again. After having excluded people from being useful economically by ostracism, the next logical step is a discard. To let them die basically, since they have no more value. So you see how the original split, which is only based on one difference and assertion of independence simply goes down in a spiral pretty fast. It works at individual level as well as the collective level. You idolize health, and then it goes down from there in a self-reinforcing pattern, until discard. user1357911 wrote: Yes, diagnosis without causality through psychological process doesn't seem of much use other than for those working in those fields although perhaps traits being highlighted could point people in the right directions. Yes, that's how they are used. Communication between people, professionals. user1357911 wrote: Yes, so the Id Ego and Superego are ways of describing/categorizing functional personality aspects, but would surely not be false self? As I understood, In a healthy person the superego only conflicts with the Id in internal debate (The superego is not a false self, it is more of the individual's social responsibility and conscience.) I think they are pretty much the same practically. In a healthy person, the false self will be pretty close to the true self. But in some people, the social takes over and they loose themselves. It's not the exact same, but they relate quite strongly. Just think about it as if someone would always loose the debate to the ID. Then practically, the ego becomes the superego, and the ID is ""lost"", forgotten, repressed, whatever you want to call it. And that is what happens when you identify strongly with an idol. You start repressing your own agency and put it at the service of said idol, you become a worshipper. So now, the idol works for you as the superego, and your ego becomes the idol. So you become a false self proper, and all your interactions are through the idol, and admiration for the idol becomes your own, and vice versa. Now usually in narcissism, it goes one step further, and the person becomes the idol, it's best avatar/prophet and so on, and then the idol itself is lost and the ID takes over and becomes the idol. So the true self reaffirms itself, but has to stay hidden, because what people admire is the idol. So to the outside, the false self becomes a kind of role, but there is cheating, because there is the belief in the narcissist he is the idol ultimately. So it's different than let's say a zealot that would put themselves in the total service of the idol as you would a superior. It's why you often see the two together. The zealot will give narc supply to the narcissist through the idol. The zealot is blinded to the cheats because he has his eyes only for the idol. The narcissist can then exploit the believer by having eyes only on himself and projecting the good on the idol and the bad on the unbeliever. So by being the best exemplar of that thing that is being worshipped, the narcissist can have admiration and superiority, all the while being free themselves as long as the image can be sustained of course. The more cheats and the more delusion, the more likely it will fall down and be exposed. There is a similar thing happening in paranoid schizophrenics, like those that hear voices that command. Now it is the superego taking over and asserting itself. It becomes an image personalized, and it plays the role of an aggressor, and some will identify with it and become it, following the voice. In this case, they play the zealot role in their mind, but from the outside, it's just the same as narcissism. Charles Manson was on that line. In part victim of society, in part being the whole society, and he switches between the two states rapidly in conversation. Sometimes he sounds like a narcissist, sometimes like a helpless victim. user1357911 wrote: (Or what you would be if you had no superego.) To need a false self, either society would need to be incorrect or the individual would need to feel or find them self constrained in some way. I don't think there is a ""correct"" here. Any society will be correct in some ways for some, and less for others. It's the point of politics to be correct for all at minimum and the best for most, but there will always be a false self. It's actually part of the game, everybody has a role, everybody has a personality and a false self, and it actually adds value to life and gives meaning. So the false self is not bad, it is a good thing, as long as it aligns with what the true self truly wants. That's why I say in a healthy person, they cohere in some way and are close by. In unhealthy people, they don't, and it's not necessarily the fault of the person, it can be a bad social script. People get miserable if they play a bad script not for them. When both are the same, you get narcissism, when the boundary between the two is not conscious let's say. user1357911 wrote: Description of what mid life crisis is about reminds me of the comment on society and enforced ideas of self or functioning. Society creating too much socialization seems to cause problems - I think there was more of this around in Victorian times? Self-crisis? Due to very strong constraints and expectations. Probably yes, the social fabric was a lot stronger, and roles were a lot stronger, especially in England. I think it went overboard, which then led to a contrary backlash, first in the 20s, then the 60s. Now it's the opposite, people don't have roles, so they have to create idols which is what marketing does. Throwable idols as it were. So people fall into nihilism, so the problem is the opposite, which is also why you see more narcissism. People simply choose to be whatever idol, which may or may not be realistic. So if there is mid-life crisis, it is mostly self-imposed. It solves a problem and creates a new one. That's why I say there is no good and bad about the false self, it's not a moral thing. It's more in the realm of a relationship. user1357911 wrote: I recently saw a film about a con artist with an analysis which also seemed to make sense with some of the explanation points, but was presumably more about the person maintaining their true self, rather than the primary example given above. It's possible. There are different type of cons. Some will be con artists like jesters. Or the Joker in the Dark Knight. He is true to himself, but he is also nobody. Basically he is what he does, nothing more, nothing less. So when they try to know his identity or origin, there is none, or many. Batman on the other hand is the narcissist, he plays another type of con which has to do with being a symbol and create fear and admiration. He wears a mask and has a true self and a false self. The Joker simply wears make up. The Joker is a bit like the total true self, that does not care about society's morals, which he sees as schemes. So he is an anti-narcissist, but also a complement to it. It's another good movie to see the concept. user1357911 wrote: Not sure how idealization or the creation of an idol is not a ""problematic item"" in itself, if an idol by nature has weak or poorly defined boundaries because it is not the item itself which is focussed on, the item is a function of something else, be it guilt, ego, self-image etc. Well, I make distinctions between ideas and idols. Ideas are not necessarily bad, idols are bad, but only because they are worshipped. So even then, it is not the idol that is bad, it's what people make of it, plus, somethings you do need to be deceived, that is how any society works. You simply have to be deceived in a good way. The noble Lie as Plato was saying, it is necessary. But think about ideas in a more general way. Every word you say or write, is an idealization of something. It's never the actual thing, it is a bad copy of it. But you need it to conceptualize and live, and communicate. So idealizing is part of life as human beings. It can't be bad in itself. But it regularly has to be corrected, so you have to keep your eyes open to reality and correct the image, or reject it if it is not working out. If it is too wrong. So an idea that is true is a good thing, or an idea that is good enough representation of reality is also a good thing. It's also good in the sense that it hides useless stuff from consciousness, all the imperfections of the world, they disappear once you idealize something, so it makes decision making possible, while if you took always all reality and all possibilities, you would be stranded and paralyzed. That is why caring and cultivating reality is important, it's about having better ideas, either in truth or usefulness. So it's a process and a good one, it's what humans do. Now, when it is an idol, then it is the image itself that is worshipped, not the thing itself. That's the difference. It's the image that is cultivated, but images don't change, they are eternal. So there is no correction possible, since now you have no reference point, no reality. So it's called a delusion. It's an image that has a life of its own if you will, not based on anything true. It usually simply starts with an idea, but then things get added to it, or taken out, and it looses its meaning. Like the examples I gave. Left and Right in politics. They used to be simple ideas, two groups of people in a parliament. But people forgot who those people were and they are long dead, and nobody cares who they were, the image itself, the idea is now disconnected from reality, but people still identify to them, and they just put whatever they want under them, and it changes all the time. That's what I mean by idols, and people worship those idols, group around them and give sacrifice, pray to them, etc. But it's just a word, just an idea, and since it is nothing and everything, people stop looking at reality, and try to find words that actually mean something. Communication breaks down, lines are drawn, and people fight over nothing. And sometimes, you need ideals, even if they are not totally accurate. Like social scripts, which give identity and meaning. It does not matter that much if they are true, as long as they fulfill a purpose. Every strong nation has those. So in itself, those ideals are not bad, and you can also worship them, but that is where the danger line is. It still has to be close to reality, or the whole thing falls apart. Then it becomes idols, the way I use the word. user1357911 wrote: I'm not sure what causes the B&W other then e.g. the idea is right or that the person can use B&W in that way (self-justification of an idea) which is not generally going to be the correct explanation. The splitting /B&W depends on the idolizations? So the idolizations are control structures or mechanism through which the splitting operates. It's because ideas are just words. So if I say ""left"", then anything ""right"" is the opposite. So if I say left is good, then logically, right is bad. Also if I say pizza is good, therefore pizza is left, and hot dog is not pizza therefore hot dog is right and bad. You can see how fast things can get out of hand and totally outside reality. And I am not even talking about ketchup. Now, someone actually in reality would actually taste the hot dog at least to know if it is good, they would not just logic their way through it. Assuming all hot dogs are bad because they are not pizza, would be splitting and black and white thinking. user1357911 wrote: The actual idol is probably the narcissist's self image itself? B&W thinking leads to a loss of reality because reality has already been lost in the individual's operation of logic - is true, is not true, is operated rather than observed. (would normally seem to require contextual aphasia which I have heard of occuring in PD.) Right. Eventually, the narcissist will become the idol itself, yes. It probably does not start that way. It just gets that way through investment in the image. Don't think it is a PD thing, it isn't. Everybody does it. The loss of reality is not a narcissist thing either, it's a normal thing people do when they learn language, talk and listen. You start noticing narcissism when the person talks about themselves all the time, and you realize their ideas are but a projection of themselves, and the meaning is lost for the most part. It stops being something others can objectively verify, there are big contradictions again objectively, and that type of thing. So a loss of connection with some reality. But not totally, sometimes there will be flashes of very insightful things, about others especially, and that is because of the projection. Just imagine someone that looks at themselves all the time, then they will be experts, so that expertise can be projected out, and since humans are all similar, it can show great awareness of reality, funnily enough, but it is not based on it. So it becomes hard to tell if the person is a genius or a complete moron. It's because the generality might be great, but it simply does not apply to reality, unless you want to believe. It's like I could point to a cat. And I say. This is not a cat, it is a furry animal with four legs and those type of animals are companions of men and great at purring. But you look, and it's really a dog. So one person might say, this guy is a true cat lover and knows everything about cats and is a genius in seeing cats. Then another will say: this guy can't tell a cat from a dog, clearly an idiot. Then the first person will say: Ah, but he did say it was not a cat. user1357911 wrote: Or if comprehension happens through those values the individual would have the idea they are open to comprehension when they are in fact doing what is described.

I am not sure I understand the first part. ID and superego will conflict at some point in life, very often in fact. Like in the example you gave, the false self might take over, so the person self-sacrifices, but it's not what they truly want, they would rather go home and get well. So at some point they might break or keep living miserably. Of course if they never have headaches, all is great, and there is no real conflict usually. The distinction is still there though, if not in act, in potential. You could have a headache. That's why the false self not necessarily bad. If it's in sync with your true self, it is a virtue. It still is if you make efforts, but it will cost you, so you'd better accept to be a martyr. user1357911 wrote: I was going to go with Logic won't cut it because it contests itself (And requires e.g. CBT as Schema therapy to cut through it?) If there are any two conflicting issues and false self-true self is a conflicting issue. Depends on the issue. Some people have bad script that are not coherent, so logic might work. Most of the time though, you are dealing with desires that are not accepted, so in that case, it is more about talking and reimaging those desires, or reimaging the necessities. Knowing what is truly important and what is not. So it deals with emotions more. I think the latter is more common than the former. Like did you ever really choose to be an astronaut, or was it forced upon you when you were young? because if it was forced and you never chose it, you won't own it, and if you don't own it, you won't be good at it. you will self-sabotage, because it's not you. Sometimes also people will make choices, but won't accept the consequences, and that's probably even more common, but they keep making the same choice, not realizing they are creating what they don't like, then they will project and blame something or someone else. Society, or whatever. It's another way you get splitting. You get an idol that you chose, but it isn't a good one, or it has cost.

I don't know if it is just semantics. People do it with their stuff, and it's not an issue. It only comes to be an issue when it is another human being. Nobody really cares is someone throws away their own stuff while it is still good. Might be dumb, but it's the life of the rich and famous. When it is other people though, that are ""objectified"", then it is seen as unjust, because it is. But even then, parents do it all the time with their children, and it's a serious issue. It's why adolescents revolt, they have to cut the tie and gain independence, and often the parents don't realize, or are not ready, or don't know how to deal with it, etc. It's not a PD thing, it's simple life. Parents are gods to their children for awhile. What's not normal is an adult being god to another adult. It's where there is a pathological thing going on, assuming of course they are equal.

In fact the person becomes irrelevent? And therefore any mistake can be made by the person without damaging the ideal? No, obsessive-compulsive behavior don't see themselves as perfect, it is usually the opposite. It's based on anxiety. They want to do things perfectly, but they always fall short, so they try again better, so it builds up. It can turn into an unhealthy desire for control. The idol in that case is superior always, and stays separate, but there is worship, and stuff is done to make the idol better, happy, etc. But you have to get rid of the unworthy, the filth that does not worship the idol just as much.

(Although the contract is probably seen differently by many persons in those settings?) Right. Well a normal person does not claim to be an admiral if they stop serving.

Some people would argue against things they believe to be incorrect in logistic terms (and would outlaw them) - to the point of editing the people concerned? What I mean is that everything revolves around the person. Correct does not matter anymore. Correct is whatever Hubbard says is correct. It's up to you to rationalize why. People that are stuck in a narcissist relationship will eventually try and rationalize their behavior for them, in part to defend them, in part to save the image.

Whereas Hitler's narcissistic ideal if he had one would probably be pushed off onto the ideal of the Aryan Race? Right. Well Stalin was the whole show, and there was a personality cult around him too. He even help create it. As far as I can tell Hitler didn't do that. One of the ideal was the Aryan race, yes, but it was something objective. People were going around measuring skulls or whatever, it was not whatever Hitler was, because as people like to point out, he did not fit the ideal. I never saw pictures of him in people's houses and stuff you usually see in a personality cult. user1357911 wrote: Because the ideal is pushed off onto something else, not on attention/admiration toward the person's self or feedback to that self? The involvement of ""self"" is not about the person. If in Narcissism the discard happens when you break the person's ego schema (false self) the discard happens when the person's Agency is interrupted (the person sees their right as being the Law,) then the person's false self is interrupted when the discard occurs - so the individual rationalizes (or diverts the idea to) the idea it is correct? The person is still in the Right even if the discard results in an action which makes no sense? (I think I am oversimplifying the last part.) Basically, anything ""different"" is subject to discard. Just like an arm that would not be good enough, you just cut it. If it acts on its own, you cut it, because it is not part of the ideal anymore. The ideal of course is the self, ultimately. Pathological self-love ultimately, but if you say it like that, you kind of loose the process, and how normal it is up to there. user1357911 wrote: In which case it is no longer poor boundaries Reminds me of the NHS criteria for diagnoses.

But sure, plenty of people act out narcissism and it is a good thing socially, or at least it is liked and is an asset. People call it healthy narcissism. There is no real way to draw a line just from the pathological process. I put it at delusional thinking and poor boundaries, but even then, it can end up being fine. I guess it is more of a moral demarcation. user1357911 wrote: The criteria are also a nightmare to work out and understand properly, but not all psychiatrists seem to apply an understanding of the criteria, some just ask the patient questions to see if the patient agrees with the question (with no clarification for the nature of each). I am surprised though because one of the criteria for PD is that it causes damage in the person's life in one way or another. So unless the person is recalcitrant about change/therapy, even if only information, it would surprise me that not many people seek assistance. Right, well, the questions are designed that way. If you clarify, you loose reliability. People don't seek assistance because they think it is normal and everybody is like that, and it is partly true. It's just when someone compares from the outside objectively, like this person is more like this than the average, then you start seeing there is a problem. Subjectively though, the person will blame others before looking at themselves, in part because it is hard if not impossible to do it properly. And in this case, ironically, the more the narcissist looks at himself, the more he becomes narcissist. So there is no way to tell all alone. And of course, it takes some good sense of self to accept criticism in that regard, some humility, but then you are not a narcissist anymore. So I would say it is the opposite, I would not expect people with narcissism to seek help, and it's the same with other PDs, but the reasons will be slightly different. user1357911 wrote: Rather than seeing them self as Correct and being violent or the disruption of another schema(butter and jam), regardless of whether the individual is Rationalizing/valuing violence as strength? Right.

Like avoiding the concept of immorality, the individual would have to be avoiding something through making the individual a victim rather than simply reinforcing for there to be a false self? Not suggesting the avoided issue has to be vulnerable, only that it has to be rationalized out for some reason to do with self. Values are ideals too, and false selves. No, there is no need to avoid anything. I mean, it is avoided automatically, logically. But it's a chicken and egg thing too. It could be the person despises victimhood, or it could be the admire strength. Most likely it is both, so who's to say? but lot's of psychopaths enjoy playing victim too, so if they actually wanted to avoid it at all cost, they would not do it. But if it is strength, then you can play victim if it gives you an advantage. Take Bundy, it is how he was drawing his victims, by playing victim. People would see victim = harmless and would get caught and eaten, or whatever he was doing with them. He clearly enjoyed having power over people, it was not to avoid being powerless. user1357911 wrote: Surely if the individuals involved believe in it there is all sorts of psychological error going on unless they are actually psychotic in some cases.

"What is a Discard? Is this a description of one? 1PolarBear wrote: user1357911 wrote: I wonder if presumably most persons with personality disorder won't recognize splitting and for some reason it would be self-reported by persons with other personality disorders less frequently than in BPD? It's a fair assumption. The rapid cycling and direct contradiction makes it more obvious in BPD, so they know it is part of the problem. In narcissism, it can be hidden, because it may be always in the same direction, the direction of idol = good, others = bad. While in BPD it will be idol = good, idol = bad, and then again in cycles. So quite clearly in BPD, it will destroy relationships pretty fast, but not in narcissism. That makes some sense. (ish) I wonder if it, coming back to codependency can depend on whether the people involved are codependent, (people can be as a result of personality style, personal experience/trauma without having a PD as such so I wonder if people with PD are the same in that sense? That the diagnosis is not all about the relationship stuff although for some people it is a major problem? 1PolarBear wrote: I am not an expert, but what I saw in BPD, is that the cycling is not clear. There is lots of doubt in it, so it is more ambivalence than total splitting. As soon as the other is split in a way, the contradictory idea comes to mind, and then another split, so making decisions and sticking to it becomes impossible. Also it usually ends up tearing the person apart, and then they will do the same to themselves, which eventually leads to low self-esteem. I think in the end, they blame themselves for that ambivalence. So discards are not real discards, but the BPD mind ends up being afraid of itself and will flee the other, or others. But then there are some that use this in a predatory manner and a way to manipulate. You mean the splitting is uncertain because it is ego dystonic and unsettling to the individual concerned? Whereas if the person believes they are right (in BPD or NPD or any other) the B&W (fact cancelling) reaction can be absolute? I would have thought multiple splits would be confusing not just lead to low self esteem because the person does not know whether they are coming or going? 1PolarBear wrote: I don't think splitting is deliberate in the strong sense of the term. It happens, and the person may not know why at first. Later on perhaps the blackening becomes deliberate, like it is indulged in. It's hard to tell really. I see people that clearly brings narcissistic injury for a long time and it becomes their poles of identity, and they will split the bad object forever. How much of it is deliberate and bad faith, I don't know. I think it varies, but if it is pathological, I would say it isn't. It can be both too. The initial blackening might be instinctive, but the details deliberate. You just add to the stuff. The mechanism occurs (involved with the individual's own ego or splitting?) then after that there is reinforcement - even if the person is aware of it, would imply the person has given them self license to edit fact? (Another conflicting mechanism because editing fact does not technically make sense.) 1PolarBear wrote: There was an example in WW2. Basically, Jews would be split for some reason, either because they were bankers, or not Germans first, or not Christian. So then there would be punishment, and then the result of that punishment, misery, would be used as further proof they were worthy of despise. So in that case, probably the first was not deliberate, but the second was. You see the same happening today with the covid superstition. At first there was a split. The vaccinated blamed the unvaccinated for being non altruists, not part of the group, not getting with the program, etc. Then they were punished and excluded from those activities, so the vaccinated propagated infection through their licensing passes and getting back to normal. Then some of the unvaccinated ended up in the hospital, which was further proof they were causing the problem, which means they needed more punishment and a final solution. Again, I think the first split is not deliberate, but the second is for most people. Fact editing among the general population - do you think most people actually believe it though, or do they have their heads in the clouds? The idea is, is there some sort of mechanism going on where the person genuinely psychologically believes what is going on (or is invested in it) or is it ""casual attitude to data"" where the person has no sense of responsibility to reality - the two seem different. 1PolarBear wrote: Not sure what you mean. The value of a thing is not primarily economic, it is simple usefulness. Some object are useful, even if they are not perfect. What I meant here, is that the idea of ""caring"" in the ideologue is simply not there. Like if you want to clothe yourself, you can figure out stuff that will do the work, but may not be the best looking, and won't be in fashion, but it works, and it is cared for for what it is. When it becomes an ideal, then it is not the thing itself, but it's representation that matters. So you don't buy a car because it gets you from point a to b, and it is useful for that. You buy it for the image it puts on you, so it might be the girl on the hood, or the freedom or whatever, but the car is secondary. If the car stops doing that, if it is now seen as for old people, or not as free as others, then the car is discarded like trash, even if it still can go from a to b. So the car was never cared for as a car, bur for an ideal. A used car is just as good as a new one if what you want is to go from a to b, but not if you have it from other purposes. In the same way, you can care about the care to make it last longer to go from a to b, but you are not likely to be able to improve it to get girls or to be more free. It's why the image is black and white, while the reality is more on a spectrum. I tell you what I miss my car like hell for going from A to B, its really inconvenient not having a working vehicle. I suppose in the social use of fascia or trend things are discarded quickly, yes you have a point, surely a narcissist would consider them self in a slightly desperate hole if needing to discard things that constantly for the sake of image - surely it would be like having an addiction? The people involved in that sort of behaviour seem overpriveleged in attitude, shallow, unable to connect reality and the importance of ordinary objects? Not meaning those who do it without thinking properly, (out of carelessness). I meant Theory of Mind would extend conscience to the Value of the Economy as argued in Old Fashioned Communism etc. (due to the people in it). 1PolarBear wrote: But a lot of people also do extend the value of people in the economic realm. Take the covid example again. After having excluded people from being useful economically by ostracism, the next logical step is a discard. To let them die basically, since they have no more value. So you see how the original split, which is only based on one difference and assertion of independence simply goes down in a spiral pretty fast. It works at individual level as well as the collective level. You idolize health, and then it goes down from there in a self-reinforcing pattern, until discard. Yes that would be a strange example, you're healthy and you're worth something, health is idealized and funding is throw at it, until you become unhealthy at which point you're devalued or discarded and can die. 1PolarBear wrote: user1357911 wrote: Yes, diagnosis without causality through psychological process doesn't seem of much use other than for those working in those fields although perhaps traits being highlighted could point people in the right directions. Yes, that's how they are used. Communication between people, professionals. I always find it easier to think ""schema x schema y"" if I want to understand something instead of ""so and so said this then that happened"", because if you choose the second you stay in the dark about what is actually going on instead being involved only in the occurrences. The relationship language seems to appear everywhere at the moment but is less easy to follow because it often ties in with ""chasing the rabbit"" on the disordered thinking the individuals are engaged in - obviously not always but there is less distinction if I am correct probably because of the way it developed? 1PolarBear wrote: I think they are pretty much the same practically. In a healthy person, the false self will be pretty close to the true self. But in some people, the social takes over and they loose themselves. It's not the exact same, but they relate quite strongly. Just think about it as if someone would always loose the debate to the ID. Then practically, the ego becomes the superego, and the ID is ""lost"", forgotten, repressed, whatever you want to call it. And that is what happens when you identify strongly with an idol. You start repressing your own agency and put it at the service of said idol, you become a worshipper. So now, the idol works for you as the superego, and your ego becomes the idol. So you become a false self proper, and all your interactions are through the idol, and admiration for the idol becomes your own, and vice versa. So the ego becomes the superego (Superego functions are Egotised.) but what gives the Id License? (why) in Narcissism what gives license to the Id? You mean agency of the individual as a living person is suppressed in favour of agency of ego? (The person's Agency depends on their ego values not on their living value? I worked out the example I was thinking of earlier. If it looks like Narcissism secondary to another disorder The idea of ""id"" is licensed like a sadistic twist. ""Id"" is a mockery. What is the motivator. Why e.g. fascia > to show power (but to the narcissist it is about a false self,) is power a false self. No. It is a way of Life. It is Correct. Therefore attrition must be a false self. (To defend against guilt/shame in ToM or is that a double Negative?) Ego, e.g. false displayed self, fascia etc. or whatever is a Rationalization. Its not an ego function, the person in the example just sees it as an ego function. Why the Id takes license would surely have to determine the subtype of narcissism??? 1PolarBear wrote: I don't think there is a ""correct"" here. Any society will be correct in some ways for some, and less for others. It's the point of politics to be correct for all at minimum and the best for most, but there will always be a false self. It's actually part of the game, everybody has a role, everybody has a personality and a false self, and it actually adds value to life and gives meaning. So the false self is not bad, it is a good thing, as long as it aligns with what the true self truly wants. That's why I say in a healthy person, they cohere in some way and are close by. In unhealthy people, they don't, and it's not necessarily the fault of the person, it can be a bad social script. People get miserable if they play a bad script not for them. When both are the same, you get narcissism, when the boundary between the two is not conscious let's say. Or the opposite if you look at it the other way - I used to hear people say people with no false social self were the healthiest (most genuine) nothing to have to put on if society functions as it ought to. The more social script, the less genuine people are with each other unless some people are very sensitive and require particular responses - e.g. Man A thinks sending Birthday Cards is idiotic, but everyone gets upset if he does not do so. 1PolarBear wrote: Now usually in narcissism, it goes one step further, and the person becomes the idol, it's best avatar/prophet and so on, and then the idol itself is lost and the ID takes over and becomes the idol. So the true self reaffirms itself, but has to stay hidden, because what people admire is the idol. So to the outside, the false self becomes a kind of role, but there is cheating, because there is the belief in the narcissist he is the idol ultimately. So it's different than let's say a zealot that would put themselves in the total service of the idol as you would a superior. It's why you often see the two together. The zealot will give narc supply to the narcissist through the idol. The zealot is blinded to the cheats because he has his eyes only for the idol. The narcissist can then exploit the believer by having eyes only on himself and projecting the good on the idol and the bad on the unbeliever. So by being the best exemplar of that thing that is being worshipped, the narcissist can have admiration and superiority, all the while being free themselves as long as the image can be sustained of course. The more cheats and the more delusion, the more likely it will fall down and be exposed. What if the narcissist actually IS the idol in the way their personality is built? Why Primary Narcissism would have been considered to be ""primary""? Meaning supply for a person with a narcissistic personality structure would be ""back up or agreement to that integration to their character,"" and disagreement with the person's character would not leave the person feeling ""lacking"", only that the other person were lacking an understanding? In those cases the exposure would be as to whether the Narcissism is Correct, and the Narcissist would find them self feeling hard done by in relation to their construct being denied or taken away when they were in the Right? 1PolarBear wrote: There is a similar thing happening in paranoid schizophrenics, like those that hear voices that command. Now it is the superego taking over and asserting itself. It becomes an image personalized, and it plays the role of an aggressor, and some will identify with it and become it, following the voice. In this case, they play the zealot role in their mind, but from the outside, it's just the same as narcissism. Charles Manson was on that line. In part victim of society, in part being the whole society, and he switches between the two states rapidly in conversation. Sometimes he sounds like a narcissist, sometimes like a helpless victim. Considering everything everyone thinks has an underlying cause it would make little sense to think of something like delusion as being a disembodied chemically induced disorder and not a reflection of the individual's thought process. Its possible that some individuals are playing out a narcissistic rationale in their heads when engaging with a delusion or fantasy? 1PolarBear wrote: Now, when it is an idol, then it is the image itself that is worshipped, not the thing itself. That's the difference. It's the image that is cultivated, but images don't change, they are eternal. So there is no correction possible, since now you have no reference point, no reality. So it's called a delusion. It's an image that has a life of its own if you will, not based on anything true. It usually simply starts with an idea, but then things get added to it, or taken out, and it looses its meaning. Like the examples I gave. Left and Right in politics. They used to be simple ideas, two groups of people in a parliament. But people forgot who those people were and they are long dead, and nobody cares who they were, the image itself, the idea is now disconnected from reality, but people still identify to them, and they just put whatever they want under them, and it changes all the time. That's what I mean by idols, and people worship those idols, group around them and give sacrifice, pray to them, etc. But it's just a word, just an idea, and since it is nothing and everything, people stop looking at reality, and try to find words that actually mean something. Communication breaks down, lines are drawn, and people fight over nothing. Differentiating an idol as something which performs a substitute place? Rather than an idealization? which is idealization of something which can have meaning, but there is still some substitution if the thing comes from ego? 1PolarBear wrote: And sometimes, you need ideals, even if they are not totally accurate. Like social scripts, which give identity and meaning. It does not matter that much if they are true, as long as they fulfill a purpose. Every strong nation has those. So in itself, those ideals are not bad, and you can also worship them, but that is where the danger line is. It still has to be close to reality, or the whole thing falls apart. Then it becomes idols, the way I use the word. Absolutely Re value system, but that is just a personal opinion. Having said, if there were none, there would be no effective laws etc. and where the value system is wrong, the same can occur. 1PolarBear wrote: It's because ideas are just words. So if I say ""left"", then anything ""right"" is the opposite. So if I say left is good, then logically, right is bad. Also if I say pizza is good, therefore pizza is left, and hot dog is not pizza therefore hot dog is right and bad. You can see how fast things can get out of hand and totally outside reality. And I am not even talking about ketchup. Now, someone actually in reality would actually taste the hot dog at least to know if it is good, they would not just logic their way through it. Assuming all hot dogs are bad because they are not pizza, would be splitting and black and white thinking. That's interesting because I'd find it to be the other way (the way I described) when psychological errors occur - I mean what gives agency (permit in the person's logic) to the idea of hotdog or ketchup changing? The hotdog is tasted but the thinking becomes skewed. There has to be a rationale for the hotdog not being pizza, if it isn't rationalized and pizza is not a strong ideal... (The error seems to occur in a different place unless its just being experienced differently by different people?) 1PolarBear wrote: Right. Eventually, the narcissist will become the idol itself, yes. It probably does not start that way. It just gets that way through investment in the image. Don't think it is a PD thing, it isn't. Everybody does it. The loss of reality is not a narcissist thing either, it's a normal thing people do when they learn language, talk and listen. You start noticing narcissism when the person talks about themselves all the time, and you realize their ideas are but a projection of themselves, and the meaning is lost for the most part. It stops being something others can objectively verify, there are big contradictions again objectively, and that type of thing. So a loss of connection with some reality. But not totally, sometimes there will be flashes of very insightful things, about others especially, and that is because of the projection. Just imagine someone that looks at themselves all the time, then they will be experts, so that expertise can be projected out, and since humans are all similar, it can show great awareness of reality, funnily enough, but it is not based on it. So it becomes hard to tell if the person is a genius or a complete moron. It's because the generality might be great, but it simply does not apply to reality, unless you want to believe. Sometimes people only understand themselves, its harder to understand different people if they think in dramatically different ways - not just different ideas on one or another thing but complete psychological differences. So people talk about them selves a lot, or from their own perspective - but then again sometimes it is self interest. 1PolarBear wrote: It's like I could point to a cat. And I say.

So one person might say, this guy is a true cat lover and knows everything about cats and is a genius in seeing cats. Then another will say: this guy can't tell a cat from a dog, clearly an idiot. Then the first person will say: Ah, but he did say it was not a cat. Exactly, differing perspectives... 1PolarBear wrote: Not really, the principle of non contradiction is the first principle of language.

[quote""1PolarBear""]No. Authorities have totally stopped caring about not contradicting themselves. Same with the media or the academia in general. Justice too. I just spent two years trying to convince moronic judges that two laws can't contradict themselves and you have to choose one and not the other, but they don't care, or actually they can't even understand it. If they say something is true today, they can say the opposite tomorrow, and it's always true. It can be done in the same sentence as well, no problem. I think they call it post truth, and it's the latest fashion. Or actually, one philosophy professor called it truthiness. But everybody sees it now, which is why nobody trusts the media or authorities. There was a time where people would simply lie, and those were the good days. Now, they don't even know what is truth.[/quote] Last time I checked e.g. Justice they had done away with Prosecution and Defence. A Lawyer is meant to ask questions to help defend your case if you are arrested, but I came across a situation where there was no double-checking of data through defence and prosecution. 1PolarBear wrote: Yes, their true self. Or someone else's desires. It depends how you take it. If you worship an idol that is an ideal man made, you are following someone else's desire. If of course you are the idol, then it is your own desires that are in display and the idol is now just a cover. But isn't the individual self-invested in the idol/ideal? (Does it depend as I was thinking above what gives license to the ID? - No wait I understood what you meant, the idol is a lie to yourself and a cover for your own motives.

It's just that some people might see rationalizations everywhere so you have to be cautious with those concepts, and it's something you want to use sparingly so not to be led astray yourself. They are rabbit holes, perfect idols. If the conceptual structure is flexible or changeable. If the issues are fixed however, not so much? 1PolarBear wrote: Right. I have a headache, ID, but have to stay at work, superego, then you have to decide, ego. When it becomes habits, your ego becomes an identity, so you might be someone always sick, or someone always heroically sacrificing yourself. Identity or personality. Well, in that you actually do it, not that you see or imagine yourself doing it (Id-Ego integration) 1PolarBear wrote: I am not sure I understand the first part. ID and superego will conflict at some point in life, very often in fact. Like in the example you gave, the false self might take over, so the person self-sacrifices, but it's not what they truly want, they would rather go home and get well. So at some point they might break or keep living miserably. Of course if they never have headaches, all is great, and there is no real conflict usually. The distinction is still there though, if not in act, in potential. You could have a headache. That's why the false self not necessarily bad. If it's in sync with your true self, it is a virtue. It still is if you make efforts, but it will cost you, so you'd better accept to be a martyr. In some people who are particularly healthy, the person wants exactly what they do? There is near-seamless integration but the person has all concepts built one on top of the other in perfect integration? Some people might see the person as a martyr when they value a superego decision but in fact the person has just chosen what they truly value as a person? 1PolarBear wrote: Depends on the issue. Some people have bad script that are not coherent, so logic might work. Most of the time though, you are dealing with desires that are not accepted, so in that case, it is more about talking and reimaging those desires, or reimaging the necessities. Knowing what is truly important and what is not. So it deals with emotions more. I think the latter is more common than the former. Like did you ever really choose to be an astronaut, or was it forced upon you when you were young? because if it was forced and you never chose it, you won't own it, and if you don't own it, you won't be good at it. you will self-sabotage, because it's not you. Sometimes also people will make choices, but won't accept the consequences, and that's probably even more common, but they keep making the same choice, not realizing they are creating what they don't like, then they will project and blame something or someone else. Society, or whatever. It's another way you get splitting. You get an idol that you chose, but it isn't a good one, or it has cost. So you keep the idol and reject the cost, you make others pay. Sounds like a pretty broad area. I get the impression reimaging is a bit further down the line if a person has comprehension errors as it is not usually accepted immediately, or maybe sometimes changing the image is not the solution because there simply shouldn't be an image in the first place, or the person is not suffering from a disorder of image so much as one of self-image? For example if someone thinks they are being strong, and actually are, but are doing it in the wrong way in the wrong place (for example staying at work with the headache.) quote=""1PolarBear wrote: I don't know if it is just semantics.

But even then, parents do it all the time with their children, and it's a serious issue. It's why adolescents revolt, they have to cut the tie and gain independence, and often the parents don't realize, or are not ready, or don't know how to deal with it, etc. It's not a PD thing, it's simple life. Parents are gods to their children for awhile. What's not normal is an adult being god to another adult. It's where there is a pathological thing going on, assuming of course they are equal. If society has classes and roles, it might be normal. The Semantic idea; Cancelling an idea is like; If person A is weighed against person B Usually when denial happens in a narcissistic defence I found the two concepts were completely unrelated to each other, so weighing concept A against concept B and cancelling concept B would be an aphasia of the two concepts. (Concept A and B cannot be weighed, it would be like weighing Sheep and Apple and expecting a number in response.) But the Superego should understand responsibility to self, and if the person is likely to break, that they need to stop, the ego is in line with the superego and the ego supports ""understanding of own needs"" in the Id? - Or does that technically define the Id (A mature Id has understanding of its own needs?) 1PolarBear wrote: No, obsessive-compulsive behavior don't see themselves as perfect, it is usually the opposite. It's based on anxiety. They want to do things perfectly, but they always fall short, so they try again better, so it builds up. It can turn into an unhealthy desire for control. The idol in that case is superior always, and stays separate, but there is worship, and stuff is done to make the idol better, happy, etc. But you have to get rid of the unworthy, the filth that does not worship the idol just as much. I mean, it can get there, it does not always do, it depends on the person. I thought anxiety was more OCD than OCPD where OCPD is about being overly rigid, wouldn't that be OCPD from avoidance-sensitivity and not from somewhere else (surely rigidity probably also has its varying motivators? 1PolarBear wrote: Yes, personality disorders are social in nature, it's not a moral thing that is absolute.

It's pathological when it affects everyday life negatively, and you can't change it. But sure, plenty of people act out narcissism and it is a good thing socially, or at least it is liked and is an asset. People call it healthy narcissism. There is no real way to draw a line just from the pathological process. I put it at delusional thinking and poor boundaries, but even then, it can end up being fine. I guess it is more of a moral demarcation. Isn't ""healthy narcissism"" a different type of functional structure, for example self-value? 1PolarBear wrote: Right, well, the questions are designed that way. If you clarify, you loose reliability. Well not really, they're meant to be clear for example ""Does your leg hurt, where does it hurt, is the bone protruding,"" isn't even an accurate diagnosis for a broken leg. It still has to be investigated further. 1PolarBear wrote: People don't seek assistance because they think it is normal and everybody is like that, and it is partly true. It's just when someone compares from the outside objectively, like this person is more like this than the average, then you start seeing there is a problem. Subjectively though, the person will blame others before looking at themselves, in part because it is hard if not impossible to do it properly. And in this case, ironically, the more the narcissist looks at himself, the more he becomes narcissist. So there is no way to tell all alone. And of course, it takes some good sense of self to accept criticism in that regard, some humility, but then you are not a narcissist anymore. So I would say it is the opposite, I would not expect people with narcissism to seek help, and it's the same with other PDs, but the reasons will be slightly different. So the ratio of people who actually have PDs on places like this may be lower than would be expected? Depending on how many people have had it brought to their attention externally? Some PDs can be very disruptive, not just to relationships but to personal safety etc. that is what made me think more people would seek help - I've met people who have done, and there used to be a PD helpline here in the UK - I am sure people used it. Or alternately a Narcissist can avoid looking at himself to ensure he does not have to attend to his self image? 1PolarBear wrote: Values are ideals too, and false selves. No, there is no need to avoid anything. I mean, it is avoided automatically, logically. Exactly. 1PolarBear wrote: But it's a chicken and egg thing too.

So the automatic value becomes reinforced. 1PolarBear wrote: but lot's of psychopaths enjoy playing victim too, so if they actually wanted to avoid it at all cost, they would not do it. But if it is strength, then you can play victim if it gives you an advantage. Take Bundy, it is how he was drawing his victims, by playing victim. People would see victim = harmless and would get caught and eaten, or whatever he was doing with them. He clearly enjoyed having power over people, it was not to avoid being powerless. I tried to look up what he had but it came up with all sorts of different things. But when I found it a bit odd when the search engine said he had psychosis/bipolar - surely unless the guy was hearing voices in his head telling him to do it that couldn't ever be an explanation. One link said he was diagnosed with narcissism. 1PolarBear wrote: Not really, the only error is to consider animals superior to humans, but that's an opinion.

That the diagnosis is not all about the relationship stuff although for some people it is a major problem? No, it's not about codependency, it's simply social problems. Like lots of them, schizoid, schizotypal, avoidant, are quite independent, possibly too much, which in itself causes social problems. There is only one that is dependent, and it's dependent PD. It's because strictly speaking, it is a problem of the self in relationship with others. If the self is adapted to the environment, you won't get a diagnosis, so it's primarily social, but the cause is partly in the self. ""Relationship"" is a broad term, it's any interaction you have with others, so it includes jobs and any interaction you have with others. Psychiatry is based on the medical model. You go there because you have some issue. In proper medicine, it's about your body, but in psychiatry, it is about being social in the broad sense, which includes stuff like anxiety, learning problems and just about anything. The diagnosis is based on those things first, to see the is an actual actionable problem. The personality is mostly causal, like if you would do a test and find a virus. user1357911 wrote: You mean the splitting is uncertain because it is ego dystonic and unsettling to the individual concerned? Whereas if the person believes they are right (in BPD or NPD or any other) the B&W (fact cancelling) reaction can be absolute? I would have thought multiple splits would be confusing not just lead to low self esteem because the person does not know whether they are coming or going? Yes. Well I was specifically talking about NPD. In that case, it has for goal to save and protect the self-image, or reinforce it, so it is ego syntonic. It's just that for most people, they can deal with people that are different, and some even enjoy it. All differences are not an existential threat. But yes, it is confusing if it is not ego syntonic. I mean, it is always absolute, it's the point of it, it's the definition of it. It's all this or all that. Normally, reality is not like that, so there will be back and forth, unless all you see is yourself or some idol. So in ideological groups, it will be ego syntonic as well, because it protects the image of the group. But if the group is not homogenous, of is facing something that is not part of the group image, then there will be some back and forth, some will split one way, others the other way, some will try and integrate. It's what we see in nations with strong immigration. Some split one way or the other towards foreigners, others try and find a compromise between identity and openness to others. And yes, it's confusing. It tears societies apart. In something like BPD, the person tears itself apart in that same way. user1357911 wrote: The mechanism occurs (involved with the individual's own ego or splitting?) then after that there is reinforcement - even if the person is aware of it, would imply the person has given them self license to edit fact? (Another conflicting mechanism because editing fact does not technically make sense.) Well, it's not really editing facts, it's picking and choosing. Let's say, you eat an Hawaiian pizza, and you don't like it, then you split and you find those type of pizzas are the worst and will destroy pizzas in general if allowed to exist. Then that type of pizza becomes a symbol of what's wrong with the world. But then you look at the ingredients, and you have to focus on the pineapple mostly as being the cause, because other pizzas might have cheese, so cheese is fine, dough is fine, jam is arguable. It's in that process of demonizing pineapple that it becomes more deliberate. Then you might want to destroy all pineapple plantations as a preventive strike. user1357911 wrote: Fact editing among the general population - do you think most people actually believe it though, or do they have their heads in the clouds? The idea is, is there some sort of mechanism going on where the person genuinely psychologically believes what is going on (or is invested in it) or is it ""casual attitude to data"" where the person has no sense of responsibility to reality - the two seem different. Yes, they are different. One is superstition, the other irreligion. I see both, and they usually come together even in the same people. Some believe, then some others just don't care about finding out, as long as it goes their way. It's like any virtue, if you lack it, you will go to the extremes and go back and forth, one extreme replacing the other. So people that lack courage, they won't always coward, they will also be reckless. They might viciously attack someone when they think it is safe, and then retreat once they see it isn't, which might be too late for them. So it's the same here. Care too much about pineapples, or not care that much, as long as the plantations are destroyed, which is now the true enemy. I see this a lot in the environmentalists. Some care a lot about carbon dioxide and warmth. Others don't but care about destroying oil or just messing up the system. So there you have the superstitious and the irreligious. Or take the covid, some people believe in the measures and want them whether they work or not, because it's about doing something, anything. So that's the superstitious, then you have people like Boris J. that will impose the measures, but does not really believe in them, so in private, he will not follow them, which creates a scandal once known. It's also a good example of the false self as I use it. Boris was presenting the image of a faithful, but really all those measures was him and what he needed to manage things around, so it's the classic narcissist trickery. People get blinded by the idol, so whatever he does is attributed to it, while in reality he isn't really doing anything except his own agenda. user1357911 wrote: I tell you what I miss my car like hell for going from A to B, its really inconvenient not having a working vehicle. I suppose in the social use of fascia or trend things are discarded quickly, yes you have a point, surely a narcissist would consider them self in a slightly desperate hole if needing to discard things that constantly for the sake of image - surely it would be like having an addiction? The people involved in that sort of behaviour seem overpriveleged in attitude, shallow, unable to connect reality and the importance of ordinary objects? Not meaning those who do it without thinking properly, (out of carelessness). Right, well it's vanity. And yes, again it is the opposite of carelessness, it is caring about the wrong things, things that are not real and can't be improved through cultivating. It's the same in relationships, they need cultivating if you are dealing with a real person. If you are dealing with an idea of a person though, it might be great until it reflects that ideal, so the idealization phase, but once it stops being that, it needs a discard, and you find the next ""true love"". Careless people don't discard, they neglect, which isn't the same. user1357911 wrote: I meant Theory of Mind would extend conscience to the Value of the Economy as argued in Old Fashioned Communism etc. (due to the people in it).

Both are exploitation of the other, with the small difference than the capitalist only uses the other person's work, not the whole thing. It may have come from there originally. It's a bit more subtle than that though, it's a bit of a gross approximation. Like in the myth, Echo essentially validates everything Narcissus says, but it would of course extends oftentimes into the physical in practice.

Yes, but then you idealize a behavior and therefore runs the risk of having it disconnected from reality over time. But yes, it's easier, which is why narcissism is a common thing. It has a natural evolution. There were whole discussions about this in the Medieval Ages, turning around literalism and metaphors. Usually the consensus was metaphors are fine as long as they don't contradict the literal. But of course you have to remember the literal or have a way to refer to it. If you just forget about it, then the idea gets a life of its own, which is where things start getting delusional. user1357911 wrote: The relationship language seems to appear everywhere at the moment but is less easy to follow because it often ties in with ""chasing the rabbit"" on the disordered thinking the individuals are engaged in - obviously not always but there is less distinction if I am correct probably because of the way it developed? I am not sure what you mean exactly. I usually like staying close to the original data. You can have the best map in the world, if you can't link it to the territory, it is useless. If I show you the territory, you can make your own map. To take your analogy, it's easy to dig rabbit holes, but if you can't tell a rabbit when you see one, and can't tell how it runs, the holes will be pretty pointless unless lucky and some rabbit falls into it. But even then, you may assume it is a rabbit because it fell into a rabbit hole, while in fact it was a snake. It's the whole problem with idealization. user1357911 wrote: So the ego becomes the superego (Superego functions are Egotised.) but what gives the Id License? (why) in Narcissism what gives license to the Id? Good question. It's because you go up, and become one, then you go down and apply the one. So there is a moving up process from the individual to the one, from material to the idea. Then both become one, the distinction disappears, then after that, everything move from the one to the individual is a matter of finding imperfection in the individual. Now reality becomes an imperfect copy of the ideal, which must be rejected ultimately as false. Since there cannot be any correction from the world, there is license for everything because inferior to the truth. Basically, in the process of doing the map, the territory becomes obsolete and the cartographer king. You can look at Fauci in the US. It's the typical process. First he looks at scientific papers and experts, and creates a map, then he becomes Science. Like he says himself, contradicting him is contradicting Science itself, so his ego had become the superego. He has become his idol, and the best exemplar of that idol, so he goes everywhere and gives himself the right to lie to people and take whatever measure he deems necessary or better. Then people have to obey. People see through his game, but the delusion is so strong, he keeps going, never correcting, because who can correct him? He is Science, and everything else is fringe. So in the end, whatever he wants is law, as long as it keeps the image he projects. Lots of people see through those games, but not everybody. He will get defenders that give him the admiration he seeks. user1357911 wrote: You mean agency of the individual as a living person is suppressed in favour of agency of ego? (The person's Agency depends on their ego values not on their living value? Yes. If you are Science, you get stuck in it, and you have to sacrifice a bunch of things normal people who aren't Science can do, like thinking for yourself, being critical of others, and so on. The investment can become big, because you have to play the part all the time. It's even more obvious in institutions like the Royal Family. You see, the Queen is the perfect example of someone stuck in the superego, she has become her function. And it's not to say she is a narcissist herself, personality wise, but she has to play the part. In fact she is quite the opposite from what it seems, being at the service of others, and being humble. It's what Harry complains about, that he does not want to become the superego, he wants to live his own life, so you see the problem here, and how people respond to it. They will claim Meghan is a controlling narcissist, which may be true, but may not be, but if she was playing the part, nobody would care. So funnily, it is because she isn't acting as one that she is accused of being one. Or perhaps they are but have broken the image. In any case, it's good for them to liberate themselves and focus on what matters, which is their own lives. I mean psychologically I think it is the right thing to do. But quite clearly it is also a really hard thing to do socially. Harry is a bit like a narcissist that became self-aware. So he tries to break free, and you get splitting and all sorts of things that are not pretty. user1357911 wrote: I worked out the example I was thinking of earlier. If it looks like Narcissism secondary to another disorder The idea of ""id"" is licensed like a sadistic twist. ""Id"" is a mockery. What is the motivator. Why e.g. fascia > to show power (but to the narcissist it is about a false self,) is power a false self. No. It is a way of Life. It is Correct. Therefore attrition must be a false self. (To defend against guilt/shame in ToM or is that a double Negative?) Ego, e.g. false displayed self, fascia etc. or whatever is a Rationalization. Its not an ego function, the person in the example just sees it as an ego function. Why the Id takes license would surely have to determine the subtype of narcissism??? Yeah, that's your map, I can't really say. But like in the example above with the Royal family, for them, the superego is everything, they are born and raised into it, which is why Harris calls it a prison they are unaware of. But William says that he does not feel like in a prison, but that is normal because he is unaware. But one thing for sure, they have to deal with narcissism at some level that is critical, all in their own way. Like I said, the Queen, she denies the bad parts, like arrogance and exploitation and in fact exemplifies herself in the opposite role. So she is a bit like the perfect Christ. I am sure she also does not get license to her ID and try to be responsible. So she avoided the narcissistic personality in those ways, even though her role is narcissism itself. But that is the Royal family and they have a long tradition of dealing with that obviously. But if you take an outsider like Meghan, and put her into that environment, she can't cope, she does not have the tools, so if the rumors are correct, she ended up being arrogant, exploiting the people below her and so on. Then when she was criticized, she split, and discarded the Royal Family, but keeping Harry, because he is part of her. He defends her like you would expect. ""Whatever Meghan wants, she gets."" said Harry to the servants. And that's now the ID gets license. Now, I don't know exactly the details of how, and you can explain it is many different ways, but it does happen eventually. I tries a general explanation above, but you could put it in other ways I suppose. But really you become the image, and everything else is but an extension of yourself, albeit imperfectly, thus inferior. It's probably that inferiority that justifies, and the delusion does not allow correction to reality. I mean, if you think a king of princess is about giving orders around, it's your image and nobody will be able to correct it. Others know there are limits and dangers to that even if the power is there. user1357911 wrote: Or the opposite if you look at it the other way - I used to hear people say people with no false social self were the healthiest (most genuine) nothing to have to put on if society functions as it ought to.

So then they have to play the part and be social, and false. It's a choice people make, I am not ready to say which is correct or not. It can only be correct in some context, and for some people in relationship with that context. Birthdays are a social construct, and a fairly new one at that I believe. I think I saw somewhere it was never a thing in the past. People would be festive as some moments in life, like coming of age, marriage and things of that nature, but not birthdays.

I think it is more aptly called grandiose narcissism, but there are types of narcissism that aren't grandiose, and plenty in fact are grandiose victims, which is a kind of inverse grandiosity. But it's possible to have a narcissist personality without grandiosity at all I believe, as long as there is delusion and an embodied image. People sometimes call it covert narcissism because the grandiosity is not apparent. It's there, but kind of in the mind mostly, so in that case, direct admiration is not the thing, but can be gotten through others, or perhaps through work or something. user1357911 wrote: Meaning supply for a person with a narcissistic personality structure would be ""back up or agreement to that integration to their character,"" and disagreement with the person's character would not leave the person feeling ""lacking"", only that the other person were lacking an understanding?

The narcissist is always correct, at least internally for the things they care about. Someone that is lacking is an existential threat and needs to be corrected, or destroyed. It's the black and white thinking. It's kind of the whole point. It gets into a nice synergy with the antisocial absence of guilt, because now not only the feeling's not there, the conscience, but you get an added justification for said lack of conscience, that you are correct. user1357911 wrote: Considering everything everyone thinks has an underlying cause it would make little sense to think of something like delusion as being a disembodied chemically induced disorder and not a reflection of the individual's thought process.

Most people don't. They can keep differentiating themselves from their ideals, or their ideals from reality. The normal worshipper will think they are not worthy of the idol, and bow in its presence. So they put themselves below the idol. Of course there is some substitution, there is a longing to be like the idol, but it never gets there. That is also why reality is not an existential threat, because the idol is superior to everything, so if something does not fit, it is just something to be avoided or integrated. But the idol itself is safe from corruption. Here, there was some example some time ago. You may know that the principle that nothing can go faster than the speed of light is pretty much an idol in physics. Now at some point, someone claimed they had made an experiment that proved otherwise. It created quite a bit of commotion, plenty of scientists actually looked at it, and showed that in the end, it was not the case, so they went and looked for the errors. That's a sensible approach, and they could do that in the firm belief of their idol. Now of course, I am sure plenty simply split and rejected it because it was an existential threat to themselves, that it was impossible and so on. So they probably never cared to check in reality, or may have looked at some other reasons, like those scientists were not authoritative enough, or something along those lines. user1357911 wrote: Absolutely Re value system, but that is just a personal opinion. Having said, if there were none, there would be no effective laws etc. and where the value system is wrong, the same can occur. Yeah, I don't like the name value or value system. They really are stories with some ideas in them. Value system is like a pizza you would put together just based on the ingredients. But stories have protagonists, desires, context and a lot of other things that give the ideas meaning. Stories based on values or value systems are usually terrible, and everybody rejects them. Laws are based on rights, not values. We know what's right in a story, no matter the values. In fact, most often the villain has values, but the hero does the right thing. Like the villain wants to control the world, that's his value, but the hero knows the right thing is to stop the villain. It's not a value, just the right thing to do. Now you could say he fights for freedom, but it usually looks silly and the hero ends up just as bad, bullying the villain for no reason, because he has different values. Or sometimes it is just his name or how he looks. Like DrEvil, clearly is bad and needs to be stopped, even though he just minds his own business. But his name sounds wrong and we go along with it. Now of course if DrEvil collects people for experiments, it is something else and some rights are being trampled on. Values are little idols. Rights aren't, although lots of people think they are values, which is problematic. user1357911 wrote: That's interesting because I'd find it to be the other way (the way I described) when psychological errors occur - I mean what gives agency (permit in the person's logic) to the idea of hotdog or ketchup changing? The hotdog is tasted but the thinking becomes skewed. There has to be a rationale for the hotdog not being pizza, if it isn't rationalized and pizza is not a strong ideal... (The error seems to occur in a different place unless its just being experienced differently by different people?) Well, yes, there is a rational, like I said, you taste the hot dog and it tastes different. You can also touch the texture of the sausage and compare to the cheese, or give a quick look at both and see the different forms, one is round, the other is a thick line. You could analyze them further with instruments, like decompose in their chemical elements, check with a spectrometer for the radiations. Basically you have to look at the essence of each and since they are different, they will be defined differently. Or just ask the waiter for the definition. Like: ""what is a hot dog?"". Chances are he will tell you the truth, and knowing what a pizza is, deduce the differences and the commonalities. In black and white thinking, you only look at those two things separately, instead of together. A real definition is both positive and negative. General and species. It's basically a mistake in using categories and definitions properly. Mistaking specie and genera, and vice versa. That's also why I don't like Millon all that much. He takes different generas and mix them together to create subtypes, but the ingredients he takes here and take out there, it simply creates bastards that may have nothing to do with the thing itself. I approach narcissism as a genera, and I try to explain what it is, how it works, how it cooks, and what temperature and so on. Looking at the ingredient is useless if you can't cook or know what a pizza is in the first place, and what it is not. That's how you get Hawaiian pizzas, they do not know what they are doing. user1357911 wrote: Sometimes people only understand themselves, its harder to understand different people if they think in dramatically different ways - not just different ideas on one or another thing but complete psychological differences. So people talk about them selves a lot, or from their own perspective - but then again sometimes it is self interest. True, but it comes with experience and observation. Keeping boundaries intact, self introspection and so on. It's a major problem though, I agree. user1357911 wrote: Last time I checked e.g. Justice they had done away with Prosecution and Defence.

So they lied. user1357911 wrote: But isn't the individual self-invested in the idol/ideal? (Does it depend as I was thinking above what gives license to the ID? - No wait I understood what you meant, the idol is a lie to yourself and a cover for your own motives.

Sometimes you can tell in extreme cases, but not most of the time. But you can tell it is delusional, so it does not matter. So you can call out the delusion, of the lie, it makes no difference. Most of the time though, it really seems like a mesh of both. user1357911 wrote: 1PolarBear wrote: Well, yes, if they are true rationalizations.

No, it's because it is a closed system, that's what makes them a rabbit hole. Realistic systems are open systems. They take input from the outside, and depending on the input, will churn out something different. Closed system always churn out the same thing no matter what happens. You know the joke about Freud and the cigars? https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/08/12/just-a-cigar/ The unconscious is a closed system a rabbit hole. It's a perfect idol like I described. So in the end, it is up to Freud to decide if a cigar is a cigar or not. Also explains the license of the ID. Now was Freud a con man or did he believe his stuff? impossible to tell. Probably both. Whatever the case may be, he was totally invested in that idol, and became it, and really you have to ask him what is a cigar and what is not, so it's his own feelings and desires. Not all idols are perfect like that, so less dangerous. You need an operator in a closed system, otherwise you realize the con. A person that will switch the machine on and off. The magician behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz. It's a great example of an idol run by some narcissist. The narcissist is the small dude operating the big machine, which represents grandiosity. Toto is the small dog that can see behind the curtain. user1357911 wrote: Well, in that you actually do it, not that you see or imagine yourself doing it (Id-Ego integration) Things can be integrated in image only or fantasy. Of course it is better in reality, but most conflicts happen just in your mind. It's what therapy does anyway right? Habits are potential, they happen in the mind first and are a disposition to act readily. So there is a bunch of work that can be done just in fantasy which corrects the mind and makes doing the right thing an automation of sort. So the ego is not just in act, it is mostly in potential. That's why we have stories, they straighten the mind, if they are good ones of course. So if you get in a situation, you know how to act. user1357911 wrote: In some people who are particularly healthy, the person wants exactly what they do? There is near-seamless integration but the person has all concepts built one on top of the other in perfect integration? Some people might see the person as a martyr when they value a superego decision but in fact the person has just chosen what they truly value as a person? Right. I mean ideally, that's the goal to aim for, imo. If something is truly a virtue, there is no effort, so if the good thing, let's say the superego is integrated, it's not difficult to act on it, and the ID is fine with it too and actually helps by giving pleasure. If doing the right thing hurts, there is lack of integration, or its too new. It's like physical training, at first it hurts, but eventually the activity gives pleasure. user1357911 wrote: Sounds like a pretty broad area. I get the impression reimaging is a bit further down the line if a person has comprehension errors as it is not usually accepted immediately, or maybe sometimes changing the image is not the solution because there simply shouldn't be an image in the first place, or the person is not suffering from a disorder of image so much as one of self-image? For example if someone thinks they are being strong, and actually are, but are doing it in the wrong way in the wrong place (for example staying at work with the headache.) Yes but how do you fix it? You have to tell that being strong is also taking care of yourself, having the courage to do it, and that in the end, you are more useful when healthy than just being a martyr. I see that type of reimaging in sports. It used to be that people would just endure pain for no reason, out of some sense of duty and the image of being strong. Now people are reimaging it and say things like mental health is more important, and so on. The sacrifice is still lauded, but the reverse is not seen as weakness. They aren't ""errors"" to speak of, it's different stories. It works, but is a slow process, and some people may never buy into it either. user1357911 wrote: The Semantic idea; Cancelling an idea is like; If person A is weighed against person B Usually when denial happens in a narcissistic defence I found the two concepts were completely unrelated to each other, so weighing concept A against concept B and cancelling concept B would be an aphasia of the two concepts. (Concept A and B cannot be weighed, it would be like weighing Sheep and Apple and expecting a number in response.) Ok I see. Yes, it happens, because people are focused on the pineapple. At least in the narcissist defense concept, one small part can be compared, but then it is generalized to the whole. So there might be the idea that apples are good because they have vitamin C, while the sheep does not, or something of the sort. So all sheep are bad, even if they have healthy fat the apple does not have. I don't think it is aphasia, but could be. user1357911 wrote: But the Superego should understand responsibility to self, and if the person is likely to break, that they need to stop, the ego is in line with the superego and the ego supports ""understanding of own needs"" in the Id? - Or does that technically define the Id (A mature Id has understanding of its own needs?) I think it is a reimagining of the superego. That is how I would see it. An ID is the own need, it's all it is. So the superego would say: ""need to be strong"", the ID says: ""pain"". So it's the ego's function to either reimage the superego so it is understood differently, or you have to make choices between the two. Either go with one or the other and own it. Basically the ego is the will in older philosophy. The superego is the intellect that can be from the outside or an internal fabrication. So when someone follows the ID, what they really are doing is making a superego that is not in sync with what was learned from society. Either that or they are already in sync, so then there is no difference. For most things they are relatively in sync. You might want to wear clothes because it is cold, and society says the same. Or you might be hungry, and society says it is good to eat. user1357911 wrote: I thought anxiety was more OCD than OCPD where OCPD is about being overly rigid, wouldn't that be OCPD from avoidance-sensitivity and not from somewhere else (surely rigidity probably also has its varying motivators? Yeah, possibly. I don't know enough. I was using the terms a bit loosely. But really I mean anxiety, the type that makes people behave in a ritualistic manner. How you want to call it, I don't really care. I kind of assumed they were causal, but I could be wrong. I mean, what causes the rigidity in the first place? I find people like that usually afraid of changes, which is anxiety. user1357911 wrote: But the effects of a person's behaviour are usually seen in moral terms. For some reason I am warming to Millon slightly on this one because personality subtypes are described in terms of how the person thinks. Yes, because his book is a psychology book, not a psychiatric one. But what he describes are not personality disorders, they just borrow the names from them. So that's where it gets messy. The DSM borrows stuff from psychology based on some archetypes described in length in some places, it simplifies them and idealizes them. Then Millon comes and take those little idols and make a pizza out of them, but does not explain the pizza itself, or the original. It's best to go to the originals if you want to go that route. I mean, if you've followed what I said so far, it is itself a narcissistic ideation quite removed from reality. Now, the next logical step, is you become a Millon expert, and start seeing those subtypes everywhere, or try to see it, and then you stop interacting with the person itself and instead interact with the idea you have of them, and if they don't fit the pattern force them into it, thus doing damage and in the end, exploiting people. So it's a dangerous path, which is why being process oriented is better, the ideas are smaller and more amenable to change according to circumstances. It can be broken down by behavior, instead of painting the whole person with some label. Since it is broken down, it is easier to find the issue and fix it, while changing the whole person, you can forget about it. So all it gives in the end is something for entertainment value, which is what you see quite a bit in expert videos on youtube about those things. Ok, you see personalities, but then what? So I get what you are saying, and I agree, I just don't think Millon is the right guy for it, but he might give you some ideas, it's a good book overall. it's only an introduction though, not much more. user1357911 wrote: Isn't ""healthy narcissism"" a different type of functional structure, for example self-value? Yes, it is what people say, or it's how it has become, but I think it is the same. There is nothing wrong having a narcissistic personality here and there. Like comics, they use it to great effect. If you want to be in business, it is a must for sales, etc. Again, it is this idea that people are special monsters, I simply don't buy it. And Millon does not either. user1357911 wrote: Well not really, they're meant to be clear for example ""Does your leg hurt, where does it hurt, is the bone protruding,"" isn't even an accurate diagnosis for a broken leg. It still has to be investigated further. Yes, but real doctors don't follow questionnaires. I am not saying it should be that way, but it is made that way. It's a discussion between the practitioners and the scientists. Plenty of practitioners will do like you say, but in theory they are not supposed to. Even with the new DSM, they were supposed to rate each trait independently and there was a revolt against it. Of course the scientists want that in order to do research, while the doctors oftentimes have other priorities, and for the therapists, it is again another reality. user1357911 wrote: So the ratio of people who actually have PDs on places like this may be lower than would be expected? Depending on how many people have had it brought to their attention externally? Some PDs can be very disruptive, not just to relationships but to personal safety etc. that is what made me think more people would seek help - I've met people who have done, and there used to be a PD helpline here in the UK - I am sure people used it. Well, I am not sure if it has changed. But usually, people would go for some other reason, so they aren't self-aware. They might thing there is this little thing bugging them, then it ends up being a big thing. Yes, they can be disruptive, but lets say an antisocial, almost none go there for it. They get caught by the Man and get diagnosed against their will. It's the case for a lot of others too. Or people might go for some marital problems, job issues, etc. People with PDs won't go for those reasons, because it is ego syntonic, it's their personality. Nobody in their right mind go to psychiatrist to change themselves entirely, but they might go for small fixes, like any normal person. user1357911 wrote: Or alternately a Narcissist can avoid looking at himself to ensure he does not have to attend to his self image? Oh, they attend to their self image, it is all they do. It's the true self that is in trouble. It's just they can't tell the difference because they are joined. So it looks the same as an integrated person in their own eyes, even healthier than anybody else, if they were to look at it because they are so joined. So when I say it is a problem with the true self, it would mean nothing for a narcissist, they would think they've got it already. It's why it is a delusion. user1357911 wrote: I tried to look up what he had but it came up with all sorts of different things. But when I found it a bit odd when the search engine said he had psychosis/bipolar - surely unless the guy was hearing voices in his head telling him to do it that couldn't ever be an explanation. One link said he was diagnosed with narcissism. Yeah, I don't think he was hearing voices himself, but his defense mechanism are interesting, and yes, in his case, they clearly are. He is like teflon, so anytime people try to connect to him as a human being, he deflects, and then throws back the stuff at the other person. So he is a mirror to other people, and he even says so himself. That allows a complete lack of responsibility, even though in reality, everybody says he was the boss, and ordering people around. So in everybody's mind, he is the leader, while in his own mind, arguably, he is the biggest victim. In any case, he shows a lot of narcissism in that regard, plus he is clearly grandiose and shows it in a virulent manner, and then there is the antisocial element he seems to have incorporated in his self image. But he is more detached from reality than your average psychopath, and he does not even try to look sane. So I think it's more than just a personality disorder, but you could say it's there as well. That's why those diagnosis are not particularly useful, but the behavior is. user1357911 wrote: The same way violence requires the breach in conscience to commit the act, superiority requires the concept of worth - unless the individual has just ""decided that"" with very little involvement? Right, well if you have contempt for someone, then violence is quite normal. It's usually a good sign someone is up to no good. If they have contempt for you, prepare for a fight, because they won't give you any leeway. It's like crushing bugs, morality does not even comes into play.

Lately I’ve been really thinking about what I want, and I feel nothing would satisfy me. I just feel completely and utterly insatiable. I just want attention. All the attention. But I feel even that wouldn’t be good enough. I feel deprived of attention and love and adoration and I feel angry about it. But I don’t just want attention for just anything. I want to be seen as beautiful, superiorly talented, intelligent and unique. Ha. And all the above frustrates me. I have to achieve it else I’ll never be satisfied. Perhaps it’s depression.

Life just seems utterly meaningless and pointless and I’m angry about it. I find myself genuinely not caring about any issues in the world. I’m just angry that other people are getting attention and I’m not. I feel empty. I just want to feel alive and feel special. I want to fulfil my potential. And I’m angry that I haven’t. I think I’m going to have to make a plan to satisfy this need. Without satisfying my need to be seen as special life seems completely meaningless.

"New to NPD .. abandon hope all ye who enter here or what? It seems unlikely you have NPD. Narcs usually don't see themselves as having a problem and don't see a reason to change. The absence of emotional empathy means they don't see it as a negative to hurt other people even if they can cognitively recognize that's what they are doing. You may still have high narcissistic traits. If the above is correct, it's good news because you probably can change. If you are a narc, the short version is you can't change."
"New to NPD .. abandon hope all ye who enter here or what? Thanks Gretabag. Apparently NPD is a spectrum disorder. I am certainly not Overt NPD (except occasionally I can fluctuate to that state when I am centre of positive attention). But have just been reading up on Covert NPD and I literally tick every box! Sensitive to criticism. passive aggressive, self critical. self absorbed, appear shy, but am also subtly manipulative, defensive, hyper-sensitive. I do see myself as different, special and often have low tolerance for others. Hold grudges for personal slights... for years!! Personal disrespect makes triggers sudden anger. I have had continual cycles of depression and anxiety for decades and also highs when I am praised. While I can be charming for a while I have discover a lot of my humility may be an attempt to seek kudos or favour including charitable acts. However I still can be genuinely kind. I have had to work on being empathic because I know it is the right thing to do as a human being. I think this type of NPD is a little different to the `classic` Overt NPD. I believe that I do have a type NPD and I DO care about it and it depresses me that it seems intractable no matter how hard I try. Any other thoughts please?"
New to NPD .. abandon hope all ye who enter here or what? Ha ha.. I bet this is not the first time this has been brought up on here But. Massive irony Q. How can I expect genuine help and advice from people with a disorder that means that they do not want to help others (except to enhance their own self esteem) as it is not in their nature?

Oh and by the way, don`t be so quick to dismiss someone as not NPD just because they are not classic `grandiose` type NPD, this is a mistake.

"New to NPD .. abandon hope all ye who enter here or what? Hello again, Lifer. Hope you're still around, and I'm sorry to miss your posts. I very much doubt you have NPD. It is definitely NOT a spectrum disorder. It is part of a spectrum of personalities, but once you have the disorder, it's a binary proposition. You are or you aren't, and there's mostly not a realistic chance of getting rid of it. Mostly. Checking boxes is not a reliable way to diagnose NPD. What is needed is a consistent history of behaviour (positive) or an inconsistent one (negative). What I would like to ask you: have you ever done any of the following without feeling forced to do it by outside influences: Admitting you're wrong, apologizing for your actions, devoting considerable effort or risk to helping others?"
"New to NPD .. abandon hope all ye who enter here or what? What's up Life, first of all I would like to say there are plenty of examples out there and some therapist who specialize in the treatment of personality disorders have documented great improvement in treating NPD the biggest challenge to treatment is that grandiose shell that just denies any problems at all and to accept help from a therapist would make them feel very insecure and possibly trigger feelings of inferiority. if you can get past this and it sounds like you have therapy can help. With that said, NPD usually starts to take root much much earlier than 9 so I would resist the urge to self diagnose it could very possibly be a ptsd issue. This has become a zombies forum it's unfortunate but thats just how it is now i guess. It's very common for narcissists to start reflecting on their life as they start to get to middle age and maybe thats what you are dealing with or it may be a trauma response to what happened to you. Talk to a therapist and see what they have to say"
"Covert Narcissism is HELL I realise most people who read this won't be able to relate and this will just be a hilarious joke and I'm one of those prime candidates you prey on, being an overt narcisstic bully, but whatever... I've come to realise I'm in hell with covert narcissism. I've recently broken up with my girlfriend because I cannot handle being forced into social situations and have people patronise me, reject me or bully me due to my shyness. I'm hyper sensitive to not getting the recognition I deserve and so being shy I am never going to get the response I think I deserve from people. I can feel people withdraw, wretch, patronise me once they see me not saying much and being glaringly introverted and it is the equivalent of having a hot poker shoved up my arse. I feel the depression and rage sweep over me and I aggressively and passive aggressively force my way out of that situation no matter how awkward I make the situation. My girlfriend cannot handle the social abstinence and solitude I placed our relationship into so we had to break up and I understand now that I can't be in a relationship. I must live alone which I don't want to do but know I have to. The reason why I argue that covert narcissism is hell is that there is no solace. No warm blanket. Overt narcissists at least can use other people for their own means and get what they want to the best of their ability and also get the respect. I cannot. As a shy person, people treat me like a dog. I realise that normal shy people can accept this but I absolutely CAN NOT. There are no people to make me feel better. Go round this forum and see oodles of threads of people falling over themselves to give other OVERT narcissists advice after they don't know what to do after their latest heinous abuse they've inflicted on some poor bastard. Nobody gives a ###$ about me. I'm a freak and not only am I a freak. I'm a freak who cannot accept that he is a freak so I basically have to hide from life to avoid the bleak despair I will inevitably feel. I have looked at this from every possible angle and I truly believe that being a shy narcissist is one of the most bleak existences a human being can endure. If there's anyone who can relate I would appreciate your kind words. I know this will probably get 1 or 2 replies at most and everyone else will be amused or repulsed."
"Covert Narcissism is HELL For a while I thought I was some sort of covert/introverted narcissist. I hate being the centre of attention, and also find discomfort in seeing the extrovert getting all the attention, when what they have to say isn't very interesting. Yes, if you hide in the corner, people will notice. Some will try to bring you into the conversation. Your apparent weakness will make them feel better about themselves. ""I'm a freak, I'm a weirdo"" sang Radiohead. Aren't we all? I've been treated like crap, and I've treated others quite badly myself. So do you want to sink in to solitude, or rise above it? If what you have to say is worth hearing, let people hear it. I've always found it hard to stand up for myself. Last night I went for a drink with a few friends. An arrogant friend stole my seat when I went for a cigarette. The old me would have let it pass, but this time I sat on them and said ""I'm not moving."" I got my seat back You should try it. ""My name is Sam Vaknin. I admit to having an inflated view of my own opinions, but you should listen to me."""
"Covert Narcissism is HELL Standing up for myself isn't an issue. Standing up for myself too much is more the issue. I'm hyper sensitive to slights and very, very, very few confident people will actually give a shy person some respect and not refer to them and talk to them like they have leprosy. That is my problem. I don't think there is a ""rise above"" chance. There's no way I can escape being the underdog and the underdog is my biggest fear, thus I am in hell. I deserve to have a bigger status than most, in my own mind, but can't achieve it so I would rather hide away than watch myself repeatedly get stepped on in these situations. There's more pleasure to be gained from denying people the opportunity to belittle me than watch them do it."
"Covert Narcissism is HELL probably, that story is hilarious lol. I'm not exactly an outgoing person, I'm a hermit (I'm also trying to fix this and having 0 supplies). I don't like being in the center of attention unless for some reason I want to be. I like to stay in the shadows and haunt around for awhile and come out in the light so everyone can look at me but quickly go back in the shadow so I get no rejection. For people it adds a mystery why I was so chatty and outgoing and now I don't return phone calls (a past story) You aren't alone on this, you are just alone in the dark so to say. I barely leave my house now (student) and the idea of leaving scares me, I spend so much time getting ready trying to find the right clothes even if its to get a soda. When I manipulate I'd keep just that person in my life or another and that's it. Like most narcs (this will sound funny but its statistic) I'm not bad looking so I end up getting attention anyway, attention I wasn't prepared or wanting. I can't handle hugs and kisses, it smothers me and I'm weird I mostly hate affection and crave only small parts. All narcs will give a $#%^ about you, we suffer together so I would so that no narc is alone on anything. We are all very unique but in some things the same. I'm glad you broke up with your girlfriend, I don't think anyone should be forced into social situations whether they are non or narc. Maybe you should date a mirror, and by that I mean find someone just like you. I married someone just like me and it works for me because I don't have to handle uncomfortable situations like that. He is an overly understanding non and I owe him my life for trying to fix me and devoting hours to research everyday. Come join me and others to fix this $#%^, I think covert narcs sometimes have a better shot. We are only labelled ""sick,freaks,abnormal"" because we are minority. Remember to be gay was a an institutionalized disease before now look. If the world was mostly narcissistic we would be a norm and nons would be abnormal. We either need to create a society of narcs (a small joke, non's don't kill me) or change because it can help us survive better. And surviving is half the battle Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Borderline PD, Adjustment Disorder and a pinch of Anti-Social PD = Yours truly."
"Covert Narcissism is HELL ""If the world was mostly narcissistic we would be a norm and nons would be abnormal."" So true, and I'm a non. It's all relative. So, as you're an N with 0 NS... If I honestly say that your post has better spelling and grammar than 90% of what I see on the 'net (e.g. you used a lower case p in ""probably""), does that count as a minor form of NS, or is it irrelevant? ""My name is Sam Vaknin. I admit to having an inflated view of my own opinions, but you should listen to me."""

"Covert Narcissism is HELL So what's the problem here? You know what you have to do pretty well. Acknowledge you're being stupid and stop being so afraid of being judged. If your shyness really starts affecting your life (which it seems it is...), then stop being shy. Simple. Stop being such a worthless perfectionist who never gets anything done and DO something. Make mistakes, learn, etc. It seems you have put some incredibly high expectations on yourself and can't accept the small fact that you suck. But you know how it is. The first step to stop sucking is to admit you suck and start working from there. A poor person who thinks he's rich will be poor forever, but a poor person who admits he's poor can work his way up to being a BILLIONAIRE. (Granted, with a lot of work, but nobody said it was easy — and that's why it is fun.) A book is a mirror: if an ape looks into it an apostle is hardly likely to look out. We have no words for speaking of wisdom to the stupid. He who understands the wise is wise already."

I virtually have no interest in the inane #######4 they do and wretch at the depraved $#%^ they indulge in, so thus it is impossible to put the tried and tested time into having the patience and have strong enough of a stomach to become confident around them. On the flipside, I need someone. I need at least one relationship to work otherwise I will go mad or kill myself. I'm sure of it. I've never met anyone as misanthropic as me and I'm not sure I ever will, so my only attainable objective is to become more of a socially normal person to be able to get a relationship with someone relatively normal and the concept of that sickens me. Is that any clearer for Duke Brains of Genius-shire?"

Etzel, one of my best long term friends since almost 20yrs ago speaks just like you, hes also a non, so like you he doesn't have a clue who this process works in our lifes. And since my old teen age we been over a lot of social events and he is very sociable and that maybe why I was his 'wing', although he didnt even had a car and I was most of the time the guy with most 'independence' and success compared to him in terms of having money and a job, stable life... (we are from low social class). We had some fights along the way, most my fault, usually motivated because at these times he didn't mean much of a supply to me anymore, cause I had gf or simply was more interested in other people supply. I wrote all this just to give you a clue how my social interactions were, I had the chance over more that a decade to build a personality and a healthy social circle but all I always wanted was my supply. I ditched a lot of people, and that is obvious in the way we both meet people and he held a stronger connection to them vs the one I accomplished, to be honest my connection to these people were very artificial and not genuine (oh! that word again), or to describe better: fake. One trait of our narc ways is the ease of moving on with the ability to have zero guilt, remorse over friendships/relationships. we have talked about my shyness a lot and ways to improve, and this guy make the same exact reasoning you do. Im actually considering telling him about my narc traits as we are close friends(in his perception). so let me put this in a manner you can understand, we consider social interaction a very complicated matter, in our views you nons are very disturbed and have arcane ways of socializing, its stupid. I can tell you this cause over my whole life i've been unconsciously 'playing the game' (yes, the one you say we suck and suggest we go learn and fix from ground zero if necessary) in order to get my supply, but now I know my real motives why I need to socialize and it doesn't make sense anymore unless for supply. This will not create healthy relationships as we know from experience , so (in my case) part of the shyness come from the fact that I acknowledge the non race discern us as scumbags, crazy, disturbed and so on. The other part is the fact that we need to be viewed as great and better by others or sometimes just be looked at and ear some compliments or some kind of attention, and thats not always the case. perfectlynumb22, sorry for derailing your thread, but I identify myself with the shyness traits you describe."
"Dealing with my narcissism... if that's what it is New here. Hi all. I want to explore this a little. I am aware that I am either NPD or I sit on the borderline between extremely high narcissism and NPD... I'm currently in a rather depressed state, so I'm just going to write what I am thinking and feeling and would welcome comments from anyone who wishes to give me their opinion. I believe that I have NPD although I believe it is quite complex. As I have been aware of it for many years I've attempted to train myself out of it... And something occurred to me recently and it is that NPD actually allows the sufferer to survive. Our brains always grow and evolve the way they do to best protect us from our environment. So perhaps narcissists trying to 'heal themselves' is not actually a good thing. Perhaps we should embrace our narcissism. I think that in trying to cure myself of it I've actually broken myself. There will probably be some who read this and think that I am not actually NPD. And you may be right. I have never been told I have a diagnosis. I have a BPD diagnosis but the psychiatrist also hinted at an additional diagnosis that would 'not be beneficial for me to know about'... I am I believe a 'vulnerable' narcissist. Which is the worst type as we spend our lives completely unsuccessful and angry about all that we should have been and had in life. Not getting what we 'deserved'. I blame others for my life. And I don't think I'm wrong in doing that. It is their fault. The misery I've had and the pain I've experienced, including the irritation and numbness I currently feel, is all their fault. And I have had a great deal of very real trauma and pain. I am deeply, deeply unsatisfied with my life. And I am angry because I am not who I want to be and have not achieved all I wanted to. I do fit my BPD diagnosis also. Except the self harm part. I've never been big on self harm. But I've been frequently suicidal throughout my life. I mean this whole post, I am reading it and it sounds so bleak, so awful. I am ashamed of it. There is so much more to me than this. As I mentioned, I'm currently incredibly depressed. I'm a void. I feel nothing except irritation and dissatisfaction. I feel as though nothing will ever be enough. I'm incredibly bored and all I want is stimulation. Or to be perfect. I want perfection. I want to be that ideal self I feel I really am. I don't think there is going to ever be any getting away from that. I suppose that deep down, I feel there is nothing to me. I have no identity. I am a void. And it's awful. I created this false ideal self that I had to live up to to be happy because deep down truly, I know that I am nothing. That there is nothing much to me, as a person. Perhaps there could have been, but it didn't happen. I did not develop properly. And that's the part I can't deal with. The narcissist within doesn't want to reveal this. She wants to believe that I am exceptional and special. And better than 99% of people. To be honest, I do genuinely believe that. So, perhaps that is what I should embrace. I should just embrace my narcissism. Accept that I am better than other people, and I am exceptional. And go after becoming my exceptional self. I honestly can not deal with being ordinary. I want to be extraordinary. I have to be. Else I will never be satisfied. But then, why am I here? Why are any of us here? If we accept that we have Narcissistic Personality Disorder then are we not accepting that there is in fact nothing special or extraordinary about us? That we are just deluded?"

I think all low-level disorders have the potential to become more problematic if one tries to get rid of defensive mechanisms too soon. So while there is of course an array of very problematic defenses, including things like self-harming, drug abuse etc, a lot of this one can only outgrow over time, if one grows and matures in other parts of ones self; parts that later play there role in stabilizing a personality that originally turned to those destructive things for stabilization. Narcissism itself though is not a bad thing anyways, it just means you like yourself. How you do that and how much it might interfere with your objectivity, interactions with others etc, is much more important imo than classifying some label as implying something pathological.

Well projection has two sides. One side is that you can empty youself of negative states and really feel that those states are now outside of you or part of somebody else. The bad side of it is, that now it is not you anymore that is responsible for your situation, but somebody else. So with projecting out things that you dont want to look at as parts of yourself, you also let go of your agency, of your power to change yourself and your situation. In the worst case, like in people with paranoid disorders, this can turn into feeling controlled or persecuted by others.[/quote] I should just embrace my narcissism. Accept that I am better than other people, and I am exceptional. And go after becoming my exceptional self. I honestly can not deal with being ordinary. I want to be extraordinary. I have to be. Else I will never be satisfied. Well the question is, can you embrace it really? When I read the text you wrote it seems like a lot of oscillation between void / fullness, worthlessnes / perfection, devalued bpd / idealized narcissism. I would argue that to fully embrace something you need the capacity to fully see it, so including the good, bad, and in-between aspects. And in my experience that requires a longer development, possibly needing aid from a professional or somebody that is more ""developed"" than you, so your brain can actually build the complexity necessary to deal with this stuff on a more detailed level; in other words not to oscillate between absolute good and bad stuff, but to becoem more relaxed, accepting and perceiving that there is a spectrum with a wide array of things that can co-exist, while they were originally seen as dichotomous and necessitating dissociation. dx: SPD"
"Dealing with my narcissism... if that's what it is I identify with almost all of what you wrote. I too am a vulnerable/compensatory/covert narcissist (idk what the official term is) and share your feelings. I don't believe it's possible to embrace your narcissism. As you suggest, it's mutually exclusive: you can't embrace the delusion when you know it's a delusion. From here it's a process of learning to manage your narcissistic instincts, manage your expectations and set pragmatic, realistic goals. Accept that failure is an important part of growth. Accept that it's ok to not be as special as you thought you were. Learn to make decisions without second-guessing yourself. Try to abandon the idea of having 'an identity', and instead try to take the zen approach of simply doing what must be done in the moment without spending time worrying about 'who you are'. Above all, be kind to yourself."
"Dealing with my narcissism... if that's what it is BorderlineNarc wrote: New here. Hi all. I want to explore this a little. I am aware that I am either NPD or I sit on the borderline between extremely high narcissism and NPD... I'd say you nearly 100% certainly do not have NPD. If you did, you'd be either an aware (greater) or unaware (midrange or lesser). Because of your situation it seems highly unlikely you are a greater, and therefore you'd have to be unaware. As such it would be practically impossible for you to hold the notion in your mind that you have done something wrong to other people. You would be convinced that you are a great person, even with evidence to the contrary. You are fitting your symptoms to something you have read about. A narc in your position would come off as arrogant, would present a facade, even while admitting that things in his life were working out wrong. Whatever you have is not NPD, but you might still have high narcissistic traits."
"Dealing with my narcissism... if that's what it is First of all, I don't suffer from NPD, but I've dated a person with npd and grew up with a highly narcissistic grandad (he was the overt grandiose type though, he was actually extremely proud of his narcissism, he was NEVER at fault). Personally, I can understand that you want to make sense of your own psyche, learn to understand yourself and rectify or even learn completely new behaviours that are less toxic. My layman advice is as follows: Don't focus too much on a diagnosis, don't get rid of your narcissism altogether, there are healthy narcissistic patterns as well that are potentially life-saving. Ask yourself in all honesty which behaviours you find rather toxic, you may also ask close ones who ""know"" you relatively well what they think your flaws are (under the premise you can handle this, this is a hard pill to swallow for non-narcs as well, so beware). Try to modify toxic behaviour and turn it into something less toxic, for instance, take responsibility for your actions, know it always takes ""two to tango"", accept your flaws, learn to truly love and cherish yourself. I like to think the opposite of toxic narcissism is true self-love because actual narcs don't ""love"" themselves, they are the personification of unaware self-loathing in my honest opinion, they overcompensate A LOT and usually come from a non-loving home, they were never loved for ""just being"". Also, consider therapy, admitting your flaws and working on them is the first step to healing and self-improvement. I must admit I admire some of the traits narcs possess, they can be extremely charming and engaging, they are great at dreaming and it can be quite exhilarating to indulge in their fantasies. The problem is the toxic ones want it all without putting hard work and effort into something, they simply expect too much from the world. Healthy narcissism would be for instance that you want to stand out and be admired, however you put in a lot of hard work and effort and are naturally prosocial, there is nothing toxic in aspiring to achieve this. It only becomes toxic when you exploit others to achieve this goal, get irate if it doesn't work out or worse take said anger out on others for having wronged you, making them responsible for your own failure (classic projection...) As you can imagine, it can get quite blurry at times, there is a fine line between healthy self-esteem and narcissism all the way up to NPD and even NPD is a spectrum and every individual is different (obviously). It's good that you are aware of your narcissistic tendencies, as I've stated previously try to discern which behaviours are toxic and which ones are more on the healthy side. Moreover take it slowly, one step at a time, if you do a ""personality striptease"" too quickly it may get quite dangerous and turn into something really unhealthy the opposite of what you desired to achieve. Take care!"
"Have a false self I have been asking myself a question for some time. I have noticed that a lot of women are drawn to psychopaths/narcissists and like to be belittled and dominated. Why wear a ""mask"" and pretend to be nice, helpful, honest when you are appreciated more by being ""bad"", rude, dishonest? Why demean yourself by copying the image of others who are so inferior to you and sacrifice your image just to gain someone's trust, to be stupid in the eyes of people? What do you gain so well from doing it?"
"HG Tudor I've very recently come across HG Tudor, read a few bits, he makes sense but there is apprehension there for me because he's a self confessed user and abuser. So paying him for a consultation seems stupid. Is this guy really what he says he is? Has anybody dealt with him personally - what's your views about his behaviours.? Thanks in advance Pickles26."
HG Tudor His books are a scam of course; basically they lure people in who like you for some reason are drawn to such personas and tell them stories they want to hear. So yes in a way he is what he says he is. If you want consultation though - and maybe figure out why you personally want consultation from a con-man - go to a professional instead; if you just want information there's lots of good literature out there from people who have actually researched and / or treated the disorders they are talking about. dx: SPD
"HG Tudor I spent 18 months' worth of a major portion of my free time studying narcissism/NPD, and the last third of that on H G Tudor. Of all the material I came across, only Tudor's helped me gain fundamental understanding of NPD. Other providers were moderately helpful. The material published in the name of the profession of psychiatry was marginally useful, or alternately a solid starting point but sometimes incorrect."
"HG Tudor Tudor's classification system really brings to life the behavior you see in people out there, such as Karens, Neighbors from Hell, Stalking Exes, abusive executives etc. Particularly the class of Greater narcs is something that probably hardly comes up on the radar where psychiatry is concerned, but is something I now know I have run into in my life. The classification system offered by psychiatry is unhelpful. It doesn't differentiate between different types but rather declares borders between behaviors that are artifacts of the environment more than the different type of narc. Lastly, psychiatry is most definitely wrong stating narcs are 1% of the population. Tudor states it's 15%, which is not exactly what I'm seeing, but I'd say I'm identifying on the order of 5-10% and there might be more out there that I don't notice."
"How did you survive after self-awareness? Hi, I don't know how it happened but a month ago I gave birth and I'm becoming self-aware. Some stressors irl but I wonder if PPD has triggered some awareness of my vulnerable narcissistic pathology? doc says ""I don't like labels"" but it is what it is. I'm a narcissist going through an inner conflict right now. How I wasn't self-aware before is very distressing. That I'm quite literally nothing is distressing too. I'm empty inside. My false facade of being a good person, a good wife, good anything could be something, or could be nothing. The intense shame and fragmentation of my ego right now is horrendous. My sense of entitlement (my needs will always be taken care of) disturbs me greatly now that I am aware of them. Feeling uncomfortable around people and constantly vulnerable is not pleasant at all. My false facade of ""I don't care what you think of me, I'm a worth while human being"" is fake. I care too much what others think. My mother (whom I HATE so much but need so much at the same time) and my husband keep telling me I'm a good person, good wife, caring, etc. Husband says who cares if youre a narc if you have a conscience and try not to do the wrong things you're ok. I don't think he understands the pain of operating under a false operands. Even now the pain I feel as I type this is too too much. I'm not going to talk too much about my predicament. I'm going to ask - does any form of therapy help with this at all? Maybe developing a new ME? A HUMAN me? I hate not feeling human, that everything I know and believe about myself is just a defense mechanism against intense childhood abuse and shame. And, I have a month old daughter I have to take care not to screw up too much. Thanks."
How did you survive after self-awareness? I've read posts on here from other Narc's and they have made progress through self-awareness. It is possible. I'm sure not an easy road but possible. You sound very conflicted are you sure of your dx? I hope you find your peace. dx BPD with NPD traits
"How did you survive after self-awareness? Yes therapy can help, but only if you are open and willing to cooperate. Being open in that context means the willingness to talk about your feelings, issues, weaknesses, etc. If a person holds back from sharing, they won't get better because they won't be exploring new ideas about themselves. They'll just be in the same mental space. Being mindful will reveal your weaknesses. When you find these weaknesses, do your best not to put yourself down. People with npd can be highly self-critical so be on the look out for how well you treat yourself. Be aware of when you are treating yourself badly. You can tell because your thoughts are making you feel worse. I have more ideas but I'll post them later."
"How did you survive after self-awareness? Thank you all. Sorry for not replying earlier, yesterday I had a lot to take in. I am almost certain of my DX. Why I am conflicted about it is because to me, one of my ""values"" is to be true to myself. To be authentic. Learning that I don't really have a sense of self, that what I think is me is not true, is very disturbing. But my values, mannerisms and likes/dislikes are always changing. It's not that I CHOOSE to change these to cover things up as pop psychology loving nons say on the internet. It's just that I don't have a real, genuine sense of who I am. These feelings come up every so often but somehow I just repress them. Learning about N parents I don't want to pass the BS to my daughter. I honestly want the best for her, what I don't have, and that's authenticity and a good state of mind and emotion. I don't think I completely lack empathy, I just believe it is deficient. It is circumstantial and most of the time I have to actively put myself in that person's position. I honestly believe that everything will turn out all right. How can it not? I will always have a roof over my head, food on my plate, a place to sleep, etc. Everything will be okay for me. The most disturbing part of myself is my systemizing. Evaluating everyone as potential friend or foe. Who will approve of me, who will disapprove of me? My existence depends on some form of approval. Maybe not full blown ""I'm a pop star millionaire"" approval although being recognized as great would be nice. If I am not perfect, how can I be a worthwhile human being? How? HOW? Okay getting off this tangent now. I'm going to see a therapist later today. I'll let you all know how it goes. He specializes in PDs, ""trauma"" and ""psychodynamic therapy"" among others. Maybe others can learn from what I learn. And nmind, I read some of your older posts yesterday. Good stuff. Keep up the good work."
"How did you survive after self-awareness? I think what you are describing is something many people, not only Narcs, go through at some point in their lives. I'm pretty much in the same place as you right now, being a self-diagnosed narcissist. And yes, it's painful to know that you are basically nothing - but that doesn't mean that's all there is to life. Focus on the healthy part of yourself, you have much more to give than you think. Right now you're probably dismissing everything good you ever felt and did, chill out a bit. Even if it was for the wrong reasons, it doesn't take away value from it. And now you can actually start living beyond it. You can start doing things for the sake of doing. You'll see how much joy and pain and whatever you can feel once you stop focusing on yourself and your needs so much. I suppose it will always be sort of like this for us, hopelessly circling around our wound, but life is still out there. Focus on what's happening right in front of you and let things in, even if it's narcissistic crap - you will *know* it's naricssistic crap. And that gives you freedom, as opposed to before. Open and mindful, as nmind said I feel so much more alive (even though I feel bad most of the time) since I just gave in. So now I'm this little stupid Narc in pain but it's going to be better. It already is way better than the emptiness I felt before when I was just repressing my feelings, I feel I'm moving away from it. Consciously turning negativity into positive thoughts and being open should do the trick. I just need to find a way to be content with being happier than I deserve, as Jane Austen put it :') Well I hope this doesn't sound like some spiritual bs, it really does help me get through the day."
"How did you survive after self-awareness? Being mindful of your own psyche is it's own therapy imo The ability to sit and honestly appraise your own behavior and habits is something most people pay a lot of money for, only to be handed out superficial advice by a professional therapist similar to what you're reading now Is it better to feel pain than to be numb to your feelings? I don't know, but I do now that pain is unavoidable, and numbing it out only encourages people to act like blunt instruments. If you want to be true to yourself, perhaps your sense of identity has more basis in feeling than anything else? I mean, everyone's sense of identity is a fabrication. That's the point of it - our roles in the play, (the word ""person""' actually stems is from the latin word for a stage mask hah)...but some people define themselves by what they accomplish, others by who they associate with, some by their completely neurotic thought patterns...maybe you just want to live in harmony with your feelings, instead of repressing them or invalidating them via poor action? “The mystery is this: There is one right thing to do at every moment. We can either follow or resist. Slender threads are at work in all of our lives, guiding us and shaping who we are—call it fate, destiny, or the hand of God.” R Johnson To be a conscionable person is to exist in a realm that transcends personal identity, i think. Maybe that's all wrong, but I hope you and your child are happy. ""Kindly let me help before you drown"" said the monkey, lifting the fish into the tree."

I hate not feeling human, that everything I know and believe about myself is just a defense mechanism against intense childhood abuse and shame. And, I have a month old daughter I have to take care not to screw up too much. Thanks. Yes, therapy helps. You may want to try EMDR, it helped me a lot while facing those feelings. And meditation helps. You need to research and find out what would work for you. This forum should be helpful, because there are a lot of threads where similar questions were asked and many suggestions given. Giving a birth may have triggered a fear that you can not be a good mother and everything else just built up on that. And that means to me that you care about your child, otherwise you wouldn't have come to that emotional state. Just a thought. It may also be the post-birth depression (not sure about the exact name). You should check that with your MD. You have husband that loves and supports you, there must be something good about you. I wish you well on your journey."
"How did you survive after self-awareness? Thank you all so much for your compassion. It really is appreciated. I saw the therapist earlier and it seems certain I have traits of both NPD and BPD (5 from NPD and almost all from BPD) so it looks like a mixture of both. No labels used. He did reassure me before I even said anything that everyone is a hypocrite and that I CAN change because my behaviours and beliefs, even if constantly oscillating (chameleon complex or whatever it is called) by grabbing onto something and holding onto it. He said it will be very challenging (hard) but very possible. My first piece of homework is to listen to music all until next Friday and keep track of how it makes me feel. polly00, I'm sorry you're having to go through this too. But like for me, I have hope for you as well. Hang in there."
"How did you survive after self-awareness? I attacked the real problems in my life, ie. my anxiety, avoidance, .. being part of society; instead of focusing on a diagnosis which is most likely wrong. In other words, i have second-hand awareness: i'm aware that somebody else is aware of my ""NPD"", and i deny it, or at least make abstraction of it and move on with my life. Some things have improved, some things have stayed the same, however i'm actively working on things and i now have a support system."
"How did you survive after self-awareness? Hi there hill, Interesting you say all that. Someone on this forum, from a search I did mentioned ACON and I looked it up and all of it describes me to a T. I'm wondering how much of that fits coverts/hypervigilents/vulnerables? And whether the covert DX is real or just ACON with strong N or BPD (or both) traits? After reading how ""toxic"" people treat their children, I'm sure my mom may be pwBPD and my dad pwNPD (overt). My mom is a perfectionist (she wasn't always) because I think she has my problem, that she is an inner perfectionist, striving for some standard that she can never meet. Like me I don't think that standard is necessarily grandiose just some inner critic that criticises anything and everything she does, she can ""never do right"". But deep down I think she wants to be loved. Yeah she had rage problems in the past, problems with but I think she's trying to atone for that. She tried to hug me yesterday but I said no (I have unresolved problems with her I guess) and she started to cry. I was moved and told her she was a good grandmother, good mom and don't worry, she is loved. She felt better. My dad? Well, I'm not sure what he wants. Respect I guess. It's very hard to be myself around him because he will rage very hard and discard me until some months down the line when to keep face he will pick up the phone. He uses religion as a tool as he is one of the ""good"" and ""real"" 100,000 Christians that are going to heaven and the rest? Well good bye then. He told my brother and I a lot when we were growing up and being kids that ""you're going to hell!"" if we didn't stay in line. That didn't work on his dog though so he physically abused his dog to the 9th degree. I literally become paralyzed at the thought of telling my dad today that I am not religious, in fact I am an atheist. I cannot fathom the outcome of that. I literally cannot be myself. I'm wondering if any of this resonates with anyone else? ACON, covert/hypervigilent, narc, pwNPD, etc? Regardless of what I am or who I am now, I have to set things right. I have to break the cycle of abuse, selfishness and toxicity and do right by my daughter. She cannot turn out like me, I hate me! I want her to be loved, emotionally sound, etc. Of course, thanks for your reply."
"Hot, Cold Someone told me this today. I've never thought of myself as a good person but yes, the thrill of the chase is always better than when you get it. I want someone one day who I can settle with but I always get sad when people stay around me for too long. I need my space and I have formed a habit of relationships with people who are too sociable. I kinda like this one guy but I don't know which way he thinks about me and everyone knows him. If he were to overtly show any sort of interest I would probably run the other direction. I'm too nervous to show him any interest. Maybe I should just accept I will rarely be on the same level as most people and being alone is best. I'm happier any way and it's hard to balance my social dynamic. I can't be completely hermit like - I like to go out- but I don't have the will to hold friendships. Just rambling to the wind anyway."

Non-criminal psychopath? I think it was Otto Kernberg who came up with a scale where NPD sat at the beginning of the scale and psychopathy at the end with Malignant Narcissism in the middle.

Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses
"Non-criminal psychopath? Narcissism is a trait of psychopathy, but it's a very different mechanism. With NPD, the narcissism is used to draw attention, to create a supply that the person needs to feel worth. With psychopathy, the narcissism is a demonstration of how little other people matter. There's no need for the supply. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."

"Non-criminal psychopath? If I understand correctly, the difference would be that narcissists are still identified with humanity: they feel the need to be special, but they are aware that they belong to the same group, and this produces an emotional relationship with others. Psychopaths can behave like narcissists (or like schizoids, or other personalities), can be successful, but they aren't identified with humanity; imho nobody is entirely like this but, less or more, they feel that they are disconnected from humanity. Then, they can ""play"" with someone, someone could create a connection occasionally, but it's very easy and quick to break the connection, entirely and brusquely, when the condition comes back and takes control. “Humor is reason gone mad."" “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”"

It's a fair description. I'll feign care and concern for people, and even offer help to someone, but it's not what most would call a pure motive. As an example: We live in a small community and not far from us is a family of fundamental Christians. The wife is struggling with lockdown, as they have small children and it's causing her a lot of stress. She was near our house with the kids last week and so we went out to say ""hi"" and let the kids play with some livestock we have. Later, my wife said, ""I'm glad we spent some time with them"" and I said, ""Yeah. They're not allowed to spend much time with us, because we're not part of their sect, but now she has to consider that she's getting more support from us evil people than she is from her own kind."" My wife was just glad that she'd helped out a struggling mother. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Does the false self have empathy? So is the one holding the true self captive capable of having reflexive empathy? Cognitivw empathy, yea, but that is cols empathy.

I would classify empathy more into the realm of mentalization and not think of such abstracts as true/false self. But there is such a thing as emotional contagion. In German we have this weird dichotomy between ""Mitgefühl"" vs ""Mitleid"", which had been a topic in therapy a while ago. ""Mitleid"" (Co-Suffering) I would say is the same thing as emotional contagion, it shows that some internal feelings gets triggered in you, you feel an emotion, might be overwhelmed by it. It can be caused for example by being in a bad way yourself, or by having small ego-boundaries... AProphet comes to mind and his constant idea that he was ""telepathically"" feeling other peoples feelings. It can also be caused by other people [subconsciously] trying to make you feel a certain way though, as in projective identification. ""Mitgefühl"" (Co-Feeling) is in contrast an ability where you investigate anothers state in a more complete sense, based on knowledge and curiosity and you are not overwhelmed by ""their"" (read your own) emotions. In Kleinian terms Mitleid is more a part-object thing, Mitgefühl is more a whole-object thing, where you realte to the person as an adult and you might feel bad for them, but you are also having enough distance to be helpful. A caricature of a contaged (?) therapist would be a therapist for example who hears your story and then starts sobbing uncontrollably. Aside from being evry unprofessional it also shows that he has a very all/nothin state now and he is being overwhelmed by something that is not clearly yours and not clearly his. If that makes sense. Mitgefühl is a outcome of a lessening of narcissism and strengthening or accurate mentalization capacity I feel. So maybe if you are uncertain if its emotional contagion or empathy, you could try to see how clearly your conscious/unconscious boundaries to that other person have been in that situation and how much you felt of their emotions were in you and vice versa. Also if you have the required knowledge to know if he was actually suffering for example, or if that was just your idea. dx: SPD"
Does the false self have empathy? Akuma thank you for that explanation. Interesting that those words have no translation in english Selfserf in my experience being moved by someone's suffer depends much on your own experience of suffer. It sort of resonates with you. For instance i witness disabled person offering seat to disabled person. Probably because they know what it is. When you talk about contradictions: i think it's very present in everybody. This person is threatening for your job then you begins to know him better. I have experienced that in new jobs. i remember a colleague who welcomed me very aggressively. Later we enjoyed working together for long time. Sometimes contradictory feelings coexists. For me It's a little like taste. When you eat lots of tastes coexist. Sometimes you even can't name them.
"Does the false self have empathy? Philonoe wrote: Akuma thank you for that explanation. Are you for real, Philonoe ? There are many ways to relate to people: 1) you may quite literally feel their feelings because you experienced them, a manner of relating through reminiscence and association 2) you may mirror people's feelings to validate them without having experienced them 3) you may understand, as a logical calculation or deduction, what they are going through All of the methods above have strengths and downsides: in terms of appraising the situation accurately, in terms of responding accurately... They all require some adjusting: as someone grows healthier, they also develop an ability to mix and match. But Number 1 remains, by far, the most accurate and shortest way to get through to someone's pain and motivation, because that's literally what it was designed for!! Basically what Akuma is saying above is that number 1 is not a valid expression of empathy. He is denigrating one of the major point of entry into relating to one another because he has, admittedly, little access to it. It's not only offensive for a majority of people, providing you see through the mumbo jumbo, but also alarmingly wrong."
"Does the false self have empathy? ViniStonemoss, Yes i find that comment interesting. There are different themes involved in the discussion. One is the ability to ""feel"" when someone lives something. it can be related to your own experience like we said. it can be related to your own state of mind. for instance i can totally miss someone's feelings in case i'm myself preoccupied. i become very selfcentered and sort of don't see people or people's needs. What i find interesting is to relate it to boundaries. if i have no good internal boundaries i become fragile with other's feelings. Some people can't listen to other's feelings because they become too involved or depressed. If i have no good external boundaries i can project own feeling on the person for instance. in both cases there are no two persons in the room. in one case i disappear. in one case they disappear. that doesn't mean that i don't feel. Boundaries make possible to relate to someone. accept they exist, they have feelings, some of them i perceive or share, some of them i don't. People who are able to listen and to relate - be therapists or not - are very precious. they make dialog possible. So yes Akuma's post opens interesting directions it seems to me"
"Does the false self have empathy? The theme itself is interesting, but that's as far as I can go. Going back to Self Serf's post, which is supposed to be the focus, remember? So going back to Self Serf's original post, it sounds like Self Serf experienced a genuine moment, if only fleeting, of consideration or empathy for someone else. Something worth celebrating more than anything. Now, I don't know, in this post, where one can find a hint that this could constitute emotional contagion. In fact, Self Serf is being forward, explaining that, because of is unwitting current state of self-absorption (""my own suffering"", ""absorbed by that"", ""my own loss""...), they may struggle to take in people's feelings. Either you possess such bad boundaries that you let anyone and anything affect you, or you stand like a fortress in regard to other people's suffering, it can't be both. With this in mind, the whole emotional contagion tirade seems bizarre. At the very best, it's a rather passive aggressive jab, taking away the focus from the original question. If you are concerned with poor boundaries, perhaps an area to investigate is how you may contribute to supporting negative or destructive behaviors? If you seek figures to enable? Perhaps you could remind yourself, and I mean that in the kindest way possible, that narcissism is a drug, and that by supporting a projected image instead of the person behind, you come closer to being a figurative dealer supplying the drug than to helping them. I'm otherwise always happy to discuss the issue of boundaries, since I have extensive experience in that regard."
"Does the false self have empathy? Maybe this is a good moment to relate the story that triggered the discussion with my therapist that I summarized above. Basically there was a series that I am watching which essentially talks about abuse and the family dynamics that come with that and the attempt of the people to get out of it. So theres this moment where one of the characters that I like very much is depressed. A girl who was in love with him for a long while has just admitted to him that she realized she really never loved him but she needed someone she can pity and who had it worse than her; and he told her that he will never love her, and never love anyone for that matter anyways. So he comes home and doesnt speak and doesnt eat. So the other main protagonist is wondering what to do when one of the younger guys comes running to her saying ""You know he is feeling down but that doesnt mean we have to, right? Right? Lets do something fun!"" And they both walk off to have fun outside. I was perplexed, because I couldnt react that way, I immediately feel bad when he is feeling bad, I see someone I like very much suffering and my impulse is to go after him, to not eat either, to not be able to ""do something fun"", probably I would just want to sit there in silence but if I actually went out, I would probably feel guilty all of the time. Of course the problem is that if I go after him, that is not necessarily what he wants, and even if he wants it, its not necessarily what he needs ; his current situatioon is a moment in his development and might be necessary; at the very least one has to clarify and to be able to accept the result. On the other hand side, the little guy is right; theres no need to feel bad because the othe rperson is feelign bad. And just like that weird girl, I might not really act out of love, but out of pity, maybe even out of fear. This is also what incited the inspection of the difference between Mitleid and Mitgefühl in my session with my therapist and I think this is what triggers Vini here, because really realizing another person is seperate is a pretty big step, and one that cant be gotten to by narcissistic means and which doesnt just spontaenously develop out of nowhere; realizing other people have hidden thoughts you will never know, feelings you will never have access to, that of course you cannot feel others feelings is a scary thing and not without reason this shift is called ""depressive position"" in Kleinian terms. And I think in a way this relates also very well to the question of SelfSerf about the False Self in a way. When the True Self (staying with Winnicott) is the untainted aliveness of the biological organism and the False Self is the hindrances to that aliveness implanted by our parents. And in a way that lack of boundaries, as Philonoe calls it, that necessity to be ""there"" for others is such a False Self aspect. My caregivers for example brought me up in a way where it was not always clear that they were seperate, and in I learned to be constantly wary of their feelings and their states, feeling responsible for their inner world, feeling unable to just let them be and ""do something fun"" a lot of the times, I would think. And I think in a way SelfSerf is still in the same position. I remember ""just going away"" (both from certain people in his family and certain inner states) and having fun is something that he struggled with tremendously. Its really the same theme and I fidn it much more relevant, than a short-term ""constriction"", if only to try putting it into context. dx: SPD"

So the other main protagonist is wondering what to do when one of the younger guys comes running to her saying ""You know he is feeling down but that doesnt mean we have to, right? Right? Lets do something fun!"" And they both walk off to have fun outside. I could not agree more but I never called this into question.

This ^ is not consistent with what I know about you... And I think in a way SelfSerf is still in the same position. I remember ""just going away"" (both from certain people in his family and certain inner states) and having fun is something that he struggled with tremendously. Its really the same theme and I fidn it much more relevant, than a short-term ""constriction"", if only to try putting it into context. I think people here are more likely to be counter-dependent than co-dependent. Not that it's impossible to find both in a single person, but NPD's core issue is counterdepency."
"Does the false self have empathy? Hi, I find this thread very interesting.

I very much relate with that Akuma wrote: realizing other people have hidden thoughts you will never know, feelings you will never have access to, that of course you cannot feel others feelings is a scary thing and not without reason this shift is called ""depressive position"" in Kleinian terms. Is that what they call ""the depressive position""? So it would be necessary step to accept that other people exist ViniStemoss wrote: What is it that triggered me? It's not clear... As I wrote, the reason why I take issue with your comment is because it glorifies ""logicizing"" feelings by caricaturing to extremes emotional empathy. But overlooking your feelings altogether on your way to rationalizing them is the most pressing danger that people with NPD face. I think that the psychological/psychoanalysis talk can be triggering because it sort of implies that they can read inside people - which is false and terrifying. It has to do with boundaries like we talked. Each one need own boundaries and own space, where others are not supposed to enter. Even therapists. That doesn't mean that they can not study human soul in general. Just that your soul is yours. In the discussion, i thing the ""separate"" part is very important. It's particularly important for parent i think. If your parent isn't separate from you, he'll think he can read you, he'll be triggered by your autonomy, he'll be triggered by your existence. How can you develop yourself in such world?"
"Does the false self have empathy? Is that what they call ""the depressive position""? So it would be necessary step to accept that other people exist Its a general reading of it yea. You might have checked the definition of it, so Melanie Kleins original meaning is a bit more specific in regards to the development of toddlers / children. But in general, Kleinian psychoanalysts will be on the lookout for the presence of moments where the patient is either more in one or the other position and tune their interventions accordingly. dx: SPD"
"Long-term employment So where do you stand on this? Are you able to keep up appearances well enough so as to go for a 9-5? Basically I’m finding out the hard way that I couldn’t handle a l”normal” 5-day workweek at this factory any longer. I’m simply too bad of a mixture of schizoid/antisocial/paranoid combined with BPD/derealization to handle what I deem simple tasks on some days. Like I might get super anxious and my panties in a twist so some mechanical stuff might suffer due to forgetfulness or being hazy, not to mention my incapability to have proper relationships. I got a job through one of my longest frienda/acquaintances (there’s been alienation) at his co-founded company that is a very progressive tech-minded reputable one that really has all the potential to be the next big thing and grabbing a considerable market share worldwide. So after a year or two of struggling and being in a very dark place. This really felt like the only real thing to give my life any real purpose because it actually felt like I was doing important work (Im covert so it’s always been am-special-through-association but after 6months am pretty much exhausted and so it seems that Ive worn out my welcome). Otherwise the vision of the company is something I can get behind and there are a lot of perks to staying there, but my mental issues have got in the way enough as to render attempts at staying futile. But overall my life is a sham and in such a deteriorated/decrepit state that am considering offing myself daily anyhow. If I lose this job it seems like a done deal. Basically prior to this been going off for around two years on what one would call secondary supply, trying to charm, entertain people to make my company worthwhile and all-encompassing self-loathing but I finally feel like am done. Am not a team-player and that company is really into tying together the whole workplace in a team-based way so I’ve been an immediate outlier. Tried my best to fake going along with it but it doesn’t come naturally at all and I keep defaulting (no real interest in others, do-my-work,go-home, repeat). Not capable of proper relations. I’ve also had quite a few ###$ (mostly Ive been more harsh as it pertains to these than my actual supervisors) and have reacted either too hot or with other issues too nonchalantly. The thing is I simply dont truly care enough and if am not doing anything challenging (it’s routineous work, although not arduous) I get bored very easily and the work suffers. Basically as much as I need to be surrounded by people for keeping sane, I’m finding it impossible. Am too delusional. People have surelt taken note of my mental health or lack lf thereof. Some trying to accomodate, some simply evade now. I have already had a few talks on my behaviour throughout the time Ive spent there and got final notice to pick up my act (being on time, not late every day) until their final verdict and if so might be able to stay but today I overheard a conversation not meant for my ears about basically not keeping “just any sort of people” there so I guess am done. How do you find this type of work that requires standing still at a desk, doing repetitive motions and such? “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Long-term employment Ive never had the will to have a normal job. When I was still high all day I was only selling some drugs to be abel to buy my own but thats mostly it. Money also was never an issue as I dont really buy stuff and when I still had contact with my family there was always a small plus there. Now thet Ive aborted contact with them though the money is really low, Ive lost quite some weight due to not eating right and possibly I'm getting annoyed overall with living this sort of depressive life now as a byproduct of therapy. So I've started putting stuff into motion to get more money and do some work in the near future. Im not sure yet though what works best for me, I assume beign self-emplyed is better and I'm aiming at that direction, too. I think doing several things would be the most useful to me, as I would probably consider a desk job or something to be like a prison. As with apperances I think youre overthinking stuff as usual :p. Even schizophrenics get recruited, they can happily hallucinate away while working - as long as they get their work done, nobody cares. dx: SPD"

Surely you don't $#%^ in public, nor do we sleep in the streets a day more more than we really have to, so why in the world would we show strangers something so intimate and vulnarable? Is it a means of befriending people? To show that you are not a threat to one another?

If I have a job that has very little contact with other people, I tend to go insane from the lack of supply. Feeling empty and bored and depressed etc. But if I have a job with a lot of interaction, I tend to be really anxious, make mistakes socially that offend or alienate people and feel very anxious or unsatisfied."
"Am I a Narcissist? Aspergers This is really mortifying for me to admit to these feelings, so please go easy on me. I really hope that nobody I know comes across this thread. I need to say that I have a diagnosis of Aspergers and struggle with expectations in society, my expectations, body language and people’s intentions. I don’t have any friends and am often seen as being stuck up and aloof. For the last year I have secretly wondered if I am a narcissist due to some of my behaviours but also behaviours in myself that I see in my father who I think might be one. Though I honestly think he is much, much worse than myself. I have to firstly say that I don’t see myself as being a manipulative individual or someone who tries to upset others. I don’t gaslight people. I don’t ignore them. My father does this constantly and it greatly lowers my confidence. So I know how this feels and would never intentionally do this. However, there are some aspects of narcissism that I wonder about and see in myself: - I want to be admired or feel special. I have always felt this way and don’t like being in the room when other people are getting attention and I am ignored. For ex, as a child I would get jealous and resent my baby newphew when my relatives would fawn over him. - I get jealous of everyone and everything very easily. - I am extremely insecure and feel inferior to everyone and everything. Not to the extent that I am an eggshell, more just that I feel everyone’s life is better than mines. - I lack self confidence. - I want to be admired but I do not like attention. I don’t understand why this is and I am confused by it myself! - People always perceive me to be stuck up. - I find it very, very hard to emphasise with certain things and others issues. I can’t understand their issues or how they would be a difficulty. - I have deep fantasies of becoming wealthy and living a well off lifestyle. I fantasise often. I think in a way this helps with depression. I do not fantasise about power. I know that fantasising often is a trait of Narcissism. - I am extremely defensive and cannot really handle criticism at all. Criticism to me feels like an attack where someone is running you down. - I am not keen being second best or not performing to a high standard in every field. (I know this sounds childish but it is the reality) These are feelings that I feel on a daily basis. I know they’re inappropriate because I don’t want to admit them. I feel ashamed to have these feelings but in a way I feel it’s just me and I don’t have any control over the feelings. I think my Aspergers contributes to this in some way. I do not know if I am a narcissist or a heavily damaged person. I often wonder why I have turned out this way. I would like to be able to improve. I want to be able to live my life, feeling secure in myself and not feeling inferior to everyone. I also want to rid myself of these emotions. I am now a grown man in his 20’s, I don’t need to and shouldn’t feel the need to be admired by others to feel confident and loved. I shouldn’t be feeling jealous of everyone or everything. Yet I have this constant worry of blending in and being an average person who does not achieve anything special in his life. Yet here we are. And I don’t really know what to do about this? Are my emotions abnormal? Am I a narcissist?"
"Am I a Narcissist? Aspergers Well narcissism has a lot of different meanings, usually boiling down to some pathology in how people see themselves or how they regulate their self-esteem. ""Narcissistic disorder"" can mean any personality disorder and a ""narcissistic personality disorder"" is again a different thing, and can be described either by consulting the DSM, or by looking at psychodynamic explanations for example by Otto Kernberg or other authors, and describes very specific structural changes based on early experiences, and is again subclassed... So- aside from the forum rule not to diagnose people - that always complicates the situation. Normally you would go to a [psychodynamic / psychoanalytic] therapist for a few probatoric sessions and there you would get a diagnostic estimation, most likely from the perspective of their school of psychology. He also would then be able to give you options and directions as to which treatments might be available and how much sense they make for you. In that context he will probably also give you an approximation of the prognosis of such treatment in your specific case, based on said diagnosis, some quick structural / neurotic assessment he has made in the talsk with you and stuff like how psychology-minded you are, your motivation and other things. That being said - without evaluating any diagnosis here - a lot of what you list seems reactive to me; specifically reactive to someone who didnt have enough opportunity to learn interacting with others and regulating his self-image in relation to others in a more healthy way, perhaps. Ive also heard from someone else that theres a range of behaviors and stuff that can be similar in ASD compared to some other mental disorders including pathologies in narcissism, so there again, a differential by a professional seems the best choice. Last but not least, surprisingly many people seem to somehow link manipulativeness with narcissism, which isnt the case. Manipulativeness / Conning etc. are aspects of antisocial disorders. While there is the ""interpersonal exploitative"" point in the DSM for NPD, that has more to do with an unconscious using of others or taking stuff for granted, compared to an actual goal-oriented scheming to exploit them as seen on the ASPD spectrum. Hope that gives some pointers. dx: SPD"

Just so that you know, in case you are indeed struggling with narcissistic issues, most people with NPD would not readily see themselves as manipulative. This forum's history is filled with posts from people who admit to manipulative behaviors without realizing it, then go on the next sentence justifying how they are victims of circumstance or others. It's a classic. People with ASPD, in contrast, aren't as focused on how people perceive them, so they are naturally more forward about being manipulative. But NPD, being an image-based disorder, is always escorted by a strong need to rewrite the narrative, both in the eyes of the world and one's own eyes primordially. Which in itself constitutes manipulative behaviors, but likely to fly under one's own radar. On other Cluster B forums, you might come across a lot of disbelief as well, but this is unique to NPD: the undercurrent tinge of desperation to appear a certain way (good, wise, poised etc.), to a point of redefining the disorder if needs be."
"Emptiness, and depersonalization Hi all, probably posted about this before but whatever: - Supposedly for VNs emptiness/DP is a way for the ego to regulate feelings of shame. ""Psychoanalytical theories coincide in understanding depersonalization (DP) as a disorder of narcissistic self-regulation. DP is described as an ego defense against overwhelming shame resulting in a splitting of an observing ego detached from the experiencing self. In contrast to a behavioral-cognitive theory on DP, which suggests that the catastrophic appraisal of normal transient DP maintains the disorder, psychodynamic approaches stress that DP is an important defensive function for the individual. We examine this psychodynamic aspect more closely as it relates to narcissistic self-regulation and interpersonal behavior in depersonalized patients."" I've had dp/dr on off for a while now, I suspect another cause too but this one seems to fit as well, like it's easier most of the time to just remain empty and distant to yourself rather than face the shame ridden core. Anyone else? BDD and vulnerable narcissism/avpd traits. (possible psychotic traits/undiagnosed, or trauma/anxiety(?)"

Anyone else? Ive not read about any connection between shame and DP / DR. Ive had this a lot as a kid and still have it on and off nowadays, but I cant really find common causes to it - last few times I had it just wandering around town when I went to the grocery store. When I was looking at it a few days ago, it seemed to me like it was quite the opposite of a narcissistic activity, it seemed more like an amplification of the flat nature of experience, in a peculiar way almost a lessenign of positive self-investment. I think emptiness is a result of an absence of [good] internalized early objects. So a regression to a level of emptiness will naturally lead to an experience of that same emptiness. That inner emptiness might originate in a sort of a nondual reality, so when that emptiness was ""formed"" when inner and outer werent clearly established, now the inner core of all internal and outside reality is ultimately empty. DP I think can be an attack on certain connections, so a form of fragmentation... but I suppose can be also an awareness of that emptiness... possibly also as a result of having been brought up in an environment where you were supplied physically but not emotionally. So you are in a way an automaton, you can eat and $#%^ but you cant relax; a factor might also be something like insecure to fearful attachment, the basic absence of the good caregiver which leads to an inability to ""withdraw"" into the good internal caregiver womb. So theres nothing there, theres just emptiness. But its not the good emptiness of nonbeing that is the goal of the death instinct, but In that emptiness there is a formless consciousness that exists before god so to speak. In that way its not at all narcissistic. dx: SPD"
"Emptiness, and depersonalization Depersonalization/Derealization can stem from neglect or intrusive parenting. I suppose it may be hard to experience a continuous sense of embodiment if you're lacking interpersonal stimulation when growing up. But my experience is that excessively intrusive and controlling parenting can lead you to detach from your emotions, sense of groundedness and reality. It's a way of escaping negative experiences that solidified into an habit (or coping mechanism)."
Remorse and shame I feel such terrible remorse and shame for all I have done. I cannot keep friendships to save my life and I don’t know how to have them. Why my husband stays with me is a miracle. Some things improve and some things don’t. I just want to move forward and be able to keep friendships. Thanks for letting me vent.
"Mortification So, does anyone have any relations to this concept? I just found out about this and sort of felt like it captured the sense of total ennui I've been experiencing lately. Except that it's not quite that but a combination of being collapsed/deflated, i.e losing all sense of agency, being very desperate, using people as objects even more than before. But then again am unwilling to fold and settle to looking for help (because I'm obsessed with my ASPD traits) that get augmented every now and again. The NPD part of me is actually the better half, go figure huh? What this mortification entails for me is sort of he grandiosity gap between what I envision my life to be and what it actually is as grown into the size of a canyon to the point of where I feel a strong sense of derealization. There is a part of me that is kind of keeping feet on the ground but when it gets dissociated my sense of being present really takes flight and I fall into some low-level psychosis type thing. Currently I seem to spend all my weekends (free time) in a total haze of depression, unwillingness and lack of agency to actually take up anything. It feels like childish pouting except the concepts I'm struggle with seem to be very Shakespearean (to be or not to be). (Preparations for) uicide hangs very high on my to-do list. *Disclaimer Personal story* Like yesterday I had a very odd situation with a girl who I was kind of taken in by (she is a gorgeous girl who is really conscientious, ambitious and also very intelligent and creative, basically everything that I wouldve aspired to be were it not for my mentall illness and it screams high status to me, not really my type but fit the bill of ideal supply. I knew I had no chance with her so even her taking a liking to me as a person was a win in my book.) So she fell in love with someone and when I inquired in a roundabout way who her new love interest was, she said something that the new guy is 10% of the reason why she wants to move out (we share an apartment) because from this guy she found out something through a random mention that kind of alludes to my past somehow and I immediately felt a sense of impending doom (because my first girlfriend of 4yrs and then my second of 2yrs both used to live in that same house once upon a time (big communal building) and I done both of them so wrong. Even my third girlfriend had connections to that house that I still rent a room in so basically it's all connected and makes me intensely paranoid. It felt like a sudden loss of control over who she thought I was because I had no clue what she couldve been told by this person who she did not want to divulge the identity of. So being left into the unknown felt extremely imposing and immediately rattled the thoughts of the necessity of suicide in my brain. /had too little sleep and too much coffee today, hence the rambling “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

"Mortification Akuma, am not entirely sure you followed my idea and it was my fault as I did not include the quintessnce of what mortifiction is. Narcissistic mortification is ""the primitive terror of self dissolution, triggered by the sudden exposure of one's sense of a defective self ... it is death by embarrassment"".[1] Narcissistic mortification is a term first used by Sigmund Freud in his last book, Moses and Monotheism,[2] with respect to early injuries to the ego/self. The concept has been widely employed in ego psychology and also contributed to the roots of self psychology. When narcissistic mortification is experienced for the first time, it may be defined as a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality, or both. This produces strong emotions of terror while at the same time narcissistic libido (also known as ego-libido) or destrudo is built up.[3] Narcissistic libido or ego-libido is the concentration of libido on the self. Destrudo is the opposite of libido and is the impulse to destroy oneself and everything associated with oneself ‘Setback’ is really a soft word for what true mortification is. It’s like being struck by death itself but from your own insides. I felt this once when I saw my first girlfriend at a party together with a girl who was the best friend of my then dumped girlfriend. It was a mixture of disbelief/denial of thw fact that these two worlds I had tried to keep completely separate had come together in a way where all parties knew of my shortcomings and really, insanity. I felt like jumping off the balcony then and there. It was like a conplete resistance to the reality I was at tthe moment. The situation I described in my initial post was really more like being close unmasking. As it pertains to that girl I referred to, she was kind enough to stil offer her acceptance and understanding (even if she in all actuality did not at all understand why I started acting odd and tried my best not to pry further i to the identity of the person and continue the conversation. It was near impossible though because it just completely enveloped my being. To discuss with her my shortcomings in previous relationships would have been just too much, hence mortification. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Mortification Interesting, I am thinking about similar topics right now. Why does someone develop libido and someone else destrudo? Which factors are influencing the tendencies for these two different attitudes? Ps: not totally sure, but my personal idea is that mortification is a death simulation, more than a real death. The subject needs to believe it's real 'though: differently, it wouldn't work. The goal of mortification is to protect the whole person from social exclusion, and from the real death that would come from that exclusion - considered that our survival depends on others, and even more when we are children. Then, if the Self isn't “right” for a particular social contest, the Self “kills” the Self, denies to exist in order to allow the individual to survive. But who is the individual? I think that the division between “Self” and “not Self” is more apparent than real: it's real from a superficial pov, not so real if you consider it deeper. The Self divided the Self in two parts, one part becomes something different, ignoring or acting against the Self; the masked Self looks like a second nature, but it's basically a derivation from the Self. It's like Halloween, when people wear like zombies, to protect themselves from zombies. ...just my opinion. “Humor is reason gone mad."" “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”"
"Mortification ‘Setback’ is really a soft word for what true mortification is. It’s like being struck by death itself but from your own insides. The question is is it part of an evolution, of some path you are on to getting better or not. If it is, then its a setback. Theres no need to dramatize it further or drown it in hysterics, if its already in itself hard to bear. Then your job is to learn to bear it over time, with your goal in mind. Or to learn keeping the goal in mind and then learning to bear it later. But if you chose to have noone to bring these experiences to, noone to figure out what they are, if they maybe are not what you think they are, to help you understand them, to transform them over time into something different, then there is nothing more to say and nowhere to follow you. dx: SPD"

Nice Selfserf. I wasnt aware the term existed in Freud. Yes, this Is what I experienced as well, an overwhelming lack of focus/drive, following my first period of isolation and intereflection, retreat into inner world (period of introversive libido, Jung). I can see you are using that time to reflect as well. Any signifcant dreams or hypnagogic visions? Can you write in more detail this grandiosity gap you speak of, what are your expectations? So this came as a sudden realization on the party? You said you started acting odd, and felt somewhat not in control of that? The Unmasking, you mean shame or what exactly?"
"Mortification Am aware of Vaknin being controversial but I believe he is onto something here. As someone who cycles between all these modes or overlays like going through socks, I totally see why one would want to. As far as treatment options, it probably wouldn’t be of much use. And dare I say, I find him to be quite enjoyable to listen. Used to detest him before which I guess is telling of my mindstate as well... https://youtu.be/889Q6aH5HeU Tl;dr: he basically tries to make all of these conditions overlap into one Cluster C disorder or being morally insane, which seems quite feasible.

"Do I have NPD? [being assessed] Hi. I'm currently being assessed for a range of things and I wanted to see if I could speak to people with NPD to get your take/opinion on this. It's really hard trying to find any actual help or neutral info on NPD out there, it's all articles by supposed empaths talking about how evil narcissism is. Bleh. Anyway. I've always thought I had ADHD and anxiety, then when my doctor started talking about Personality Disorders, I did some research and thought hmm, alright. I can see how I could be a Cluster B, probably BPD. However, I've been unable to shake the idea I might have NPD. This is why.. I do have a very cultivated self image. I'm very aware of it and I lie to maintain it, all the time. I don't feel guilty for lying. I'm happy to lie to most people, even close friends or family. I behave in... I don't know, I don't think it's necessarily abusive ways, but then, of course I would say that. I suppose if I try to objective about it, then yes, I can see how my behaviour can be abusive. Obsessive. Gaslighting people. However, I think my empathy levels are higher than you'd have for a diagnosis of NPD. I don't think I have abundance of empathy, but I have some. Maybe less than your average person. I can be quite self centred. I'm insecure and it really bothers me if people don't like me (even if I hate them). I will be literally obsessed if I think someone is one-upping me, to the point of self destruction. I guess I do think about being powerful and successful, not I'm not that bothered, if that makes sense. I like a daydream as much as the next person but I don't seek out material stuff. If you asked me if I think I'm better than others... not necessarily. I go up and down. I think I'm unique but not necessarily better than everyone. Someone who hates me recently mentioned to a friend they think I have NPD and they had all this ""evidence"". It made me kinda pissed they were doing all this research on me and giving me this diagnosis. But to be fair to them it did make me think about it and I can see some of their points. But, they're also a bit messed up themselves and got a lot of wires twisted so I can't take them 100% seriously. I do like praise and admiration, sure. I guess I do seek it. And it's very much like ""woah!!"" like a rush, a hit, getting that good bit of admiration or something, and then it passes fast. So I feel like I'm always looking for that next hit and not appreciating it when good things happen. To be honest I think I'm probably going to end up with a diagnosis of BPD. But I am intrigued by the traits I have that correlate with NPD symptoms because I can see it. It's just goddamn hard finding neutral/supportive stuff out there for people with NPD. Even if I'm not NPD, I think I could benefit from it. My ego is so ridiculously sensitive and I do think it would do me good to be humbled a bit, and to feel bad when I hurt people even if I personally think they deserve it. Thanks for reading! K"
"Do I have NPD? [being assessed] Diagnosis is done by a professional at the beginning of a treatment usually and it makes little sense outside of that context - actually even inside of it it looses its relevance rather quickly, as for the patient the diagnosis has little influence on the ""day-to-day"" of long-term treatment. In addition its against the ruels here to try diagnosing someone anyways. Empathy is restricted in different disorders ranging from substance abuse disorder to depression and is dysfunctional in most PDs. Thinking one has or doesnt have a certain type of empathy is not a good indicator and without having been in therapy for a longer time I think its hard to self-assess something like this anyways. This goes fo ra lot of stuff, as one is trying to get a clear picture of something with a broken lens. dx: SPD"
"Long-term employment So where do you stand on this? Are you able to keep up appearances well enough so as to go for a 9-5? Basically I’m finding out the hard way that I couldn’t handle a l”normal” 5-day workweek at this factory any longer. I’m simply too bad of a mixture of schizoid/antisocial/paranoid combined with BPD/derealization to handle what I deem simple tasks on some days. Like I might get super anxious and my panties in a twist so some mechanical stuff might suffer due to forgetfulness or being hazy, not to mention my incapability to have proper relationships. I got a job through one of my longest frienda/acquaintances (there’s been alienation) at his co-founded company that is a very progressive tech-minded reputable one that really has all the potential to be the next big thing and grabbing a considerable market share worldwide. So after a year or two of struggling and being in a very dark place. This really felt like the only real thing to give my life any real purpose because it actually felt like I was doing important work (Im covert so it’s always been am-special-through-association but after 6months am pretty much exhausted and so it seems that Ive worn out my welcome). Otherwise the vision of the company is something I can get behind and there are a lot of perks to staying there, but my mental issues have got in the way enough as to render attempts at staying futile. Basically prior to this been going off for around two years on what one would call secondary supply, trying to charm, entertain people to make my company worthwhile and all-encompassing self-loathing but I finally feel like am done. Am not a team-player and that company is really into tying together the whole workplace in a team-based way so I’ve been an immediate outlier. Tried my best to fake going along with it but it doesn’t come naturally at all and I keep defaulting (no real interest in others, do-my-work,go-home, repeat). Not capable of proper relations. I’ve also had quite a few ###$ (mostly Ive been more harsh as it pertains to these than my actual supervisors) and have reacted either too hot or with other issues too nonchalantly. The thing is I simply dont truly care enough and if am not doing anything challenging (it’s routineous work, although not ardoua) I get bored very easily and the work suffers. How do you find this type of work that requires standing still at a desk, doing repetitive motions and such? “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Punch and Judy. Punch and Judy. The truth with narcissistic people is that they constantly need an audience to fulfil their image. Think of you and I are like a mirror to them and without this mirror (us) they are nothing special. Narcissists have this pseudo talent to make us feel disempowered and they play on our unwavering allegiance to those close to us for them to get their kicks, but the sad truth of the matter for them narcissists is that they are afraid of not being immortalised by existing in conversations way beyond their death’s. This master manipulator deep down is scared all the time that they won’t be remembered so they over-compensate and bully because of this paranoia, in turn giving us the true power and control over them; like my mum always says to me when I get stroppy and dig my heals in, she says “you’ll need me before I’ll need you.” and that has come to bite me in the arse on more than one occasion in my younger years. So, be mindful that when it comes to dealing with narcissistic people- just remember what my mum said, that they will need us before we will need them. This paradigm shift means that we have the power and not them. Stay safe and be beautiful. Your friend, B. Bully. hidden depths"

"Feelings. I’ve heard NPD described as emotionally stunted, lacking in many and I’ve seen it talked about online as well as on here at times. What I am more curious about is do you with NPD or those with psychopathy do you feel things. Sounds kind of stupid and maybe it is but it’s a curiosity I have. Are you able to feel things like someone running their finger up your arm, does it give you chills or goosebumps or is that sensation blocked. What about sexually, do you enjoy sex, do you experience the feelings and sensations that go along with intercourse? Reason I ask is I read about a case of a woman with NPD and she was so shamed her entire life about her sexuality that she lost sensation to her sexual parts. She didn’t enjoy sex and experienced great shame from having it but knew it was necessary to keep a relationship going which obviously always became a problem Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"
"Feelings. I enjoy sex but after two years with my bf, he still says having sex with me feels like having sex with a stranger, as if I'm just using him for a one night stand. This always surprises me. Apparently there is a lot of stuff I am missing out on that goes on between long-term partners...that I would not otherwise know about because they are, well, missing. My baseline is indifferent....or 'deadly calm.' Everything I do is cold and calculated. There's a lot of ""feelings"" I imitate for calculated reasons which I have gotten through observation...sometimes having a fake persona is like also being a director where I cue myself as to what I need to convey in a given moment and then I deliver. Anger is one of those feelings that I have gotten a lot of practice with imitating to the point I can pass it off as real, because it can be ideal for manipulation...however there is nothing real about it, because if somebody walks into the room who, for tactical reasons, I do not want to get that impression of me, I can instantly turn the ""anger"" off and maneuver into an outward presentation of positive and friendly, and then just instantly change the narrative, ""oh hey thanks for joining us, we were just discussing such and such..."" I'm big on the it never happened if nobody but my accuser witnessed it happen...but after awhile, these kinds of transitions can lead people to talk and they figure it out, so I found its better to just maintain a consistent mask of corporate and businesslike, unless in a more social atmosphere where humor, charm and something more prosocial is more useful. That said, I think I feel stuff genuinely, but they do not connect into my actions, and I can turn it on or off. I can like somebody and still, if I have an opportunity to take something I want from them, I'll do so, and then I'll get push back from them about ""I thought we were friends and had built a great rapport"", and I'm at a loss for what any of that means...at the end of the day, it's nothing personal. It is sort of the same with right and wrong. I can distinguish between the two intellectually and grasp that what I am doing is against the law but the distinction and/or knowledge has no effect on my actions, no 'pull', no 'current'...it only gives me incentive to rehearse a fake narrative or clean up the paper trail."

What about sexually, do you enjoy sex, do you experience the feelings and sensations that go along with intercourse? I don't really like the ""soft touch"" stuff; it feels annoying and not much different to being in cold water. Sex is different; I like sex to the point of addiction, but I get aggressive. Fortunately, it's something that my wife likes but there are times when I get too aggressive and have to back off, as it makes her nervous. I also prefer it when she gets aggressive / assertive. Maybe one day a week we won't have sex, but it's rare. Afterwards, I don't really have much interest in physical contact and just want to watch TV. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Feelings. Sex is a odd situation the more I have thought about it. It’s very intense and active in the beginning and I like to play little power struggles in bed too similar to what Jomp mentions, this fades quickly though until eventually the idea of having sex with the person is a huge turnoff and apparently I became distant and they become starved for affection, which just turns me off more. This has happened in every relationship that’s lasted any length of time. I’m sure there is probably a psychological reason behind it. I don’t remember having a loss of sensation just a complete lack of interest but it would be interesting to see if a loss of feeling cane along with this as well? Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"
"Feelings. Yes, I like penetration. Jokes aside, hate succumbing to another though and have been told in bed not to be so controlling. If I really like the girl (and feel she has something to offer/teach me), I’ll play along. So I’d guess am not that playful, it’s just mostly imagined. Am assuming sex to be somewhat mechanical with me nowadays but its been so long I couldnt really say. Used to have grest chemistry with my long-time BPD mate so bedlife was off the charts. We fought a lot which mightve had smth to do with it but she opened me up in many ways so certainly had to have played a role. She was also very open and forthcoming which was refreshing and told me about how she had dated a sociopath before who had been rough in bed so it had been odd to her that someone could actually be soft and caring to her instead (like it was odd to her that she was deserving of it, maybe?) In general I feel pretty numb to touch, (unless it comes out of left field, like spontaneous from others. then I get flushed with warmth for a second, if its like a random unexpected hug. But am not the cuddly type really, as I often feel like a piece of meat. I think that is just from objectifying myself for years on end. I don’t let people through my defenses these days anyhow so when it happens, I almost feel like a normal person (for a second there). Then I realize it’s completely at odds to how normal people react to such things. Like the pleasantries of social life that follow am not capable and completely resume (as was already notes) that formal-like way of interacting. The excitement of a welcoming female body nearby fades fast because I get stupored and don’t have a clue of how to act and basically retreat back into my detached state or shell. I think it’s like a way of being unassuming and unthreatening but that also means almost lifeless. Empathetic girls (esp. those I am into) have that effect for sure. Also, I often sense my body language and the way I go about things can be taken as aggressive (and downright solipsistic am often afraid).I’ve noticed a friend with ASPD to be somewhat similar in that regard. I’ve seen the non-scientific term “selfosexual” being thrown around somewhat on Quora which refers to the closed-down libidinal investment into our own Self. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Feelings. While I've often been described in terms which suggest callousness or emotional poverty I wouldn't describe myself as unemotional. Rather as someone who is subject to intense, almost overwhelming, primitive drives which I hold under rigid control as they aren't really fit for public consumption. As I've said before it's more Mr Spock in jackboots than Ted Bundy. This is a more in depth post on emotional poverty The situation of having to keep a large aspect of yourself under raps at least partially lends itself to the ingrained sense of alienation which is such a large part of my own make up. Though I suspect that some of the psychological aspects of interpersonal connectedness, particularly those involving group behaviours and concepts, are broken at a more fundamental level. I've always been subject to a fairly high level of addictive sexual behaviours, largely driven by a need to overcome my own sense of alienation. Sex itself is just a means to an end, the goal is and always has been intimacy which usually requires physical affection of some kind. I'm consistently very tactile with romantic partners, a big fan of 'soft touch' and one of natures natural cuddlers. My sexuality has such a heavy emphasis of sensuality over aggression, that there is a long running joke amongst my friends that I f*ck like a girl, albeit a proficient one. I like to revel in physiological sensation and place a high value on my sensory experience of another person. Unfortunately I find that the sense of intimacy diminishes rapidly the longer I am with a person and I end up using more and more intense methods to retain the experience of closeness, including, but not limited to, the infliction of pain and trauma. Generally it's better for all concerned if I cycle romantic partners frequently, usually to the tune of 14-18 per year, as it's not a good idea for any one person to be responsible for providing me with a sense of connectedness. That said I tend to be very 'other' focused so some sex acts, receiving oral sex for example, have less appeal unless under a very finite set of circumstances. Banging a couple of call girls whilst admiring my muscles in a mirror à la Patrick Bateman, is about as alien to my character as it is possible to be."

(All take, no give) I think you’re either overthinking this or heading off in realms of crazy for which I have no frame of reference. The business about wishing to postpone orgasm, is very reminiscent of Gilles Deleuze‘s notion of the underlying dynamic behind masochism. The psychosomatic pain because you’re irritated by someone touching you is not something I’ve ever even read about. My own reasoning was rather more banal. I find blowjobs a bit lacklustre (probably as the result of circumcision), i feel they’re something a lot of women do as a matter of course because it’s expected of them, I personally wouldn’t want someone’s nob in my mouth so I feel a bit bad for them and at the end of the day I like to be able to interact face to face, either verbally or through touch. Frankly blowjobs always feel a bit impersonal to me and i’ll take a suitably affectionate kiss over one any day of the week, though I appreciate I am likely to be in a minority in this regard. Penetrative sex itself can suffer from the same problem if approached too mechanically. My philosophy in regards to sex generally is that it should be relaxed, based in good communication and for the most part, fun. If you can’t laugh when someone’s genitalia makes an amusing flatulent sound or someone falls off the bed, to my mind, you’re doing it wrong. Even messing around with blood and other weirdness, it pays not to take it too seriously. Passion is something which ebbs and flows on its own, which you can ride but never force or hold on to. And good sex, first and foremost, should flow. I’m usually going to be against anything which feels too forced, scripted, mechanical or contrived which I what I was trying to get at in part with the Bateman remark. What you’re describing sounds far more complex and intense, sex as a surrogate for some other kind of interpersonal dynamic or similar."

First of all sorry for the late reply, I didnt see your post at all. Usually its customary to tell the new therapist about diagnoses and about your past encounters with therapists and forms of therapy, as it can make categorization for the new one easier. But it depends a bit on the therapist. An experienced psychodynamic therapist for example will not really require information about the diagnosis as he will diagnose you on the fly while in probatoric ssessions and their diagnosis can be quite different in how its achieved as comparing to diagnsoes based on the DSM etc. Its also true many peopel in the field have issues themselves that they project onto certain disorders, so if you are uncertain about it, maybe just give him the information about yourself that you feel you want to share at this point. You can share more later when youve realized some form of trust. So in any event, I wouldnt stress about it too much. dx: SPD"
"Should I tell my new therapist? justonemoreperson wrote: You said you wanted to go, so telling them anything but the truth seems counter-productive. It's not that I'd be lying, I would just be withholding my past diagnosis. I fear being denied care or worse discriminated against because of my npd since these things have happened in the past. I thinking telling them about my past diagnosis could be helpful, but ultimately, and especially because I have multiple mental illnesses, stress should be on my symptoms not diagnosis. Which also worries me as I've had therapist who focus too much on the diagnosis."
Should I tell my new therapist? There's a reason why doctors keep medical records: it's because everything is relevant. If you hold back something as significant as that then everything is going to be off. It is lying; stop spinning it. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right.

"Increase motivation/decrease enthusiasm This seems like a contradiction in terms but for me it’s often not and I’m just curious if anyone can identify with this dynamic and if so how do you deal with it.

Occasionally I find something I get excited about go all in on it, get way over excited about it let it consume my time and thoughts to the point of obsessiveness, this is where the grandiose thinking starts to emerge, it’s sort of like how I read about autistic people having special interests the difference is they never last and I eventually lose interest and search for something new to get excited about.

"Increase motivation/decrease enthusiasm I was asking because when you mentioned grandiosity, grandiosity and working towards a goal are kind of incompatible.

It has been morepronounced when I was still on weed all day long, but its been a thing after I quit, too, where I had a block of binging TV shows, playing computer games, programming etc. Im still having problems doing somehow opposing things one one day. I cant like program in the morning and make music in the evening for example. But the blocks have become a bit more - hmm - small? Complex?

Well, what actually happened was I made money quickly so I got greedy and put most of my money in thinking I can’t lose and then I lost as quickly as I gained so I pulled out which I guess in that sense I am lucky as a lot of people lose their life savings but this is just an example, I’ve way overestimated my ability many times before and it’s never had a great result in my opinion Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"

I'll watch videos on Youtube about whatever it is and go read some articles about it and sometimes that kick-starts the enthusiasm again, so I can complete it in bursts of activity. I once knew a guy who built a scale model of the Titanic out of matchsticks and, to this day, I have no idea how he managed to stay focused enough to finish something like that, when all I wanted to was float it in the lake and fire flame arrows at it. I find that I have a tick-box mentality to a lot of things. I started flying lessons at the start of the year and got about half way through. The problem was that as soon as I was able to take off, fly around a bit and land without assistance, that was enough for me. I can now fly a plane (tick), so the extra effort required to do the exams, get my license and talk to boring people about constantly changing CAA regulations just didn't seem worth the effort and was very, very dull. I also have issues with repetitive tasks; they drive me insane. If I play games on the PS4, I play them on the easiest setting, as I want to get through the game, not repeat the same section over and over to beat it. ###$ that; usually I just give the controller to the wife and go do something else while she finishes it. I'm currently waiting for her to be in the mood to finish a part of Tomb Raider that's making me want to break things. However, my biggest block is doing ###$ all. The more I do the more I feel motivated to do; the less I do the less I want to do. There is an upside though; I've done considerably more than the average person, as I tend to be very impulsive and will go and do stuff that others will carefully consider and possibly decide against. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."

Two questions for pwNPD, ASPD, or Psychopathy, if you would like to answer: - how did you react when you get your medical diagnosis, towards the doctor that said you it? - before you get a medical diagnosis, did someone else (friends, family,...) share with you some suspect about your disorder, and how did you react to his words?

Ns Who is your Favorite Kid and why??? I only have one and she is by far my favourite. Stepmother was NPD (I believe). She was/still is an ace at playing people off against each other. Her favourite was her own bio child. The scapegoat was my older sister. The punchbag was by brother and I went into care because she completely neglected and abused me.

"How to find a satisfying relationship as a narcissist I’m a narcissist, leaning more towards covert. Though my husband had issues, one (far from the only!) reason I wanted to leave him was that he’d initially made me excited by checking all the boxes of the admiration I wanted- proposing with a fancy ring, showing plenty of PDA to make me feel loved around family and friends, going on fancy vacations with me- but once I “accomplished” all this and was left with day-to-day life with him, I got bored. I promptly became involved with a very high-status and rich guy. I love associating with him; I feel special. He also makes me feel special because he is very difficult to “handle”; he says he isn’t sure he’s ever capable of love again, but if there’s anyone in the world whom he’d love, it would be me. This attitude means that even small positive gestures from him give me a tremendous high: I reckon I must be extremely special if I cause him to break down his stone-cold nature. He went through a random phase recently of becoming very religious and saying we couldn’t have sex outside of marriage, then totally withdrawing from me and spending basically all his time either at the office or home alone (I know he was actually home alone, not with another woman, bc I have a friend who lives next door to him and other reasons). I decide I’ll start moving on. One night he wants to meet for dinner; I cry a bit about how much I loved him and he says that he’s just haunted by past breakups and just doesn’t think he can do it again. I say “well I guess that’s it,” but suddenly he’s back constantly wanting my attention and to make plans. I’d mentioned talking to a new guy, so he asks to come over, then he asks me more about this new guy while HE has sex with me. We then have a nice candlelit dinner etc. I feel this man is also a narcissist; he gets a high from my attention when he knows I’m forsaking him for other options (and I’m honestly super attractive and successful myself). I realize I could find many men, very quickly, without this man’s issues. But I DON’t WANT TO. All I want to do is figure out how to keep this “relationship.” So here’s my question- since I’m clearly a narcissist and prefer unhealthy choices, how do I ever find a “happy” relationship?!"

I think a lot of people with narcissistic issues have this kind of trouble, not only people diagnosed with NPD proper. You have a certain ""learned"" way of interacting with your significant others, maybe even in the form of a trauma bond, and maybe its desctructive, or always fails, or always feels like a dead end, somehow the brainw ants to go there nevertheless because its such a well-trodden path. I would say that getting out of this is actually a quite long and hard path, because it either requires you to try forcing yourself into something that might feel awkward, insecure or wrong, or it requires a basic change in personality that you kind of grow into... actually desiring, tolerating and hopefully finally even enjoying a more healthy relationship. In that regard not wanting unhealthy ones anymore is a good first step I think. I am not sure if one can do much by oneself though. Narcissistic issues are always issues after all where we are very much in our own head and we require some outside perspectives to rearrange our thought processes over time. So - eventhough I dislike boring people with such standard replies - I would always think that looking for a capable therapist to support you in such an endeavour is one of the top choices. in that process you can over time try to mold yourself into a person which is more open to peopel who are not destructive in the long run. dx: SPD"
How to find a satisfying relationship as a narcissist I wonder if pwNPD and others with these type of relationship problems unconsciously seek these types of relationships not only because they are familiar but if there is also an attachment/abandonment issue underneath. They fear intimacy and sub consciously choose relationships that are doomed to fail similar to the way borderlines will push you away because they are worried about getting attached and being abandoned?

"Being challenged As an individual person with PD, what do you do if someone challenges you to do something that you know they don't actually expect you to do but could actually kick up a $#%^ storm? I had a heated argument with my immediate manager last week and in the end she told me to take it further. She knew she was in the wrong and all I really wanted was an amicable resolution to the whole thing but as she threw me this challenge I did take it to hr and higher management have become involved. I know she wouldn't have really wanted me to do this as it leaves her exposed as a poor manager but as she challenged me I couldn't back down. What do you think about this?

"How do you know if they stay because they love you? Or if they stay because they are scared? My boyfriend and I have been fighting from the start of the relationship. I think, in the beginning, he didn't treat me correctly and since then I have become tyrannical in a sense. I don't mean to be but I guess it could be said that I am. He has said to me a number of times that I snap and it scares him and I've gotten more violent. As soon as that happened, I called my psychologist and psychiatrist immediately and scheduled an appointment. I understand that being violent is not the solution. However, it is a reaction to what I explained as being broken to the point of where I keep giving him chances to make amends and he says he will and then tries to hide that he has broken them. I found out something he did. At first, it was a hunch so I asked him directly. He told me that I was being paranoid and delusional and that I need to be institutionalized again. A few minutes later, he came out with the truth and I lost it. It's like a domino effect where all this stuff just keeps happening. Neither of us are in a situation where we could just leave due to COVID 19. This makes me feel like I'm keeping him hostage as he really has nowhere else to go due to being retrenched. I feel like he is just pulling an act until he can just run away. I feel awful. I've said to him a number of times that if he wants to leave, he can. That I would find him somewhere to stay. But I don't think he believes me. I feel like an absolute monster. He says he would have been long gone if I was anyone else, but I'm charming and pretty (basically low self confidence on his part) and intelligent so he keeps getting pulled back. I can't believe I have transgressed so badly since my dropped assault charge. I really don't want to be this way. Between the anger I feel towards him for how he treated me, the lies and the sadness that it's escalated to this as well as feeling like I am going back to where I was... The feeling of thinking someone is just staying with you... Someone that you love... out of fear is so bitter. I want to kill myself. I really do."
"How do you know if they stay because they love you? I don’t want to really even try To give any specific relationship advice here it would probably be a good opportunity in therapy together to work through these issues and get down to the cause imo. It sounds like you are taking all of the blame for what’s happening and placing it on yourself, It’s usually alittle of both that need to work at it. It also sounds like you don’t feel like you have a good open relationship where you can communicate with each other.

"How do you know if they stay because they love you? My first impulse would also be to talk about it. Now since you seem to think he wouldnt [dare to] be honest, that doesnt seem to be an option (?). Which does raise a question though, namely why you stay with him. When I look at the intro of what you wrote, you say, that he didnt treat you well initially and you turned into what you call tyrannical, so when I read that correctly you are trying to control him a lot. But why did you stay in the relationship if it was clear to you from the start that something was wrong? This might be just me, but I actually have quite a black/white view on this kidn of thing. In my opinion a relationship is quite a fragile thing and you need openness and trust for it. So if one person cant speak openly, or there is abuse or fear involved that is not only problematic, in my view one instance of that damages the whole relationship. Irrepairably. So while I would second ESmokes idea, I would look at it a bit differently. If you want to try staying together, and if there is an option for you to somehow pair your therapy in a way - also if you two are even open to that idea - then I would maybe look at the relationship issues more through the lense of your personal psychologies, and vice versa, in contrast to trying to repair the relationship or to regain control over it; so trying to shift the focus away from you vs me towards a more internal view of whats going on inside you from moment to moment and how it connects to your past experiences etc. But I guess if thats an option is also something that requires you to sit down and figure it out together. dx: SPD"

How do you know if they stay because they love you? I don't disagree with the others on the subject of seeking help if you wish to stay together but my instinct is that if you've reached the point we're one person is assaulting the other then it's time to call it a day. I imagine physical abuse would result in such a catastrophic loss of trust that no platitudes or arguments in a therapists office are likely to be able to overcome.
"How do you know if they stay because they love you? OP, if you're worried he's only staying with you because he's scared rather than because he loves you, you could give him information to contact a domestic abuse hotline for men. It might be a simple way to find out since they would help him leave if that's what he wants, and he wouldn't need to worry about trusting you for help. Maybe he doesn't leave because he's both afraid of you and loves you. As unpolitically correct as it is to say, author of ""Games People Play"" (and guy who came up with ""Transactional Analysis""), Eric Berne called repetive dynamics/patterns within social interactions ""Games"" He asserted that often in order for there to be a ""Game,"" both parties experience some type of payoff. Also, with no intention of being an asshole, I'm curious if you think your level of violence would get better or worst if he retaliated in the same way? Do you think it would make you even more violent? Or, do you think him responding violently back to you would regulate your own behavior? Or, do you think him responding violently back to you would make you lose interest in him?"
How do you know if they stay because they love you? I agree with everyone else on the abusive front. I found it odd that someone who is abusive would come out and not only admit that but also own the entire responsibility for it. I thought there could be more at play here. I know plenty of women who will goad a man into threatening or doing something “assault” not even necessarily hitting them so they can have them arrested and now they have control over them due to their case. I was wondering if something like this was going on but in reverse. Either way if it gets to this point it’s probably a dead relationship either you get out for you or because of them but it’s not good for anyone involved Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses
"How do you know if they stay because they love you? @Akuma, many reasons from personal insecurities like fear of abandonment to more squishy reasoning like that he fits in well with my family, and I have had really happy moments with him. The problem really lies with this underlying foundation of mutual distrust. This has created from my point of view a polarity in his personality. One moment he can be utterly fantastic and the next he can be horrid. Sometimes this can swing in seconds. It makes me utterly confused. I can handle someone being fully stoic or fully emotional but I don't know which one he is because it swings with very little variance. I'm not sure if the trust he broke can be fixed at this point. I don't feel as if you can look at a relationship from a day to day stand point. You need to look at it holistically. I feel that I put myself into his shoes when we fight and that he doesn't care to put himself into mine. He will apologize and then do the same thing. I asked him what sorry meant to him and he said that sorry meant that he could understand how I feel, not that sorry meant any sort of remorse or that the word itself means nothing in comparison to making amends to the person. I'm not saying that I am being treated fairly. I'm just saying that I am getting violent and it's escalating. It's not consciously intentional but more a subconscious reaction. It is an impulsive action that seems almost like an emotional defence with a physical offence to get him to feel the pain he is putting me through. He doesn't try to understand me, as an individual. He piles me into ""all woman"" and fits me into that narrative. For example, he hid a lot of things from me in the beginning... Well, he still does, and in one of our mutual things that we do together in a group, I saw someone with a female name that he has always referred to as a male. So I phone him and ask him. He believes my motives are jealousy but my motive is to understand if there has been a misunderstanding and if so, why he tried to hide it from me intentionally. Additionally, we clash in terms of I will outright say what I want to say and want to settle a matter. He will avoid saying anything until he acts out. He said yesterday that there are a few things that I do that we can speak with the psychologist. This is still making me feel uneasy in terms of stuff once again being hidden from me. I feel very much deceived and confused as to whether this is paranoia or not. It doesn't help that he made it out that I was paranoid when it turns out I was not as it just muddies the water. Datura is asking if he acted back with violence if it would deescalate or escalate the violence. It would definitely escalate the fight. I'm not sure how much it would escalate the violence. It just depends on what the fight is about. Anyway, for a number of factors we cannot be apart for now. He is also involved with business within my family so that makes it more difficult."

"Motivation? Freud said work and love. And I find that it sums it all up. I see work as both what brings food to the table and a main source of fulfillment (so in my case, creative freedom). And love as a successful relationship, with possibly a myriad of less intense but warm/stimulating relationships such as friendship or work relationships. Fairly straightforward. What about you?"
"Motivation? I'd say I'm primarily motivated to entertain myself (humor, creativity, curiousity, learning, etc.) and be as comfortable as possible - along with (normally) purpose/service and spirituality. I've felt burnt out and unsettled for a long time now, so the last couple have been on the back burner. I value the the freedom to do as I like, authenticity, and like you said, creative expression. I can't say I value personal relations that much except for rare instances where the persons are comfortable and enjoyable. I don't value maintaining the order of social structures / hierarchies (which often comes with social participation) and I'm still trying to understand the benefits to doing so. I try to adhere and then I get frustrated and stop caring. I've realized I deeply value the presence of nature even if it's only sitting in a park or going down to the water. I normally value encouraging inspiration or creating some type of improvement in quality of life for people I support (when I don't feel burnt out or unsettled) - same with spiritual activities be it meditation, etc."
"Motivation? You've mentioned getting bored easily at some point, I think. Maybe that's part of being successful and being motivated to accomplish things as well. I'm curiosity driven, but also quite easily entertained, so I don't think I get bored that easily. Comfort and stability are better to me - though most people prefer entertainment and stimulation."
"Motivation? If I get interested in something, I want to do it and I want to do it now. I'll throw myself into it and get almost fixated on it until it's done. Anything else that needs to be done while that's happening will just get ignored. But, if it lasts beyond my attention span I'll get bored with it and it'll remain unfinished. It's taught me to do things quickly. Comfort and stability are great if I'm not driven to do something, but I get easily restless doing nothing.

The Paradox Of The Personality Disorder This is something I've been stewing over of late. I don't think it's something that's exclusive only to personality disorders but I've found that within the lists of characteristics there are a lot of contradictions. It's like we want something and at the same time we don't. I wanna be adored then when people like me I push them away. I wanna be special but I'm the first to stand up and tell people that I'm anything but special. Do you get what I mean? England's Glory
"The Paradox Of The Personality Disorder I'll put that more clearly now I've thought about it. Here goes; I believe that I'm superior to people, that I have a higher purpose. And I believe that I'm entitled to more than anyone else but at the exact same time I believe that I am the scum of the earth. This is my paradox. I'm going to discuss this with my lady therapist on Tuesday, even though she has already told me that she is out of her depth. I think it's a kindness and she might learn to swim in deeper waters.

"The Paradox Of The Personality Disorder When I first began the 12 steps and listening to how other people got themselves better, I was told to try not to judge or compare myself to what other people were saying, what they had done or who they were. That could get my mindset into thinking that 'I was not like that' or 'I would never do that'. Instead, I was told to try and relate to them as they told their life story. I could choose snippets I could use to improve myself and discard the rest. Dropping my defenses and baring my soul, reaching out and connecting to another soul who has fought, struggled and won. And continues to struggle daily. Yeah, I am there too. This is how I learn to be a human and I would always want to be teachable. There is a difference between ego and self-esteem. Ego can be a false-confidence to bolster a poor sense of self-esteem. If we have a high self-esteem, we have a secure self-confidence and don't really need a large ego to feel better about ourselves or our situation.

There will be parts of it I like and parts of it I don't like. I have the freedom to choose who I want to be. One of the most difficult things for me was to find out who I was. Fear and shame had blocked me from growth for many years. I hid from others. I had to learn that I had something to offer, but I had to come out of my shell in order to share it.

I also want to be back in my old city in a place with a playroom for my snakes and a patio that I can sit outside privately and have a couple planters on. As for material possessions, the only thing I can think of at the moment is to still have my (or a) car. Recently, I realized I'm no longer capable of relationships. A little while back, I started talking to someone very nice and as soon as I felt like I was getting mentally/emotionally close and vulnerable with them, I started having panic attack after panic attack after panic attack after panic attack. I stopped sleeping, dissociated worst than normal. It was so bad, I stopped talking to them because I wanted the $#%^ I was going through to end. I think I'd be better at being a therapist than doing support work type stuff. It ######6 blows though because to be able to counsel as a social worker, you don't need more than a bachelor's to get work, but places won't hire anyone psychology based unless they have a Masters or PhD or PsyD. Even then, there's very few jobs for them. Social workers are too busy being feminists, etc. that they don't focus enough on research or how the mind operates, biology or interpersonal dynamics or any of that. Also, I find feminism, sjws, and social work extremely triggering (probably one of the most enraging things in my life) If I got a proper education, I thought it would be cool to do research and put together a coping and effectiveness skills kind of thing for people who are institutionalized due to being in the prison system (and want to stay out), etc. As for self-improvement, I'd like to work on my emotional intelligence among other issues I've recently discussed around here, I want to be able to ground myself/practice mindfulness, do more things based in nature and be able to sit quietly and peaceful when I want to.

"Persona ViniStonemoss, when you say validation, do you mean for an issue you're experiencing, or acknowledgement, or...? I've noticed mine sometimes develops a different personality without me intending it to, and I don't I realize until afterwards. My mental health caseworker left me a voicemail some time back and I didn't call back, so he dropped me which meant I no longer got a small associated financial supplement. I didn't want to call him back because I acted in a manner that made him really uncomfortable and maybe feeling angry or threatened or upset. I justified it (aka to avoid feeling guilty and needing to apologize) by thinking of the number of times I've been victimized by people in positions of power in the mental health field ---- and the fact that even though I had a letter from my psychiatrist from my old city saying I needed therapy not antipsychotics shoved upon me, he wouldn't help me get it. ( After almost a year of asking, I went over his head right in front of him to my psychiatrist, and a therapist who dealt with me in group, in order for me to get into therapy which also pissed him off. ) The thing is, if I'm honest with myself, it wasn't intentional and I don't know why I did it to him. I became another person without meaning to and didn't notice until thinking about it after his voicemail. Then I noticed it with my psychiatrist around the same time frame. I was still being honest, but my mannerisms all switched into an entirely different person. Again, I didn't mean to become that person. Then I think about my therapist which I adore, and I become very agreeable with, full of admiration and put her up on a pedestal. I have reason to admire her because she's actually very impressive, but it's not who I am in real life. To note: she's aware of who I am in real life because I talk about it; it's just weird that I become a different person in my interactions with her - almost childlike. Very sweet and docile, if I'm angry and low on patience, I avoid her to make sure I don't lash out on her. It's like, instead of consciously figuring out how to act in situations that are stressful to me, I unconsciously step back into autopilot and let some other aspect of me step in and take the wheel. I'm as surprised as anyone as to which part comes out. Also, when I was taking my courses I tried to act very friendly, nice, dumb myself down and clown around - which is genuinely part of who I am at times. But a huge part of me acting like that was more because I knew I didn't see eye to eye with them and I come from a completely different place than them. Part of my personas are that if I come into something with a really strong personality (when I have it), people will instantly become defensive and want to try to challenge me - sometimes a whole bunch of people all at once. I don't have the desire, energy or willingness to even attempt to engage in pissing contests (I'm not smart enough on how to ""win"" at doing so anyways) so I try to enter in very passive and polite and friendly and bubbly, but I can't always be that for very long. The contrast of me switching from being really docile and agreeable to a more aggressive and intense person probably made it even worse with them. That's when there become problems for me. I really do wonder if my social retardation is because I have aspergers/high functioning autism sometimes (among my cluster ###$ of other disorders)"
"Persona I have no idea what validation means in this context. Of course I use a persona, everyone does. It’s a core component of the jungian model of the psyche. In so far as I know I’m aware of the impression I’m trying to give and why I’m doing it. it’s difficult to catch yourself doing something deliberate. Having had a brief look on wiki here’s the paragraph about the absence of the persona: The alternative is to endure living with the absence of the persona—and for Jung ""the man with no persona... is blind to the reality of the world, which for him has merely the value of an amusing or fantastic playground."" Inevitably, the result of ""the streaming in of the unconscious into the conscious realm, simultaneously with the dissolution of the 'persona' and the reduction of the directive force of consciousness, is a state of disturbed psychic equilibrium."" Those trapped at such a stage remain ""blind to the world, hopeless dreamers... spectral Cassandras dreaded for their tactlessness, eternally misunderstood."" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(psychology ) I mention this because of an irony some of you may not be aware of: Cassandra is the OP’s previous username, she’s one of the forum’s resident “empaths”.

"Empathy disorder I don’t think empathy is a disorder, thinking you are more empathetic more caring and more understanding than everyone else might be though.

A personality disorder per definition is a structural disorder of the self and its parts, while empathy is basically a skill produced by the self. So they are different categories. Empathy proper is a sideeffect of emotional and cognitive maturity. On the contrary people who fidn it important to say they are empaths are in my experience usually not mature and are often mixing up empathy with either emotional contagion or their overall amplified or histrionic inside. dx: SPD"

Some people say that people who say they are empaths are in fact narcissists. Are the two intertwined or is empathy a disorder in itself? I'm pretty sure you've asked this question before. Empathy isn't a pathology any more than intelligence or physical attractiveness are. Declaring that you have superhuman levels of any of the above could probably be called grandiosity. In my view the key issue is that not everything which is called empathy actually is. In psychotic projection where a schizophrenic projects their thoughts or internal monologue onto other people the afflicted individual may end up believing they are telepathic, when in reality schizophrenics have some of the poorest social cognition of all groups of the mentally disordered. The less extreme defences seen in personality disorders also occur below the conscious level and are often experienced by the disordered person as an intense form of emotional intuition, which can conceivably be inappropriately labelled as empathy. People diagnosed with BPD are particularly well known for the belief that they have some sort of highly tuned emotional radar which has little bearing in reality."

"Empathy and sadism I read the same on some psychological site. Proust (sorry if I quote him again) thinks that sadism requires sensitivity and morality, while real ""badness"" (not my word) is numbness. I think that it could make sense.

Empathy and sadism It made a certain amount of sense to me even though it had never occurred to me before. They was talking about Ted Bundy and how it was never determined if he was a psychopath or not. They said that as he got pleasure from being sadistic then the chances are that he wasn't a psychopath and more likely a malignant narcissist. England's Glory

"Empathy and sadism Manners73 wrote: I just read somewhere that psychopaths cannot be sadists because a sadist must have empathy in order to get pleasure from the sadism. Is this so? What do you think about this? I dont think sadism has much to do with putting yourself into someone elses shoes but with an ability to either evacuate negative states into someone else and feling more calm as a result, or by feeling less powerless by being able to control somebody. So in a way sadism might override empathy in soem situations, but might also be a form of externalized non-empathy with yourself. dx: SPD"
"Empathy and sadism It depends what drives the sadism. Sadism is how others perceive the behaviour; they register it as sadistic. However, there's a lot of difference between people who are sadistic because they need to make others suffer, compared to someone who peels a cat to see what happens. I think a lot of people are classed as psychopaths because it fits a common model for our understanding of grotesque behaviour. Most serial killers seem to be driven by emotion and psychological need. There's a whole bunch of psychology in there, but it's the gory stuff that makes people revolt and classify. Take someone who rapes and murders prostitutes. People focus on the ripped and violated body, and wonder how anyone could do such a thing; they must be a psychopath. But the death and mutilation is irrelevant to the driving force that made them do it. Dead people are boring. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Empathy and sadism The counter argument would be that someone who wasn’t psychopathic couldn’t do something like that, and if they did it once they wouldn’t continue to do it. I think it takes a unique combination of psychopathy and Other underlying mental issues to become a serial killer.

Police, soldiers, religious fanatics all kill people and would still feel bad if they stepped on a mouse. It just needs a cause, and there are many reasons for people to find justification. In fact, when you look at most serial killers, there's usually some principle behind what they do. Misguided, maybe, but it's there. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Empathy and sadism Those things are all seen as socially acceptable and many have ptsd and other issues later on from killing someone. To do it willfully, on your own for your own selfish pleasure brings into different territory in my opinion. Shooting someone a hundred yards away because you think you are helping your country or even if it’s so they can’t get you vs keeping someone against their will and completely destroying them and discarding them like trash and going on with life like nothing has ever happened takes a high level of callousness few people possess Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"

"How can I stop indulging in power fantasies? I have indulged in power/revenge fantasies probably since my teens (that's decades ago) as a sort of mental comfort blanket.

He even calls the italic part ""grandiosity gap"". And that those 'fantasy worlds' your inhabiting increase when you get more detached,psychotic. You dont have to be ashamed of who you are, nothing wrong with indulging fantasies. We all have fantasies, childish thoughts were ashamed of and are terrified that someone will read our mind and discover were having that thought. This is true for each and every one of us. Theres no reason to be ashamed, or feel bad and that you dont belong. The light shines on all equally. What Jung says is that you should study the delusion, psychoanalize, to find what it tells about the patient. Care to give us specifics of your fantasies? Its an anonymous forum, nothing to worry about."
"How can I stop indulging in power fantasies? As a schizoid I dont understand why you would be disgusted about having a fantasy life. I would think if anything, that disgust would be the place to start trying to understand a mechanism. Fantasies themselves arent a problem as long as you dont space our all the time... quite the contrary apparently, as they seem to serve an important function for your well-being. So the boring reality is probably they would disappear once your internal reality has shifted in such a way that they have become unneccesary. Until then, from my perspective its probably better not to be hard on yourself and see them as something that is helpful to you. dx: SPD"
"How can I stop indulging in power fantasies? @OP As with most things, there's a positive to every negative. Instead of trying to find a way of getting rid of them, why not focus them on stuff you want to achieve? Point your anger and revenge creativity towards solving problems that you're having. Then, it's not some bizarre inner monologue; it's visualisation to reach a goal. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"How can I stop indulging in power fantasies? Fantasies of revenge and violence invoke negative feelings and unwanted aggression I try to steer out of them as soon as I catch myself slipping into them. I used to space out and have day dreams/fantasy thoughts usually grandiose but harmless nonetheless. I liked these they had a soothing calming effect, I wish I was more in touch with that mechanism still to be honest but I’ve lost connection with it over the years it seems. For me controlling your thoughts is a challenge, first doing things to occupy your brain help, second it’s practice. Every time you slip into an unwanted fantasy try and pull yourself out of it, like anything else you will devolve this ability over time"
"How can I stop indulging in power fantasies? I do this too. It's automatic, when my brain isn't occupied with something else it seems to switch to fantasising. Sometimes I catch myself at work smiling when in a fantasy, quickly stopping the smile and hoping nobody saw. AProphet wrote: Care to give us specifics of your fantasies? Its an anonymous forum, nothing to worry about. Simple example of such a omnipotent fantasy is I am suddenly surrounded by a pack of wolves growling at me. I somehow know exactly how to behave and know to turn to the pack leader and somehow this wolf sees I am strong and respectful of him and respects me back and they don't harm me. (in writing it seems pretty ridiculus, somehow somehow somehow it all works out miraculously and i feel all is well) Having these fantasies empower me, I can handle anything and I feel strong. I think the explanation for them can be found in object relation theory. The baby sees the world as either all good or all bad. When mother is present all is good, when she is gone all is bad. And baby's defence against the bad is by sort of locking it out of himself, in his imagination having full control of the situation so the bad cannot reach him. So these omnipotent fantasies are a defence mechanism. I'm certainly no expert on these thing but to me this seems to fit. Unfortunately this defence mechanism isn't working so well for me anymore. I often feel this deep feeling of guilt, I can't explain it well, like I am the most horrible person in the world. Spaced wrote: But I am not normal. I am a narcissist.

"How can I stop indulging in power fantasies? @Spaced, have you been diagnosed with NPD? Do you just consider yourself to be narcissistic? This seems like the words out of someone who has obsessive compulsive thoughts about these power fantasies and perhaps being a narcissist rather than a PD. Firstly, normalise your behaviour. Thinking about something and actually doing something, or going out of your way to plan an action to make your fantasy a reality, are two different things. Everyone has fantasies of power and doing harmful things to someone or taking revenge. They are completely normal and a healthy way of letting your brain come to terms with social interaction that may have hurt you. However, when you start writing a 400 page manifesto on how you intend to take revenge is probably when you need help to deal with underlying feelings. However, if you were that willing, I doubt you would ask for help to not have fantasies if you are already making plans for them to become reality. You would pose the question as help in not making your fantasies a reality. Seek a therapist and use CBD and DBT to normalise your thoughts and perhaps help with some of your anxiety. They may even suggest going on a mild antidepressant and diazepam. This may help with dealing with anxiety around social interaction. Honestly, we all are different people on the outside to what we are on the inside. If we all went around saying exactly what we think about people, it would lead to conflict."
"The difference between The basic way I understand the structural differences between BPD and NPD in a very simple way is borderlines are aware that they are self loathing and hate themselves, Narcissists project that into other people and think they hate them while it’s really the parts that reminds them of themselves they really hate. Is this what they mean when they say other people are seen as an extension of the narcissist and if so are there any other good examples of it?

"The difference between fair words regarding differences a extension of a narcissist would be someone who more or less does there dirty work, mirrors there image, etc but could also be someone who he projects onto. but in my mind i see extensions as more of a tool to progress as opposed to an out for there feelings (projecting) - ur gril saucy"

I tend to agree with the borderlines being the most difficult. Pathological Narcissism is just a defense mechanism against the internal pain that the narcissistic individual exists in. A way to preserve some of the sanity, the borderline doesn’t have that layer and is more likely to be more unhinged in my opinion When an old wound that is reopened the narcissism attempts to block that emotion with anger or rage when in reality it’s probably shame, embarrassment, or self loathing Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"

Is this what they mean when they say other people are seen as an extension of the narcissist and if so are there any other good examples of it? I feel like this is another thing that gets misunderstood a lot, but I’m not sure Projection is used by all sorts of people. You could call it a narcissistic defense, but basically everytime someone projects, depending on the level from which he projects from he will either see himself, or parts of himself in another person, group or object. Certain self-help groups are a good example of externalized functions of conscience for example, that both stabilize the personality but also make it more rigid and hard to evolve. Borderliners project, too of course. Its that combination with rapid splitting which makes it especially hard for them to get better, as its always that absolutely horrible other persons fault. Anyways in case you dont have access to it, I'll just post you two relevant quotes from Kernberg, eventhough his ideas are of course only his take on it, maybe its helpful -> Kernberg, Borderlien Conditiosn and Pathological Narcissism, pp322 wrote: ""In general, all neurotic conflicts interfere with the optimal relationships of the self with the various instances and structures mentioned. At the same time, the establishment of pathological character patterns as defenses against direct conflictual relations with others and direct confrontation with the forbidden oedipal impulses protect the functioning of the ego and the self; they also protect self-esteem, that is, they have a narcissistic function. Therefore, all patients with neurotic reactions and character pathology have ""narcissistic problems"": there is a pathological vulnerability of the self, defended against by the pathological character traits, so that when these traits are explored ~nd resolved analytically, narcissistic frustrations and conflicts become activated. (...) A more severe type of narcissistic disturbance can be found in cases where the self has developed pathological identificatory processes to such an extent that it is modeled predominantly on a pathogenic internalized object, while important aspects of the self (as relating to . such an object) have been projected onto object representations and external objects. This severer type of narcissistic pathology refers to individuals who (in their intrapsychic life of object relations and in their external life) identify with an object and love an object standing for their (present or past) self. (...) It needs to be stressed, however, that within this more pathological relation of the self identified with an object to an object identified with the self, an object relation still exists namely, a relation between self and object, both intrapsychically and in external interactions. A still severer type of narcissistic pathology is characterized by a more profound deterioration of object relations, in which the relation is no longer between self and object but between a primitive, pathological, grandiose self and the temporary projection of that same grandiose self onto objects. The relation of a pathological grandiose self to a temporarily projected pathological grandiose self is characteristic of the narcissistic personality, a specific type of character pathology representing the most severe form of pathological narcissism. ibid p265 wrote: The difference between narcissistic personality structure and borderline personality organization is that in the narcissistic personality there is an integrated, although highly pathological grandiose self, which, as I have suggested earlier, reflects a pathological condensation of some aspects of the real self (the ""specialness"" of the child reinforced by early experience), the ideal self and the ideal object (the fantasy of an ever-giving, ever-loving and accepting parent, in contrast to the child's experience in reality, a replacement of the devalued real parental object). (...) The integration of this pathological, grandiose self compensates for the lack of integration of the normal self-concept which is part of the underlying borderline personality organization: it explains the paradox of relatively good ego functioning and surface adaptation in the presence of a predominance of splitting mechanisms (...) Now the distinction between what constitutes a grandiose-self proper from a ""normal"" projective mechanism is a bit unclear and I dont have time to look for a good explanation. It might suffice to say that what is pointed at is early represantations of primitive inner images that can be a bit psychosis-like / toddler-level and who are more like precursors to ""person"" and ""thing"". So in a way saying that another ""person"" is an extension is inaccurate because on that level it is exactly not a person but a conglomerate of early self and object representations that have not much to do with the other person or with personhood - which is exactly why it can lay the ground for paranoid or negativistic projections as seen in PPD or ASPD f.e. Just for the sake of some pseudo-completeness I would point at a book by Bernard barnett called ""You Ought To"" which goes into the history of the super-ego concept and which might explain parts of these things a bit more accessible than kernberg and the likes. dx: SPD"
"Differential diagnosis narcissism psychopathy Hi everyone I'm a woman and I met a man and the only thing I'm sure of is that we both are disordered. I suspect we may both be narcissists (grandiose him, covert me) but I have an alternative explanation for both of us and I have difficulties in choosing between the two. Let's start with him since it seems easier, maybe I'll do another post for my own differential diagnosis later. He seems a textbook narcissist and I don't understand if he has an insecure core or a psychopathic core. Please, don't question the options I'm considering because I'm not writing everything (of course I have a lot of evidence of him being very manipulative, lacking empathy, pushing boundaries and being extremely charming and unable to bond -not only with me-. I don't know if he is antisocial. I know that he changes jobs often and that he has a huge need for stimulation. I also saw a little of his carelessness amd impulsivity but I don't know the extent of it). I'm just writing a tiny sample of things that make me difficult to choose between the two options... If there is any way to differentiate the two without looking at a brain scan. I was hoping other narcissist could help, because you know how you yourself look like. -When criticized he devalues me and shifts the blame. He never loses control when doing that, he is just quick to become patronizing and to put me down while smiling. A typical answer to (unintentional/imagined -I never told him something with the intention of hurting him-) criticism would be something like ""Oh, the crazy fantasies of little girls always make me laugh"". Is he doing that because it works (psychopath) or because he feels threathened (narcissist)? Is it a projection of bad intentions or a manipulative tactic to keep me insecure? I never catched him overtly defensive. -We were searching for another woman in order to do a threesome and we failed. He told me something like ""it's her loss""... Well, if no one was interested maybe we weren't offering that good of a deal. Does he believe he is a gift from God himself (unassailability of psychopaths) or was he protecting himself from the pain of failure/rejection (compensatory narcissism)? -Before having sex for the first time he told me, unprompted, he was ""pretty big"". Did he said that because he lacks inhibitions or because he thought this would improve his chances to have sex with me or because he needed to regulate his self esteem? -He seems fearless when considering non verbal cues. He never fidgets, he talks fast (so I would think he is not concerned with finding the right thing to say), we both have a slightly weird way to manage eye contact and it would seem like it's not natural for him to break it under pressure... Is he fearless because he is (psychopath) or because he feels superior to me (narcissist)? He always puts himself in situations I find a little risky, but nothing over the top as far as I know -not that he would tell me-. -He refused some money I offered to pay for a prostitute for him (don't judge) because ""We don't pay for sex. We don't need it"". Was it because paying for sex is humiliating? Because he wants to be in control and if I'm the one who pays, I'm the one in control? Because he thought that refusing was more fun and spectacular and pleasant? Because he wants to be seen as noble? And does he want to be seen as noble to be admired, to gain my trust and loyalty or just because it's the first thing that he felt like doing and it seemed fun and why not? -He uses a lot of big words. Is he trying to sound intelligent/royal or it's just that he doesn't care about rules, let alone implicit ones? I avoid big words because I'm inhibited and I care a lot about the judgment of others, so maybe he doesn't because he is the opposite. He seems to care about being elegant/proper (he refused to go with me to do some outdoor activities that can be seen as ""for poors""; he is always well groomed and takes care of his body, takes a lot of selfies... Once he even told me I wasn't being elegant, but he also wanted to stop me to do what I was doing, so maybe it was instrumental)"
"Differential diagnosis narcissism psychopathy You are way overthinking it. Narcissism is not separate from Psychopathy, and who says psychopaths can't be insecure in their own ways? What you described is psychopathic with high levels of narcissism. Other psychopathic types might not view themselves with such high regard, and others might do a better job of hiding it. Anyways, narcissism by itself lacks some psychopathic traits like impulsivity, high need for stimulation, fearlessness and risk-taking, and that ability to seemingly always remain unfazed and in control. Simple NPD types are more clumsy and also have a high need for admiration and/or adoration, making their interpersonal style a means to achieve validation. I don't fake it. I just make it."
"Differential diagnosis narcissism psychopathy NPD can ACT grandiose it’s mostly a defensive mechanism to protect an incredibly insecure and low self-esteem. Just as with external validation external criticism can have the reverse effect and trigger a full display of narcissistic adaptations deployed to protect their fragile self. Psychopaths are said to not have this issue in the same way, it’s hard to say what is going on and I’m not a fan of trying to label people as disordered. I’m not sure why you want this type of relationship to begin with."
"Differential diagnosis narcissism psychopathy I agree with Easier and Esmoke, and I am not a fan of labelling people too. However, I would add: a psychopath can easily wear the mask of a narcissist. But he can change and become humble, if it works better. It's much more ductile. Moreover: not sure if it's always this way, but I noticed that the psychopath is more childish. The narcissist is childish too, but the psychopath is more childish. It's an oral temperament. Hare (who studied them) writes that he suspects something happened during fetal age. In my personal experience, there is something like a new-born baby, or a one-two years old toddle; this explains why he can be so ductile too. But this is very hard to be noticed, because he is great to hide himself. Moreover, even if this is true, sometimes he voluntarily plays the part of the little toddle. “Humor is reason gone mad."" “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”"

"Differential diagnosis narcissism psychopathy @Datura: thank you. I am not sure if you are asking me, or if you are looking for it by yourself... However, it's a subtle sensation, it's hard to articulate. Mainly, I perceive the common narcissist (not the pathological one) as a structured “personality”: the body is well- structured, and the behaviour is quite constant, conditioned by the need to confirm the fake self-image. My perception can change when the narcissistic personality is so strong that it turns towards psychosis. We call psychopathy a “personality”, we lack a better definition... but in my perception the psychopath isn't still so structured. Sometimes, I perceive him as “something” (?) that stopped before the creation of a “personality” (or, maybe, of a person). I suspect that it's also the reason why he is so skilled to play everyone's role, because there isn't still a... human being? I hope it doesn't sound offensive, I don't intend it offensively. However: I can't look for it now, but on YouTube there is an old and shocking interview: “A Psychopath Describes His Behaviour”; I believe his first name is Robert, he is a pedophile who molested a toddle. I am not sure it's authentic, but it's an example of what I am trying to explain. You can see that he is satisfied for his criminal actions (sometimes his eyes shine), but mostly he is naive; he is also an example of a childish physical appearance. I am not saying that it's the way every psychopath looks like! “Humor is reason gone mad."" “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”"

Exactly this. The difference is just that emotional development stops at a different age; I suspect that it's really archaic for psychopathy. Moreover, there is maybe another difference (as you mention too): for someone it's an arrested development, for others it's a regression. Not an expert, but as far as I know for some psychosis (for example, schizophrenia) it's a gradual regression, and it mainly concerns logical and cognitive skills. “Humor is reason gone mad."" “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”"

"what are u like as a drinking drugging degenerate? Alcohol is a roll of the dice. I can be extremely funny and extroverted or violent and unpredictable; it depends on the circumstances. Weed just chills me out. Coke I can't use, as I just become uncontrollable, and with acid I need to be tied to a chair. Speed is ok, as long as I have a lot of stuff to do. I smoke a lot of weed. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"what are u like as a drinking drugging degenerate? Alcohol is varied to types. In general, I get very happy and bubbly. Friendly. If I straight continue to black out drunkenness, there is this line where I cross and I get super sad and cry. I think its tiredness. Or hunger. Well, I can't drink now anyways so thats over. But if I sober up with coke, or mix with X, it doesn't go into that landslide. On both coke, X and speed I am super talkative and bubbly. Weed - is a no. I get really bad anxiety. Honestly hate the stuff and people on it are just stoopid. This whole thing about it being awesome is ridiculous. If you have any sort of anxiety, it tends to worsen it and naturally makes you more depressed. 0/5. I used to enjoy it when I was younger but it's never been the same. Acid is a coin toss. I can get bad anxiety. But I have had some good trips where I went around skipping and making ""for tonight"" friends, being bubbly etc. I had a time where I really connected with a Bonsai tree. Shrooms are such a hit and miss. Hardly ever get visuals with them and the one time I was convinced half my brain had shut off. Or I was dying. And all my friends were running around screaming like chickens. So, I would say I stick to the things that make me bubbly and extroverted and stay away from the things that make me want to be in a straitjacket. I also stay away from jagermeister (although drunk me tends to sneakily order it) and tequila because its just gross. Whiskey, neat on rocks or Vodka with water is generally what I used to enjoy. Being an H addict. All I can say is I ended up listening to a lot of music, lost track of time, wrote a lot of #######4 and was unable to go to the toilet or orgasm. Ironically, the only pills I am allowed to take now contain opiates. But I only take it when I am in serious pain to the point of screaming."
"what are u like as a drinking drugging degenerate? I've been always extremely sensitive to different types of weed - much to the annoyance of most of my dealers, because I was eyeing a special kidn of effect that only about 40-50 percent of the stuff could produce. So when I was still smoking that was mostly a sort of warm, floaty body-high with an amplification of visualisation capacity / the internal world. It also amplified my paranoia though. Since my paranoia has vanished in the course of therapy I dunno if that would still happen nowadays, I havent smoked in over 5 years now. Alcohol I use very rarely as I find the dissociative effect of it very boring. Its more like an amplifiaction of that numbness I am in all the time anyways. There is a change on top of that pure dissociation when I drink a few cocktails but I couldnt really describe it to a satisfying degree. It amplifies somethign but Im not sure what. dx: SPD"
"what are u like as a drinking drugging degenerate? On the weed, I used to get bad anxiety/paranoia also that why I never got extremely into it and it also hit me very hard as most drugs do but some of the newer lab grown stuff I’ve tried is completely different. They've essentially bred out those bad qualities and they have weed now that will actually help with anxiety as opposed to making it worse. Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"
"what are u like as a drinking drugging degenerate? With a lot of weed, it's not so much about the strain as it is about when it's harvested. A later harvest tends to produce more calming effects, as the CBD levels are higher. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
what are u like as a drinking drugging degenerate? i smoke my platinum girl scout cookies way too much. weed makes me so docile. if i had to pick one that evens me out id pick weed but again the 0-100 phenominom is still there im surprised drugs have such different effects. but not really just a little - ur gril saucy
"what are u like as a drinking drugging degenerate? Alcohol: I'm usually a fairly friendly and gregarious drunk though can be quite destructive in a manic and good natured sort of way. Very occasionally I can be brooding and cranky. In either event I'm less harsh than I am sober. I should also mention that the men in my family tend to have bad reactions to beer and get quite violent. Consequently we're all big spirit drinkers. My uncle Hans can tuck away a couple of large bottles of cognac and still hold a cheery and polite conversation with his in laws but after a few pints he's apoplectic with rage and trying to hit people with the furnishings. In all honesty I've never really got drunk on a lot of beer so I've no idea what effect that has. I'm usually a fan of scotch, Brandy and liqueurs. Also cocktails, the more offensively effeminate the better. Weed: Probably the best for me as it dampens down the background hum of aggression which I experience most of the time and makes me less sharp. It comes with a serious downside in the form of the reduction in physiological sensation, a bit like having your senses wrapped in cotton wool. Sex on weed for example, is a waste of everyone's time and energy. I smoked a lot during my late teens early twenties and only ever got a mildly euphoric floaty sensation, no paranoia. Coke: I usually avoid it as it's a bit of a weird one for me, generally it just makes me feel sharper. I'm pretty certain I could successfully operate under its influence. The downside is that it removes the brakes, so that the mile wide streak of sadism that runs through my personality and is normally nailed well down gets to run around naked in the rain making rude gestures at passers by. I'm can be gleefully cruel on coke and will take any opportunity to get nasty. Opiates: Not recreational but I've had tramadol, morphine, fentanyl and diamorphine in fairly high doses. They just make me spaced out. I was given an overdose a couple of times which had me visually hallucinating before passing out, no delusions though, I knew full well I was seeing things. Drugs alway strike me as fundamentally social things, or for a specific type of socialising which involves clubs, house parties and the like. Chucking myself down the side of a mountain, round a track,out of a plane or just generally roaming around the back of beyond is more how I like to get my jollies. With a few exceptions it's cheaper and healthier."
"Empathy / Hypocrisy According to my psychotherapist (I was there because of insomnia/anger managent), I have light narcisstic traits. So, one question: a lot of people (who are ,,normal'' lol) talk about empathy. They are so empathic and good humans because of their giving nature.. (lol!) Lies. Sorry, but a lot of them were extremely unempathic when it comes to certain problems. I have recognized it a lot.. Personally, I think it belongs to the human/the character. So, isn't it a bit naive and dumb to expect empathy in all areas (family, relationships, job..)? Sometimes I think that this empathic people do not know what empathy means? Especially that there are huge differences between the cognitive/emotional (affective)/somatic. A lot of them do not know that, lol. You know I have recognized affective empathy a lot in the faces of people, mostly when they experienced something similar - despite the psychotherapist I had. She was really emotional empathic (and didn't experienced the same). So isn't empathy based on our morals (right/wrong)? Oh, and a lot of ,,normal people'' expect empathy, but do not have it at all. lol. I have just narcisstic traits (however my cognitive empathy is quite good), but my former friends and work-mates were kind of that. I think that they are just weak people (in case of beeing that needy), because of needing help, but not giving that engagement back. They are much more egotistical than me, and didn't had my analytical thinking/methods. I was extremely good at solving their problems according to get to their core problematique (they were too stupid/too afraid for that..). However, I know that people are complex (they do not... lol). Did anyone experienced something similar with ,,normal people''? Sorry if I upset someone who has the full diagnosis."
"Empathy / Hypocrisy I had a friendship with a very troubled woman a few years ago who had struggled at school, has dyslexia and other health problems, narrowly avoided prison in her 20s. She mostly socialised with quite brutal people or people bordering on having learning difficulties. If anything needed sorting out, a shouting match or one party or the other walking away was how it was done. I haven't made a career of getting an average-ish degree though I did publish writing modestly for a time. My time isn't spent on highbrow pursuits. I don't parade my learning and have certainly let myself go a bit. We began this friendship after meeting in a cafe, and it would often be therapeutic - just to have company, trot out some funny lines, kill time - but all the while she was on the verge of mistrust, expecting the worst. I was sympathetic and would tread lightly. But then what was apparent was what in other contexts would be called 'inverted snobbery'. I used the word 'cutlery' once and even that made her angry. She didn't know how to bracket me really - this man who was neither browbeaten or fooled nor ever going to shout or get violent. There was something she couldn't have or couldn't be, or so she has been led for decades to believe. She would demonise these things outside her. Worse, one of her daughters was dyslexic also, and she'd start to mock me in front of the daughter and poison her, basically. It was as if she was starting a little subculture, establishing its parameters, kind of what a lot of dysfunctional families do in their four-walled Republics. I think it's a mistake to start to formulate a demonised view of traits and behaviours that are for the most part virtuous and beneficial that you maybe happen to struggle with or that seem to be alien or something synthesised or that seem impossible to synthesise - this way one can only compound being unreachable and compound difficulties in reaching others. That is a dead end. I don't know - is this a case of turning frustration to aggressive-defensivity? On the internet, talking to strangers across the world, despite the trolling nonsense no one is any real harm or threat. I'm nearly 50 and have nothing, have remembered my friend reading your post, and am typing this calmly with fraternal feeling. Can you talk yourself down from deconstructing empathy in this unhelpful way? Yes, a lot of people are awful and hypocrisy exists, but going from specifics to coalescing a worldview in abstractions based on this in a fixed, overly defensive way is something else. I have recently resumed speaking to someone with NPD who I care about. I don't know how we will navigate what comes next, but I'm open, I think she is approaching openness. The openness is key."
"Power.... What is best: inherent power or granted power? When I was a child I was given the role of playing David in a school production of David and Goliath. I was 6 years old and probably the smallest person in the school. I stood in the assembly hall, armed with a catapult and a piece of plasticine. I shot it across the hall to kill the giant and I hit the headmaster right in the eye. At my young age I had been granted power and given a weapon to use and in effect I killed the giant. I carried this granted power around with me for many years. I believed I could fight anyone no matter how.big they were and I hat I would win. I was wrong of course because I got the $#%^ kicked out of me on many occasions but I still felt this power within myself that I had been granted and I still do have to a certain extent. My power isn't inherent by any means and to a large degree it is an illusion but nevertheless it has given me the courage (or stupidity) to confront people in higher positions than myself and to show them no fear. I believe I will possess this for ever. So what is best; inherent or granted power? England's Glory"
"Power.... My power, if you want to call it that, comes from my belief that I can do anything. I'll take anything on that interests me and it doesn't occur to me that I might not be able to do it. In most cases I pull it off; very rarely do I fail. I think that insecurity stops people attempting stuff, so we only really achieve a fraction of our potential, because we tell ourselves that we can't do it. I've done some pretty remarkable stuff, mostly because I've always said yes to pretty much every opportunity that comes along. People say that impulsiveness and a lack of fear are a negative. I guess they can be, as they've got me into trouble, but they've also been the reasons why I've achieved a lot of the stuff I have. We're all just badly-shaved apes with similar intelligence levels and strengths. If someone else can do something, there's no reason why I can't. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."

I think we're drawn to change; it encapsulates everything that we're about. Even touch needs to have change to be felt. Having money doesn't make anyone happy. Getting money and spending money does, so it's the change in state that motivates us. Power represents our ability to overcome something or someone else, but if that becomes the status quo then we have nothing to be powerful over. So, we either set bigger and bigger goals, which will eventually become unachievable, or we knock what we've built down and start again. Maybe we cause conflict because we want something to fix. Maybe we ###$ ourselves up because it gives us a lower platform to build from. Everyone damages themselves, which should represent a failure in evolution. So, is it a failure or a way of finding meaning in what would be a mundane world if everything was working perfectly? Do we need to be self-defeating to be successful?

If you want to camouflage it, try putting people's stated principles to test. You can watch them squirm while being encouraging.

"Humiliation question It's not my business if people feel it's worth addressing things or not; my only concern is that if you ever place yourself in a position where you were to be vulnerable with a therapist, that you make sure they're not triggered by you or your behaviors (no idea if I'm repeating myself) Part of the ethics that a therapist is taught, is that they need to refer clients elsewhere if they find the person triggering because it can take away their objectivity and possibly cause them to take their issues out on the person they're working with - and no one should have to experience that. It ends up being counter-productive or even damaging.

"Humiliation question Not ideal, bro, not ideal. Life on life's terms. With my experience I felt at odds with the individual from the get go. Originally, I dealt with him when he facilitated a couple of group therapy sessions and he'd use way too many personal examples involving his childhood and the many ways women have hurt him (an extremely inappropiate level of self-disclosure in a therapeutic setting for many reasons). The part I played in the experience was agreeing to work with him. Even when I was I waiting for a referral for one on one, all I hoped for was ""not him"" That level of discomfort is not how you should start off with a therapist. I remember him complaining about ""those types of girls with their tits hanging out of their shirts"" and then looked at me, eyes widened as if shocked by what he just said, and then exclaimed, ""Uh oh. I shouldn't have said that."" I have to admit that I was entertained by that level of (still relatively innocent) faux pas. When he started directing his criticisms of women at me it became a problem and soon after that, he ended up in a situation that led to him giving me a referral to someone else. I was actually really proud of myself because I was able to recognize that he was triggered and that it wasn't personal which is extremely rare in regards to me experiencing personal issues with others. On a tangent (of course), Sometimes I get weird invasive images or feelings that come up for people, and with him, I saw him naked wearing nothing but a diaper with a thing on his head and a rattle too like in the fetish porn, lolz. I found it strangely entertaining and fascinating to try to psychoanalyze him - and myself given that babies freak me right out (after I stopped working with him, of course)."

"Crossing over to psychopathy Here's an interesting thought They say a psychopath is at the extremity of narcissism. Ie they can't be more narcissistic anymore that even the fluctuations of emotions narcissists have are completely gone. The person is completely cold and vacant. So what I'm wondering is can a narcissist cross over to aspd? I'm 27 and suspect I have NPD if not at least some serious narcissistic traits. Lots of abuse and shame from childhood and throughout life. I don't give a flying ###$ about anyone and only care about family but in a sort of shallow way. Like obviously wouldn't want them hurt but don't seem to care much about who they are and their needs wants etc... It's like people are just holographic representations that don't really exist. I can't genuinely connect on any level. I'm always disingenuous, pretending acting but my true feelings and thoughts are always kept hidden. Sort of what you would call a covert narc. I'm going through a very tough time at the moment and worry I might become a psychopath at some point. My connection with the outside world is dwindling day by day. I often frighten people when they are close to me. They find me intimidating and I think it developed from years of isolation. It's like I feel I can do anything and there is no consideration for the existence of others. I have to apply a lot of self control to stop myself from misbehaving. It got to the point of whooping my dick out in public because I thought it would be fun to show these two prostitutes how big it was. Any advice would be appreciated."
"Crossing over to psychopathy Comorbitiy rates bipolar/NPD are very rare, 0-8% in pwNPD. When youre correctly diagnosed with bipolar the danger you are facing is becoming delusional and psychotic, which I would assume is much more problematic than becoming psychopathic. That beign said one can't become psychopathic. There is a possibility to becoming secondary schizoid which would equal chronic sideeffects of a dissociative disorder on top of an NPD structure though, but that has to do with your ability to feel emotions, not with the functioning of your conscience, which would remain largely unaffected. In addition in this scenario a NPD should exist. So summarizing, youre probably going insane from a combination of your bipolar disorder and your social withdrawal. You should do something about that. dx: SPD"

There is no test at this point that tests for every type of narcissistic disorder. Also you should ask yourself what you want the result for. Will it motivate you to look for a way to change or to look for a skilled therapist? Or do you want it perhaps so you can give up, because pwPD ""cant change""? Or is it just boredom or a way to get your mind of your current issues? Etc. If youre planning to get a therapist, a psychodynamic / -analytic therapist will give you a diagnostic opinion after the first few introductory interviews when asked. Psychiatrists can diagnose, too, but how well they take into account individual psychological structure as opposed to merely scoring items on a check-list depends on their professional background. Finally of course you will get diagnosed when you are in a clinic or psychological rehabiliation center. dx: SPD"

Well thats the big drawback with diagnosing with those lists like DSM, NPI etc. there is always overlap and ultimately all you will show is that a persons answers correlate somehow with a given set of ""symptoms"". If diagnosis is done over a longer period with psychodynamics in mind thre is less overlap - but ultimately also less necessity for a diagnosis heh >_>.

Blatantly it´s malignant NPD. When you truly transition into the ASPD realm, it´s heavy sadism (that you develop layers of ego to guard yourself from experiencing), putting others down to boost your ego comes naturally so you have to hone it in. You don´t truly care about others but care enough for their opinion of you (although that is very hard to gauge) and lose true interest in the world because you understand that it´s like a layer of unconsciouscness. Whereas before self-awareness you wore masks and believed them, post self-awareness it was the unbereable knowledge of not knowing who you were under all of the masks but sensed something was there.

"Crossing over to psychopathy I don’t think you can cross over to psychopathy one day, I think you could be a psychopath all along and just not have gone over the edge and one day something triggers you and it comes out and you kill or seriously injure someone. There are plenty of examples throughout history of people being mostly normal and one day just lose it. I think these people were psychopathic on some level their entire life and it just took that one trigger to set them off. I’ve heard it compared to walking on ledge trying not to fall off. Remember one thing that usually is present with psychopaths is the ability to appear perfectly normal when the need too (the mask of sanity) so pretending is second nature to the psychopath The typical path is there is usually a long history of disturbing behaviors by the time you reach adult age but there are some who have never been in serious trouble and then turn into rapist/serial killers later in life. If you have the ability to have these terrible thoughts and urges and control them and not act on them than I would say you are not psychopathic, or atleast not a severe psychopath.

"Borderline psychopath So what the hell is it exactly? The webs tell me it´s a person who ticks most of the boxes of the Hare type test but are still essentially not completely callous. As I understand the born-ASPD brain is completely alien to the neurotypical one as opposed to someone who has gone through what some dub the sociopathic process, so actually hasving the makings of a neurotypical but most all emotions have just been shut down. How I understand it is that there´s a capability to reach those underlying sheathed feelings but there is a strong unwillingness because they are essentially not constructive in any real sense. With NPD being my core disorder, I can´t say that I actually have had that many to begin with (other than shame and such) but my warmth toward others really has dwindled over the last years (there was a situation where I went trough The Process and it essentially felt like my shadow side taking over.

And it actually stuck on after awaking, like it was difficult to shake. The defition of possession I suppose. The silly thing now is that the ASPD side of me is actually almost more socially harmonious because it´s at least rational somewhat. When my narcissism (read: need for attention, delusional, golden child self) kicks in am like a starved child that will lick a lollipop on the group. It sucks and makes me seem like a madman (hey, I´ve almost embraced that image of myself) [just to keep in mind that] the borderline part does not at all refer to BPD.I have the schizoidish/BPD-ish sense of a split (all-good/all-bad) but in this definiton it does not refer to that, but more the split between being somewhat in a constant twist of neurotypical vs psycho-minded Anyhow, some thoughts on this, what do you make of it? “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Borderline psychopath SelfSerf wrote: So what the hell is it exactly? The webs tell me it´s a person who ticks most of the boxes of the Hare type test but are still essentially not completely callous. As I understand the born-ASPD brain is completely alien to the neurotypical one as opposed to someone who has gone through what some dub the sociopathic process, so actually hasving the makings of a neurotypical but most all emotions have just been shut down. How I understand it is that there´s a capability to reach those underlying sheathed feelings but there is a strong unwillingness because they are essentially not constructive in any real sense. Emotions aren't shut down, they're just not seen because most people reference emotions based on how they're shared with others. Psychopathy leads to a callous disregard for others, and so those ""others"" won't see emotions or any real emotional motivation. It doesn't mean that they aren't there. People who are ""driven"" to AsPD by personal experience do have the neurological capability to express emotion, but the mechanism of their condition means that they probably lack the ability to demonstrate them because the events that put them there in the first place haven't allowed them to develop the emotional skills needed. There's a lot of conditions that put a limit on emotions, psychopathy and AsPD being only two. I've never heard of borderline psychopathy and I'm struggling to work out what that might be. As most conditions are based on an increased or decreased level of normal behaviours to the point of abnormality, I'm not sure what you'd get with someone who's a ""bit of a psychopath"" - probably just a selfish arsehole. I can understand why someone with a mental condition would want to turn down the emotional responsibility to others; it's the psychological version of putting your fingers in your ears and going ""la la la."" It stops the conflict, but it's a response to a condition, not the condition itself. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Borderline psychopath I’d guess someone who has higher than average psychopathic traits but short of a clinical diagnosis? If you go by Cleckly these are the types who can go on to have a successful career and maintain relationships like a marriage but many times lead double lives. Read a recent article from Harvard Department of psychiatry and they believe psychopaths lack the ability to predict or plan for future events almost completely, not that they completely lack remorse or emotions just that they simply can’t understand how what they do will effect others or their own outcomes so they tend to repeat the same mistakes that would make no sense at all to a normal person only later on to regret their actions after they experience a negative outcome Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"
"Borderline psychopath It's just that reality is different from theoretical systems. It isn't schematic, even if you consider physical factor only. I guess that psychopaths' brains differ a little from one person to another; if someone's brain is less ""altered"" than most psychopaths, he would have a “crossed” brain, and you would have a borderline-psychopath person. There are infinite shades and combinations in a neurological asset: nature doesn't create clones. Moreover, psychopathy is assumed to be inborn, but what does it mean? A child, whose brain changes while he isn't still able to interact (fetal and neonatal life), will become a different adult. We can't know if the variation from usual development was caused by a genetic disposition or by a psychological factor. We can't know for sure the destiny of a brain that develops, and the fetus and the new-born baby can't interact, so their emotional life is a mystery. Genetic could predict one's development, but we still haven't an extended knowledge of our genetic map and, in my limited knowledge, a genetic difference isn't proofed for psychopathy definitively. Different researches gave contradictory results. An epigenetic factor would be possible for psychopathy, but psychological traumas and environmental difficulties can produce epigenetic alterations - and that it's proofed. Then, problem NOT solved. My two cents: these are assumptions only. They should discover something, and then formulate a theory, and not the opposite. “Humor is reason gone mad."" “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”"
Borderline psychopath My own personal opinion on the matter is there are too much that still isn’t known about it and I think in the past that if you had a significant amount of psychopathic markers you were just jammed into this pre conceived box that they created for the disorder. If you say you don’t feel anything for anyone else they all nod their heads in approval because it validates their “box” if you say you do care about people or some people then you are manipulative and glib and superficial because you can’t possibly understand what it means to care about someone so you are just saying that. Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses
"Borderline psychopath Anyhow, some thoughts on this, what do you make of it? If the question is if you can get more access to your emotions, I'd answer that when you cant even deal with whats on the table right now, youre certainly not going to be able to deal with even more. dx: SPD"

It's a fair comment; it's like he Salem witch trials and the mechanism hasn't changed towards this condition for three decades. Even on this site, it's the only condition where the forum has been closed, without concern for those who used to use it for their own benefit. I wonder if that would happen for any other condition. This is where therapy requires an almost super-human ability to switch off your own psychological needs and focus on someone else. I do ""suffer"" from this condition. The traits that people like to throw around as qualifying criteria also limit a person's effectiveness, but people don't like to help unless they feel they're getting something back. Also, it makes people nervous. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Borderline psychopath Paraphilias got shut down under similar circumstances didn't it? In response to the OP: ''Borderline psychopath"" sounds like a bit of nonsense off the internet to me. It reminds me of three things: 1) The Vulnerable dark triad, a common combination of borderline, vulnerable narcissistic and factor 2 psychopathic traits, often found in drug addicts and child abusers. 2) Neurotic Psychopathy, an old term for BPD from a time when psychopath (literally pathological psychological inferiority) was used as a catch all for severe personality disorders. 3) The is also a line of research into BPD which regards it as primarily an impulse control disorder similar to a female form of AsPD."

Although grandiosity does seem to fuel aggression in response direst status threats, it does not fuel unrestrained anger, hostility, or aggressive retaliations following minor provocations (Bettencourt, Talley, Benjamin, & Valentine, 2006; Krizan & Johar, 2015; Rasmussen, 2016).] Also who would win in a fight?

"NPD vs BPD rage It should be mentioned that narcissistic rage is the term for shadow side triggers of the narcissistic personality in specific. The term may not be used in the context of BPD, those are (as far as I know) just triggers. The shadow (as per C.G. Jung) is the collection of personality traits we've rejected about ourselves, so they now operate on an unconscious level, having it root in formative upbringing, when we are being taught by our parents what is good and bad, allowed and not allowed. The shadow side gets triggered and leads to lashing out, which the conscious mind is not aware that the behavior is irrational . One other example of this I know is for girls that had to compete for daddy's love (big families), they get extremely triggered by intimate partner choosing to spend time bowling with friends instead of with them. Its an unconsious self esteem threat in that case. Just a loose example for some context. The general term were looking at is unconscious triggers. Now, what I realy ment to contribute to the thread. This is a repost but its higly relevant here. This is the set of responses that Ive identified that made me rage and lash out (as NPD codependant): 1.being rejected by a girl that wanted to see you; before you self abused and discarded her, ruining the idealize/devalue yourself/discard pattern 2.being cheated on money, my friend promissed to pay for the 1g but didnt, I raged at him 3.a friend seeing my true self in the moment I fell in love, my jaw dropped and I was staring blindly at her (my false self claimed a different reason for this, ""I let down my friend"") 4.Other people having thoughts, like the aforementioned friend thinking im stupid for not knowing (this was at first reinterpreted, gave me narcissistic injury after a psychotic epsiode) 5.being wrong about the girl I was in love with, that I didnt want to meet her and she was synchronous, (this gave me a slight psychotic episode) 6.not knowing O. isnt reading the messeges, my true self that wrote it for a different reason was allready ""dead"" and had no bearing. My false self never asked the question if shes reading them becouse she wasnt allowed thoughts. Everyone knew what I know. Only the narcissist has thoughts. This gave me a big psychotic episode, those have become a lot more intense since I revived the true self and theres all this conflicting information about whats real. 7.not being able to tell the twin sisters B. and J. apart, I raged and stalked them, few days psychotic episode after 8.telepathy between me and my twin flame (wont explain this, was reinterpreted as chat messages and gave me a few day psychotic episode) 9.an example of my NPD collegue: telling everyone at a party that he wants to ""come inside"" his girlfriend and his dick didnt stand up becouse he was high on MDMA, so he retreated from the party 10.an example of another colleague, I told him his girlfriend was angry with him, he raged at me even though I was helping him (him not knowing something, doesnt exist other people have feeling)"

"NPD vs BPD rage In a bigger picture not sure it matters much. I don't mind asking some tough questions though. Whatever others envisioned the difference to be, if you saw both, would have a different impression based on age, sex, social status, wealth, etc? Thing is, people tend to do what they are approved of and avoid what they are not. So the difference may have less to do with how the two appear then what might really matter, what they get beat up for, or get some support for.

Not so much people I interact with in real life but you see it more on social media accounts particularly those that are commenting on news media pages.

In my view politics is just the new religious fanaticism, just take the same type of people move them from on belief system to the next I can’t see any difference between it.

We learn a fact and that's the end of the journey; there's no recognised need to see the background to put the answer into perspective and apply it to other situations.

"B+W thinking in society Quoth, a past member who is dearly missed, introduced me indirectly to this concept of emotional reasoning , which I didnt know before and which explained quite a lot of things to me. This ""ability"" of the common folk to be manipulated by people seems to depend to a high degree on their inability to step back from their emotional perception and see it as merely that. On top of that is a very problematic ingrained disability in people to question and to be rational. They did a few tests here a while ago with students, and teachers, to find out if they can fact-check and how they deal with news stories. One of the most memorable was showing them a picture of a mutated flower ( something like this ) and saying these flowers were found near Chernobyl. In utter disbelief I had to witness that every single one of the probands thought the flowers had turned this way due to radiation. Another aspect became rather clear due to aunt Corona in the past months. There have been quite a lot of people here who have gone insane by being told to stay home for a few weeks or by being unable to go to the gym for that amount of time - including the cream of the crap who beliefed children were held in underground bases by satanists to extract some drug from them and to veil that ongoing war under the earth the corona crisis was invented... While I could probably explain this in a lot of psychological terms, on the top-level I find its quite astoundign how entitled people have become, how unable to just bear with things for a while and how egocentric and emotion-driven they are. So yea, ""narcissism"", in the sense of some weird, unfounded egocentricity might be a thing, but frankly msot people are really just plain dumb and are very easily fooled. Im not actually sure if this has become worse, or if the contrast is just bigger nowadays, I'm pretty sure a few hundred years ago it was just like that, just on a smaller scale. It might also be a factor though that people nowadays who are already incapable of rational thought, are just overwhelmed by the complexity of everything on top of that and so become additionally unstable, both cognitively and psychologically? Ultimately of course being overwhelmed might then again trigger additional reactions like regressions, or using more primitive defenses like splitting. dx: SPD"

"Bombardment of awareness (Alan Watts) So I´ve always been enamoured with Alan Watts but never came across this sort of dissection before. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGZrJZ24kUY He has often spoken about similar concepts of only ""being necessitades to do something that one must do, but only if it is done voluntarily"", which is the intro, but at the 6.50 mark he starts speaking about Torpor/being unconscious and another minute later the concept of narcosis, equating it to Narcissus, who he dubs to residing in a state of reduced consciousness. It´s a way of being turned off. It fits into the general picture of pwNPD quite well but in a certain sense it goes almost directly opposite some of the general populace´s methods of describing NPD. In my mind all of this talk speaks poignantly on the narcissistic/schizoid ondition: lately (and really throughout my whole life) I find myself being irritated by the mere existence of others and the claims they make onto my being (the necessity of somehow accomodating their existence,). The truth of the matter is of course much more horrid to accept (and truly, I am incapable of realizing it), i.e. that I am unable to adapt, lack the social skills and truly do not care enough. Am unadaptable and stiff as a personality, so I refuse to partake, only to the extent that is necessitated from me by surroundings so everyone becomes a threat. (Alas I have become a threat to others´ [emotional] safety myself but that is a nother subject. ALl of this also alludes to why a lot of pwNPD get sweeped up by the booze (I, and every other pwNPD I know of, sure has a tendency for it) because it brings a reduced sensory input, acting pseudo ""return-to-the-womb"". Later on, he also speaks about the condition of the inability to relax (intense anxiety), which is also way too familiar. Which is accute of being incapable of relinquishing control and trusting your surroundings. In my mind it speaks aptly on the narcissistic condition and found it an intriguing approach...discuss at will. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

I'm not sure if this is helpful or not, as the mechanism behind your behaviour may be very different to what I've experienced. I have no real idea how schizoid / NPD works. That said, I think your issue may be around your comment, ""lack the social skills and truly do not care enough."" You've probably heard this a fair amount and had experience of its effects and so see this as the key issue, which you have no control over.

They don't care; inasmuch as they don't know or care personally for the person that they're treating. They care because it supports their own internal motivation. They'll see someone die with horrific injuries and then go off and have a sandwich. Their care is a series of processes and training, which is no-less real than those of people who cry over dead kittens. In fact, it's seen as more valuable because it has a constructive purpose. I think you need to start focusing on your own ""principles"" rather than those being pushed onto you and develop a system where you can harmonise your behaviour with the expectations of others, rather than fight against yourself. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Bombardment of awareness (Alan Watts) I am fascinated by sleep. When Watts says that we have to trust sleep, and be sure that we will come back to the light, it recalls me Proust. There are many interesting reflections about sleep in his book. There is a passage where he wonders how we can be the same individuals when we wake up: same habits, tastes, personality, in every detail. It means (he writes) that “something” doesn't forget ourselves, even during deep sleep, when there are no dreams anymore. It's a mystery. “Humor is reason gone mad."" “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”"
"Bombardment of awareness (Alan Watts) I've spent years of my life not trusting sleep. Fearing loss of consciousness and sensing the moment I drift as if my mind is being drowned in thick, black water. Then yet again, on the opposite end (as far as loss of self), fearing sleep for the uncomfortable fantasies that disturb and occasionally define me. Luckily, I generally find the middle ground these days. Anyway, hyper vigilance (as OP describes as inability to relax) is common learned behavior from an environment that is unsafe. I often wonder how much all PDs are just shades of complex PTSD."
"Bombardment of awareness (Alan Watts) poxalis wrote: how so? philosophically? When you look at home brain waves change during the different stages of sleep, it gives a glimpse into how consciousness is produced. During deep sleep, we effectively die, and our consciousness disappears, leaving only our mechanical body active. There's also stuff that can be done with a person while they're asleep which doesn't work while they're awake to affect their psychology. It's as if we go into diagnostic mode. There's an article I was reading a little while ago which discusses some of this; if I can find it, I'll post it. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."

"Alternatives to Guilt In the empathy is narcissism thread, I made a comment that reffered to how emotional empathy is supposed to be a motivator - and now it has me thinking about the emotional motivational purpose of guilt. If empathy encourages prosocial behavior like species or tribal cooperation, reciprocal (and other forms of false) altruism, kin selection, etc ----- and if they choose to, people who lack it can use perspective taking to achieve similar results, how could this translate into guilt as an emotional motivator? Like empathy, some people cannot utilize guilt as a motivator because they're frozen, or so much has accumulated it's not safe (for time being), or because they're not capable of feeling it, or they just plain don't want to. I also know, from observing others and from personal experience, that trying to moralize or trying to force people into internalizing ""wrongness"" is an ineffective way of teaching people because they often either shut down or act out even more (variety of reasons). I've seen and experienced the 12 steps to be effective for addressing this, but that's obviously reserved for those who are receptive to it rather than having it shoved down their throats. It would be interesting to recieve input as to what could be a couple gears down from, or an alternative to, guilt as an effective motivator (to create wanted changes within oneself). Same with hearing about people's formulas / processes of utilizing their emotions or the functions they're supposed to serve."
"Alternatives to Guilt For me, it's simply reward behaviour: I know what works and what doesn't. If you treat people well, they'll treat you well, and if you don't then you can issue a sincere-looking apology and that works, as people seemed conditioned to forgive. Guilt and empathy are complex conditioned responses to others' behaviour. I think the reason I don't have any real empathy is because I failed to learn the connections when I was young, so they didn't properly form. Therefore, I have had to learn this consciously since. I didn't care about my parents or other family members and so their opinion on my behaviour had little effect. For most, these behaviours are so well inculcated, before they had the ability to rationalise the link, that it's seen as instinctive or even divine. This is the reason I think that people internalise wrongness; it's built in them before they've had chance to develop critical thought. We know that it's learned, as people in different cultures find different things to feel guilty about. Having a beer or a bacon sandwich causes few issues in Christian-based countries, but would cause emotional chaos to someone from a Muslim background. If internalised wrongness has not worked when you were a very young child, then it's not going to work via reason. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Alternatives to Guilt Thank you for the input. For whatever reason guilt doesn't work (be it since childhood or acquired), I'm wondering what other effective replacements could be. I'm too idealistic to give up on these ideas. justonemoreperson wrote: For me, it's simply reward behaviour: I know what works and what doesn't. If you treat people well, they'll treat you well, and if you don't then you can issue a sincere-looking apology and that works, as people seemed conditioned to forgive. I see this is an example of an (albeit vague) gear down to guilt as a motivator. If there was ever a time in your life where you experienced a pattern of behaviors that did not work and had serious consequences for you + the sincere looking apologies didn't work + you no longer wanted to repeat those patterns, how did you get yourself to address it? I think I accidentally had a double connotation when I said ""internalizing wrongness"" One connotation was that as a motivator, it's supposed to get one to feel regret for the behavior and a desire to try to make it up somehow which leads to overall changes in behavior or personality. The other connotation being guilt trips and even switching over to shaming others and pushing them to feel inherently ""bad"" - which is unhealthy for anyone In one of my psych classes last year, we learned about studies that found that shaming children or acting like they were ""bad"" (instead of focusing on the undesirable behavior, why it's undesirable, and how to make reparations) decreased their ability to feel healthy guilt for doing something they knew was wrong and empathy towards people they hurt. + I think it's important to step away from any of this being seen as a ""divine"" quality because it's a cop out in so many situations."
"Alternatives to Guilt I think guilt can definitely work as a deterrent, you can see people being guilt tripped all the time into doing something they otherwise weren’t going to do before the guilt tripping. I think a big problem is that if there is enough reward a lot of people will rationalize and justify reasons to act against their conscience so they don’t have to feel guilt. Some people hold steady regardless and act in accordance with what they believe or what their conscience is telling them, I’ve always found this to be almost a strange concept at times as my belief system is largely not concrete as such but I find this a very admiral trait to have. To just stand your ground because you believe in what you are doing. Maybe we are looking at it upside down? Maybe it’s not to avoid feelings of guilt as a punishment but to act in according to one’s beliefs and guilt is only there to remind us when we stay outside of that. Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"
"Alternatives to Guilt When I said I was looking for a ""geared down"" or alternative version of guilt as a motivator, I was hoping to step away from the conscience aspect, the sense of morality behind it and decrease the emotional appeal related to it. I was attempting to say that guilt-trips from others aren't the same thing as utilizing it as a motivator. Also, I was referring to self-change because when others try to force it upon you, it makes things worse by leading you to push back harder or shut down further - especially with strong personalities. Originally, guilt's ""bigger picture"" purpose is to keep us adhering (as you called it a reminder) to some sort of values or societal rules to maintain relations with others for our survival and the survival of our genetics. I'm going to interpret what you said as focusing on staying close to one's beliefs can serve as an alternative to utilizing the emotion of guilt, thanks"
"Alternatives to Guilt That’s a deep question, I haven’t thought at that deep of a level about it. I believe people act in accordance with their belief system or conscience, whatever that is for them I see guilt as more of an indication they have acted in a way they see as wrong or against their own morals or beliefs. So I would say your own beliefs guide you more so than an active avoidance of guilt. I think the church and other institutions use shame and humiliation to control people well maybe in olden days more so than now. I view that as different than genuine guilt one feels internally. I think those forms of control create a bigger problem than what they solve usually if that’s what you are referring to when you say teach other with guilt and internalized badness Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"
"Alternatives to Guilt DaturaInnoxia wrote: The other thing that inspired my desire to ask this question was when, in another thread, ViniStoneMoss referred to it being an effective method of correcting one's behavior (its purpose/motivator) < I wanted to brainstorm further on the topic. It’s an interesting subject, I’d like to hear what Vini thinks on the subject. This really opens a whole new can of worms too. If you think about someone with not a very good sense of themselves as seen with narcissistic disorders or personality disorders in general and not having a good foundation to help make these what are probably little judgment calls for most people just make automatically. Or even adopt a new set of ideals that suddenly appeal to them. Without a solid core to guide someone they could get lost in a way.

"Alternatives to Guilt I believe people can leverage whatever emotion they have in their toolset. Guilt is perhaps the obvious one since it is associated with morality. People with BPD have plenty of guilt on hand. In this case, the challenge may be to discriminate between toxic guilt (for instance, when you keep dating someone abusive) vs helpful guilt (for instance, if you act selfishly and manipulate people into looking after you). People with NPD don't deal with guilt as much (they sometimes confuse shame with guilt), but they do have plenty of shame on hand. The trick, I'm assuming, is not to runaway from it, although it's very natural to try to runaway from uncomfortable emotions. If you don't feel shame, there is always anger left. For example, people with ASPD are perhaps less prone to shame than people with NPD (the latter more likely to trick themselves into thinking they care), but that does not mean they don't have strong emotions. Emotions are always a point of entry, but I don't believe therapy/recovery/progresses have to be an emotional process in the dramatic sense of the word. Stoic people remain stoic. Emotional people remain sensitive, you just don't hurt as much or anymore. So the ultimate motivator is to eliminate discomfort (guilt, shame, anger etc.), but the fact that to eliminate discomfort you might have to go through a bit of discomfort can act as a strong deterrent. Guilt-trips are always wrong. Emotional appeal is bad strategy if your interlocutor does not deal with emotional empathy. And moralization is only occasionally OK to draw a boundary, for example if someone is encroaching on your space of freedom or someone else's. Even in this case, it is indeed never wise (not to mention brutal) to expect someone to grow a moral system out of thin air. Instead, It's to signal to your interlocutor that they're hurting you and/or sucking the air out of the room, to remind them of the world outside of their own. It's purely pragmatic if you will and can, at best, elicit curiosity but the goal should never be to elicit compliance. I don't know if people who were not taught empathy can grow one at an adult age. Should be possible based on the literature. But it's not something I witnessed firsthand."
"Alternatives to Guilt I believe people can leverage whatever emotion they have in their toolset. So utilizing the next available emotion to be the motivator can be an alternative to guilt. I wonder how other emotions could be used to facilitate this. Another thing I'm understanding you to say is that the emotions don't have to be dramatic to serve as motivators. Thank you for the input. Instead, It's to signal to your interlocutor that they're hurting you and/or sucking the air out of the room, to remind them of the world outside of their own. I've cringed when I've seen people try to use moralizing on youth with RAD to try to push them into guilt or showing empathy. I'm not sure why people think it's appropriate to try to appeal with ""how do you think they/I feel when you do that?"" to individuals who never (or rarely) experienced people in positions of power to show respect or regard for them - same with any other talk of ""right"" and ""wrong"""
Attention Seeking Behaviour I'm wondering if attention seeking behaviour is sometimes part and parcel of having personality disorder. For me I attention seek in order for people to show me some kind of care. Not so much these days but definitely when I was younger. Does anyone have any insights here? England's Glory
"Attention Seeking Behaviour I think it all goes back to whatever triggered the personality disorder development in the beginning. Borderlines fear abandonment because they were abandoned or discarded which caused a wound. Narcissist adopt a persona as a personality because they were taught theirs isn’t good enough, Malignant narcissist and severe ASPD seek power and control because they were abused and controlled and fear the idea of giving in to that again. Same thing with attention if you weren’t shown the love or attention when you were a child you will probably seek it in other ways as an adult because you don’t know any other way. The strategy is to shake these behaviors and become more stable with your own self image and not let others determine your self-worth. Easier said than done I know but it should always be the gold standard. I personally detest attention whoring in general I still can’t figure out if this is some sort of projection or if I really just don’t like it. The idea of seeking attention because mommy and daddy didn’t give you enough is sickening to me I reject the idea completely but this is just my own take of the matter. Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"
Attention Seeking Behaviour I detest attention whoring in other people but I know that my behaviour (especially when I was younger) was all about attention seeking. I loved to push people's buttons to get a reaction out of them. I suppose its a bit like manipulation in a way. I'd learn what buttons to push to get the results I wanted. Or I'd do dangerous things. I still do it now in a way. Like I love to tell people (who I know have a maternal instinct) about my dangerous bike ride to work. I did exaggerate on it as well sometimes. And I get a reaction from them. It is down n to not having parents in my life and I know it. I'm not ashamed of it but I just wanted to know if it is related to PD. England's Glory

"Attention Seeking Behaviour Attention is what's seen, but it's not what causes it. Healthy attention is paid as a reward for something done which has value. People are currently giving Elon Musk attention because he successfully made a rocket to launch people into orbit. Seeking attention for its own sake is psychological masturbation. If you want to flip this around, then you have to ignore the need for attention and try to do something of worth that will give you attention as a by-product. This level of attention will be more sustainable because it will give you a reason why you're getting it. You can blame and point at others as the cause, but it makes no difference where it comes from. You need to make the change. Carrying on the masturbation analogy: if you want a relationship because it means you can have sex then wanking into a sock isn't going to satisfy your general loneliness, because you've boiled down the whole process to getting your rocks off. Seeking attention is the same as wanking into a sock. It boils the whole measurement process into a single act; that of being recognised, while ignoring the real reason people get recognised: for doing someone worthy of recognition. Start reading to people in an old-folks home, join your local search and rescue organisation, offer to coach kids' football, write a book, grow giant sunflowers. Anything that gives some solid ground for recognition. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Attention Seeking Behaviour To be honest I dont think that everybody wants attention for the same reasons. I dont even think that all people who want attention really want it. Attention, if seen through the histrionic lense, might be another counterphobic thing: You put yourself into a situation exactly because you are afraid of it to act like you have power over it. Others might want to feel more like adults, again others more liek children, more masculine, others feminine etc. I think its much more important - for the individual of course not so much for us talking about it here - to figure out what the meaning for them is. Only when they've found the meaning can they figure out ways to go there... and might find that attention has never been imporatnt to them anyways - or yes, find ways to actually get recognized for achievements that are real and that might be useful to not only parts of themselves. dx: SPD"

Problem is the girls I've been with have all been longterm gf's and I've basically relied on accolades to draw them in, being the extremely quiet/reserved type but sometimes odd/quirky exhibitionist/peackocking when necessary, so it seems very difficult for me to redefine my sexuality in a different setting. In my head, it works and am able to sexualize girls when detached but when it comes down to it, I know that it's not in my wiring to have sex with anyone who takes an interest in me. Girls who give off the open/slutty vibe actually turn me off quick. Since I've become heavily schizoid and sheltered (well, aren't we all nowadays) for the past few years now am easily intimidated and that is helping me in the least as I seem to creep people out easily, especially when am feeling less-than (which is the majority of the time). Deeply covert/vulnerable but also increasingly ASPD. My relations of late are almost non-existent and have been heavily dwindling so it's tough to hold up appearances. Am like a walking-talking example of toxic masculinity plus I really need to stick around capable people because I feel like a worthless piece-of-shit majority of the time. There are moments where I sense I can still charm but the settings are not right because I don't want to lay the charm on someone at work. Short of paying for sex (which carries with it the same invulnerability issue am sure, couldn't imagine doing that), any suggestions on what could be done?

"Rejected We're herd animals, so it's relatively ingrained within us to dislike the experience of rejection because ""back in the day"" if we were cast out of our tribes, we'd die quite quickly. Both shame and sadness would have made us willing to conform. Some people consciously practice rejection (and shaming) to try to get people to conform, and it often works (at least in our early years or struggling times) specifically for that reason. Also, it can be offensive if one is not included in something on purpose because it's relational-aggression. There are lots of reasons for ""relational-aggression"" - including to reduce competition (sexual viability or attention in general, etc.). In which case, you'd need to learn to conform well enough to not be seen as a threat (and you may never be able to do that) or you'd have to accept that's what you'll get with that person and seek the type of interactions you want elsewhere. If there are ways in your thinking and acting that play a part in the exclusion, then it's worth addressing that if it's something important to you (while keeping in mind that being left out / rejected doesn't necessarily mean you're doing anything wrong). For me, being rejected due to be relational agression (being competition, asshole-ism, etc.) could lead to anger or disgust. If done respectfully because I was unwanted, it would lead to sadness. Shame usually results from people thinking it's them rather than the interactions not being a good fit. Also, with exceptions obviously, my dysfunctional answer to most interpersonal issues that matter to me (or my energy levels) is to distance myself even further - even when it comes to experiencing rejection from others."
"Rejected Ultimately, people want to be noticed and valued, as it confirms their choices and lifestyle. If you get overly connected to rejection events, it probably stems from a lack of confidence in your own decisions, so you require inclusion from others for confirmation, and see it as a personal slight when that doesn't happen. @Manners: it would probably be useful to examine how you're processing the rejection at the time, before you kick off, to try to identify what you're feeling. Is it hurt, anger, confusion? Confrontation is giving you a mechanism to deal with the event, while distracting from the underlying cause. You're effectively blaming the one excluding you, rather than trying to work out why it's so important to you in the first place. Jabbing someone in the chest because you want to be included is like ######6 someone to make them a virgin. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."

I think if you ever tried to kill yourself you know that you have other things on your mind than feeling bad for others. I find this question insulting. dx: SPD
"Lack of Remorse for Suicide How would suicide be a matter of morality? < because that's what ""remorse"" implies to me. Do you think being overwhelmed enough to go against your inherent drive to live is a matter of someone being ""good"" or ""bad"" / ""right"" or ""wrong""? It's unlikely that someone with major / chronic depression or PTSD or c-PTSD would feel remorse, so why would NPDs, AsPDs, or any Cluster B be the ones to feel it? A situation like someone with bipolar disorder who was normally well adjusted and had a healthy family life, who went off the deep end for the first time, might feel regret or remorse once they were properly stabilized and back to their ""normal"" selves. ^ That's a different situation though because usually suicide is either a result of chronic, unrelenting depression/crisis/stressors or ongoing lack of impulse control with or without an ongoing lack of ""distress tolerance"" I tried twice as a youth, but I never regretted it or felt bad for doing it. What makes you think a lack of feeling bad for failing at trying to escape from your suffering would be associated with a cluster b - especially NPD or AsPD? What's motivating you to ask this, by the way? Do you want one of those diagnoses or..? Do you ask your question here because you have applied that same sense of immorality to NPD or AsPD? A lot of double standards are set up for here. Polite questioning was allowed in ""the other place"" and this isn't it. Im confused, has it always been like that here? It's almost like a reverse form of abuse"
"Lack of Remorse for Suicide Well, my current working diagnosis is c-ptsd but I’ve been diagnosed with PDs in the past. I’ve never attempted to kill myself directly more like abused myself with drugs alcohol and recklessness but I’ve had suicidal thoughts all of my life as long as I can remember they come and then go. When I am feeling suicidal I think I’m the lowest form of life on earth and I don’t deserve to live, I’d be doing everyone else a favor by doing it. On top of thinking I was not meant for this life and I was born into the wrong time in history so I will never really be happy. Now if you put yourself into that mindset do you think how other people will feel about it would even enter the equation?

"Lack of Remorse for Suicide Im confused, has it always been like that here? Since this is not the first time you ask, yes it has. There have been prolonged periods where it was much worse when the Mods all fell asleep and when it was much better when there were moderators around who had a certain background knowledge and had set up standard policies to deal with different kinds of posts. Obviously atm theres no dedicated moderator here, so more problems are to be expected. </offtopic> dx: SPD"
"Lack of Remorse for Suicide To answer you all I am asking since I tried t commit suicide once. The doctors in charge of me in the psych ward wrote on my file that I tried to commit suicide but ""showed no remorse afterwards"" which struck me as something odd. As though they expected for there to be some form of remorse for the act! That's why I ask if it's associated with certain PDs at all or if it's normal. It's an honest question nothing more nothing less."
"Empathy is narcissism Empathy towards other humans, what is it’s primary purpose, why do we even need it? It’s main function in my eyes is to place other humans as a species above all others. With the possible exception of the cute animal breeds of course... To be perfectly honest I don’t understand why “Donna” who is running around as we speak buying useless crap she doesn’t really need while cutting everyone off in traffic and wasting everyone else’s time. How does “Donna” serve any more of an importance than any other creature on earth? Wolves are crucial to an eco system, so are the prey they hunt. Neither is more important than the other both serve their purpose in the delicate balance of life and death one that is earned with quick reflexes and sharp instincts. Not a push up bra, padded ass underpants, and high heeled shoes. Why does “Donna” deserve empathy, what makes her special, why should I even care about her. Empathy is a self serving trait same as any other narcissistic feature, it make the person feel special by proxy. ‘If every other human is special and a gift than so am I’"
Empathy is narcissism I have the empathy debate all the time with my daughter. She has absolutely no empathy or even sympathy for other people and I have to teach her that in order to get on in life you have to relate to what other people are feeling or at least learn to pretend to. My empathy is more sympathy as I've learned to understand how someone might feel and I pull all the right faces and make the right noises. I don't give two shiny shites about Donna to be honest and if I said I did then I would be lying. People who say they have this empathy thing are lying or mentally ill. England's Glory

"Boundaries-Fantasy/Reality I’m just curious if anyone else with a narcissistic or borderline disorder can get temporarily lost in fantasy? Probably the first thing I ever noticed in myself, well it was pointed out to me as you will soon see. I had a tendency to assimilate other people’s stories that I liked and start telling them as if they happened to me, it rose to the level that I believed that they actually did and had an entire mental image created for the event. This came to my attention when I told a story back to the person who originally told it to me and it took me a few minutes to work this out, I found this really sick and I was revolted by the fact I was doing that, like what the hell people must think about me. I have since stopped but this still bothers me to this day. Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"

"Therapy? No thanks. Court ordered therapy is very different to elective therapy. I went through it and it's basically a labelling exercise. Elective therapy could have it's value, not to ""fix"" a deeply ingrained PD, but to help deal with a particular issue. Some could find it useful to develop a process to deal with aggression or being more productive in certain areas. Personally, I'm not interested. Mostly because I've never spoken to a medical professional with a common point of reference to me, and so it's largely irrelevant. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."

My reason for entering in the first place was kind of shady. I wished to get certain benefits by doing it, which I managed to get. After that it was just a matter of time before I was going to terminate. The termination wasn't completely easy, because at some points I felt like it was somewhat useful. However, the therapist wasn't perfect, and I hated the rigid time of 45 minutes per session. Obviously more time would be needed. The net worth of the therapy seemed negative to me, so there it was.

Some therapists offer phone and videoconference based therapy - the latter at least might be an option to look into, eventhough my therapist has always told me that at least in the first phase of treatment, patients with narcissistic illnesses need some real person where the withdrawn perception can kind of break itself in (not sure if this makes sense in english).

Therapy? No thanks. I've been going to a court ordered psych for a few months now. First appointment I was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder and Adhd Impulsive type just off what I'm being mandated for. It was also written that I seemed unreliable. Ok then.

I prefer psychiatrists because they're going to stick to medication related questions and aren't going to get more personal like a therapist/psychologist will. I have no use for talk therapy.

Love Well that's a good question. It's probably too late for me to learn it now because I'm used to getting along without it but I think that if I'd have felt it for my family when I was younger then things might have been easier. Like my brother for instance; he was bay abused by his mother but he loved her still and you could tell he did so he stuck around but I wasn't physically abused half as bad and I felt no love so it was easy for me to walk away and not look back. I don't know. Its swings and roundabouts I suppose. England's Glory
"Love I believe I’ve loved certain people that I am close to, it just never lasts long term in romantic relationships and I tend to want to be left alone more than the desire to be in an intimate relationship although I can’t help the feeling that I am missing out on a lot that people in relationships seem to take for granted. I want it then when I get it I don’t want it.

"Love Yeah I get what you're saying. I can't have success in a romantic relationship because I only like the sex whilst it's new and then I get bored of the actual person. I have no feelings for them apart from what they may give me. In the past it been for a place to stay or money, alcohol, drugs etc. Once that supply dries up then there's nothing left for me and I'm not in a position to give anything back. Not because I'm selfish but just because I've got nothing to give back on an emotional level. I can't honestly say that I feel empty though. I've heard people talk of this emptiness and I just can't relate to that either. England's Glory"

I copied the way my brother behaved and I thought this would make me be loved and also make me love other people but I just never felt it. Thats a cool but complicated question. I think that love has a few requirements pwPD dont usually meet. One of them is being anchored in the depressive position, aka realizing the other person is actually seperate from you and realizing their actually a person, not [idealized] fragments or split halves. In addition I think it requires a pretty stable sense of self and internal world. Another is - i think - that you need to have somehow incorporated love as a schema or as a function, especially for yourself; and that it - if it does - naturally develops in line with other developments inside of you, like the aforementioned cognitive abilities. In my own experience I realized realtively early actually that what I called love was a mixture out of idealizing, projecting parts of myself and unmet needs onto others. I cant say if this is repairable, but if it is then learning to love - just like learning to feel I suppose - cant be the first goal, as theres a lot of groundwork to be prepared beforehand. I don't even know if I'm missing out on it or not. Pretty normal if youve never experienced it. But even figuring out if its worth the hassle might require a internal stability that isnt present. Like with the therapist really, one day you say you want somebody to talk to, then you say you dont. Stabilizing that is hard and I think the reason why so few people on here over the years have actually tried it lies in the same problem, namely being unable to imagine what they would be working towards - and keep that image fixed. dx: SPD"

Do you think the person with the PD is aware of this dynamic, do they actually see the other person as an extension of themselves and idealized parts of themselves or is it more of an unconscious thing similar to projecting where you may hate another person for showing the same traits that you actually hate in yourself but are unaware that is why you don’t like them?

"Aggression So what, if anything has helped you hone yours in? Also looking at anxiety/stress, which are modulated somewhat by some of the same pathways. General discomfort and dissatisfaction feeding into that loop. I quite obviously have problems with keeping at a task (get restless quickly and need variation often). Obv this ADHD aspect will probably be a part of my personality for keeps but just hoping that could offset it somehow. My ASPD traits have been giving me (but more-so others around me) trouble for quite a while now so am really thinking if there is a good solution here chemical wise (have tried to postpone a visit to the psychiatrist for long now but am thinking I can´t put it off forever). Mainly this is due to my aversion to psychiatric drugs and their side-effects (*tips hat towards AProphet*). It was a little more than a year ago that I tried taking 5-HPT along with correlating doses of L-dopa and L-Tyrosine (these agonists have to be taken together in order to not deplete receptors inequeally) but at times I really sensed that I got more boldened, which is why I don´t want to get on antidepressants (in fear that it will enhance grandiosity and make me even more obtuse toward others) Found the information provided here in this following video to be quite enlightening. It´s quite a long watch but goes in depth about psychopharmacology https://youtu.be/bNW2N4XWWzc There´s also research that shows dopamine to promote paranoia in individuals prone to it (can confirm). Definitely need to eliminate caffeine intake and no alcohol also. I´m already microdosing psilocybin according to the Stamets protocol 5 days on (2 off) along with Lion´s mane for more neurogenetic benefits and feel that it has helped me somewhat, at least as far as aggression goes. Of course it does not change my underlying belief system or the emotions that feed them, which are very twisted and skewed (and psilocybin at times puts me right in touch with them, i.e by relinquishing some control) but am doing damage control more than anything. It´s been a month or so now I think and am going for another two months at least. I´ve felt for long now that am going to snap and been unmasking near random people (unintentionally) because under huge amounts of stress I tend to get dissociative. Before anyone suggests, meditation I have yet to gotten back into but somewhat considering. It is said that it´s not good to meditate when your brain is in a depressed state anyway, as it only sets these pathways stronger into your brain, so really my. I don´t feel a sense of serenity/elation often. Anyhow rambling ceased, what has helped any of you lot? “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Aggression I dont think I understand the question. For me aggression and impulse control are two different things, first of all. So being angry and allowing oneself to be angry can be a very healthy thing; or on the flipside it can be extremely unhealthy always bottling everything up.

Yeah it was bit of a mixed message. For me these things correspond in the sense that anger is an impulse. I have been losing/breaking a lot of stuff lately and that has to do with impulsivity. If I just took it easy and didn´t want everything so immediately, I might be less quick to anger (when things don´t go my way at that very moment). This is absolutely an ASPD trait. Couldn´t find my keys to leave the house this morning (which made me more late) and just got irate (I even considered the option that my dad had hidden them, as per that recent thread and got legit paranoid that he might do that at one point:mrgreen: Basically, my question was posed more as it pertained to agression at work. The preferred term overimpulsivity might be pathology perhaps. Since I am what the literature would suggest ´supply deficient´ and pursuing some new avenues to feel somewhat fulfilled (work related, I take great second-hand pride in the company I am at - special by association), but in general I am constantly attention starved. For a long while when I was doing my other menial job (which I abhor oft because it´s in service and I deem myself above it.), my mask would often slip because I felt a constant need to be the perfect service guy, e.g. put on a fake smile for the client. Nowadays the job I am at leaves me more time by myself (alongside others) and brings the necessity of interacting with coworkers (whom I try to generally avoid as much as possible). So basically I´ve noticed myself giving the mean look to people who I kind of needed to hold my hand a bit or who I wanted to welcome me more into the group (whatever that means). I become aware of some nagging need but it felt inappropriate to expressed it to them because because I am wary of bein just being an entitled jerk. Also generally my body language is probably somewhat agressive/offputting and I´ve already probably made coworkers think I´m somewhat off. I just don´t want them to think I´m an absolute psycho (nearing that level though). I´ve become such weird mixture personality wise (sadistic/masochistic) but also take offense quickly if anyone else puts me down. I don´t like kindness essentially, not sure if it´s my paranoia or my necessity to not be perturbed in my shell, if anyone asks something about me personally I start squirming, not really wanting to give them the gist of how things really are. An absolute contradiction of sorts - like I want the attention but abhor it if people show genuine concern and interest in me, I scoff them. Especially if they are female coworkers, I hate when I am catered to and put them down without being aware of it in the moment (only after the fact) (It´s this whole inverted narcissism/schizoidish trick: almost showing others that I am so resigned from my needs so much so that I don´t even want them to be addressed or answered to by others]. **random aside**I´ve pinpointed that this dislike of kindness is the deep conditioning of my covert dad whose subtle intrusions (such as to put things in a certain place or do something a certain way) are just ways that he can feel good about himself, not true helpful acts of kindness or concern (Like ""oh, if you need this thing for tomorrow, be sure to put it here""), but it is actually a very covert way of making himself feel important in situations that would in normal circumstances not warrant a mention. [He needs to remind me somehow of his agency somehow, like he is allowing me to do something, it is he that enables me to do something that I would otherwise come up with myself anyhow.] So I have grown to detest when someone of a position of authority tries to help or een guide me because my initial reaction (schema) is to take it as a way of them controlling my actions. [yes, it´s ###$]. This also makes me agressive. Then at other points, with people that have taken a liking to me initially but have kind of shrugged me ´from their circle´ I become obtuse pretty quick into the relationship. Like today I wanted to ask a favour from a coworker and thought long and hard how to approach him, figured the best way would be to assertive to get him to do it but I was too engaged and it was more as like a confrontation because of my body language (like asking him is such an ordeal am already set in fight mode beforehand/expecting him to refuse, but am not aware of it in the moment) to the point where another coworker stepped in (he noticed something was up. And the situation just got awkward. Since I also gain ego strength from putting others down, I have to be very wary about that and I think so highly of myself that I want to boss others around. Especially those that are higher up from me (it´s a subverting authority thing). And in a workplace that stuff can get ugly fast.

Definitely can see where that would stem from. I am flat most of the day tbh and I am often concerned that my boredom/lack of care shows too much. At points am somewhat aware that I am dissociated from my feelings and body (I´ll have mind-surges, just racing thoughts, going in circles) but can´t really do anything about it if the work is static and just involves repetitive action a lot. As for self-medicating, silocybin helps for sure but the correct dosage is vital if I´m around people because it also makes me somewhat less aware at times, like I´ll be enjoying myself a bit too much and I´ll start to drift from (either lose myself in some grandiose fantasy or just be high on my own Self) and lose track of others. I think it is helping, definitely honing in the anger, like putting another filter above of my usual reactions. And I´ve felt somewhat okay with being in harmony with others, being okay with subjecting to their will and not having to always go against the grain. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Aggression SelfSerf wrote: Yeah it was bit of a mixed message. For me these things correspond in the sense that anger is an impulse. I have been losing/breaking a lot of stuff lately and that has to do with impulsivity. If I just took it easy and didn´t want everything so immediately, I might be less quick to anger (when things don´t go my way at that very moment). This is absolutely an ASPD trait. Couldn´t find my keys to leave the house this morning (which made me more late) and just got irate (I even considered the option that my dad had hidden them, as per that recent thread and got legit paranoid that he might do that at one point:mrgreen: I dont think ""ASPD traits"" are a thing. I've recently had the ""pleasure"" to be on a project with a real pwASPD. The amount of aggressivity, lack of concern for any other perspective, manipulation, the simple scale of how naturally they use people and the trail of destruction in both projects and other people they leave behind is on a totally different level and every gangster movie or psychological description pales when you experience that first hand. If you realize you have impulse control issues, why do you have the urge to give it some fancy name at all? So basically I´ve noticed myself giving the mean look to people who I kind of needed to hold my hand a bit or who I wanted to welcome me more into the group (whatever that means). I become aware of some nagging need but it felt inappropriate to expressed it to them because because I am wary of bein just being an entitled jerk. Also generally my body language is probably somewhat agressive/offputting and I´ve already probably made coworkers think I´m somewhat off. I just don´t want them to think I´m an absolute psycho (nearing that level though). I think youre doing this on the forum, too. At least youre oscillating between being a suicidal hysteric a pseudo-spiritual drug-freak and a horrible ""psycho with ASPD traits"", which makes it hard to take you seriously - or more healthy people would probably say it makes it hard to get a clear image of you and connect to you. Guess youre ambivalent about that and have trouble tolerating [that] ambivalence. o basically I´ve noticed myself giving the mean look to people who I kind of needed to hold my hand a bit or who I wanted to welcome me more into the group (whatever that means). I become aware of some nagging need but it felt inappropriate to expressed it to them because because I am wary of bein just being an entitled jerk. Staying with the same quote and looking at another dimension of it, I really think you should try working on that hysteric self-labelling. Just because you have needs doesnt make you entitled ; just like looking our for yourself doesnt make you NPD or breaking stuff when youre angry doesnt make you ASPD. If anything your ambivalence towards needing others might be understandable due to your past experiences and veiling them with useless labels just disconnects you from both the current situation (which might be a wanted side effect of course), but also from putting stuff into places that makes them easier to understand and manage. dx: SPD"
"Machiavellianism? Hi everyone I'm new to this forum. I had a question nagging my mind regarding Machiavellianism as it relates to the Dark Triad. I did a Dark Triad test a while back and it turned out I had normal levels of narcissism, high levels of machiavellianism and moderate levels of psychopathy. How different is machiavellianism from narcissism and why does is it not correlate to any of the known personality disorders like NPD, BPD or ASPD? Also, slightly off topic but does anyone know what moderate psychopathy means in real terms? Does it mean sociopathy and did I make a mistake in answering the questions? Wouldn't someone who is psychopathic be inherently narcissistic as well? Thanks"

Not sure how that translates to everyday behavior. As far as that last part, I would say it´s possible to be less narcissistic if that person has low-self esteem in some wider sense for their facade to seem less-so. Anyone as a covert/vulnerable subtype would abhor the extra attention gained from being too eagerly narcissistic so they might not flaunt it. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

How different is machiavellianism from narcissism and why does is it not correlate to any of the known personality disorders like NPD, BPD or ASPD? I would be surprised if it doesnt relate to ASPD, cause thats kind of a central aspect of ASPD. Narcissism is a bit of a problem, since it has different meanings depending on context and school of thought its used by. So it can mean self-love, or something that pertains to self-esteem modulation or in contexts like narcissistic withdrawal it can mean withdrawal into the self or into fantasy. NPD also is a different thing and is based on the DSM definition and the discussions underlying that whatever they are. In that context the simplest answer would be manipulativeness etc are not part of the diagnostic criteria of NPD or BPD. Also, slightly off topic but does anyone know what moderate psychopathy means in real terms? Does it mean sociopathy and did I make a mistake in answering the questions? Wouldn't someone who is psychopathic be inherently narcissistic as well? Thanks Psychopathic and sociopathic arent clearly defined terms and there, too, it depends who uses them. Someone like psychoanalytical therapist and theoriest Otto Kernberg has seen ASPD and NPD as a spectrum f.e. based on comparable faults in the super-ego and other structurs of the psycho on different levels and degrees. But that isnt widely followed. dx: SPD"

"case study: cured narcissist Ok prior context. The best girlfriend of my fallen star, Ive been messaging her a lot over the course of a few months with realy my findings, reflections and what I learned, firstly dialogue, later just checking the messages, just out of convenience I knew she probably doesnt read them but it didnt matter. I planned to keep sending as long as I could, untill she ignored me like the rest. Maybe I get a chance to say my sorry. So she finally responds: Will you please stop messaging me? Now notice, this is deception. Becouse what she realy wants is to prove how stupid he is by writing messages to soemeone who doesnt read them. She realy wants him to write something. She knows the narcissist is stupid and doesnt understand prior context. So he responds, narcissisticaly injured that she wanted to see him and then didnt, unexpectedly, with narcissistic rage: ok why hate me so much im the most amazing person anyway bye ######6 had reality break from grief im hurt im sorry I HAD NO ONE even the imagination that someone cared was a lot okk ok i had very little and a lot of hurt ok my own sister cant write back right here in xxxxxxx when im going threw you saw what i was going threw didnt exist self abusive hated the one one that mattered ever no choice I COULD HAVE EASILY BE AMAZING had community first time .. im over it its over He wrote Amazing becouse he just thought he cured NPD And realy he was a lashing out little boy who didnt understand anything. And realy And then his true self strated dying from grief 6 months after the girl he loved, broke her heart (both girls are friends), he realy didnt want to, he had an abusive false self. But he had no choice. And that girls still is everything, Then hyperspace event 2 started, on a very weak true self. This one came with prior warning from a dream, which said ""wank off and wet your feet"" he knew that wet your feet means dmt, he just didnt know its going to be soon day. Yes the dmt tells you, and even takes you there without smoking dmt its just stronger when you smoke together with event. Becouse he didnt know that he has as much time as he wants to respond. He is an automaton, he doesnt plan. A few hours later he then compulsively just admits. But he purposefully self-defaces himself. He didnt write the messages becouse he thought she is reading. Just becouse she didnt ignore him yet. And realy she wants to write and is decieving him. And realy he had a psychotic episode/event2 the day before telling him not to trust her. He still trusts her even though she hates him becouse he is an automaton and self abusive. Put in this kind of situation, he always reacts the same way. And you wont tell me narcissistic supply defficiency isnt real. The day after the dmt my false self was disintegrating. I DIDNT EVEN NEED TO WRITE ON THAT DAY. I JUST NEEDED SUPPLY. u realy did never read any its ok made me felt good and the others were on it too So he says hes an idiot instead of what he wanted And realy he had all the time in the world to respond. To talk to her and say he is sorry. And she is waiting for him now to write. Or write something meaning full But he just cant, even though he learned it all, wrote plenty of it with this girl even. Will you please stop messaging me? Why you keep checking.? and then maybe guess what she wants. She wants him to tell her, why he wrote them. But he never gets to that. Then she threatens him with ignore and he cries. When realy she cant ignore him and waited hours for a response. But he couldnt just think of any solution, except what he did in that place in 3 different cases, always the same: be retarded. Its called not having self-awareness. You have no idea of the situation you are in. And how am I suposed to live this way? Being abused like this. I didnt even feel anything. I just didnt care anymore. I was allready aware of the severity of my condition, never felt ashamed again. But being cheated and abused like that is just trash. human trash. Just ###$ you. I mean it doesnt matter what happens but its ######6 disgusting and pathetic, and always this way. Go to extreme lenghts to self abuse."
"case study: cured narcissist correction. my true self was allready dead when hyperspace even 2 happened, it died when I lost hope that I can say sorry to the ones that mattered. I grieved, but only short and intense bursts of whining. I think its becouse my false self doesnt miss it, hates the true self. During the event my false self fought the dmt for a long time, but it did break threw and I observed my inner mind I think fixing, reintegrating my lacking capacities, remnants of the true self. Dissociative processes preventing self reflection, empathy, and visions of the future. I just had a dream (more than a dream, a vision when entering sleep, not asleep yet) of me stiffled by hate, with the words ""who was the baby before?"". Im still working it out what It means."
"case study: cured narcissist Alright, you talk of the script. ""Hates love, loves to be hated"" etc. So what do you do to overwrite the script?

You yourself said that even the gods could not tell you anything. They could say anytinhg but nothing that you would accept, no information that you would be capable of making anything of.

I need to always regain and work intensely to restate a static view of myself. An infallible, perfect understanding of myself. This is the crux of narcissism, the very core of it. All this because the only humans who I ever depended upon, failed me. Proving that they could not be trusted, they showed me that nobody else could ever be trusted (neither life itself) either. Existence itself became deplorable because there was no guarantee of love to be had. Just suffering and volatility was guaranteed. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

You yourself said that even the gods could not tell you anything. They could say anytinhg but nothing that you would accept, no information that you would be capable of making anything of. Yes the false self (in the case of narcissit codependant) ""supplies"" on others abusing you, like a script. Its 'prime directive if you will'. You should be well familiar with the steps ive taken. At first I learned everything there is to know about the nature of the condition and developed my true self as much as I could. Its difficult with an arch rival in your head. In Jungian terms that would learning about the condtion would be 'shadow integration'. The narcissitic personality is full unconscious, so you have to consciously integrate it and go threw his individuation process, using dreams and reflecting upon your actions. I did that not knowing what I was doing yet, just following my intuition, nor knowing the dream representations of your aspects (afore mentioned shadow, anima, self or archetypes). Jung is considered pseudoscientific by conventional psychiatry, he is known for the theory of the collective unconsicous. I bypassed conventional psychiatry alltogether, they couldnt even diagnose me correctly, but now Im going to enroll in some kind of therapy following the latest narcissistic injury. About the DMT. Yes, breaking threw on dmt is a cure for the condition. And the best experience you can have is by doing it on acid, it prepares you for the blastoff, by the way. The problem is as you said, the false self will never let you do that. It fears the dmt, It knows that it supplies,feeds, strenghtens the true self. It will never let you break threw, like in my example where Mila Angelina connected to me a second time, she said now or never, AGAIN. And the insufferable false self said ""now is not now or never, now or never was back then"". What I most regretted, It still didnt register. It will lie to you and abuse you, never learn or change. And the dream images involving the dmt were the most apparent to me, ""wank off and wet your feet"", soul sister telling me to eat food before I return, from a 3-stove chandellier, but I took no note of that . And the dream where even small ammounts supply the true self (doctors with a constant supply of fetuses), so small ammounts are good too if you dont think your ready for breaking threw into hyperspace. Also meditation, the true self likes that. But the false self makes you (at least me, In comparison to my friend thats been doing it a long time and advising me) incapable of entering, sustaining the meditative state. Its realy difficult to meditate normally, but is easy when I have a surge of the true self, like when O. fell in love telepathicaly. I understand that what I write might seem delusional but its the truth as best I understand it, I cant help that. I couldnt make it up even if I wanted to. So what we have left are the spiritual solutions I mentioned above and one more, being in love. When the true self Is in love it is stronger than the false self. Also I think the false self is vulnerable during psychotic epsides, thats its one moment of weakness, but thats yet to be verified. The true self hidden under wraps (even someone seeing the true self, like in the moment I fell in love, my jaw dropped, gives narcissistic injury) like you say, is undeveloped, too weak to function on its own. And emotional pain can cause you to ""die"". Its in quotes becouse it never dies, it just becomes weak, but all the capacities that were evolved are still there, but it has to be supplied. The ways to supply it (that Ive discovered) once again: self love, being surrounded by people that care about you, dmt and psylocibin (for certain, maybe other psychedelics included), being in love, meditation, and twin flames telepathy. Ofc you will be challenged and denied all the way by the false self, and its realy powerfull. Powerfull beyond imagination. It knew to run insuferable and discard pattern when O. even for telepathy. I hope I answered your question."
"Just took a Personality Inventory and ... wow Hello, everyone, 27 year old female here, been following this forum and many others for some time. I just took the quite extensive Personality Inventory for DSM-5, and apparently I meet the criteria for ASPD, BPD, NPD, Schizotypal and Avoidant personality disorders. I should get some sort of medal, lol. CBT hasn't been helpful, my therapist honestly doesn't get me and only really addresses my surface and generalized anxieties. Thus far, I've refused to take anti-depressants, which were his strong recommendation, although now I am honestly swallowing my pride and reconsidering. I've perused these forums for quite some time trying to figure out if I could relate to anyone given my symptoms. It's hard for me to relate to people in real life. I'm wondering if anyone has experience dealing with symptoms that cross over into this type of huge co-morbidity. I can't tell you guys how much I'd appreciate anyone willing to share experiences either on this thread, or through private message. It's very difficult for me to open up in real life, and it would be so helpful for me to be able to open up on here to anyone dealing with similar issues. I guess I could start with asking this: how do you deal with the fact that your psychological issues consistently undermine your various capacities and potential, and make it so that it's even harder to advance in life than for those who may not be as gifted? How do you deal with simply not being able to be around people? I am married, but I honestly can't tolerate anyone other than my partner, definitely not my close family, and I have no interest in meeting others. How do you deal with the depression, the self-defeating patterns, and just feeling all around so unbelievably misunderstood?"
"Just took a Personality Inventory and ... wow There is significant overlap with all of these personality disorders. Otto Kernberg believes Npd is just a narcissistic surface covering a borderline structure, in the sense that narcissist are able to deceive themselves by building a facade of a shallow personality to cover the deep insecurity and pain they really feel and a coping mechanism to fight back against the shattered identity of the borderline who is more likely to be in touch with that pain. There are a few ways I’ve read about how they distinguish between them, ASPD has a criminal element to it, one way I’ve read to tell between NPD and BPD is attachment styles. Borderlines are typically very clingy and needy and narcissist are dismissive and distant thinking they don’t need anyone for anything even with an underlying need for attention and validation that they typically would never admit to, even to themselves, there is a lot of duplicity in both of these disorders that seem to contradict itself. Another simplistic way is if there is self- mutilation, abandonment issues and suicidal ideation it is very likely you Could have borderline personality disorder. C-ptsd is another condition that can look very similar to those particulars BPD and they have ways to tell those apart as well. Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"

I should get some sort of medal, lol. Well hello there! I will fight you for that medal because I have self-diagnosed that exact same coctail. Am male and 28 though, was in talk-therapy (gestalt psychotherapy) for around a year and a half but she never gave me an official diagnosis. I quit that therapy with talks of signing up somewhere else and getting on meds. Also now considering it strongly because otherwise things are getting darker and darker. The way I see it my dominant structure used to be NPD but the ASPD traits got so strong that it´s bascially interchangeable. Mainly sadistic and paranoid definitely, might be schizoid or dissociative at times on top of that though because when the BPD hits, $#%^ gets real and real tiresome fast. PTSD perhaps. Mostly I distract myself with things. Sometimes self-destructive to sort of ""reset"" me to a lower point so I can keep climbing back up to ground zero again, knowing full well nothing´s really tehre. I tend to hink in a childish way that it´s all just a game we´re playing here anyhows. There are times I become aware that none of what I am doing is really the long-term solution. Tbh, I know that´s not really encouraging but coping mechanisms are just that... If you have some well-adjusted family, I would suggest finding some support from them with the caveat of not overstaying it and using them. (*ok scratch that you specifically noted that wouldn´t be an option) I would say it´s good at least that you are married but I do understand the frustration of not being capable or willing of other relations. Have to acknowledge your husband being a hero also for keeping with it thus far. I guess trying to find some way of doing something fulfilling while avoiding the potholes of your own personality and self-effacing behaviors would be the way to go. Of course couldn´t tell what that would entail for you. [Hey look, my post is telling of me being less psychotic atm. That´s a win in my book] “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

"Just took a Personality Inventory and ... wow As for the shrooms, I have been lucky to have met people who are into psychedelics and have contacts. Its always a third person thing. Idk, I always it possible to get drugs by merely asking around. Not the least-dangerous method but It works. Ask and you shall receive especially applies to shrooms. I still carry a magical belief that these things are an amazing tool given to us or left here by a ahigher form of consciousness so I tend to think of it as a sacrament (it is odd since I dont consider anything else much holy in this world, sadly) so once you put the thought and intention out there, they will come to you. Also, they are really not to be messed with. If you havent had a full-blown trip I would first advise you against that. Scientifically Psilocybin is said to mimic psychosis in the brain but the assumption is that is because it activates communication between parts of the brain that otherwise do not. In the wrong frame of time and mind this can be ill-advised and lead to permanent mental issues. In general it is said it’s a good idea for anyone with a personality disorders (since we have more like Self fragments, parts of our Self is immature, parts are archaic and so on). Having communication between all these parts can either be healing or scarring, depending on integration. But as of now they have not made a therapy that involves psilocybin available other than for PTSD, so microdosing is the way to go, mkay? That said, Terence McKenna’s advice is that it’s mandatory to have a deep trip this at least once in your life (but to put strong emphasis on set and setting. it is vital). Prior to this, it is however best to be acquainted with the substance well in advance. Anyhow. It’s good if my post helped you some. It seems the least we can do is offer alternative perspectives and at best some insights. It is ironic though because a lot of responses to me here I have glazed over and only after visiting later I see the real gist of it. I dont have any answers here tbh at all, being amidst one of the biggest circlejerks of my whole life. There are a lot of topics on here to look through also, which mention a lot of these themes. As far as paranoia, it ranges a lot. Mainly the general of (people are talking bad about me behind my back, think am crazy, theyve taken a disliking to me). And these are all quite well-founded thoughts since I can be quite abrasive. Since I’ve become aware that I objectify myself a lot (80% of the tome) I tend to do the same towards others (people on the streets) and am afraid they will notice. Also, since I am out of touch with feelings I feel like my body is just a vessel hauling around my mind. I fear the mask of sanity slipping in a general sense. Am trying to be aware that I don’t freak people out (because I literally often feel like I don’t give a damn whether they are there or not) with my obtuse mannerisms or haughty behavior. I give off bad vibes mostly and am thinking I will be somehow ousted. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

I think it's even less socially acceptable for me, since I'm a woman. I'm also conventionally attractive and I say this with some degree of objectivity, as I never aspired to model but am able to do so for fun in my free time. Because of this, I come off as a totally conceited bitch even when I'm not actually thinking negatively of others, and am just not interested in engaging in conversation due to being in a way stuck in my own head. I like that you used ""mask of sanity"", I definitely have used that phrase before and feel it slipping all the time. Do you ever wonder how you became this way? I struggled a lot in therapy because I don't remember a lot about my childhood. If I could only figure out the source of all this dysfunction and pain, I could probably figure out how to heal at least some parts of myself. But I'm just so cut off from memory, feelings, anything really. I feel totally inhuman a lot of the time, except when I have my emotional outpourings and outbursts over seemingly random occurrences or triggers."
"Just took a Personality Inventory and ... wow hydrangea00 wrote: Hello, everyone, 27 year old female here, been following this forum and many others for some time. I just took the quite extensive Personality Inventory for DSM-5, and apparently I meet the criteria for ASPD, BPD, NPD, Schizotypal and Avoidant personality disorders. I should get some sort of medal, lol. CBT hasn't been helpful, my therapist honestly doesn't get me and only really addresses my surface and generalized anxieties. Thus far, I've refused to take anti-depressants, which were his strong recommendation, although now I am honestly swallowing my pride and reconsidering. I've perused these forums for quite some time trying to figure out if I could relate to anyone given my symptoms. It's hard for me to relate to people in real life. I'm wondering if anyone has experience dealing with symptoms that cross over into this type of huge co-morbidity. I can't tell you guys how much I'd appreciate anyone willing to share experiences either on this thread, or through private message. It's very difficult for me to open up in real life, and it would be so helpful for me to be able to open up on here to anyone dealing with similar issues. I guess I could start with asking this: how do you deal with the fact that your psychological issues consistently undermine your various capacities and potential, and make it so that it's even harder to advance in life than for those who may not be as gifted? How do you deal with simply not being able to be around people? I am married, but I honestly can't tolerate anyone other than my partner, definitely not my close family, and I have no interest in meeting others. How do you deal with the depression, the self-defeating patterns, and just feeling all around so unbelievably misunderstood? Im in psychoanalytic therapy for over two years now and my paranoia has basically vanished completely. My social anxiety and self-centeredness has also decreased. On the other hand side I've become much more creative and have started to set myself goals I want to achieve. At least all my neighbours seem to like me a lot, too , constantly showering me with stuff... I'm not sure why though lol. From where I started a few years ago - being constantly high on drugs and basically just lying on the couch all day - thats a pretty drastic development I think; eventhough for me personally it looks like very slow babysteps with lots of setbacks, which only in retrospect looks like a development. Personality disorders or structural disorders are very complex to treat and frankly CBT is not suited in most cases if you ask me. Therapy needs to address the structural deficits, basically you go through the development that you should've gone through as a kid and it takes an awful amount of time, but is necessary, because a lot of the issues that are caused by borderline disorders will only vanish when the mind has matured enough. This cant be just ""conditioned"" or induced via some magic pill sadly - at least thats my experience and also what I've read in a lot of psychological literature over the years. dx: SPD"

"covert vs. compensatory narcissism What is this difference? Read elsewhere a while back that covert was narcissistic core, avoidant outside whereas compensatory was avoidant core, narcissistic outside. Can anyone elaborate? I mean what if a compensatory narcissist also had a ""suppressed"" sense of entitlement (hating what others had, hated other people getting what they don't etc.), would that mean they have both? A covert is definitely a narcissist and will eventually go through the process of self-awareness and accepting who and what they really are, but what about compensatory? I guess compensatory is a defense against shame, insecurity and inferiority, I mean basically an avoidant who developed narcissistic traits to compensate for that during either childhood or earlier adulthood, but how does that differ to covert I'm sure there's some overlap, they differ yet they seem fairly similar.

Compensatory narcissism is a subtype coined by theodore Million. I dont think it has been used anywhere else. For him that type ""captures the psychoanalytic view of narcissism"", where a person who has grown up with a very negative and inferior self-view compensates by a grandiose yet brittle way of acting, including portraing ""every small certificate and placque"" on the walls [Personality Disorders in Daily Life 2nd Ed p339]. Covert or also closet narcissism has originally been used interchangably with hypervigilant, hypersensitive or vulnerable narcissism, as the latter for example by James Masterson or Ralph Klein, as the former by Shalman Akhtar, but has lately been used in research more to describe purely the way that certain symptoms show or dont show. So the first difference is that for Million his subtype captures the character, while the latter term describes the degree to which pathology is observable. But yeah if we accept the older definition of the latter and if we accept Millions conviction about his theory then they would be seen as complementary. In Ralph Kleins presentation even the object relations are inverted in what he calls closet narcissism, so in the grandiose self the ""external"" object has become the idealized one. If we stay with him for a little more another difference might be that Klein is saying that the child hides its natural grandiosity, its too painful to be naturally grandiose so that part of psychic development gets arrested (Klein, Closet Naricssistic Disorder p.14). So personally I'd argue that from that it follows that Klein describes a more low-level development compared to Millon. But there, too I am not sure how many people have followed this idea, plus its too abstract for personal use. Even ""narcissism"" itself is defined so differently in different contexts (which adds to heaps of overlap and contradiction), its descriptive ability is very limited imo. dx: SPD"
"covert vs. compensatory narcissism Guess they're the same but as you said different theories and presentations. Both make sense, but I think I'm more with million on this, kind of like the whole point why someone would develop some narcissism, or ""narcissistic defenses"" on top comes from underlying feelings of shame and weakness. Guess compensatory uses grandiosity as well, but not all the time and as you said not outwardly, basically like some napoleon complex or something where they're always trying to feel better than the next person in the room Thanks for the well educated and well thought-out response.

"Quarantine On the topic of narcissistic supply, just my humble opinion from what I have read and interpreted myself. I think it’s more like a need to be acknowledged, I don’t like the term admiration which paints an entirely different picture. Think about a child that wasn’t heard or given the attention they needed during development and now feels like they will be ignored or their opinion won’t matter to anyone because that’s what they were taught, so when it does and they get the attention and acknowledgement that they didn’t get it temporarily boosts the self-esteem. This is my primitive understanding I don’t think of it as some sort of cult like following where everyone involved is in a constant circle jerk. I think this definitely happens, it happens to people who are perfectly healthy psychologically also. I think it’s important for people with NPD to find ways to validate themselves internally, I don’t think the concept of supply is a healthy one at all and it’s something to work to correct. People will put you down and try to chop you down for no reason other than they are jealous or want to hate, letting them dictate how you feel about yourself is a terrible way to exist in my opinion. Just another sock puppet in a dancing children’s show for the amusement of the masses"

I don’t need anyone’s company to be stable and people seriously bore me as a whole.

USAs president is a great exampel for this, if they admire him hooray, if not theyre out. Akuma, do you use social media? I may make another thread about that, and ask users here if they use it for their own gratification, etc I totally overslept social media.

"Narcissism? I am confused about this: if someone has a self-image that isn't entirely related with his self/body/reality, is he surely a narcissist? I explain it better: I think that my self-image isn't realistic under some aspects, but I don't feel so much social competition, I haven't a consistent feeling to be superior or inferior than others. Sometimes I feel to be a little “different” in a positive or negative way, but this isn't a strong and constant feeling; then it can be a narcissistic trait, but it's quite weak and occasional, as I don't think very often about social life. But I could have a self-image that isn't entirely realistic. I don't put myself in a competition against other people, it's self-centered.

So if there is a psychostructural lack that leads to your inability to look at yourself clearly then yea thats a narcissistic issue. But more concretely this can have a wide variety of causes of course. Kinda doubt that a completely realistic self-image exists at all.

I.Self image is not constant. It fluctuates depending on what happens within and arround us, very many different reasons. Self image abstracting from reality is NOT uncommon. The narcissistic case is only the extreme pathological example, where that image has no relation to reality whatsoever. It is not the defining feature of narcissisitc personality [self image], just one of the related issues.

As of the subjective part II: Everyone likes to feel ""special"", nothing bad about finding reasons to differentiate yourself from others, be they good or bad ones. One important difference you highlight is that narcissistic traits are something entirely different than pathological narcissism A certain ammount of narcissistic traits is healthy, and not all with NPD possess all narcissistic traits. Once again. Nothing wrong with having a ""wrong"" (not realistic enough), or even looking for your true, authentic self image, being lost a bit on the way. Its a difficult process and you should just keep reflecting untill you find common themes, and then decide whether to keep those traits, or change them.

I don't focus on other unless they put theirselves in my path and ""want to get to know me the real me"" then that's when I'm allowed to judge them for their worth and if found wanting, its not like I try to ruin their life because they're well on their way to doing that anyway. but if I'm provoked enough its not my fault you was dumb. but the ones that actually have more than just words and can back there $#%^ up and not let me down usually end up with my undying devotion. so why is it people act like I'm in the wrong!? thank you for letting me get that out."
"Narcissist latent homosexuality. What do you think about corelation between narcissist both overt and covert and latent homosexuality or homoromantic?I was thinking very often about that in last time,because i never have capacity to emotional connect with woman,only sexually atraction was when i see some girls or looking at woman as sexual object thats why people was thinking that i am pervert. Here Sam Vaknin says. Some narcissists are raised by weak or inaccessible mothers and harsh, rigid, or sadistic fathers. They tend to bond with males in male settings (army, sports, police, bodybuilding, the Catholic Church) and to seek empathy, warmth, support, secure friendship, and love among their male peers. This macho bonding masks repressed and latent homosexual tendencies, the result of incestuous or simply pathologically excessive love towards the father (or father figure). Most male Narcissists are misogynists. After all, they are the warped creations of women. Women gave birth to them and molded them into what they adysfunctional, maladaptive, emotionally dead. They are angry at their mothers and, by extension, mad at all women."
"Narcissist latent homosexuality. Well, can´t give you a reference for this but the sexual aspects of a narcissist are somewhat similar to a histrionic´s tendency to seduce and use their sexuality to get attention/admiration. It also has to do with sexuality that is underdeveloped and not integrated. So in that sense it´s close to a child´s, with high opennes. That doesn´t necessarily mean they will swing both ways in most situations. In my experience, someone´s attractiveness or lack of it sometimes overrides my capacity for friendship because I feel less motivation to associate with people who I deem in some objective sense lesser than (or in my eyes). They might have attractive personality qualities but I am extremely image focused so it´s tough for me to hone it in. The opposite is true also, I getvery self-conscious about handsome men. With ex girlfriends I had extreme insecurity when someone attractive was around them but tha´s more like a comparison thing and I don´t think this has much to do with homosexuality. There might be some homoerotic aspect to some friendships but I don´t deem myself homosexual by any sense of the word. Am simply not into dick. I think one would know that one a visceral level, even if some of the narcissistic construct sometimes might veer towards borderline flirting with a male. The misogyny seems to indeed be inherent to the narcissistic personality structure. Definitely has its beginnings in childhood and faulty parenting on part of the mother´s side. I only knew my mother until 9 so it´s difficult to attribute any importance. But the misogyny is largely the entitlement to garner unearned attention from the opposite sex. I also attribute some of it to quite a strong conservative undercurrent (quite primitively assigned gender roles) as quite deeply held beliefs that I would much prefer not to admit to myself. Always idendified with fairly libertarian beliefs (false self) but I guess that is mostly virtue signalling. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

"Do these traits sound BPD or casually narcissistic to you? Please keep in mind that this is an older teen, so not developmentally an adult yet. - Is often extremely envious of others and senses condescension and enmity where there isn’t any. Has gotten to the point where it’s mentally painful to them to acknowledge others’s talents- even people who want to teach kindheartedly are seen as threats because any superior skill is seen as offensive. Has avoided people helping them for years due to rage that ensues when trying. -Can rarely ever feel happy for others if they achieve or have something the want themselves. -Pursues vengeance, usually with extremely hurtful words and the occasional physical violence. The violence is only hindered at threat of punishment. Has once lightly bitten a toddler in anger to hurt them, often gets an “endorphin rush” from punishing children and making them cry despite being taught to be kind. Will use people’s insecurities against them. Is quick to be on the offense if feeling slighted. -Hypersensitive to criticism, but will be very callous towards others. Will not acknowledge one’s own mistakes or offenses without deflecting the blame on anyone else. -Tries to manipulate and argue with others to do their work, and if it fails, will guilt trip them despite knowing its not fair. -Often low cognitive empathy. For example, has asked excitedly asked rape victims to recall the details of their trauma without knowing it would hurt the victim, or once whipped a sibling but got offended when reprimanded because they didn’t realize it would hurt them. Often has to actually imagine someone doing to them what they do to others to feel their pain instead of it easily coming naturally. Won’t often do this. -Generally unempathetic, but not entirely. Examples would be when a friend was suicidal, they asked the friend to text instead of talk verbally for the comfort of said teen upon the verge of suicide. When friends have trouble, friend will offer advice but little to no emotional comfort. Will only deal with facts. Will ignore friends and family problems entirely if they can’t solve it with a step by step process that doesn’t account for extreme emotion. Regularly threatens to hurt siblings (though doesn’t act on it due to fear of punishment). Will empathize with people if they suffered the same pain they did, but refuses to empathize with people who don’t have the ability to empathize at all- considers empathy a transactional thing. Other examples include brushing off people’s health problems, even potentially dangerous ones as “their fault”. Is annoyed when people feel heavy emotions, has been called “robotic”. Enjoys taking advantage of “doormat” type people, only hindered if they can’t get away with it. -Is driven by their own form of justice. They have tried to subliminally influence many people online they deemed not worthy to live into killing themselves, and is regularly aroused by others’ pain- the most extreme example is arousal from a video of murder- the teen claimed it was justice because the victim deserved it for allowing themselves to take sexually risky endeavors (the victim was pulling a stunt and got taken advantage of, ending with brain damage.) Is best sexually driven by fantasies of people being forced into extreme submission/subjugation. -Often black and white thinking, won’t tolerate grey areas easily except for their own benefit. -Has guiltilessly shoplifted multiple times, only hindered by fear of being caught. -Seemingly shallow friendships, often asocial. -Often has narcissistic fantasies, often lives in their own head where they are happiest. -Enjoys collecting people they find interesting but can’t emotionally connect with them much- merely wants to be entertained by them. -Can often feel empathy for others but won’t act on it/lack of compassion"
"Do these traits sound BPD or casually narcissistic to you? I had a neighbour who has been to prison a few times, he's about 24, and sounds quite like this. A doctor got his sentence halved with an apparent diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome. I and others including one friend who worked with people with ASD for years don't believe the diagnosis. I think he is a victim of child abuse who came to self-medicate with strong dope which has blunted him in a way that makes him seem cut off in that way that might colloquially be viewed as psychopath-like. I think this neighbour and the person you describe both illustrate how these medical terms are at best - not that this is exactly a criticism and certainly not a damning and cynical one - working models that provide a literature to assist in management of the behaviours and symptoms. I personally don't believe so much in the terms as these working models of understanding. Where I live BPD is now 'Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder' and I was tentatively diagnosed with it myself by a psychiatrist who then immediately relocated, breaking the dialogue that might have coalesced this. I don't recognise myself at any age from what you describe. Having exposed myself to various 'working models' of psychological understanding for thirty years whatever it is that I have seems to be changing. I'm more stable but the stability is not positive. Mostly I'm not aware of people with an autistic spectrum disorder being criminally violent. But supposing they grew up in a neighbourhood where violent crime was normal. Maybe they'd model that behaviour in the same way people with ASD can model usually more socially useful and acceptable behaviours. Similarly a survival thing, but with unfortunate outcomes. If there is something in this then maybe my neighbour's doctor might have been hoodwinked in the same way that some of us meet people with NPD who we at first think have high-functioning autism, because we want to believe they are at sea, that they've in no sense meant us the emotional harm that arises. I believe the neighbour's doctor was hoodwinked because my neighbour's parents, living on an estate here known for child abuse, incest and domestic abuse, know what led to the start of his behaviours, whether either or both of them were the perpetrators. They've been negligent with the doctor whether with a secret agreement with their son for fear of legal reprisals should child abuse come to light. Do you know enough about this person to know if 'things happened'? To me it sounds like there is too little mask to be talking about narcissism or NPD. It seems to me that insecurities are much better masked there with a narcissism problem. What is the drug situation, do you know? This strong laboratory-altered dope is doing serious damage which sadly only those who don't use it and therefore have no denial about it seem to be able to recognise. One friend I had a decade ago is unrecogniseable now behaviour-wise and I'm certain it's the dope. The paranoia and paranoid misunderstandings are the key sign, and I get the impression inconsistent supply of it makes for extreme anxiety that tips over into anger, like someone with a messy coffee habit. I think once the strong dope is involved a person will be unreachable for a very long time. I'm inclined to avoid people who use it altogether these days. What I've said leads away from a certainty but I think that is not a bad thing - it acknowledges the openness of the person's future."
"Do these traits sound BPD or casually narcissistic to you? Well, this person is me, I just preferred to write that in third person. And yeah. I’ve been told I have borderline type of behaviors, but also equally arrogant- moreso the latter. But I understand if this forum isn’t for me. Perhaps I don’t belong anywhere"
"Narcissistic Brother, Help! Hello all! I am a BPD patient, now cured, after many years of therapy, which I still attend, nonetheless. Thing is that I have an NPD brother. He is not officially diagnosed because he refuses to go and see a therapist, but I have talked about him with a number of PD-therapists (including mine) and the off-the-record diagnosis is NPD. Let me talk about him a bit. First of all he really thinks he is perfect. A perfect person, entitled for each and every good in this world. He is the smartest one. He is the best driver. He is the BEST in any case. His NPD traits begun when he first suffered from acne, which he still does. Whenever a pimple shows up, he is full, literally full of rage. He abuses mom verbally, he bumps his fists on the doors and walls, he says that in reality he worths nothing and then, when the pimple disappears, he suddenly believes he is the most handsome man on earth. He also manipulates people and especially me into believing that he is superior - as a man, a person, personality, everything. He tries constantly to downgrade me, especially in front of others and girls. For instance, me being almost 6 ft tall and him being around maybe less than 5 7, he constnatly states how short I am and that in reality I am a ""bit"" taller than him. I am not saying that because it annoys me but just to show you his attitude. I have a lot of gray hairs in my head, although I am just 29, still, when he discovered (literally) two gray hairs on his head, he panicky said to mom ""will I become like him?"", full of disgust, as If I had syphilis lol. He cannot accept criticism AT ALL. When I tell him something wrong he did, he retorts something wrong I did too, so yeah, like, I should shut up because who am I to criticise him, mr Perfect? If I insist, he starts insulting me and verbally abusing me, full of sarcasm. He even takes my clothes without asking because ""I have too many, so why would I need this particular sweater?"" The other day we had this huge fight. I have unfortunately lent him my earphones. After an hour I really needed them cause i had to speak with my girlfriend and it is always more convenient for me using them while speaking on my mobile. I politely asked for them 5 times. Then, the sixth time I asked for them he stood up more slowly than a sick turtle and intnted to go get them. So, I was like ""Yeah, I don't see you going getting them, hurry, I need them"". And he literally exploded: ""YOU WILL TALK BETTER TO ME I AM NOT YOUR SCLAVE!! OKAY AM I CLEAR, YOU A*HOLE?"". I was speechless but, I got angry as well and we started this huge fight, where he was gaslighting me, telling me that I was sarcastic toward him (while what i said was a humorous embellishment, obviously) and that he refuses people talking to him so badly, that I am an a*hole for talking to him like that and so on. I became very very very angry an strated trembling, begging him to leave and he was like ""No I will stay here cause I so enjoy you being so mad, I will even make you madder"" with a sarcastic smile on his lips. I cant and dont wanna remember more. Just stating an example. I could use a number of examples of such a behavior but it is pointless. I don't know if all this is narcissism in the sense of a PD but, since all people have narcissistic traits, I do need your help and opinions guys. I know that most people suffering, like my bro, seek help but he refuses. He said that he wont go to a shrink because he is not crazy like me!! Imagine. Do you think that a good strategy would be to avoid him in any case? We live under the same roof. I can't even. Thank you in advance."
"Narcissistic Brother, Help! Well the most obvious thing would be to start living on your own. If you are better and you can get an income, to look for a small apartment or maybe a flat share. That would have the most positive sides for you in any case, not only due to your family, but for your life overall. As to that brother of yours, since you arent his therapist ultimately you dont have to indulge in his crap of course and I think in a way trying to figure out a way to ""deal with him better"" is already indulging, but that might just be me. Theres a book ""How to talk to a narcissist"", which could give you some ideas. Another thign is, you can look at the way that he interacts as externalizing - we have some people here, too, from time to time, who show up and they dont really want help or want to get better, they need human toilets basically. They just want to take a huge dump and then they leave until their mental bellies start acting up again. So in a way he needs a container for his inner stuff and I would assume - which in a way is also the topic of aforementioned book, eventhough I am not sure this perspective is taken explicitly, the ""quality"" of interaction with an externalizer depends on your ability to be a good container - to contain his extermnalizatiosn and projections and transform them into something that he can work with. But that being said, that is a therapists job usually, it can create a sort of co-dependent dynamic very quickly if you try to do these thigns and it can backfire on your own therapeutic goals, because it will take your mind off your own stuff and force you to concentrate on someone elses. dx: SPD"

Hey Akuma. Thank you very much for your reply. I just realised that there is a thread about Nons, and I apologize for not having posted there. In any case, I just remembered that his whole you-will-talk-better-to-me- attitude applied to other family members too. For instance, he has this disgusting thing not flushing the toilet after taking a dump (lol- sometimes at least) and when dad once scolded him for that he was like ""I will not reply anything till you stop shouting to me!"". Instead of apologizing he demanded a special behavior. Oh God. My BPD is coming back in forms of impulsivness and self-cutting because of his behavior and no-one here respects that. I am that close to start cutting myself again in order to release the pressure. The bad thing is that I am still dependent on my family cause i am studying and do not have a steady income. Not to mention the corona-quarantine. He used to go out every single day and I was calm af and now I have to cope with all this every hour lol If the admins wanna remove the post into the nons thread, please do so."

I think its understandable that you getting stressed out. Part of you might feel a bit trapped there, especially when you are being forced to have contact with people that you perceive as toxic. So frankly I think that getting aggressive and having trouble containign that is maybe normal and not necessarily a BPD thing. What I would think is though when your brother (and perhaps other family members) are needing you to contain their $#%^, too, that this becomes too much; it gets stuffed inside of you and you are trying to get / cut it out again? So I guess its a good thign you are still in therapy, maybe you can explore ways to make it easier for you or more successful for you to set clear boundaries. Clarifying this to both yourself and to the ones around you that you are not their soul-trashbin or punching-bag or toilet. that brings its own challenges with it, but in the longer run its much better, it supports your own cohesion, self-respect and other things.

"Narcissistic Brother, Help! Hey! I do acknowledge that ppl with NPD suffer and I do kn ow he suffers too, but I am done with his $#%^. He is a toxic person for me, and I know too well, that I have been toxic for some other ppl in the past, too, however I've worked so much with myself and know I am much more mature. I talked a bit with muy therapist and he said that all this was narcissistic rage from his part, because he felt inferior with my comment. Any way, what bothers me a lot, is that everyone here expects me to compensate for his own behavior. For example, he is 25 and incapable of taking care even a bit of himself or affairs concerning him. He has planned a trip with his gf for April which he will have to cancel cause of corona virus and mom told ME to call the airline and ask if he gets a refund. When I told why not him, he is old enough and it is his own job, I somehow came off ""inconsiderate""..."
"My Narc husband is a vVctim of his Narc Dad...help! I'd like some advise, on a bit of twist regarding narcissistic abuse! I'm married to a full-on vulnerable narcissist! We were best, best friends and team roping partners for three years before we ever dated. At first I didn't want to date him because he's friendship was valuable to me and I didn't want to risk it. Those three years, he appeared he was very much in love with me (I know, don't say it), he was protective, kind, helpful, a knight in shining armour and very invested in my opinion of him. When I finally said yes to dating, I fell madly in love with him and a year later we were married. It hasn't been easy, of course and he does cycles through every narc pattern to a T. Again, it was a rough start but a lot of learning and educated came along to help us grow. Here's the deal, we are great, amazingly happy, repectful, mature and solid 90% of the time! He does get triggered, and does the ghosting thing, and silent treatment's, but few a far in between. They're short lived (2 months is the longest, and I'll explain). What's crazy is even during his ""detach phase"", he goes back home to dad, and he stays completely faithful to me and our marriage. He knows that's the one thing I will not forgive him for. By society standards, I'm out of his league (I don't feel this way, so please don't judge), but we truly compliment all aspects of each other. I'm very strong, independant and confident, I'm happy, positive and successful. He has no self-esteem, he doesn't find value in himself, basically he thinks he's a complete failure. I believe this is why we are so strong together! I'm very good at naturally empowering him. I do believe in him, I find so much value in him as a person and I strongly appreciate everything he does for me. I keep his supply filled and with ease because they're true things I feel and show him. On the other side, and its taken a lot support and education, but I don't need him to validate his feelings for me. If he hurts me, I handle it respectfully and in a way that's attacking and I know not to ""expect"" him to understand my feelings; and we've learned to communicate this aspect very well. This was a hard thing grasp, originally, but being strong and confident, I know where he stands in our lives, our marriage and about me (trust me, I'm not being nieve or making excuses for him). He's definitely my person and I am his! We are truly awesome together! Before passing judgement, he see's 2 professionals, on his own accord, to for the tools he needs in his tool box to keep our marriage in the right path. So why am I writing this? You see, my husband's narcissism isn't the problem, it's my father-in-law's narcissism that is the whole issue. His entire life mission is to destroy our marriage. He lies and manipulates my husband so bad. Remember me saying that he only runs back home to his dad. The relationship between that father and son is heartbreaking. His dad does not validate him, praise him, nothing. His dad treats him like he's 12, and my husband's maturity drops to a 12 year old when they're together. My husband cherishes his father, and I don't dare say one bad word about his dad...oh no, massive trigger! My husband has grown in his life's successes since being together with me. He now has a career, instead of being grunt labor. Its a fulfilling career that my husband is so proud of and works hard at it everyday. He has a nicer vehicle, credit score and saving; his competitive side and confidence with team roping is growing and he's getting more successful in this goal. This causes my husband to always blirt out things to his dad for praise and validation...like ""we had amazing sex last, I was so studly!"" Or ""I roped like this, or I did this at home for my wife, etc"". His dad just responds with an ""oh ya"" or shoulder shrug. Another problem is that his dad loved me at first! He was proud I had their family name, praised how truly happy his son was, how he loved that I spoiled his son, etc. Then, out of no where, that switched flipped to pure hatred! So, now that there's this horrible tension between the two most valuable people in my husband's life, there's a lot of turmoil in his head. My husband started lying to me and hiding just to have beers with his dad, the more he snuck around, the more evil things his dad would put into his head about me. His dad convinced my husband I stole 21k from him? What, we share and account and there's no way to steal money, he can see everything transaction. Yet, my husband believed him for a few weeks. Then realized it couldn't be right, andhad accountability for that mess. Then one night, my father-in-law demanded my husband divorce me and ""get that ring off my finger."" He left me the next morning! His dad has also got physically violent with me, slamming me against the wall! And my husband justified it by just standing there, almost in shock or torn? This move out and daddy justification only lasted a few weeks. What's crazy is that his dad goes through all the narc phases but to my husband and towards our marriage. I think he pulls my husband home for his own supply and manipulation. Then the second my husband says wait, what I am doing, no, no, no...he gets really hurt and scared. Then his dad turns it all around and tells him I'm the best thing he's ever had, don't let me go, take good care of me, how much he loves me for his son, and how could you have ever thought about leaving her...ya, ugh!! The first of this year we moved 700 miles away from our hometown, then 2 weeks in his only brother was killed in a bad wreck. Firstly, this was the first and only death my husband has ever had in his family. Oh man, what an emotionally challenging ride this was, he was very overwhelmed. Of course, he goes home and his dad convinces my husband he has to move home because they lost their only other child and they have no children left but my husband (my husband is 45 years old), and he needs to be back in his childhood room. This was a deviant and sick move. So, my husband comes back to me, on the fight, very mean and nasty and moved back home, per his daddy's demand. He's been gone since the end of January. Now, he is starting to pattern back around, because he truly can't and doesn't want to live without his wife and the lifestyle we have in common, I fulfill his life/supply! I filed for divorce once, and it scared him so bad, that's when he found help, and went to his professionals. He doesn't want any one else! So, here's another piece to my problem-puzzle. My husband is ok and understanding that he's a narc, it doesnt make him perfect, or our relationship easy, but he tries very hard to keep our balances level with me being an emotionally driven person and him not knowing how to process that people have such feelings; however, don't you dare imply his dad is a narc, has flaws, or point out things his dad does to him and us. This causes a war! Is there anything I can do to end this cycle with his dad, or help my husband be aware or see the patterns there? Honestly, if I decide to divorce him, at this point, it'll be 100% because of his dad and the games he inflicts on my marriage, my happiness and my life. If I divorce my husband it will destroy him! Also, like right now, at this moment (per patterns), my husband is teetering between I've got to start talking to my wife, before I lose her, but he's afraid too, because what if daddy finds out, or hears me? It's crazy to me, that my high level narc husband isn't even the toxic one, his dad is! I recently ""suggested"" a plan that when my hubs has to run, since he cannot control that urge (and he'll likely always have that negative dad influence), to try and do it with maturity, no silent treatments and shorter terms. If he'd learn to skip the hate-my-wife phase, it'd shorten this to about a week. Honestly, it doesn't bother me that he has to run, he decompresses and comes back with power. Missing me keeps that spark and relationship good, especially for him. It also keeps reminding him that I am valuable in his life! I know, I'm probably sounding a little crazy, but we work, truly! Maybe a rare couple, I hope! So any help, please, regarding his dad? *I posted this on another forum and they lit up bashing my husband for his lack of accountability with his dad, they were very brutal and mean. Please don't do this, although my husband is a narc, he is aware and he tries, but he is genuinely a victim of narc abuse himself! It's a really tough triangle especially for him. He needs validation from his very emotionally and mentally abusive father and it's very toxic!! So please don't bash my husband, remember he's a victim on this spectrum! Also, my.husband, through his 2 professional ladies, knows how he developed narcissism as a kid, he knows it was his dad, but like a victim, he makes excuses for his dad during that phase of his life!"
"Is apologising to someone with NPD a bad idea? Or rather, is apologising to someone with NPD necessarily a bad idea? I am taking tentative steps towards repairing a 'friendship' with someone who shows the traits and behaviours of NPD. I haven't jumped the gun in deciding on the viewpoint - the more I read and watched, the more ridiculous it seemed to not conclude NPD was the fair term for how she is. I had very little idea two years ago when things were going wrong and I blamed myself and apologised when in retrospect I shouldn't have. I succumbed to manipulation and gaslighting, and I was silent when this woman dealt in narcissistic and otherwise obnoxious gestures. I went through the thing, that seemed at one time just something I'd hit upon, of wondering if she had high-functioning autism. I've since seen a few videos talking of NPD and ASD being confused. (I've read many articles and some decent books too on the subject - a lot of it is rubbish and too geared up to 'turning and running', right though that very often may be.) I couldn't consider her to be just an awful person. I still believe a small number of details about her that seem in part to explain the reason for her difference, to do with childhood. I mean, if those were lies too ten she is a psychopath, and I don't believe that. Enough was said at times to show the possibility of growth. I've written a letter that tries in about two-fifths of its content to gently express what I feel I've learned. Some if not many wouldn't try this. I'm partly thinking our lockdown situations might make people see our current cocoons as places of not just self-protection but change. People seem to get that in some ways. In my letter I've 'unilaterally' apologised for not understanding what was behind her behaviours. I've included a reserved but articulate apology and my reasoning is that it softens what I'm putting to her, the accusation aspect of saying she has NPD, and more importantly perhaps because it is a different kind of apology to giving in to manipulation. I think. I've said alongside the apology that people do sometimes get undeserved power from being apologised to, and that they can misuse it. This is part of tentative boundary-laying. This letter I've written from scratch five times in the last nine months. I've deleted all previous versions. 'Fail; fail better.' I'm thinking I will post it tomorrow. I had left a gift for her last week, a film that I believe shows I've been listening to her. I once thought I was in love with this person. I have love for her but I am satisfied with the platonic basis of it now and genuinely would not even want to risk exposing myself to more given what I now know. It could go wrong, even messily. I will give up if so - I do need to feel I've done my best for this person, who is in her mid-40s, and who I can see continuing to wreck everything for herself for twenty years if her habits keep her alive that long. I am a quiet person who showed her patience and willingness to share time and to help her with an academic matter and some practical, techy stuff. I never 'used' that, as if I was bargaining. I gave willingly and only later made any kind of muted comments about her apparent ingratitude and the one-sidedness of things, once she'd blown up and made a load of quite feral, self-contradictory, self-deceiving statements. The fifth version of the letter I'm otherwise sure of now, but I don't know whether to excise the apology or find another way of saying that I regret being at sea before, without causing antagonism through the conspicuousness of the nearness of what I'd say to an apology. I do believe I knew someone twenty-five years ago who is very similar to this more recent friend. The way the matter has gouged into my life has probably been why I'm so heavily invested in trying something for this woman, being twenty-five years older and wiser at least after a fashion. What do people think? Thanks for any feedback. I hope that people here can see that I'm investing a compassionate approach, and I strongly believe in that, at least for now. I admire anyone who's accepted they have NPD or that NPD literature is a working model of understanding and who is tackling this, if it can be done."
"Is apologising to someone with NPD a bad idea? Short answer: Yes By only reading the title and glancing at the post. pwNPD tend to take advantage of kindness, even if they necessary see you as a good person and their saviour in some regard. They just aren´t capable of corresponding with like, at least it isn´t first nature and will feel ´wrong to them"". Apologizing will show that you are willing to make yourself subservient in this relationship. Remember that a pwNPD doesn´t view helping them as necessary you, but it is a form of relationship where she will feel ""less than"" because she needed help and either feels indebted to you (and deep down resents it) and in the worst case, feels like they´ve duped you so they could use you as help. If it´s a question of boundaries that have been violated, it is a bad idea. By apologizing you are moving the boundaries even closer toward her court. Taking the higher road might seem to you like a noble thing but if she is really narcissistically disordered, it is a show of hands how far she is allowed to push you. So if you are actually looking for raising the bar in the relations between you two, you might try to rationally (as opposed to emotionally, we tend not to don´t speak that monkey language, rather refuse even if we understand) set boundaries as to what is acceptable to you. Keep in mind though that for a narcissist, making the first move to make amends is damn near impossible. Their pride doesn´t allow that. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Is apologising to someone with NPD a bad idea? Its not, why should it? But what youre doing isnt apologizing. Youve obsessed for months about writing that person some letter, which implies that you care way more about the effect it will have on some imagined relationship, than about making that person feel better or to right a wrong you yourself have done. In addition on some level what you are trying to do is devaluing her, because you are basically saying ""you poor thing, I didnt understand that you just have an illnes [I just googled]"" - which doesnt seem empathetic but condescending - especially in light of your obsession with that person, which doesnt exactly make it look like a selfless act of love, as you seem to try convincing yourself that it is, but about you having finally found some explanation on why you werent treated the way you wanted. Also this belongs into SOFF. dx: SPD"
"Is apologising to someone with NPD a bad idea? ID010471 wrote: Thank you both. I can appreciate that you might see patronage in this, and I appreciate that it could be perceived as 'devaluation' for me to attribute what happened to my friend's NPD. It may well be that that is how my friend responded in her mind, which would be a great shame. Isn't it also possible though, that the idea of devaluation comes from the set of responses someone with NPD has evolved? That this is dissembling? I am pretty good at criticising myself, sometimes accurately, with the benefit of forcing evolution, but also neurotically. Sometimes when rejected I'm at sea as to the reason, sometimes it's not truly an insult but reasonable defeat of an unnecessary infatuation and sometimes there's a neurotic component, even if that isn't the whole explanation. I do appreciate that as far as a romantic relationship goes there are things wrong with me or that are problematic that she could fairly cite or that she will have had in mind. But, more relevant the purpose of the letter, what hurt in a more lasting way, and what remains, are those experiences that occurred once we had still pursued a platonic relationship, which I wanted and which she says she did, that are echoed in the material on NPD, too often and too resoundingly to ignore. I would not risk looking merely like a psychobabble addict without deliberation. Once we were meeting as supposed friends, there was still a diabolical amount of obliviousness, rudeness (to waiters, taxi drivers and myself) that for some time I just did not understand, or refused to see for what it was well enough to question myself about it. I was actually a bit surprised by the onesidedness of my perception, too and a bit scared of your reaction to it, which is weird but normal for me if I ""disagree"" with people on the forum. For me this also indicates though that - as cliché as this is lol - you reminded me of my caregivers. Especially my mom has had a habit of being very convinced she is interested in me, and has - now that I aborted contact with my family - started writing letters and emails in which she is pathologizing and infantilizing me, but in the tonal content of ""I am there for you""... which for her probably makes her feel better after such projection. I see this in your post. In addition to that such reaction is almost a bit automatic, as after many years of the forum, the usual suspect coming [erroneously] to the NPD forum asking for assistance with relationships is not necessarily of high insight and good mental health and to be frank a waste of time. Akuma, do you believe that it is only selfishness behind my motivations? If I say that I had hoped to at least try to plant a seed, for this woman's potential benefit, do you not believe that at all? I dont think I have such positive perception of humans, no. I have an aquaintance for example who is a typical externalizer. Its always the other peoples fault. Ive been for 20 (sic) years trying basically every method in every book to get him to do that less. And I mean hes very extreme about this. Hes a diabetic, too. So situations arise where he goes in under-sugar-mode and I tell him he should maybe test his sugar and eat something and he will wonder if he should call an ambulance for me because I am ""having problems"", refusing to eat somethign until he can barely walk etc. But I've also realized that all this helpfulness from my part is also an inability to accept him; or more specifically a deep wish for someone to be clsoe to me perhaps who ""fits much better"" with an additional fear of lookin for someone who might actually fit better. Not saying this might be your motivation, too, just putting this on the table as an option. Also because in my experience really, trying to ""help"" people can be not only motivated by stuff we fail to realize for a long time, but also completely useless. Akuma, is it possible that you identify with this woman and that therefore your response is like hers may have been, perhaps tellingly? Is there not something you can consider in this? That your view of how I've seen this is a defence that you could benefit from deconstructing? I feel this is possible, but I am at the listening stage, I've listened to you and am happy to listen more. Your tag refers to NPD in a way that suggests you accept the diagnosis - but do you still experience conflict between what led you to that and the discomfort and criticism of it? Guess I answered this one already. Its both I identify with both parts of you and that woman. And I guess you thought this necessary and a good thing to do. I still dont share that opinion though. dx: SPD"
"Is apologising to someone with NPD a bad idea? Thanks. I am glad I haven't made things worse by continuing and I do regard these exchanges as some kind of success. I have some upset at the idea that my friend may have reacted in the way you suggest, though I'd anticipated the possibility - this is no criticism of you of course but a case of facing facts or strong possibilities. By chance I had found myself in another online exchange yesterday that fed into this. This woman has probably had a lot of male attention though this is not as a result of anything purely superficial. I think things have gone awry in relationships a lot whether it's down to the men's behaviour or hers or a likely fatal mix. We chatted briefly and regularly for two years before any meet-up - she is a waitress (downsized from a more academically informed career) and on Facebook when I intermittently had an account. (I do need to make her not quite recogniseable here, just in case.) I think she probably expected the worst of my intentions, and that prior experience attuned her for that. I haven't been able to defeat that. In the time I've known her she has been around brutish men including someone who threatened a disabled neighbour of mine. I think this is a case of her fearing less the 'devil she knows' than what she imagines must be lurking behind my quiet attentiveness. I have been near to cutting ties with my own families for various very legitimate reasons. I don't know where you are but in my country there have been policies in the last decade that have messed things up very impractically and dangerously for many people and my parents voted for this while seeing the condition those policies had left me in. They seem to have achieved a slight understanding of this all too late and I've seen signs of something like guilt or a wish to make amends. It's a very odd thing having been treated violently or with verbal abuse as a child, to develop a mental health situation and then hear unguarded expressions of approval of these policies and politicians, whether it's malice, passive-aggressivity or extreme naivety. I can't quite say stupidity. I have a very specific conception of what love is and have seldom seen anything like it in others but I do feel that this couple in there mid-to-late 70s have some kind of not overly shallow feeling for me. They can forget having me as deep in the family as my siblings ever again and it's possible a new experience could wreck things for good. I would think you know best what is working for you but I suppose I'd also hope that you can stay open to accepting signs of concern even if it is a clumsy mess peppered with their unresolved issues. I don't know you but I honestly had an amount of tear brimming in my eyes reading your second response and I do personally believe we as a species can have a capacity that is an irreducible fraternal feeling that is awareness of others, of others' stories, and though agnostic I have experienced something fair to call boundlessness that feeds this true awareness of others that seems on the face of it to be just a name and some words. (Are your parents overbearing, moralising types or just crassly insensitive and oblivious? In the latter case, though I suppose my parents have gone from the former to the latter with age, the latter seems something towards which it's easier to bear and tamp down the exasperation.) So, based on that, best wishes to you. If there are developments that might be of mutual interest in discussion I will post again here but will continue to read the forum in the meantime. I emphasise also to SelfSerf if they're reading that I read both replies attentively, finding - I suppose because there was less concordance and some resultant anxiety - more immediate questions to bounce off of Akuma's comments at that point. Certainly the last two sentences of your post remain in my mind. Thanks."
"Is apologising to someone with NPD a bad idea? Is apologising to someone with NPD a bad idea? From my own experience, my honest flat out reply is, yep it's a bad idea. Verbal abuse can cloud how you see yourself and how you perceive how others treat you, regardless of having NPD or not. I personally think that if writing that letter makes you feel better, then by all means send it, but if you second guess yourself, then wait. Be strong of self, meaning remain firm in your feelings and be sure of your intentions and just be plain honest. There is nothing to lose, imo. Only much to gain. Self respect. I don't apologize to anyone who mistreats me. I stay the ###$ away from them. I wish you the absolute best. “There’s an Asian expression that ‘a burden shared is halved.’"" Bipolar ADHD"
"Is apologising to someone with NPD a bad idea? I am likely on the spectrum, so I apologize in advance if my answer is straight up—whether you are narcissistic or not. I believe the question you are asking is in itself a fallacy. Apologizing is the expression of regret over one’s own actions, meant to let someone know you didn’t mean to cause them hurt or prejudice. As such, it should not be based on who the other person is or how you feel about the other person—it should be based on whether you sincerely believe you have done something you regret doing that might have caused the other person hurt or prejudice. It should be based on your conscience. It sounds to me rather like your real question is whether it is okay to try to manipulate the person to get the relationship to go where you want it to—just because you believe that person to be a narcissist. That actually sounds like something a narcissist would do... The answer is no. It is not okay to manipulate a person in order for your relationship with them to go where you want it to, independent of whether they are a narcissist or not. When a relationship gets to the point where you feel the urge to manipulate, it’s time to question the existence of that relationship. If that person actually is a narcissist, that doesn’t make it any more fair game. Saying they deserve it because they are narcissistic is also a fallacy. Narcissists don’t choose to be that way, and they are mostly not even aware of the damage they do because they can’t see themselves for who they are. Saying that a narcissist deserves to be manipulated back is like saying that a handicapped person, an amputee or a person with a chronic disease deserves to be treated worse than the rest of us. Narcissists are people too, and trust me, they suffer more than enough, precisely what their narcissistic ways are meant to be the painkiller for. If you send her that letter, there are two likely outcomes: it will have absolutely no effect and she will only laugh at it, or you will have declared war on a narcissist, and you really should know better than that. You can’t win with a narcissist. Sounds like it’s time to let go for good."

There is probably a psychological term for this but I’m not familiar with it. Yes this is holds exactly for NPD, especially the 2nd paragraph. The narcissist will in fact go to extreme lenghts to justify his behavior and never learn anything from his mistakes, make belive, pretend he is perfect and infallible and it was all his plan from the begining, that he foresaw it. The infalliability trait is pathologicaly ingrained into the narcissistic personality remember. So like SelfSerf said, self deception is the rule, the default mode network of the narcissistic mind if you will. But also this: SelfSerf wrote: There’s more than a few good Youtube videos about it, which try to go into it. Basically it’s about not being able to look head on/accept the negative traits . We mostly need to view ourselves as positive charactera in our own stories/minds. The inability to integrate positive and negative aspects of everything in the self. Instead of understanding that everything is shades of black and white, the pwNPD is trapped in cycles of idealization and devaluation, of juggling between extremes instead of a reasonable middle way, of unifying the positive and negative aspects of object representations (internal to the mind) into a coherent whole."
"Self-reflection Oh, as it pertains to this thread. I do this a lot, but only after the fact. And often it doesn’t pay to so it because it just pours fuel into the fire of self-loathing. Lately I’ve been practicing it a lot but it also might be the fact that my mind is quite suicidal. Was told recently that people who consider suppposedly do that a lot beforehand. As for appropriateness, that could be either a few hours, a few days or in some very traumatic instances years down the road. That’s part of the reason why we pwNPD might at lower points in our life feel like life is just something that happens to us, that we are not in control and lack agency or any say in the matter. In a sense of sheer emotional intelligence, we actually do lack it, since we are the age of a toddler inside an adult’s body, with very bad coping and social skills that we have overcompensated with by developing various deviant and destructive methods of controlling the environment and others in it. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

"Is this a narcissistic personality disordered person? Hi, I am constantly being told that I call ""everyone"" a narcissist, however, in my experience, I now encounter so many people I believe it is VERY common, my own mother definitely being one unfortunately. I have just walked away from my GF since I believe she is one, if I describe her behavior, can anyone tell me if she indeed a narc? Or the problem is with me? When we first got together, she seemed overly controlling. I had to delete all my dating profiles, I wasn't allowed to speak with my ex before her, she was not happy me having female friends, etc. etc. She would have temper tantrums over little things like me using my cuttlery wrong, but at the same time, she was constantly sending me love letters, little notes, it seemed over the top, and she seemed upset if I didn't match the amount of cards and love letters that I gave back to her. Then came the first major problem; I had a female friend call me drunk one evening and I ignored it. I explained it was only a friend. As a consequence, my GF then got up in the middle of night and while i was sleeping went through all my phone messages. She then found a private discussion I had with my sister about getting money back owed from my ex (whether I should or not because it was over $1000) - it was only a discussion I had not interacted with my ex in anyway, just a private conversation with my family. This triggered my GF to go insane, and she had an explosive temper tantrum in the morning when I awoke. I then went to work and then found I was blocked by her on every form of communication when I got back to my own place. No matter how many messages I sent asking her if we could talk/resolve, or explaining that I had no feelings for my ex, she would not reply. She did not communicate IN ANY WAY with me for TWO WEEKS. It was only when I had gone to hers for the third time, written a letter, and loads of flowers she finally gave in and talked to me. During the silent time she would unblock me on messaging, only to block me again minutes later, then deny she had unblocked me in the first place when I questioned it. When I had turned up to her's for the third time, she ""pretended"" she was on her way out to an important ""work"" meeting, but I knew this wasn't the case since she drove off up - what she didn't that I knew - was a dead end street. Now the most recent episode. Valentines night. I had sent her a card in the post, got flowers, chocolates, but unfortunately a personalised gift hadn't arrived (I explained that I was sorry about this). However on the eve, I felt like I was being interviewed. She seemed to give the impression that I was at fault because I had not talked about marriage or possibly proposed that evening (I only know her 8 months) etc. I then told her that if we were to get married etc, we need to live together first, and this requires her to get a job (she has not worked for nearly a year and I had been paying for 99% of our outings). We then got back to mine, and she had a temper tantrum saying that I had bullied her about getting a job (I had not, and had been very calm and rational about it) and said she was ""going"". This time, I did not try to stop her this time, and her temper tantrum got worse and worse while I hid under the bed sheets trying to avoid confrontation. She then repeated the same behaviour as before, blocked me on everything, ignored any messages from those channels of communication that weren't blocked. 4 days later it was my birthday, and still I heard nothing from her. The sad thing is I had got her an engagement ring, but she just didn't know. I then gave up and stopped contacting her after sending quite a few upset messages seeing as she had ruined my birthday (I had booked 2 nights in a hotel with champagne but instead spent my birthday completely alone because I had no time to make new plans). She then (2 weeks later) unblocked me from facebook. I gave her the ultimatum and said if she doesn't contact me tonight I am going for good. In response to this blocked me again! This triggered me to drive to hers, and her mum was there and handled me at the doorstep while my GF hid upstairs. Her mum then told my GF to call me later, we spoke, and she apologised saying she was under a lot of stress at the moment (her mum is ill) but I said I would not tolerate such childish behaviour anymore and the damage emotionally and financially she was causing me. Her mum then started screaming for help from upstairs (even though she didn't appear that ill at the doorstep), and the call ended. I am still blocked on everything and do not know what to do. I am torn because I am worried she is overburen with her mum being ill, yet she has shown to me she has deep narcissistic traits. Also, I believe her mum is a narcissitic parent, pulling the strings, because her daughter is now looking after her, and she ignores me. It's like her mum doesn't want to lose her to me? Can anyone tell me if this is what I am seeing here? Or is this just normal human interaction and I have been overly upset by her need for space after arguments etc.? Thanks"
"Is this a narcissistic personality disordered person? Hello, are you still here and involved in this? I've only just joined and don't like to see a thread go unanswered in any forum... I have had an insecure-seeming girlfriend who had periods of verbal aggression, and a platonic female friend who almost certainly has the behaviours we associate with NPD. Your girlfriend sounds more like the first type, as difficult to work with as this is. Maybe since posting you have gone round in familiar circles and find yourself in the same place. With the virus situation you may be using social media more than you had for communication. I think this is a big problem. My friendship with the woman with NPD is probably in the finished-looking shape that it is because she was over-reliant on Messenger. Last February she walked up to me on the street, said, ""Can you unblock me on Messenger, I want to talk to you,"" and then walked away. To a 48-year-old man this seems almost funny (and she is 43, with the tastes and habits of someone half that age) but it's not really. This thing of apps messing up communication instead of aiding it is a disease that will outlive the coronavirus. I had sixteen sessions of counselling last year with the best counsellor I've ever had, and have learned that some mixes of neurosis just cannot work in relationships. The wrong buttons can only be pushed, unintentionally or otherwise. I have wasted a long time in my life missing people who I shouldn't; I've persevered with friendships that were never healthy. I would want to say to a lot of people, seeing the same kinds of thing being replayed everywhere - by all means never give up on anyone immediately and don't act in a fickle fashion as soon as anything goes wrong. But months of pointless pain and aggravation show that the polarity is wrong. There people just need to accept that things can't work and move on. Seven billion people in the world - there is someone who is a better fit for both parties when this stuff is happening."
"So, why do You think you're a Narcissist? So you are a narcissist. Where do you think it comes from? Were you born that way or do you feel like it is something that you developed? Is there some person or incident or series of incidents that you think contributed to it? Is it a lack of trust, a grave psychic injury, or abuse that led you to this?

"So, why do You think you're a Narcissist? I was definitely not born like this. It's the result of a series of trauma and specifically, disruption with primary caregiver (mother).

"So, why do You think you're a Narcissist? Ah well being told I was is a start, but then again my T thought maybe, because I do introspect, and would only leave it at a 'maybe' because of the introspection. I am not sure when that became a requirement, lack of introspection, maybe it's implied. On a personal level though, I realized I was keeping myself at a great distance from others, judging them, really believed I am better, analyzing life vs living it. Starting the get over myself part was hard, but it's taken a LONG time to stop believing I am better than others, and I still revert to that in groups. I stand off, am very selective who I will speak with, over analyze what I will say before I say it, expect others to win my trust, dismiss others based on nothing much but a first impression... The bad part is that I am the only one who loses when I go into that mode. Everyone else enjoys themselves, while I am sitting there alone in my self-created bubble of superiority. I am a male and my choices seemed to be full on BPD, or NPD (AsPD was out of the question). I got most rewarded for NPD thinking, and behavior. Accomplish things, prove your worth, get first place or at least try, do not feel but do, be a leader do not follow. NPD thinking is what I got rewarded for. But again, is lack of introspection a requirement for narcissism? Or is it just the more common case? p.s. it appears that most everyone here introspects, so if lack of introspection is a requirement, then maybe few or nobody here is.

"So, why do You think you're a Narcissist? i believe, and i spoke more about it in the recent Compensatory NPD, that my narcissistic tendencies that i displayed as a young adult (competitiveness, self interest and self absorption, feeling superior and special) were basically a defense for low self esteem and high neuroticism throughout my life. now, i behave more like a codependent, and just recently i was sucked in into a disastrous relationship with an amorous narcissist. looking for that Maladaptive Covert Narcissism Scale one of the posters mentioned above, i found an interesting paper with such a scale: http://www.midss.org/sites/default/file ... _scale.pdf not sure how to score the answers (does anyone know?), but looks like covert narcissist is a different animal from the overt one. see Table 2: coverts are associated with high shame, low self esteem, high neuroticism, and high introversion, while the overt ones have no association with those traits. and yes, i have plenty of empathy and introspection myself. i easily qualify for the empath type, as commonly described online."
"So, why do You think you're a Narcissist? ddreamer wrote: and yes, i have plenty of empathy and introspection myself. i easily qualify for the empath type, as commonly described online. If you have empathy and self reflection, you dont have NPD (pathological narcissism). Possibly some narcissistic traits only? Is that what compensatory means? not familiar with the term. Remember that what you call ""covert narcissism"" (shouldnt realy be called in all correctness covert) is also called narcissist-codependant."
"Interesting article I would comment that the articles is not very in-depth and pop psychological. And directed primarily towards those in relationships with a narcissist, which is not bad in itself, they dont need the more sophisticated language of idealization/devaluation and psychological defenses. So the article essentialy summarise the agregate qualities of what a relationship with a pwNPD might look like: ""thankless"",""stepping on eggshells"", ""serving all his (her) needs"", which are essentialy correct, but not very in depth or sophisticated."
"Cruelty, Resilience Me: seems to have emotional codependency, inverted and covert narcissist traits, and now possibly developed some sociopathic traits Anyway... who can relate to this feeling? I feel like the passage of time and life can be described as a building going upwards. Your earliest formative years are the base and then as you get older you build more and more levels. Life hurdles can be translated as winds or other issues and you're either strong enough to withstand or you crumble. I feel like my building was structurally flawed, a flimsy internal build of planks lazily nailed together. And yet I was shielded by my spirituality and perhaps other things that kept me safe up until a point. A proper breeze wasn't just going to knock down my recent level, but knock down my entire tower. Everything wasn't built properly. It was a weakness in resilience. You may not have known from talking to me, I don't seem like a weak or shy person. And yet one, proper life knock would have teared me down completely. But luckily in the knick of time I removed myself from my emotions. My spiritual path changed to Machievellian and ""Satanic"" ideals, I read a memoir from a diagnosed sociopath describing the invulnerable way they view and navigate the world. Now I understand there is no point being sad because it accomplishes nothing, I avoid listening to songs that give ""feels"" and instead listen to dance/happy or dark/malevolent music most of the time. I was almost destroyed and it was so good, so horrid and twisting and mind-bending, and addictive... and I have this hole in me from codependency which just is pitch black and physically aches at times. And I want to be useful and used, but also I wish I could be needed (a common desire of codependents, but they seem to always be despensible). God... I wish I could be needed and belong to another... Like a yandere possessive boyfriend fantasy... Anyway something cruel happened to me. This isn't what almost unhinged me, and this didn't hurt me at all. Maybe because I didn't actually care about my boyfriend and the relationship was so new. But... he slept with another guy and sent me pictures! And the other guy was bragging about how it's the funnest relationship he ever ruined! And I know that was just #######4 talk, cause he seemed dumb but like... in my toxic warped and emotionally invulnerable mind... it's just so delicious. That would've ruined the old me. Utterly ruined. I still have pride so ""exposed"" them on Facebook and I reckon I got my little revenge or justice. That was more of a necessity than anything else. But !@#@... If I could do that to someone... or be with someone who needed me. I don't know. I just, like toxic and cruel things now. Can anyone relate to this?"
"Cruelty, Resilience I'm wondering if you enjoy how you've become? Do you prefer the you from before or after whatever unhinged you? I ask because some people are resigned to their injuries or resigned to thinking they don't have choices whilst other people enjoy their symptoms (or at least the idea of them) and still others find pay off in the suffering and self pity that comes with the aforementioned resignation. Although not the same as the ones in your post, I know there are some 'symtoms' I'm quite pleased with and will not change.

It would make sense to be hurt (even if it's just via experiencing disgust or finding it insulting). _____ I'm currently quite fascinated with 'reenacting trauma' because there is a lot of variety. Unfortunately, due to this whole extremist feminism movement, it's not necessarily politically correct to acknowledge anymore. With conscious or unconscious reenactments, one can range from becoming a perpetrator of abuse / violence, it can be a possible reason for developing an interest in sadism, or seeking out those who fit the profiles of their abusers for relationships or as an attempt to 'master' the event/person that hurt them (sometimes a reason for sex trade work), etc. -All these things can be seen as attempts at ""resilience"" or resistance. I like this article because it's the simplest ""A Helpful Way to Conceptualize and Understand Reenactments"" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articl ... o=0.833333"
"Cruelty, Resilience Thanks for the insight. I believe I extremely enjoy how I've become because I finally feel resilient. But more than that, I feel a lot more invulnerable. Sometimes I wonder if my state/condition or at least my moods and feelings, are malleable. So it makes me less of a victim. I can try to adopt the proper mindset and feelings. Now invulnerable and also happy for the most part. About the current thing that didn't hurt me at all. It didn't hurt me because SOMETHING ELSE already happened before that, that caused me to obsess and be in my head. But that other thing wasn't malevolent at all. I look back at it, and it was like nothing. And yet it did so much to me. Cause of the intrinsic flaws I was carrying. To do unto others what has been done to you... I was ALMOST destroyed and by that I just realised I need to clarify, it's less of a poison scenario and more of a speeding car almost hitting me. I recieved no damage, but I almost died. That tricky emotional terrain that unhinged 'empathic/apathic' people go through. So I want to 'do unto others what was ALMOST done to me' Yes I want to be needed in an extreme way. And yes possessed by someone, so long as secretly I'm in control of myself. Stockholm syndrome I think about a lot. Someone hurting you is like them dominating you, and if you find yourself having fondness for your abuser it just means they've dominated you to such a deep extent that you can't even rightfully hate them. No I don't think this particular recent event hurt me. Though I did act out of pride, enacting 'justice' by exposing the screenshots and people shaming them publically. But my pride is confusing due to the changing nature of the inverted and then the covert narcissist traits. I think what they did could be principally, logically labelled as a disgusting thing to do. Reenacting... um... yes. I seem to crave extremes to compensate for the years of codependency loneliness damage. My own narcissism traits caused an ego that prevented me from 'dating down' or 'chasing too hard' and 'getting used' so instead I suffered through, and it was the right decision cause back then I was vulnerable and I just know a single hit would have made my proverbial tower just collapse. I couldn't accept things, like being rejected, when I felt so alone and had 'faith' that 'the universe would provide'."

And the other guy was bragging about how it's the funnest relationship he ever ruined! I've been lucky enough to have never knowingly been cheated on (aside from my one ex who went and raped a chick when we got in a bad fight, but I never found out about it until after we broke up. Given the context, I didn't interpret it as a betrayal in our relationship the way I'd interpret what happened to you, but rather him acting out on his anger away from me). That being said, I'm always impressed when I hear about the person who was cheated on, doing something like setting the cheaters' car on fire, etc. and I find it annoying how people get more upset about the latter. Zoicite23 wrote: My own narcissism traits caused an ego that prevented me from 'dating down' or 'chasing too hard' and 'getting used' so instead I suffered through... Are you saying you no longer do this? Because depending on you're part/behavior in the dynamic of the relationship, you may have literally just described ""dating down.""

I was wondering because you described a sort of avoidance mechanism which in my mind - and to a degree in my experience - makes it hard if not impossible to connect to anyone and therefore to relate to anyone. So I found it confusing, having this idea of invulnerability on the oen side and wanting to connect to people on the other. As to the image of the tower I think that in my case maybe a few years ago I might have subscribed to this, but not anymore. I think that the structural issues can to a degree at least be amended so the whole thing can also grow into other dimensions, so grow more wide and more deep. But I think that in part this relies on the ability to accept that towers instability and to work with that, not trying to ignore it - or at least not all of it hehe. dx: SPD"

"Causes of overt/covert narcissist. I was very often thinking about what is the real cause of developing overt/covert narcissist,is that genetic,or temperament geting baby on birth or also nurturing? I read this According to some theories, the cause of narcissism is early affective deprivation, while clinical material describes the narcissistic person more as unwilling than incompetent. If NPL is caused by infantile damage and subsequent ""short-circuits"" in further development, then it is likely to be incurable. On the other hand, if narcissism is a behavioral disorder that has been acquired, then there is some hope, albeit rather weak, that these behavioral disorders can be corrected My father was overt narcissist i remember him as a dominant and i was afraid of him,i remember myself as a submisive and maybe there is some corellation between covert narcissist and stockholm syndrome. Also as a kid i was always imagining world as a dangerous and nasty place,my wishes was to go to work on cruise ships and i think that it would help me with anxiety,gaining self esteem maybe also finding love,but i didnt have courage to go so far away from home. Now i am working on river ships but it not make satisfied like going on ocean."

On the other hand, if narcissism is a behavioral disorder that has been acquired, then there is some hope, albeit rather weak, that these behavioral disorders can be corrected If I may, I think that citation lives in the past a bit. Noone uses the nature/nurture dichotomy anymore. There hasbeen lots of research now into how adverse childhood experiences affects the developing brain and also the childs physiology as a whole. This isnt limited to narcissism, it can range from psychological distress of different levels of course to a lack of frontal lobe development (read lack of impulse control, proneness to drug abuse), lack of different brain functions including intelligence - but even to diseases like cancer. Maybe Nadine Burke Harris TED talk about the ACE study might be an interesting starting point here or the talk by Kwame McKenzie about the causes of psychosis. When we are talking about neglect for example it is I think most obvious. The developing brain is hardwired to need certain kinds of inputs and responses and it develops based on those. If they are absent or dysfunctional, the brain of course cannot wait with developing until they appear, but it just grows in a way where the connections formed on the base of these interactive schemas simply are'nt there or are faulty. What we can see as an outcome is people with psychostructural illnesses, like the lowlevel personality disorders, dissociative or psychotic disorders, which come into being because often primitive mechanisms have become stuck in the mind, which would have normally been changed into more mature ones, but couldnt. The flip-side is though that, as we also know, certain genetic setups change over life due to our actions and beliefs and our brain also keeps on changing itself - else we couldn't learn new things. So this, too, I find is a rather hindering perspective, to say it's either behavioral or structural, because from the physiological side behavioral and structural are both based on brain-structure of course. I think what lies in this quote is the neurotic/borderline dichotomy, which in my view is a real thing, but this can't be broken own just into disorders where you need CBT and disorders where you cant do $#%^. After all non-behavioral psychotherapies like the psychoanalytic/-dynamic ones are also evidence-based. dx: SPD"
"Causes of overt/covert narcissist. First of all an aknowledgment. Overt/covert are misleading labels, overness is realy a scale of outer/inner psychic energy focus. Unless you understand the label as who the pwNPD is abusive towards, then outward and inward abusive differentiation makes perfect sence, but that is not widely agreed upon. So better terminilogy would be grandiose/classical vs inverted/codependant narc. Causes of the condition are mostly developemental, not genetic, they stem from upbringing. If the child was not accepted as it is, with its strenghts and weaknesses, when the child aquired trauma, narcissitic primitive defenses evolve above the personality structure, designed to protect the self from further pain and trauma, so that the person may continue functioning. I might add here that these primitive defenses are NOT the self and are NOT even a personality, and those are fully unconscious. In jungian terms an unconscious complex takes over the functioning of the personality structure, stemming from the relationship to one or more parents (I'n my case was mother,oedipus complex, for inverted NPD). To the latter relationship I would atribute the degree whether the child aquires inverted/grandiose strain. There is no reliable research on this that I've found, so we cant conclusively say if the precondition for narcissistic personality is that one of the parents is narcissistic, and uses shame-based introjection as a propagation mechanism."

Hes right about that, those labels are $#%^, and people, even in serious research have no idea what they are talking about . So what I gathered theres essentialy two types of the narcissistc personality, you can cathegorize who the narcissist is abusive towards: overtly abusive or covertly abusive , the former being of course classical or grandiose, while the latter being narcissist-codependant, inverted or ""covert"", vunlerable NPD subtypes. But considering the shortcomings of DSM and that NPD shares lack of object relations and splitting emplyed as primitive defenses with Bipolar disorder (also called manic depressive), I must conclude that often NPD-invert gets diagnosed as bipolar. This is just a working theory becouse sometimes the patient is realy stupid (doesnt think at all actualy), like my new neighbor living upstairs, he says hes bipolar but I suspect inverted-NPD. He similar in this stupidity to one more case study of a colleague I know, and Im wondering whats that about. Becouse me and my sister were never this stupid. Its true, I didnt understand other people have thoughts, that makes you pretty stupid. They dont think at all . Impossible to have reason and arguments with them. Not only lack of self reflection."
"Causes of overt/covert narcissist. I belive that the upstairs neighbour Gary is indeed NPD. I base that on his thought patterns, certain revealing quotes ""...when Im going out of the house"", ""did make that noise then and there"", those are the quotes but what I mean is that he assumes I know everything he knows (only the narcissist has thoughts), I dont have thoughts and cant know things so he just projects his thoughts onto me, that I know when hes in the house and he isnt. No I dont know, I dont watch for him or care. So to delve further the is the covert type which is usually intelligent (me,my sister, SelfSerf?) , albeit not possessing self reflection and/or the covert type which is totally stupid, and even if he tries to educate he falls into retarded conspiracy crap like Bashar and mayan callendar, bibble verses, fish people (atlantis), ancient aliens etc., no ability to think and reason at all. Also one more important Jung says is that the patient tends to recall artistic images not at random, but that indeed the unconscious is purposeful and the brought up artistic representations are the ones relevant to his case study. So my neighbour Gary pulled up these images: Kestrel, an old french movie, but he showed the scene of a boy being bullied on the football field. In fact he played this scene more than one time, commenting that he ""realy liked it"", The scene want that special, it was just brutal bullying, no cinematic value whatsoever. The other example he pulled up was the movie ""Memento"" , now thats a very excellent movie which I recommend you should all watch. Thats why I'll wait a few posts to say what I think Gary is trying to say with that symbol, how it applies to him."
"Is he narcissist? I post this https://www.psychforums.com/relationship/topic215521.html about my ex bf some days ago but decided to move on from the matter. Today I met a woman at happy hour, it turned out we dated the same guy!!! What a small world! I thought my ex only messes with women from different neigbourhoods, you know, far less likely get caught or involve in same social circle. I never run into him ever since we broke up. The conversation with this woman piqued my interest in womanizer or player's mindset( someone reponsed to my post said he is, I'm not sure what exactly is womanizer in this age, I have polyamorous friends, but they are very open and honest to all parties and people around them, it's different from this situation). She has totally different impression of him from me, he sounds like a narcissist in her description (I said it more like name calling, not in PD sense, I know nothing about PD, that's why I come here to learn), but I saw him as a clueless and insecure kid screaming for attention. In retrospect, I think I might let our relationship last longer than it should be because I was curious if he has any real personality, he always seems like an empty shell to me. I know, stupid me. But thanks to this conversation, I don't feel angry towards him anymore because it's pointless. we were dating at different universe, he played and married women speaking his love languages, and he mistook me as one of them, while I was trying to show him how to love from a different world that is completely foreign and scary to him. If you have the patience to read the gist of my side of the story with him from the other post. I see him as insecure, secretive, and socially clueless and annoying, though he was very gentle, quiet and sweet when only the two of us toegher. I did love cuddling with him and reading a book together or just playing guitar. He said he can be himself with me. We never fought, never raised voice to each other, he did walk out on me once when I confronted him, but it's not like a fight, I stated my stance very gently. He is very non-confrontal, says sorry a lot (while I'm very firm with my position and boundaries, I don't do it in a pushy way). So it doesn't sound he is a narcissist, right? The woman told me, he acted like he was king of our city, a Casnova. He chased her down the street (I first asked her if he met her this way, she gasped, yes! lol). He mostly texted her and went to her neigbourhood, she never went to his, and never met his friends (I was silently shocked she didn't mind this in dating, but as we compared notes, she got a bit upset said he seemed really like you, so I stopped asking too much of their dating details). They dated a bit then she got annoyed he would flirt with other women, she started to have no string attached sex with him (why women still settle for less when they want more, and they can actually find it elsewhere easily?). He was very flamboyant, fun, and sweet, and got upset when he doesn't get what he wants. So all in all, she said he is a narcissit and hardcore player. I'm a bit puzzled by the different perceptions and different behaviors towards us. Yes, the flirting and chasing women on the street pattern is always there. But when we were dating, he always called, we probably had no more than 10 texts over 4 months. I asked him if he likes texting (before revealing I hated texting), he said he doesn't text. He never acted arrogantly to me, maybe because I always took the wind out his sails whenever he did something superfical, though I did see he appeared like that in front of some people, when he talked to them, it sounds like interrogating. Later when she asked him for hookups, he said he was with someone ( probably me, or with his now wife, the timeline was a bit confusing, that woman dug out the wife's instagram, we found something connecting the dot.) So she stopped contacting him. He contacted her again in August and September! That's when we broke up and just one month before he got married! I kinda feel bad telling her he got married, I hope she don't get bad hangover tomorrow. This woman certainly did a thorough dig of his romance history. She didn't know he got married though because the wife's instagram has no picture of him nor them together. She found out the wife's instagram sometimes ago where there was a picture of them together but somehow she deleted that pic around September, weird. When she showed me all the instagrams of the wife (I wish I had an account to catch this early, but then cheaters are going to be cheaters, what's the point?), I realized the wife was never just a friend all along, she must have been one of the FWB. For him, it's not lying when he said he wasn't seeing anyone, FWB is not gf; It's not lying if he omits some facts, he didn't tell me it was her he went out town in June, it was her he went to the out of town wedding with in July. Clearly the wife had been infatuated with him for a long time, there were so many posts hinted her longing even though there were no pic of him. She follwed every friends (not many) of him, none of them followed her, she followed an account with his name(he doesn't use social network, probably she thought it was him initially). Several posts on the same dates about her inner struggles and love when he and I were out on a date since her moving in, like ""when there is love at least a drop, there is a patient ocean"". On one post she dedicate to her brother, giving him advice on how to love a girl, she wrote: give her all of you, in bits and pieces, despite the thousands of girls you may have entertained before... I'm deeply touched by their true love! Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding is nobody compared to her. I don't feel angry anymore, I have my closure. They deserve each other. I wish they stay married so he can be kept in cage. I'd like to hear real and fake narcissits opinions if he is narcissist - or if you are just a ""womanizer"" or player without PD - and what's in your mind and why do you do it instead of forming genuine loving relationship, long or short, like polyamorous or open relationship? I don't get why people have to sneak around or fake interest for sex or love, in this time and age, people are more tolerant and non-judgmental, you can always find what suits you without lying, cheating and breaking-hearts."

"As Good As It Gets - Melvin Udall (NPD 101) I am not the first to make this observation but just recently rewatched the movie as I remembered liking it as a kid and to my surprise, it dawned on me how good of a portrayal Jack Nicholson´s character is down to perfect detail (all of Nicholson´s mannerisms and expressions). It´s inherently fraught with how messed up the way of thinking is for a covert (plus most likely malignant) narcissist as opposed to neurotypicals and people capable of true empathy. Whoever wrote it is a genius or perhaps JN really put himself into the character, just playing himself (as his whole life and especially recent rapport of him seems to allude to the fact that he might not be far off from being one himself) Melvin Udall is a mug, self-centered, misanthrope of a writer who lives a sheltered life in a world that he has complete control over. It´s over other people that he doesn´t so they are allowed only to play along if they fit the plot. He uses people only to the extent that he needs, (as extremely distanced self-objects) while he goes on in the world looking for a mother(ly) figure. When his character finds it in the form of Helen Hunt, her self becomes moot immediately. She becomes a prop in his life or a sort of trophy for him to adorn his already perfectly miserable life with and already in the movie there are moments where Carol tries to hold Melvin accountable for eroding her sense of self-worth. (She is not blind to it, but is being blinded through flattery and compliments [which Melvin understands is a ticket into her life]. Now this character is not without some redeemable qualities. There are moments in the movie where he seems to actually have sincere positive emotions (shortfelt) but they are mostly from a passive, receptive position and even then his mind is just overactive and keeps narrating his life so much he doesnt really experience it. It all is simply an exceptional illustration of how a narcissist is not actually living in the real world. Being a professional writer of romantic novels, he takes great pride in the fact that he is capable of swooning the girl. And even though he has none of those qualities himself (probably fantasies only), as a narcissist, he still sees himself as the life of the party and the main character in everyone else´s story. He actually spends quite some time in the movie elucidating his lack of emotional understanding of life (some of the things he alludes to are the basic gist of human social interactions or rather shows what his expectations is of how people should behave but he himself is of course superior to all the typical niceties and social cues expected of people. He also often uses projection and calls others out on being a villain when in all reality, he is the one in the wrong. He has all the schemas going on his head and he knows perfectly how the world should work as he is actually going along truly living and breathing other people as props. So it is with his gay artist neighbour who he has berated since the opening scenes. His neighbour who Melvin actually deplores, becomes the secondary supply for Melvin to sustain his newfound relationship with a woman who is obviously struggling and is shown to be in a vulnerable position. He is alive only to the extent of all the narration going on his head, concurrently wearing a mask just as long as it is a good fit for the role he has set out for himself, mirroring and waiting for cues from others to know what his next act should be. (It´s all good as everything goes smoothly along, unless it doesnt after which he will be immediately upset by it and make others around him acutely aware of the fact that he is not pleased with how things are at that moment). He has extreme OCD (which I think quite a few members of this sub-forum do), which is almost like ´magical thinking´ tics. As if he continues on doing them, his world will keep from falling apart. He also seems to be extremely paranoid with how he is perceived by others, to a certain extent, always scanning around (also during his proud moments). Alluding to the fact that he is only there experiencing them if others see it happening. He is of course rude to butlers and any others he deems lesser than him. He puts them down to gain any sort of self-esteem, which remains ever-elusive to him. I could pick any number of scenes from that movie but it just reminded me so much of how narcissists are with their (un-)significant others and the way the movie ends is actually tragic, because his character played his way into this unassuming woman´s life and he knows the right poetic things to say, even if he doesn´t truly feel them. The narcissists truly remains a mere observer in their own life. If anyone would want a an affirmation of really how sad and confined a narcissist´s life experience is, I would recommend this movie. A 10/10. Also, found it hilarious that someone had written a case study on his character and prescribed prozac for the OCD as a couch psych. http://blog.udn.com/joannaliu/224925 “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

"new school of life video Ok wanted to give you guys a chance to express yourself, but let me start then: 1. Maybe the most important point is that society focuses our attention mostly externally, diminishing our own importance. When in fact you should be treating yourself, as if you were the center of the universe. Special and important like that. 2. For that aim self-reflection and self-awareness are essential. Remember, that these are the traits pwNPD lacks. At least be aware of your own limitations, if your not planning to do anything about them. 3. The lifelong process of raising your own awareness is also hightlighted in the video (Jungian 'individuation', acording to him the main aim of life) 4. The importance of unconscious patterns in determining our behavior (Freud)"

"Struggling Hello there I'm not diagnosed with NPD nor have I ever seen any professional about this but I'm struggling and I'll tell you why. When I was much younger I did realise that I am narcissistic. I truly believed that I was superior, more intelligent, better looking and that I deserved more than anyone else. I treated people like $#%^ and I just could never take responsibility for any of my actions. I believed the world owed me a favour and I couldn't understand why it wasn't delivering it to me. Anyway that was years ago and to be honest (until I joined pf) I didn't even know it was a mental health issue. So with this realisation about myself I decided to change. Recently though I think it's reared it's ugly head and I'm thinking that what I may have become is a covert narcissist. It's like all of those traits I had when I was younger are tucked away, hidden inside me in a little bundle. I'm still arrogant but I put a funny spin on it as with all of the other traits. My struggle at the moment is that I think I'm projecting all this onto a work colleague but in my ###$ up head I'm accusing this person of doing the same to me. I can't figure out if it's me, him or even both of us who is afflicted with this. If I have NPD then I have it. But I would absolutely hate to inflict this on another person. Does anyone have any clue as to what to make of this or has it even happened to anyone here. Thank you in advance. England's Glory"

Struggling I also hate the thought that this other person has affected my life so much that this thing has happened to me. I feel like I recognised him as soon as I met him. It was like looking in the mirror and I didn't know why at first. Then as time went by and I saw him more and more I became in denial of this similarity and endeavoured to destroy him. I don't hate myself and I feel no shame or guilt for what I'm doing but if this is all projection then it means I'm seriously ###$ in the head. In my head I see us both as opposite sides of the same coin and I don't even understand what that means. England's Glory
"Struggling I could be projecting here, if so apologize in advance, but we can only relate to others through our own experiences. I can relate to having gotten involved with someone who seemed like my mirror, only to have it turn into a war of destroying each other. If you are a cluster B personality, then that is almost bound to happen at least once as we replay our past, except from the adult position vs the child. Maybe even a few times.

"Struggling Manners73 wrote: It's a war of wills and I don't think anyone's going to win to be honest. Probably not. What came to mind ... For cluster B types their willpower to win at all costs can be their last sense of self-esteem, even if that means ruining a relationship. I don't mean that in a critical way though, it's just what they need to keep on surviving, and can be a useful focus in some situations.

"Attracting people who are Narc Magnets SO I have a problem when making friends with girls (I’m a girl). I constantly make friends with people who fall victim to other female Narcissist friends and ditch me. I must be doing something wrong in my interactions with people to attract those that then attract narcissists, fade me out for the narcs while keeping in mild contact, then realize what’s really going on and come back to me, after which I no longer want or desire their friendship b/c they can’t see what is in my eyes blatant wickedness from normal. Or, worse, the Narc manipulates them in cutting me off, until they cut the Narc off….This has happened to 50% of my female-female friendship from grade school to now. There is NOTHING sexual about this post, I’m just saying this is how I always lose female friends and It’s annoying b/c I’m genuine and a Narc isn’t. I’m straight and Not lesbian (no offending, just clarifying the platonic nature of this post) This is something I'm doing wrong as True Narcs, especially female Narcs, are a few percentage points of the population. I know I'm not supposed to judge people as Narcs but these are people who have at times mentioned they've taken tests for it (albeit online, but they seriously show symptoms) I’m not talking about the pop psycology definition of people who are self-obsessed. I’m talking about the clinical definition, where it’s an iceberg-their need for attention is what you can see, and their lack of human emotions like empathy and sympathy, and grandiose self entitlement and lack of guilt is what really hurts people around them. To a Narc, you are a drug/toilet paper. Their brain chemistry needs your attention, but they resent having to pretend to be ur friends and care about you to get said attention, hence the eventual “discard”—throwing you away all of a sudden like toilet paper, since you were just an object without human emotions to begin with. AND THAT COULD BE WHY THE GUY YOU DATED OR YOUR EX BEST “FRIEND” RANDOMLY GHOSTED YOU! A NARC in hiding! No genuine emotions but a mask of it that became to much burden. Obviously, when you warn them they don’t believe you b/c Narcs are real good at making you feel close to them. I’m a nice person, genuine, empathetic, and people who naturally befriend me seem to be Narc’s target! I guess I have that sweet doll face look going on, I’m pale, I’m short, blah blah LOL But, I’m kinda a tomboy, just don’t look like one. I’m not real good at emotional stuff even though I’m female (INTP?), so obviously I can never win over a charismatic, emotionally intelligent and evil Narc. On a related note, ppl also constantly attempt to scam me. I think b/c of my look, I either A) act tough then nice ppl get turned off by me or B) act nice and normal and scamming attempts ensue. I mean, what should I do? Should I just give up and learn why Narcs are so successful? Are people stupider than I give ppl credit for? Should I find a way to find more street smart people? What am I doing wrong? Is the secret not keeping friends (I lose female friends when they move away or a Narc female get possessive over them), but rather making new ones constantly, on a very superficial level? When I’m a mom, I only suspect it to get worse, as you have to worry about bullying, PTA dynamics, neighborhood mom dynamics, the whole slew! And the narcs always are in the mix of these things! I have a side story to shaI used to attract Narcs until 10 years ago (I was 25 then) when my childhood best friend (“kate”) randomly stopped contact with me, her fiancé of 5 years, and our mutual friends with no explanation, and acted as if she had moved on all of a sudden with 0 remorse. Prior to this our relationship start being more one-sided and she just wanted us to all hear her talk about herself. She could care less what you were going through. She was raised correctly-so sadly, a better mask of fake humanness and more victims. Her fiancé of age 30 tried to commit suicide over this, he was deeply in love with her and a great guy. He ended up failing and is now paralyzed for life. Kate expressed no remorse and later popped up trying to sell her ex-fiance time with her specially trained emotional therapy dog at a 50% discount. she bought a small therapy dog for $3000 to take it to senior centers for attention/narcissistic supply. She let the dog loose in her apartment community after she realized the dog was getting all the attention, not her, and the dog later turned up at the animal shelter and was adopted quickly. Kate then proceeded to join civic volunteer organizations and meetups in the community so she could prey on kind-hearted older married men for validation. Rumor was she broke up 2 marriages. She was the “Community Narcissist” subtype—using community nonprofits as a tool for attention and hunting ground for married males to sleep with for attention. I went to therapy over this ordeal and learned what Narcisissm is and how to spot it/avoid it. The Therapist I saw over this issue, basically gave me a disclaimer that Narcissists/sociopaths can only be diagnosed if they are themselves in front of the therapist. LOL. That's not realistic in most circumstances. BUT, she told me that if kate was a sociopath/narcissist (""Narcopath""), then what happened was Kate was raised right, but brain chemistry wise/or trauma wise, didn't have the full range of human emotions like guilt/empathy/morals, so, being raised right just allowed her to wear a better mask and blend into society better. Then, she turned 25, and decided that wearing the mask all these years was too tiring, and she would just go on and be her true (nonhuman) self. SCARY. I believed the therapist b/c it's not as if Kate got cancer and fell of the face of the earth, she literally did a 180 and popped back up with ZERO remorse, completely healthy and annoyed that everyone was upset with her. Half of her family also got freaked out and cut her off. That was the last I heard of her... Looking back, she was always kinda low on empathy and loyalty and very self-absorbed. I recall her saving a kitten in the middle of the road--she documented her saving it in a series of instagram posts. A total attention tactic. I mean, the kitten could have easily gotten run over while she was photographing it from the curb!?! Needless to say, I'm doing something wrong here, to attract people like that, But the question is, what?"
"Attracting people who are Narc Magnets Your kindof making it into a conspiracy theory I think. The evil ""narc"" is not there to get you. Your just supply to him. And its not you attracting them anyway. You just attract N-Magnets. And belive me such a thing exists. I was an N-Magnet. Narcissist codependant. Self abusive. So my primary relationships were those with narcissists. We just magically found eachother out."
"Attracting people who are Narc Magnets Arguably this thread could be hashed out on the Significant Other, Family and Friends forum. I want to be kind, but ultimately the advice there will tend to turn into 'why are you choosing people who have narcissistic traits?' We can only change ourselves, and if that seems impossible, well of course we cannot change others. Make a list of what you find attractive, because there are attractive traits. Could be an appearance of confidence, life of the party, charming, driven, energetic, they showed you much attention at first, etc. SOs of people with NPD are likely to end up disappointed in the long run. Ask the person with NPD and they will tell you, it is not some malicious intent. You fell for the show version, the idealization. Sometimes people with NPD can be an ideal, for a while, but why... well there is no understanding that but to be NPD. They can't keep up the idealization forever. It is what others approved and fall for, but it's really not malicious that the show collapses eventually. Once you have a list of what is attracting you, then you'll know what to be wary of going forward. Or you can enjoy their personalities for what they are, including the parts that appear later in a relationship. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"Attracting people who are Narc Magnets p.s. @alaskan91 Your post was long and I found it difficult to read, but perhaps your meaning was you tend to attract others who attract Narcissists? If so then just take my previous post and see if you can explain it to them, but... Most people learn by doing, explanations often don't work. They have to go through the experience themselves. It's ironic though. We are often quite content at times that some people are narcissists. Take work as an example. It can be a strength, that personality type that runs or sells the company, from which others benefit. Personally I am of the mindset that if a personality type exists, it's probably because it works in some cases. It's what others approve of in context.

"Attracting people who are Narc Magnets Not an expert on psychology, I can only speak from experience as it seems we have something in common, I also have physical features that don't match with my personality, people think I'm cute and very approachable, but I'm actually very coolheaded and not so feminine. Hopefully I can be of help. Are you actively seeking friends or passively accepting whoever approach you? I'm the kind of introvert who doesn't care about socializing, so I tend to be passive. But if the quality of people approaching you is not good as you mentioned, then maybe try to reach out to people you like unless you are a shy introvert, which might take some effort, but it's not that hard. I often approach strangers when traveling and had made some good friends! What kind of friends you are looking for? Going out or BFF? 1. For going out, it doesn't matter if they are narcissists or not, just enjoy the good time when you are together, don't expect anything more, if a friendship comes out of it, great! Otherwise, at least you have a great time! Say no when you are not comfortable with anything, if they take offense, it's on them, not you. 2.If you are looking for BFF, then look for people share similar temperament and hobbies with you, it's more comfortable and low maintenance. Also accept that people and relationship changes, it's sad, but that's life. I had a childhood BFF whom I cut off several years ago because she has became someone the old her would have despised, I tried to help but she was very nasty towards me, so I had to walk away. Make friends with kind people who have standards. Friends with people very different from you is possible, it takes work, just like any relationships. You have to know your boundaries, be kind, but know that you don't have to live up to other's expectation. It sucks that some people think you are easily manipulated just because you have a friendly face and temperament, that's why it's very importance for people like us to have strong boundaries. It's a painful learning process, but very rewarding. Good luck!"
"Let's play a game Hey everyone, I signed up for this forum because I've been a pretty enthusiastic student of human psychology for most of my life, especially regarding myself. There are many disorders that semi-apply to me: depressive, anxious, OCD, narcissistic, autistic, paranoid, sociopath.... and i was wondering if you all would like to help me diagnose the main character in the popular series ""You"", it's also based on a novel if you want to do some research... the character has these traits: -he's very manipulative -he kills people -he gets easily obsessed and possessive with beautiful women -he's very good at stalking and researching -he has a high amount of empathy and an ability to blend in, the ""nice guy"" So yeah i'm aware this character is not a real person, but if he were a real person, how would you diagnose him? I would guess some combination of narcissist (he always thinks he's saving the girls he's stalking from worse people) and sociopath for obvious reasons, but to be honest i have my beefs with the DSM. Psychologists say the disorders are only supposed to be tools, but if the said disorders are not actually disorders and are just a diverse set of personality characteristics, then how can they even be tools? The problem is compounded by the fact that psychiatric medicine can only questionably treat people's ailments and suffering. Thanks, and glad to be here"
"play Very Serious. Melissophiles catch bees in jars and then shake the jars vigorously to cause the insects to become drowsy and disoriented. The concussed bees are then removed from the jar and placed on the genitals. This typically results in the bee stinging the person. The beesting causes the genitals to swell and become extremely sensitive, increasing the intensity of the ensuing orgasm.

Again, for many patients characterologically, and for all patients in some areas of their personality, the development of self-reflection must precede any attempt at investigating conflict . In the areas where development has been thwarted, the analyst attempts to help a patient change what is classically called ego syntonic to what is classically called ego alien. Thus the enacted ways of being are no longer ""who I am"" but are gradually replaced by the cognitive perspective of ""what I do."" As this change takes place, a person is more able to hold, reflect on, and potentially resolve disjunctive self-experiences as states of conflict without the effort's being automatically short-circuited by dissociative processes designed to protect self-continuity."

Nobody can say for certain who is right. I am talking from experience, and the downside of that is that its subjective. What you call shame I would call self-denial, not accepting your strenghts and weaknesses, gravitating towards an ideal image, ideal self. Becouse the feeling in the strictest sence, shame, I didnt have that, before I cured myself. And thats how they describe the narcissistic personality. Shameless."
"Let’s vent What I see is: Shame results in self-denial. Shame in early childhood results in self-denial of one's true strengths/weaknesses and an ideal, but false, construct takes the place of the child's true personality. Ppl with cluster b disorders started out as children trying to please a demanding, self-centered parent, and it was never enough as the dysfunctional parent kept moving the goal-posts."
"Let’s vent But I had to learn shame. Feeling ashamed. I didnt have shame. I could never do the things I did If I had shame. I dont the answer to this. But what you wrote I agree almost completely. The requirement to be someone else, white rabbit chase, moving the goalposts, It influences your identity immensly. Becouse the need to be loved and accepted is so fundamental, its survival, must be met at any cost, thats why we fragment (reject, disociate) the aspects of ourselves that the parent didnt accept. We construct the false, confabulated, artifical personality to meet our most fundamental need."
"Let’s vent The shame results from the parent's criticism that you're not enough, not satisfying his/her needs. When the parent has the responsibility of meeting a child's physical/emotional needs, the dysfunctional parent doesn't do that-- he/she expects the child to meet his/her needs instead. When the child fails to meet those needs, the child feels shame or guilt. The feeling may not even be remembered at age 2, 3, or 4 but it causes the child to hide it by masking it with an ideal but false image of himself. That ideal self-image could very well be a dissociation or say, a disavowal, of the child's true personality?"

"What is a narcissist anyway? I know what is classed as a one clinically speaking; need for attention, vanity, entitlement (whether overt of covert), excessive self-importance (probably to overcompensate for lack of self-worth) and low to no empathy -- although it will differ. Yet, what exactly is a one? Someone on a different forum who became self-aware about being a vulnerable narcissist described it as feeling like an android who has just realized who and what he is for the first time. When I felt self-aware, and believe me this is going to sound strange, and I don't know if this is due to identity issues or what, but it felt like there was this hidden aspect of myself inside of me, almost like a 'monster' of sorts that was always there with me but I never realized it (please tell me you know the feeling), so I get the whole android analogy. I felt mini-panic during that time, it's less of a fact that you dislike feeling narcissistic rather it completely conflicts with who you really are. I guess I project a lot which is why I never knew before, but when you introspect you know there's something up. So what is it? If someone just told you ""it's required for healthy self-esteem"" for the covert/comp type or for the overt/NPD type it's caused by upbringing or whatever, then that's fair enough but deep down in my own mind, it means something completely different. BDD and vulnerable narcissism/avpd traits. (possible psychotic traits/undiagnosed, or trauma/anxiety(?)"
"What is a narcissist anyway? Yes, how you described your experience captures it perfectly. What I went through after self-awareness was almost completely like that. Although the sad part about is actually that maybe on a cosmic, objective level you might be thought of as innocent in the sense that the lack of awareness was a defense a child’s psyche built as a layer in order to ward off the horrendous nature of the world that was given to him by faulty, abusive parenting. And by that I do mean the less traditional parts of the definition as well, such as neglect, emotional incest, engulfment, parentification, seduction into inappropriate rolls (kind of like trapping). By the time awareness of it as a layer comes in, the hurt and the enormous weight of guilt that narcissist hauls around (acknowledged or not) makes it near impossible to empathize with their own self. If the superego is sadistic, then it has oft been said any recovery is a hopeless cause. When the truth is unsheathed it’s really a horrible realization. When before it seemed like the world just did not agree with you as the main character, suddenly you become implicated as the villain and source of all your woes. And worst of all, you KNOW you deserve every bit of misfortune that comes your way. It’s become a way of life. So in my experience, the narcissist is a true pariah. Now this can be argued but often through their own choosing. How I find some of the better descriptions of a narcissist to be is as someone who has an aversion to Truth. Since their whole cognition is based on a falsehood, their interactions with the world are limited to only the extent of interactions that they accept, i.e how they like to be perceived. As a pw/cNPD I know firsthand how that is congruent with developing strong aspects of AvPD and schizoid traits as well. And when they do actually come to the same leve as everyone else, i.e. when they are not so disconnected from reality through their false selves, they nevertheless are someone who is deeply cynical and disillusioned about life, to the point where they seek either consciously or unconsciously to sow misery and disharmony everywhere they go. A narcissist’s consciousness is actually pruned toward seeking out the potential negatives (initially because the constant state of alarm that their upbringing brought with it to their safety and wellbeing, a constant threat). By adulthood this threat is the baseline for every interaction and becomes constant, because their ego protects a fragile or truly non-existent sense of Self that can by swayed by the least of negative responses. What most every relationship is to a narcissist is essentially a prey or be preyed upon. In this sense anyone with cluster C is by definition predatory in nature because of their affinity to smell out weaknesses and social dynamics in a way as to benefit them, or further their agenda. Therein comes the automaton or android part, because all these machinations become a front for the hollowness/underdeveloped inner life. The person him/herself becomes more and more vacuous as the years pass and anther layer of defense is added. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

"What is a narcissist anyway? Do you know the story of narcissus? He was a beautyful hunter, one day he saw his reflection in a pond and fell in love with himself. All the while ignoring the nymph Echo, who was in love with him. But Echo could only speak back the last words spoken to her. And narcissus was too self absorbed to ever ask, how is she feeling.

Nice source material SelfSerf. Its called narcissistic* personality disorder, not becouse the narcissist is self absorbed or something, no, other people dont exist. Only he exists and has thoughts. Other people are used as objects to be manipulated, to fill the enormous inner emptyness caused by his abusive upbringing. Its not realy he's fault, and he is not conscious of it, he has no self awareness. Its just something that was done to him, before he could remember. the pwNPD was forced to make a choice, to feel safe and secure he was forced to hide behind this false self, false ego, idealized self-image, whatever you want to call it, to cope with the world he entered."

"Help & Advice Ok, this is over the last 8 years and the last 3 have been getting far worse. I must admit I always thought it was me, however in the last few weeks I have been reading up on NPD and Sociopaths and Disorders and the NPD stuff I have been reading, I just look at it and think ""thats Her, she does that"" and ""thats me, the victim"", not a survivor yet as I am still with her.... So here is the gist of it and yes I am booked for counselling although im looking at the EXIT door as I don't think things will change..... She has suffered from childhood, abusive father, controlling, she is Bullemic, Then various boy friends and husbands abused her mentally and physically (apparently as I only hear this from her), she is the victim and has a lot of ex's(loads in fact) all had issues (apparently).... She has sexual issues, Sex is just for gratification and she regularly will have an affair and fling or an extra boyfriend, when caught out its not her fault. Se has relationship issues. She has food issues (bulimia). She has control issues and has to be in control and when the isn't you can see in her face its all going wrong and she is getting anxious. She is a pathological liar and even when caught out she says she will change and sobs forgiveness however the lies continue. She is manipulative, She is outgoing and the soul of the party, She attracts men like bees to honey, she flirts in front of me constantly, she is as jealous as hell about me and has a rage that goes with this. If it's going wrong for her she is overwhelmed and makes me feel guilty or pushes me away. She will toss me aside every six months or so and then beg to have me back like i'm on a yoyo or being flushed down the toilet constantly. She has a therapist - apparently its HER therapist (like its HER house, HER car, HER friends and HER Family) and we cannot see him together as its unethical as agains its HER therapist - My view on this is he has no clue as to her problems (3 years now) and she lies to him like everyone else. She Lies to friends and family and has a grander attitude but also plays a vulnerable part very well. She never says sorry or apologises and if she is in a corner just goes quiet, then after thought a day or so later comes back with a tiny point and magnifies this and now its all my guilt as my fault. Im constantly put down in many ways and she hardly ever uses the words I Love You, she says she is scared and cannot open up. She also convinced me that her infidelity is just her and I have to live with it or leave. I constantly feel like I am treading on eggshells with her. One time when in a corner and it all looked like she was going to implode she accused me of raping her when we were on holiday, which was a complete lie and threw me into turmoil as I didn't see anything like that coming. I'm not sure she is npd as I am no expert but like a say when I read up on it (2 books from amazon and a load of internet articles) all is see is 70% of what I read is her to a tee. I wrote to her and expressed everything I had been going through over the last year and she has agreed to see a joint counsellor (but not HERS) however she also agreed to stop lying and hurting me and that lasted about 1 day. So I will be seeing a counsellor in the next few weeks, just needed to type this up and ask what people how know about NPD think of all the above (there is a load more but thats the gist of it)....... Thanks Anonymous"
"Help & Advice Arguably this belongs on the SOF&F forum, and I am going to link it there, but here is the thing (and I mean this in a kind way)... The idea that we can 'fix' someone else who has many issues is also a form of narcissism, and a grandiose belief. The big turn around comes when we stop trying list what is wrong with someone else, and turn that into 'why am I doing this?' I think speaking with a counselor is a great start. If he or she is any good, eventually the topic will get turned around into why are you involved?, what were you hoping to get out of it? why did you hang in there? Is fixing about control?

"Help & Advice Thanks, I didn't realise I had posted in the wrong forum, sorry about that.... Well I do love her so I guess if she could be fixed then that would be good, She has again asked for help so i'm going to see a counsellor to discuss and then we will see one together To be honest (and thank you for your kind words) I really don't think she can be fixed, after looking at all the last 8 years and previous history I think its as the films use the words FUBAR However I'm willing to give her the chance as she does deserve that from me, hence the counselling etc And I dont think I could fix her at all, I think a counsellor who specialises in her problems may be able to help her but unless (my belief) she realises its ""her"" then I cannot see her changing at all in the long term"
"narcissist fluctuations in mood Hi all, been posting a lot lately mainly out of wanting to understand myself and hopefully share with others. This is something about having this that's probably the thing that bothers me the most (I really mean that it's horrible). After all the years of wondering why I have mood swings now I know. People with this supposedly have mood swings related to attention/lack of attention, introspection, external life events etc. I guess this applies more to the compensatory type but could also extend to all types as well. Take from online: ""Alternates between feelings of emptiness and deadness and states of excitement and excess energy [Forman]"" ""The average person high in the trait of narcissism, Dawood and Pincus argue, isn’t particularly likely to become depressed, but should depressive feelings set in, they would be experienced as plain sadness. The person high in pathological narcissism, by contrast, should be subject to feelings of a particular kind of depression “characterized by anhedonia [feeling empty and useless], feelings of worthlessness, nihilism, and boredom with life."" The Penn State researchers believed that those high in pathological narcissism, with its dependence on feeling important, would show variations in mood corresponding to their perceptions of whether other people were recognizing and applauding them. These variations should occur on a bigger scale than the normal variations in mood most people feel. Those high in pathological narcissism should also show greater emotional lability, or more frequent variations in positive and negative moods."" What goes up must come down and I mean that describes me to a T, most of the time shame, emptiness/lack of feeling, self-loathing (collapsing) thoughts, and sadness dominates my day, bar the short time I can okay about what's going on. Sometimes I'll be smiling, next minute slightly tearful, others irritable, edgy, stoic, down on my self, resentful, depressed etc. It's not as severe as in bpd, more like a mild case of the emotion fluctuations and not as intense but it's more emotionally liable than people who have very little to no narcissism, apparently anyway, from what I now know. Just how coverts will present in therapy for depression but leave as soon as the therapist validates them and sorts out there problems (which probably aren't as bad as they think inside their heads, it's easily to be down when your always absorbed in your own thinking and can't regulate that image of yourself in your head easily). What are your thoughts, and how the hell do you deal with this? BDD and vulnerable narcissism/avpd traits. (possible psychotic traits/undiagnosed, or trauma/anxiety(?)"
"narcissist fluctuations in mood The quote is funny, since oen of the most prominent explanations of depression is a narcissistic one, namely that you are devaluing an iedalized object and due internal repercussions you take the devaluation onto yourself. Freud describes this mechanism in Mourning and Melancholia 90 years ago. So while on the toplevel I think the distinction is funny, there is no explanation here why there would be emptiness and so on in pwNPD. But all these thigns seem rather close together anyways, Meltzers explanation of cyclothymic states for example is also about idealized objects but afair there it was about triumph over them or the lack thereof (?). In any event, mood swings as whole seem to depend mostly on unconscious splitting - which is also why they cant just be put away, because the reasons for the splitting and the inner objects its pointed at isnt usually in your consciousness. You could argue as a person prone to ego-fragmentation questions of idealization and devaluation are not really my concern. But dealing with this is I would assume done in longterm therapy, as there is no dealing with this in any other way. The mechanism always splits botht he self and the object and your ability to deal with the whole is therefore hampered. dx: SPD"

"What do you think of this? This is a very important article. I agree that the term narcissist is wildly overused nowadays. The fact that most studies on the prevalence of NPD estimate only 0.5-1% actually have the disorder shows that the chances you are in a relationship with one aren't especially high. But, I was thinking about this the other day. Wouldn't it be fair to say that the rate of NPD varies dramatically between different families? For example, if there really is one narcissist in a given family, the chances are far greater that there will be other disordered individuals within that same family. As NPD originates in large part from dysfunctional parenting, it would be fair to say that a dysfunctional, disordered parent would possibly produce a son or daughter who grows up with a personality disorder also and their siblings may suffer the same. Then, there is the question of how much genetics play a role in the development of NPD and other personality disorders? As not all children raised by disordered parents will become disordered themselves. And similarly, not all children who are abused go on to become murderers or pedophiles. It is widely accepted by psychologists/psychiatrists that it takes both nature and nurture to create individuals with PDs and other pathologies. So yes, the term narcissist is way overused and the actual disorder is pretty rare (1 in 100 people at most), but the disorder and other PDs probably group together at quite a high rate within particularly dysfunctional families (that's my theory anyway!). I have - High functioning autism, OCD (episodic), social anxiety and depersonalization/derealization disorder Expect I may have - Avoidant/schizoid personality disorder or traits"

"What do you think of this? Good article that points out that narcissism is not a simple you have it, or you don't matter. What is also messy is that people may outwardly appear to be similar, even if their underlying motives are very different. I am going to make a generalization, a story, it's also a simplification - A.) You disagree with what I learned, I am special/entitled, I learned I was special/entitled, I am right. B.) You disagree with what I learned, I am valueless except for what I do for others, I must fight back, I am right. Outwardly it appears the same, but the motives are very different. Even more murky is that some narcissism probably is healthy, but then again so is having a desire to eat food, to have sex, to compete, etc. Is there an I eat too much to the point of being ill, my life has gotten into trouble due to sex, have I lost my friends and loved ones being overly competitive, etc.?

I suspect a number of people with ""NPD"" or pathological narcissism may in fact have an OCD component that complicates diagnosis. OCD is the great masker, it morphs to fit any preconceived idea its host has and its tentacles can seep into every aspect of that person, forcing a square peg to seem like it fits into a round hole. So if you have narcissistic defenses or tendencies, OCD can make them seem much more dire, pathological, and extreme than they really are--it amplifies everything 10x. Just my opinion. The redeeming thing about this is that OCD is more treatable (in theory) than NPD. So even if one is prone to narcissism, the OCD makes it 10x worse and when the latter is treated or addressed somehow, the narcissism may become far less disabling."

Did your shame/anxiety manifest itself once you became more self aware of your NPD tendencies? For me, it's always been there, I think. Even before I knew anything about NPD or my possible tendencies. I can distinctly remember moments of my childhood of this anxiety; for example, there was a time in HS where I did well on a test. I congratulated myself in my mind, and then the thought popped in my head that I was better than everyone in the class. That thought was followed by extreme anxiety; even now, I can get a little anxious just thinking about it. I do agree about the OCD though. When I'm anxious/ruminating about another ""theme"" other than NPD, my belief that I have NPD is less of a problem. So I know that there is an aspect of my OCD that is amplifying my worries. xdude wrote: Interesting question. I get misleading messages though.

"Dealing with injuries, and emptiness I feel empty a lot of the time. It's particularly exacerbated by being out in the world and not being noticed, not having the glass of admiration filled up. If I'm not being admired or noticed, I often feel worthless and nonexistent. I then do space/numb out, which makes it even worse, and I panic and scramble for anyone to notice me and pay attention to me. I then feel/become even more ignored and get very angry, so then I lash out as a desperate last-ditch attempt to get attention. Rinse and repeat. People really do ignore me when I'm in these states, so it's self-defeating, but maybe it's my mind's attempt to teach myself that I don't really need their attention. I'm still alive and relatively healthy without it. I know pwBPD numb out or disconnect a lot of the time. Maybe it's what's happening to me, or maybe it's a form of narcissistic deflation/depression when the False Self isn't reassured. It's worthlessness, a feeling of not existing and not being important to the world. But unlike pwBPD, I guess the emptiness isn't overwhelming enough to self-harm. I've never in my life cut or did any other explicit physical self-harm. I'm too scared. I've taken a knife to my skin or stomach when I've been upset, but could never force myself to make a deep cut, out of fear of seriously injuring myself or dying, combined with a narcissistic aversion to hurting myself or creating aesthetically unpleasing scars."

Definition of DP/DR: Depersonalization-derealization disorder occurs when you persistently or repeatedly have the feeling that you're observing yourself from outside your body or you have a sense that things around you aren't real, or both. Feelings of depersonalization and derealization can be very disturbing and may feel like you're living in a dream. Symptoms of depersonalization include: Feelings that you're an outside observer of your thoughts, feelings, your body or parts of your body — for example, as if you were floating in air above yourself Feeling like a robot or that you're not in control of your speech or movements The sense that your body, legs or arms appear distorted, enlarged or shrunken, or that your head is wrapped in cotton Emotional or physical numbness of your senses or responses to the world around you A sense that your memories lack emotion, and that they may or may not be your own memories Symptoms of derealization include: Feelings of being alienated from or unfamiliar with your surroundings — for example, like you're living in a movie or a dream Feeling emotionally disconnected from people you care about, as if you were separated by a glass wall Surroundings that appear distorted, blurry, colorless, two-dimensional or artificial, or a heightened awareness and clarity of your surroundings Distortions in perception of time, such as recent events feeling like distant past Distortions of distance and the size and shape of objects Episodes of depersonalization-derealization disorder may last hours, days, weeks or even months at a time. In some people, these episodes turn into ongoing feelings of depersonalization or derealization that may periodically get better or worse. I have - High functioning autism, OCD (episodic), social anxiety and depersonalization/derealization disorder Expect I may have - Avoidant/schizoid personality disorder or traits"
"Dealing with injuries, and emptiness Out of curiosity if you have derealisation do you also have memory impairment problems? Like you are looking into your fridge but can't remember how stuff got in there or you can#t say which month or season it is?

"Dealing with injuries, and emptiness Mkay. I'm not sure what you are describing is the same thing. I have actual memory holes, so I really cant figure out where a milk bottle on the table comes from, or I will walk to the cupboard, take out a scarf, being convinced it is winter, and then realizing its summer and 24°C outside. Also in these attacks I feel certain emotions that are absolutely without any connection to anything, they seem to be complex situational emotions but I never have a clue what they mean. In addition my midn seems to be half asleep or something, I have memory fragments of stuff and I dont know if its from the dreamworld or from reality. Its not provoking huge amounts of anxiety, but its certainly a rather scary thing that has luckily always gone away by itself after a few hours.

"How do you control underlying feelings of intense anger Hi all, need some help here and I don't think Google is much help. I feel kind of bad/uncomfortable admitting this online, even on an NPD forum, but it's something I fear is getting worse (superego not controlling desires?) and despite being a good guy sometimes I'm afraid this will turn into a bomb. Every now and then, mainly if someone said something to me, or I feel resentment towards someone else for having something I don't (this is been getting worse as of late and it's killing me) I feel cold-blooded anger (and other people can probably see) behind my eyes. This doesn't really ever erupt into an explosion but instead this internalized anxiety and 'quiet' rage. I am scared, scared of what I am (vulnerable type) and scared of having these feelings which I apparently don't have much control over. I've seen that look in my eyes in my reflection, it's down right bone-chilling, and I need to do something about this. Tell me you know the feeling. If someone had a severe case of narcissism (not me) and was self-aware, where would they even go for immediate help for it if they knew it was coming?? Example, in my town (uk) there is an outpatient mental health place which I've been to recently for other issues, but the waiting list is almost a year long, if someone knew this was coming this clearly wouldn't be a solution so what would be? Doubt my gp/doc would know much about it. Just a question I had. How do you get over the feeling? . I want help for this but there is nowhere really to go, expect maybe seek help in the local loony bin (which is actually apparently a really nice place) but this isn't ideal and can be resolved in easier ways.

"How do you control underlying feelings of intense anger Anger is a normal reaction in which your system tells you you are unsatisfied with something and tries to drive you towards changing it. I am angry at all the non-diagnosed assholes being on the forum for example. I gut it, you are all hoooorribly mentally ill and suffer every second of your pathetic lifes. But almost none of you is diagnosed with the disorder this forum is made for. Its extremely annoying. Its like being on a cancer forum and then people show up who self-diagnosed with cancer and some of them have taken magical drugs and have special insights from other dimensions into the types of cancer they have and they got spontaneously cured! O.M.F.G. What a ######6 loonie bin. Why should I have an issue with the anger about this? its your fault! Change #####&. You see? if unlike me you are blessed with being able to actually feel your emotions then learn to tolerate them.

You are feeling your emotions or you wouldn't get so upset by relatively small things. Anger is a strong emotion; it seems that your issue is not being able to reasonably deal with them. @OP Stop focusing on it. You're worried about this and so you think about it more. It's like fat people on diets; they shouldn't focus on food, so they go on a diet and spend the whole time focusing on what they're eating. It's counter-productive and most of them fail. We need stuff to focus on. If you provide yourself with a lot, then you will prioritise and focus on what's important. If you give yourself a little, you will focus intently on that. Our brains can't process negatives. If you want an example; do not think of a giraffe. Now that you have a picture of a giraffe in your head, realise that telling yourself ""not"" to be or do something is pointless. Instead, focus on other activities, ones that create a change in environment. Get some exercise, take up a hobby, get a job...do something positive for yourself. Your mind will focus on the more stimulating activities and a few months from now you'll notice the change. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."

Other emotions - nothing whatsoever. I also cant remember how it was originally, as this switched off at some point.

"How do you control underlying feelings of intense anger Ooohh boy, this really hit home and I could talk about anger for ages. I hope you respond so I don't feel ignored or like I'm wasting my time. Lately I've honestly been feeling like I'm wasting most of my time on this forum because people usually rarely even acknowledge what I say/respond. Makes me feel dumb and even more worthless, tbh. Okayyyy, now that that's outta the way... My anger, and often rage, is often intense and barely (or not at all) controllable and containable, like I'm on the verge of just going apeshit on everyone. Usually it is triggered by unmet and entitled expectations. I was just at the grocery store and a guy that was 100% my type ""failed"" to notice me, or simply wasn't into me (my default assumption). I was extremely angry, almost to the point of rage. Often it extends into full-blown rage, but I am trying to distract myself, painful as it is. I am still very angry and upset when I think about it. I think there is a major distinction between anger and rage. Rage is a very primitive reaction, like what you describe. My eyes often become animalistic. I feel it in my eyes and others IMO clearly see it because they avoid me big time in those states and I want to lash out at anyone and any living thing nearby. Everyone is a target and I feel like I could do anything, even to the point of homicide. Luckily, I have never killed or seriously injured anyone, but I feel like it's a matter of time if I don't get it under control. It's like I ""split"" the entire human race black when I'm in those states. While anger is a more reactive and rational response to a perceived injustice or as an externalized form of frustration to protect the ego, I think the rage results in large part from dysfunctional object relations and a feeling of being devalued in comparison to the other. For example, when I was ignored by the guy today, I felt absolutely convinced he had the upper hand, and since I have poor object relations, I extrapolated this to ALL people who are my type never being interested in me, feeling worthless, etc. My self-esteem and is so heavily dependent on what other people think of me that rage is a natural consequence. I've never been a chronically angry person until the last ~ 5 or so years, and it's pretty terrible. Not only does it affect your feelings about and relationships with others, but it literally is physically very unhealthy, releasing large amounts of cortisol and literally making you age faster and more prone to mental and physical illness. I would strongly suggest you see a therapist to work on this. I am seeing one (the method is called transference focused psychotherapy). I can't speak for you so I'm not saying you are a ticking time bomb, but I think I was/am one unless I work on this."
"How do you control underlying feelings of intense anger Covertunsure I get the whole ""refusing to look at me"" thing, I think it's more of a social skills thing though, some people may greet/glance at anyone near the person they are talking to, others won't. Best advice I can give is to just get used to it, they may not have meant anything by it, and if one dude/gal doesn't look at you (or me) it's not the end of the world, don't let 'em get under your skin. I mean if you weren't looking at someone, just casually no biggie, and they started to get really angry you'd probably think they were just overreacting. Also, your writing style is very articulate and you seem quite informed about these things, I'll give you that. BDD and vulnerable narcissism/avpd traits.

"Collapsing Anyone ever lose all (the dreaded phrase) - *sources of supply*. I´ve felt for more than a year (when I quit my job) as if there is no-one and no cause left to idealize out there so I didn´t really know where to go there. I have a total lack of internal sense of motivation (dysthymia) hence I also lack belief in shifting focus somewhere and reinventing myself since that seems an impossible feat. Esspecially now that I´ve been driving people I´ve known longest in my life further and further away. Don´t have the ego-strength nor the inherent will to charm my way into a new group of people. Nowadays it feels like my life is a wide awake nightmare and that´s when I consider hospitalization but what is keeping me from admitting myself anywhere is I don´t think I would bounce back from that. There are legit days now where I feel like am so paranoid am going to explode and am having difficult keeping the mask on for even daily errands. The crappy part is my paycheck comes from a job that requires me to objectify myself even further. I kind of know, it´s just full on riding on adrenaline. I´ve begun freaking people out for sure... I stopped going to therapy like a year ago when things got more than devious and malignant, i.e. feeling inherently ""evil"" (because manipulation became conscious and I actually started calculating my next steps, instead of in a subconscious manner. So that I couldn´t even face my therapist without my mind (or inner critic) going beserk on me and telling me to make a run for it from her office. Coincidentally looking back it feels like she was my last straw to the real world. Someone here once wrote that once you delve into the realm of psychopathy, your mind will never let up. It´s been a year of feeling like Gollum/Smeagol now and I can´t accept there is no going back. I´ve totally lost the plot. Sad thing is my rational mind knows there isn´t even if I want to remain ignorant of it in a childlike way. Going off the adage, I´ve been feeding the wrong wolf and he´s grown into a beast the size I can´t handle. I don´t believe any therapy will ever help because last time I got my hopes up to try a new therapist I was almost too paranoid to sit in the same room with her. Basically I feel like crawling into a hole curling up and dying because there is nobody left to turn to. I don´t see anything being improvd by my existence. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Collapsing I could have written most of that myself, chilling, I don’t feel like I’m turning malignant in any way though. If I lost my job for some reason, I’d either be locked up or most likely dead within a year, I have no doubt about it. You need a purpose in life, any purpose is better none. You sound like you are the grips of a deep depression, the dark thinking could easily be attributed to that, the hardest part to breaking out of it is dragging yourself outside and doing something, but it’s the most crucial step as well."
"Collapsing Self-diagnosing oneself with an illness one thinks is incurable has always been in fashion on this forum for the people who didnt have the balls to change something about their situation. Kind of understandable maybe, you would have to change a lot of stuff probably, your housing situation being one of the foremost, your job might be another one. But if you want to push the first steps away all the time, rushing back into your inner world of self accusations until youre an old man, suit yourself. dx: SPD"
"Collapsing I obviously still also have the tendency of writing out a sentence and not finishing the thought. What I meant to write connected to the notion of adrenaline was that my job as a courier is essentially running on adrenaline and dopamine most of the time. Otherwise it´s a really rough getting going. If I´m not sharp and wired once I throw on the backpack, I think it might be for me to get into an accident as there are legit times when I kind of phase out and become foggy on the bike cruising through traffic. The other end of that is that after some time of going intensely, am so overwired I legitimately lose the sense of danger. When I´ve got on the steed in a somewhat vulnerable state, being amidst cars actually felt somewhat frightening, so as to counteract that, I just numb myself out (overstimulate) and go all buckwild insane pedalling amidst cars. Am sure it can´t be good for a fragile brain to be in a near-constant state of fight-or flight (I know am the hypervigilant style). Other than for the reason that it´s easy, uncommited earning, it´s almost like I´ve chosen this line of work just so to prove myself am not who I am. A part of me thinks I should quit caffeeine and try to actually settle down with but I don´t really wanna stop as I like the constant action. And am afraid of feeling even lesser-than once I do that. In order to keep up with earning tantalizing amounts of money (that I´ve ramped myself up for), I treat my body as just an object (I´ve read this as being somewhat common for NPD) to get around which leads me to treat other people like objects as well. I guess it doesn´t help that a large amount of time it also entails often going into malls (which I absolutely abhor). Just a mass of mindless people spending their leisure time by consumption. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

But if you want to push the first steps away all the time, rushing back into your inner world of self accusations until youre an old man, suit yourself. Ouch, a rough but honest one from you there. The thing is, my ASPD traits are so augmented nowadays and my self-esteem so low that I find it very difficult to actually socialize with new people, let alone find a new job. The housing situation is actually in a rough place both ways because I am situated between two cities. If am not staying with my dad (pw cNPD) The place I currently rent a room at is in a student town and the house is known as a kind of communal housing. The rent is sort of cheap, it´s a shared apartment and it drawns in people from other countries and those only looking to rent for a short while. It has the benefits of random parties and joviality but lately I´d rather avoid those as I´ve actually disliked the spontaneity The way I´ve rationalized it was to have more options available just going inbetween towns but I´ve noticed being inbetween two cities is not helping in the least due to the lack of object constancy (I´ve started noticing this for the past year more and more how it takes me a while to sort of ´warm up´ again towards people). I genuinely seem to forget them and our history together. Then again, it´s also been a way of keeping others at a distance. I And that has been fine by me as if I´m not here, there is no way they can get close and find out what a bummer I can really be. But it works the other way as well. People I´ve met, friends I´ve made in the other town I´ve become estranged from as well. Largely because of this newfound awareness of not being like others (in a bad way), i.e. capable of real friendship, I´ve alienated others. Before it used to be in a good way, i.e. thinking I was special. These self-attacks actually stem from realizing what a negative influence I can have on others and not seeing myself as being able to contribute in a worthwhile way. The other place I am currently housed entails living in a communal apartment with a shared WC and kitchen, which is not ideal, as the tenants change often due to the nutjob of a landlord. It´s owned by a sociopathic couple, and the landlord and her husband have a record of shady real estate businessing, skinning people to the very last cent, evading taxes and even having actual physical confronted previous tenants. I took it as my a mission for a while to undermine their rule but it´s more-so a delusion of mine to think that one is able to. I´ve somewhat relished the drama of hassling with them but I know they would kick people out of the house in a heartbeat for the smallest of disagreements. I guess it doesn´t help my fight or flight situation in the least to know that there is are such misers breathing down your neck all the time “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

' The ways I´ve dealt with being depressed as a child were a sort of turning away from the world , giving up on society´s expectations of what makes a successful human being in our society, but then cloaking that innerly held standard of necessary ambitoun into some false sense of self-appointed goals that carry little relation to what the world around me is doing, i.e. what they call the narcissistic bubble. I´ve avoided popping this so long and then a year ago I truly understood what a construct I´ve made for myself. Issue is I have not developed the skills to actually cope with life in any other way, I just design a new bubble to subsist in and now that I realized what party my ASPD traits (that I probably always had but never acknowledged that much) have played in that, I understand that I haven´t ever truly cared to see it any other way. Currently the bubble I am in right now consists of me not doing much meaningless with my time because I am severly depressed I just bide it. And it´s tough because this bubble of isolation is making me shift further into the dissocial realm. I see people I used to consider friends (really I see how they were sadly just supply to me, people I either idealized and hoped aligning with would somehow enhance my life) going on with their life and actually living and it just ######6 depresses me further because I feel like I just don´t have it in my constitution. All this severe isolation I wen throught as a child/teenager hasn´t really allowed developing proper interest in others anda large percentage of my reaching out to people I´ve faked through the years. The few friends that have stuck around to see my shitshow are not often available so it´s just a bummer. Oh wells. As far as being allowed to be happy...I barely know how to relate to that. I feel some form of but it´s just constant agitation. Which is pretty much baseline. Recently I built this this thing for common use in the shared apt house that I live in. And for that 3-4 minutes after a guy who lives in the house validated me for doing so, I felt something (or blatantly, my ego felt this strong positive emotion from an odd power-trip construct [I AM STILL CAPABLE of winning people over] but that is like 5 minutes vs the 5hours that I spent struggling and building that $#%^. None of that just seems like it´s worth it to me these days) Am probably at a low point because the seasons are changing (and I knew I would feel like this), there is barely any sun and it´s all of a sudden cold as ###$ and I keep relapsing with porn every few weeks (drives me way down to nihilistic land) truly feel like I´d be better off dead. It´s just that the way people handle when $#%^ like this hits (seasons changing are hardly true hardship) is that they lean on eachother. They do stuff together, feel some sort of communion and joy from being around others and sharing their lives. And I feel very strongly about how I am not capable of this at the very least. I abhor being around people because nowadays Ive had to resort to being the fakes I´ve ever been to myself. At least back when I used to believe my own $#%^ I was not critical of how I acted, it still probably seemed odd to others. I often just abhor my own existence and it´s just all meaningless. /Woe is me Maybe I should just start building more random $#%^ and bringing change into the material world.

' The ways I´ve dealt with being depressed as a child were a sort of turning away from the world , giving up on society´s expectations of what makes a successful human being in our society, but then cloaking that innerly held standard of necessary ambitoun into some false sense of self-appointed goals that carry little relation to what the world around me is doing, i.e. what they call the narcissistic bubble. I´ve avoided popping this so long and then a year ago I truly understood what a construct I´ve made for myself. Issue is I have not developed the skills to actually cope with life in any other way, I just design a new bubble to subsist in and now that I realized what party my ASPD traits (that I probably always had but never acknowledged that much) have played in that, I understand that I haven´t ever truly cared to see it any other way. Currently the bubble I am in right now consists of me not doing much meaningless with my time because I am severly depressed I just bide it. And it´s tough because this bubble of isolation is making me shift further into the dissocial realm. I see people I used to consider friends (really I see how they were sadly just supply to me, people I either idealized and hoped aligning with would somehow enhance my life) going on with their life and actually living and it just ######6 depresses me further because I feel like I just don´t have it in my constitution. All this severe isolation I wen throught as a child/teenager hasn´t really allowed developing proper interest in others anda large percentage of my reaching out to people I´ve faked through the years. The few friends that have stuck around to see my shitshow are not often available so it´s just a bummer. Oh wells. As far as being allowed to be happy...I barely know how to relate to that. I feel some form of but it´s just constant agitation. Which is pretty much baseline. Recently I built this this thing for common use in the shared apt house that I live in. And for that 3-4 minutes after a guy who lives in the house validated me for doing so, I felt something (or blatantly, my ego felt this strong positive emotion from an odd power-trip construct [I AM STILL CAPABLE of winning people over] but that is like 5 minutes vs the 5hours that I spent struggling and building that $#%^. None of that just seems like it´s worth it to me these days) Am probably at a low point because the seasons are changing (and I knew I would feel like this), there is barely any sun and it´s all of a sudden cold as ###$ and I keep relapsing with porn every few weeks (drives me way down to nihilistic land) truly feel like I´d be better off dead. It´s just that the way people handle when $#%^ like this hits (seasons changing are hardly true hardship) is that they lean on eachother. They do stuff together, feel some sort of communion and joy from being around others and sharing their lives. And I feel very strongly about how I am not capable of this at the very least. I abhor being around people because nowadays Ive had to resort to being the fakes I´ve ever been to myself. At least back when I used to believe my own $#%^ I was not critical of how I acted, it still probably seemed odd to others. I often just abhor my own existence and it´s just all meaningless. /Woe is me Maybe I should just start building more random $#%^ and bringing change into the material world. At least that way I have something to show for my time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWejItJsyhQ Just wanted to say, I relate to a lot of this and you’re not alone. I feel like people don’t like the real covertunsure, they like the facade and part I act out. Last night, I went to a meetup I’ve been going to for a few months. People were laughing at my jokes and I felt like one of the lives of the party. But the entire time, I was thinking, “boy, if only these idiots knew how evil, narcissistic, and angry I am. I hate playing a part, but that’s the only way I can feel perfect and whole. I have no ability to like myself while acknowledging I’m not perfect. Consequently, I’m always miserable out in the world, where I’m constantly confronted with the reality of not being perfect, and I get extremely angry and agitated and get suicidal and homicidal thoughts."

Of all the defenses against lack of attention or whatever, this is the worst. BDD and vulnerable narcissism/avpd traits. (possible psychotic traits/undiagnosed, or trauma/anxiety(?)"
"Paranoia? Yes, i can definitely identify with this problem. I just read the ""Paranoid phenomena and pathological narcissism"" link and this sentence particularly resonated with me: ""Tragically, being gripped by the paranoid condition and its manifest delusional system is the only kind of security that the paranoid patient knows."" I would indeed feel lost without my paranoia because I have become so accustomed to it as a form of self-defence and self-preservation. I was bullied and ostracized at school and I became paranoid and defensive in response to the repeated rejections from my peers. I would trust people were my friends and then hear from other people they were being two-faced and didn't really like me etc. It feels much safer to assume the worst in everybody in case I am let down yet again. This is why I also find myself very uncomfortable when somebody appears to genuinely take a liking to me because, for one, I don't believe I am worthy or deserving of positive treatment, and secondly, I eagerly anticipate the inevitable moment they will turn on me. It is a vicious cycle, a self-fulfilling prophecy, where I am uptight and defensive, avoid eye contact, avoid any kind of commitment to anybody through fear of the uncertainty of how they will treat me in the future. And of course, this gives people a negative impression - I am ""aloof"" and ""disinterested"" etc, etc. And then people's negative response to me just goes to confirm the paranoia which governs all of my negative non-verbal signals towards others! I have - High functioning autism, OCD (episodic), social anxiety and depersonalization/derealization disorder Expect I may have - Avoidant/schizoid personality disorder or traits"
"Paranoia? I think what Ubinix points out is correct, this is more about internalizing, taking stuff personally, being reminded of that one feels worthless or not understood or not seen and then becoming angry about it - in that process then possibly distorting the cognition even more due to splitting, fragmentation and the like. I asked my neighbours for a favor for example and they didnt reply back. It didnt create any immediate problem cause I could remedy the situation myself without their help but I was angry at them for a while and was convinced they would have forgotten me intentionally, while in fact they had done so accidentally because of stress at work and health problems or family that arose unexpectedly. I think this connects to a lot of the neglect etc. I've been experiencing as a kid, so there are misunderstandings that are based on certain cognitive schemas one might [unconsciously] have about oneself [and others]. Technically though I dont think this classifies as paranoia, but is the opposite of it. Paranoia is when you feel watched, judged, persecuted by people (or even things) because of unconsciously projecting self-evaluation. Contrary to that, as Ubinix said, the sales people etc examples here seems more about taking stuff in . dx: SPD"

This is something I'm working on really hard lately because the emotion I feel comes out as absolute fury to the point where I feel like my heads going to pop.

I do think it manifests for me in an almost psychotic-like state where I'm almost convinced the other person is trying to undermine or slight me, to the point where it affects my ability to be rational. Is it like this for you or is it a more measured, strategic approach of retaliation or introspection or self-/other-criticism and devaluation? When I first started driving at 16, I'd get road rage when someone cut me off and I assumed they were trying to undermine ME, it was all about ME, and I was absolutely compelled to get them back and ""win.""

No, when they appear. From my perspective you have quite the wishy washy approach to your mental health atm and eventhough you are an expert in staring at and obsessing about certain stuff that does not seem to translate to you really looking at it clearly. I assume sooner or later your therapist (or parts of yourself even) is going to point you towards becoming more aware of your defensive maneuvers and possible triggers. That is most effective when it happens on a moment-to-moment basis, or in realtime so to speak. Rare moments of change-inducinginsight are in my experience depending on resonance between your ability to look clearly and to see the connections clearly. So having an accurate understanding of the concepts can be rather helpful to have in the back of your mind. dx: SPD"
Arrogance... I've been called arrogant before but it was when I was younger and I didn't even know what it meant. I must say that I couldn't fault myself until I got to about 25 years old and realised I'm not as great as I thought I was. This was one of the best realisations of my life as it was when I really started to learn. I'm still arrogant though and I think I always will be. I believe it's a personality trait but I keep it well hidden and I don't make other people feel like $#%^ because of it anymore. Are you arrogant and how does this affect your life?

I've been described as not listening to what others are saying, particularly when the topic is of an accusing or correcting nature. Not that I don't take feedback. I do, but relatively quickly I make my mind up that I know best or better than most others because I put in work to hone the skills I take interest in. I'll still take advice, but the way I react to it depends particularly on how the person delivers it because power is important to me. From my perspective, when I know I'm right there's nothing anyone can do or say to wobble that particular view. So to others it appears as if they're speaking to a wall. If need be, I'll pretend to heed the advice and continue doing things my way. I don't put authority on a pedestal once I've picked up the core basics of the particular skill and decided on a better way to do things. I always put my own personal twist and don't like to follow scripts or rules. Even if someone is better than me at the moment; I know with smart and hard work I'm capable of reaching their level and surpass them eventually. Too bad once I get some success and learn the ins and outs my interest starts fading and look for something new to stimulate my brain. I don't fake it. I just make it."

"Envy, Vanity, Insecurity & Superiority I mainly posted that because the dsm 5 differs quite a bit from the dsm 4 and includes specific wording for deflated or vulnerable narcissistic adaptations that a lot on here identify with, but the truth is a lot of the diagnostic criteria has to be teased out it’s not usually So obvious. Shame for instance may be experienced by intense anger at the person who is bringing that emotion, defensive mechanisms take over. Grandiosity can take a lot of different forms Competitiveness can be an all out mission to their own undoing or they can instead choose to avoid comparison all together for an underlying fear of failure, and instead find a way to complete with themselves, basically reinforcing their own grandiose ideas.

I've found addiction comes before self-loathing does - bends you more and more out of shape the longer you do it for. Something to do with the ongoing cognitive/emotional dissonance when you keep using after comprehending how mentally corrosive it is. Can't say I agree with you about competitiveness, but amusing to see you keep bringing up the discord thing all the same (if that's what you mean). Do you experience much anger? Had the demon unleashed for a few days when detoxing a few months ago (was supposed to be getting a letter from Mum's employer about aggressive behaviour as a non-client visiting her workplace, actually), but, withdrawals and drug psychosis aside, it's sort of a non starter.

In theory, I think this would be classified as extremely healthy self-esteem or maybe cockiness, not narcissism, but I think almost anyone who's obsessed with themselves likely has narcissistic traits.

I don't know how important insecurity is to NPD, but it's not explicitly one of the diagnostic criteria, FWIW.

If someone seems vain or full of themselves, I interpret their vanity as a direct personal affront and attack to me and my self-esteem/self-image; I feel they are trying to make me feel inferior. I do then devalue them in my head, but it's not very effective and I tend to launch into full-out anger or even rage at how they're ""treating"" me. Competitiveness - Is anyone able to tease healthy from unhealthy? Again it's an area I feel blind to w/r/t other people, but I f*cking love challenging BS artists, so go figure. Is the distinction perhaps when it goes from useful to useless flexing? I think competitiveness gets unhealthy when it results in maladaptive aggression toward the competitor. For example, if a businessman can't beat his competitor in business, he might try to blackmail him or set his factory on fire because he can't stand the idea of losing (a narcissistic injury), or simply because he's a psychopath and wants to win at any and all costs."

Either way I had anger problems more so in my younger years, I’m pretty chill now most of the time with occasional outbursts that seem to manifest out of nowhere.

We've all got a dickhead in us. For an addict, the relationship with him needs to be as realistic as possible. covertunsure wrote: This is one NPD trait that doesn't resonate with me almost at all. Envy doesn't consume a significant part of my life. I do believe others are jealous sometimes, which is probably narcissistic, but it doesn't seem to affect my life to a significant degree, which means it's not pathological. Jealousy had a function in keeping tribes together, so probably weirder to experience none than a little. Men are mostly just apes with flashy peacock feathers: if another one starts doing his dance in front of your girl, the ""jealousy"" motivating wedging him away needn't be the emotional kind (or hostile). I think ""healthy jealousy"" comes from protection; unhealthy from insecurity. Envy seems more like jealousy doubled over by selfishness or greed - has expressions in virtue-coveting, object attachments, pessimism where there can be optimism; jealousy is less desire-based, more based on maintaining the most 'evolutionarily desireable' thing available to us (love, sex) once connection with a partner has been attained. Nothing wrong with that if you ask me. Assuming others are envious of you based on little information probably is narcissistic; nevertheless situations occur where the thought will have obvious validity - and that too becomes excessively narcissistic (I guess it's possible to be excessively excessive? lol) if the observation becomes something of a focus. I reckon you can be just as narcissistic about the truth as you can with BS - and both seem to invite the same kind of response. In theory, I think this would be classified as extremely healthy self-esteem or maybe cockiness, not narcissism, but I think almost anyone who's obsessed with themselves likely has narcissistic traits. I don't think there is an adaptive reason to be totally obsessed with yourself. It liikely means you constantly want to feel superior to others, which is narcissistic. Is that just a technicality though? I reckon most people see self-involved cockiness as narcissistic. But say it's sub-NPD and there's some awareness of the outer repugnancy - like it's kind of being 'weaponised' to see what the effect will be - would you say that's primarily narcissism, or something like ""depersonalised mischief"" ? I don't know how important insecurity is to NPD, but it's not explicitly one of the diagnostic criteria, FWIW. I think it's far more important in vulnerable narcissism, which overlaps significantly with BPD, which is almost by definition a disorder of insecurity (in attachment, identity, self-esteem, emotions, etc.) Insecurity seems more specific to certain traits or situations, but I'm sure they overlap. Isn't there a sentiment out there that certain NPDs can be highly secure in themselves (without being psycopathic), and have a high - or maybe excessively high - self-esteem? Hardly applies to me though: had bad GAD in my late teens and developed an OCD/BPD type insecurity about sexual performance while sober (takes a while for some addicts to get back in the groove), and doing the Freud thing, it's pretty obvious that's mostly what my ""narcissism"" is compensating for (alongside the general futility that comes with being a chronic addict). Sex is fundamental to our nature, so lacking confidence means you'll lack something overall - if there's surplus energy (like bipolar-addicts tend to have), you'll eventually seem creepy. Ironically, doubt it would've developed that way without initially having the other qualities my attention drifts towards, in order to make up for it. If someone seems vain or full of themselves, I interpret their vanity as a direct personal affront and attack to me and my self-esteem/self-image; I feel they are trying to make me feel inferior. I do then devalue them in my head, but it's not very effective and I tend to launch into full-out anger or even rage at how they're ""treating"" me. Is that because they're effectively objectifying you? Not only are they acting superior: they're disrespecting/disregarding your own virtues, by focusing on their own. You aren't getting the respect you deserve; therefore they are being disrespectful. Objectively, they are being anti-social towards you. The more I think about it, the more obvious it should be, to not behave this way. I think competitiveness gets unhealthy when it results in maladaptive aggression toward the competitor. For example, if a businessman can't beat his competitor in business, he might try to blackmail him or set his factory on fire because he can't stand the idea of losing (a narcissistic injury), or simply because he's a psychopath and wants to win at any and all costs. If people react differently according to a scale between acceptable etiquette and their own insecurity, from what you're saying, much more empathy is involved in the healthier kind. I've read some of your other posts - are you a diagnosed NPD? I relate quite a bit a few things you've written about, but without meaning to compare, I might unconsciously be doing a CBT/vipassana-mindfulness thing to avoid the kind of reactionism/personal offense thing you describe. What's been your experience with those kinds of tools?"

""Competition"" is a wide scope; it's the motive that makes the difference. Most good athletes compete with others, but they see themselves ultimately competing with themselves. If your prime motivator is being better than everyone else, then you're always going to fail, as there will always be someone better, stronger, faster etc. And, even if you do win, it's fleeting, as eventually someone will beat you. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Envy, Vanity, Insecurity & Superiority Does it always need to be about winning? I'm not describing it well, but there's a less binary middle ground between those two extremes, where stimulation/exercise have priority over narcissism. Narcissism is involved, but reward-juju comes more from the de-personalised interplay (i.e. how it feels good to stretch different skillsets), such that winning isn't necessarily a factor...and distinct from the NPD rubric, in that reward is proportionate to the challenger - win/lose may not even come in to it; rather it's a win/win split between exercise and better exercise. ifogg was an example of the kind of de-personalisation I mean. He's very clearly psychopathic/narcissistic, or whatever, but he relished having a challenger; and the closer to the mark a challenger got, the more he seemed to like them. Talent and ability is more interesting to him than his emotions are. Emotions interest me more than him, and probably care more about crossing over the line than he does. Asking because dissociation increases when stoned and there isn't the person's facial feedback to remind me of their emotional state, and I tend to be insensitive as a result. Bit more context: About a year ago I had a Nepalese housemate who played guitar, and when he learnt I played as well, he was keen to have a jam session. At the precise moment he realised I could do things he was unable to, his whole attitude tensed up, and after a few minutes he started going on about how he wished he could play the same. Children experience that sort of thing all the time, like when marble collecting re-emerged in the mid90s, but it's a hard one to meaningfully empathise with. The world isn't really solid, in that way; more of a wade through subjective dream-pools, of extremely narrow perceptual biases. Reality is neural simulation through personality filter . If we comprehend how that applies to our own person, there can't be envy towards that which challenges us to stretch ourselves - rather we appreciate it (or them); without comparison, we like them more, for the pleasure of their talent. Narcissism on the positive side - can't see any reason it can't have components of the negative (or that it can't slide towards the negative under influence of other variables). Someone in between, for example, might lack any thoughts of superiority and enjoy other people as much as themselves - but say they're also part-schizoid, spend most of their time alone and don't connect very easily, and they've got some depression: that 'healthy-competition' drive, which is a kind of aggression, might become part-hijacked by the depression; and because the person's part-schizoid and more detached than normal people are, they drift into inappropriate-conduct territory, merely because they were abnormally selfish at the time, and their native margins happen to be wider than the norm."
NPD/DID Just wondering if there's anyone here that has had a series of events and evidence come forward that they don't remember doing it thinking about (even sexual).

"NPD/DID Do you have an actual diagnosis of NPD from a professional therapist or psychologist? If not, you should be careful labeling yourself with a disorder you may not have. DID is not a personality disorder per se (it used to be called multiple personality disorder back in the day), it is now regarded as a dissociative disorder. Such a disorder causes alts to arise and front in a host body, and the host is sometimes unaware of the alt's behavior, thus the dissociation. The feeling that someone else took over your mind and did things you're not aware of is very common with this disorder."

"NPD/DID As AProphet says, I think the False Self/True Self dichotomy might make NPD or pathological narcissism seem somewhat like DID, because grandiosity is projected onto the False Self and the ""host"" acts accordingly. But if that grandiosity is fragile (i.e. vulnerable narcissism) and the False Self is therefore not robust, one can pendulum-swing to the other side, the deflated ""True Self"", but since the True Self isn't fully developed or fleshed out, it is really just an approximation of a person with no real sense of worth, identity, or self-esteem. At least, that's how it plays out for me, but I apparently have more identity issues than most with pure NPD (I also have borderline traits). I do feel like I have two different ""personalities."" One is ""everything-is-great-and-everyone-loves-me covertunsure"" and the other is ""I hate everyone and everything and myself covertunsure."" Maybe Jekyll and Hyde is more accurate. The shift into the latter is precipitated by a perceived rejection, slight, or narcissistic injury. But my default state these days is the latter. Perhaps it's a safety net to avoid further disappointment. The most frustrating part of vulnerable narcissism/borderline disorders is the inability to self-soothe and having nothing to fall back on. There is simply no true self-esteem, so in effect your personality is dictated by those around you and you are at their mercy, which just makes everything all the more unbearable.

"NPD/DID I am going to be a bit of a heretic here... Cluster B is about how one dealt with an abusive upbringing. Psychopathy is an entirely different matter. How you dealt with it, and I don't mean one incident of abuse, I mean constant gas lighting, your feelings don't matter mine do (the parent), you were never good enough, I only care about you when you do something for me, etc... varies. Some kids go feck it. Some take it to heart. Some, try to keep on winning parental approval. Disassociation is another way to cope. Step #1, anyone telling you, you should feel like me because I am strong is utter BS.

"Destructive label The label of Narcissistic Personality Disorder, as a diagnosis, is simply wrong. It’s a diagnosis described through the eyes of those experiencing the disordered behavior, but it’s not reflective of what the pwNPD experiences. It would be akin to diagnosing cancer patients with “Hairless, Helpless, Burden on Loved Ones Disease”. It’s stigmatizing and it incites bad feelings. And it’s not helpful for the person afflicted."
"Destructive label I agree, and statistically speaking all the narcissist everyone is harping on about on social media are probably not NPD and just assholes or just scapegoats for the ‘victims’ inability to maintain a relationship because she is probably horrible but anyway look on the bright side professionals just look at narcs as selfish and childish ASPD gets looked at like degenerate abusers that no one wants to touch."
"Destructive label I think it depends on the context. A lot of the DSM/ICD based diagnoses are of course symptom based and therefore dont describe a person but a [hopefully] rather distinct set of pathologies that is supposed to make it easier for clinics etc. to categorize patients and offer [hopefully] treatments that work for them. An example would be xPD vs substance abuse disorder or eating disorders vs borderline pds. Then from the clinicians side there might be certain expectations that malleable, submissive patients are easier to work with and more pleasing, so certain diagnoses might give them bad expectations and counter-reactions - this is supposed to be addressed in their team meetings though as a normal side effect of psychological treatment. On the other hand side of course laypeople using NPD or narcissism often use it as a term for describing a demonized entity, not describing a, psychological disorder - especially not one informed by the intricacies and the history of the term used. We are seeing this not only with annoyed girlfriends though but with the so-designated themselves. People who show up here clearly showing obsessive or introjective-depressive symptoms, demonizing all sorts of behavior as symptoms of ""narcissism"". A striking example proclaimed lately that ""not caring about anything"" (read depressive nihilism) or having his own opinions (read agency/self-esteem) are for him clear indicators he has ASPD or NPD [traits]. But thats not the words fault. Narcissism as a psychological word is so broad, that if anything you could attack NPD from a linguistic perspective, as narcissistic can mean ""pertaining to the self"", so its like ""Personal Personality Disorder"" :p ZeroZ wrote: ASPD gets looked at like degenerate abusers that no one wants to touch.

Tbh, this is going to sound grandiose but unless you had experienced some odd and downright scary things where it literally feels like your consciousness is being ""occupied"" by something, am not sure this position can be declared final. Some have said here and I think you were also of the opinion that there is no point in trying to differentiate between ""the true self"" from the false self. And in a general sense I would agree. But if you look at what a personality/Self is from a spiritual aspect it´s obviously very malleable and varies with whom the person interacts with. But in any traditional sense, people´s Selves at least feel to be less transient in time but to the Narcissist, this might not hold true and it is none more true than for covert narcs who have very little sense of their own self (being capable of getting so down on themselves as to seek even to destroy their any sense of self-worth through attacking themselves. Any destructive obsession with the self is however, still an obsession with the self (which is by definition unhealthy). Now, that aside, this True Self I mentioned earlier merely because I have experienced (and written here in a post once) after real live hypnosis aimed at bolstering self-esteem that there is a ""real self"" (or maybe a split of self, if you prefer?) under or alongside the false self. After going through a particularly tumultous time (that elicited me finally turning towards the ASPD spectrum and basically abandoning all my emotional needs that I used to hide so well), the day after the hypnosis I awoke in bed after a very emotional dream where I was crying out of feeling sheer relief like a child. I initially seeked hypnosis (and therapy at the time plus holotropic/bioenergetic breathing) to recover my lost self and emotions. The dream was so vivid and felt real that when I woke I was extremely disappointed to find it untrue (my mother having returned somehow, like having faked her death or smth) and I experienced like a minute of a shift where my inner voice was taunting my emotional body (or true/real self) so to speak, basically in a derogatory way. While I (as the consciousness or the observer) was almost in awe of what was happening and actually sided with the ""weak"" self that was being bullied because I felt like it didn´t deserve it, I nonetheless could not stop the harsh inner voice. Maybe this just illustrates a truly schizoid split but unless you have experienced it you would not skip a beat in saying it to be of demonic origin. Someone here has called it the devil driver as it actually kind of feels like possession. Any normal person (in my shoes) would have gone to therapy by now but the fact that I am almost incapable of calling off the show is making me forego it indefinitely. The suicidality and bad situations that your thinking puts you through almost seems like your mind is trying to kill itself and there is only this mute force of consciousness that you are barely consenting to. What other than demonic possession is this? I would prefer not to believe in supernatural forces but I´ve experienced plenty to believe both explanations might be correct. One mustn´t necessarily forego the psychiatric materialistic explanation entirely to admit that there is a spiritual aspect to being human. Narcissism being a very severe ailment. ASPD = Psychopath was after all denoted to be from psykhe+pathos as a sick mind or suffering soul and what else are we really? In my mind there is nothing in this reality to convince me that there are not interdimensional entities running the show that we are all plugged into. It´s just that is a thought one might not want to entertain. Or maybe it´s just the narcissist´s disordered thinking that denotes the Self ""Bad"" and The Other being Good, having fed this message subconsciously while growing up. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Destructive label I’m reading Elinor Greenberg now she’s treats lots of narcissists and borderlines and one way she has clients get in touch with their inner self or whatever term you like is to sit in almost a meditative state in complete silence and literally ask yourself what is wrong or what do you need. She claims the inner self is forever communicating with us in subtle ways thAt may be getting ignored. One such instance was a sudden surge of anxiety, when she investigated what could be causing this she had a conference she didn’t feel prepared for so she spent extra time on. It can be almost any thought that pops in your head or even an image, take note and try to investigate what it could mean. Her belief is that there is usually some reason why something is there. I tried this and I didn’t have any luck with this but I haven’t had much success with meditation either, I’m sure more practice would help"
"Destructive label Sorry SelfSerf I have no idea what you were trying to say. I'm just going to ramble a bit, maybe I hit some contact-point somewhere. The True Self/False Self dichotomy is ultimately about how true you are to your impulses, needs and desires - I've probably said this in the past already, it was ""invented"" by Donald Winnicott to describe alienation from children from their aliveness by the rules and limitations set by their parents. Its not used a lot in the context of NPD, so I never know what to make of it when it appears here on the forum, especially since it doesn't have a lot of concretely descriptive value when people use it, since its too abstract. If such a thing exists in ""Spirituality"" depends a lot on what branch you are looking at. If you are looking at Advaita-Vedanta of course you will find the Atma-Brahma nonduality and this ideas about some sort of primordial consciousness with everything else being Maya or the play of Ishvara... Its a hard philosophical problem for the adherents of that school to show how such nonduality would be possible and how you can realize it if its nondual though. In Buddhism in comparison no such thing as a True Self exists at all (Anatman doctrine) and enlightenment to a large degree realizing this, thereby destroying the 12 links of dependent arising by uprooting Avidya (believing there is a true self). I think its important to make a clear distinction between these concepts, as they are not only different philosophical entities but ""working"" with them also is pretty different and has different goals and implications. As to demonic possession... its hard for me to see what you are getting at. If you hear voices after waking up it could be hypnopompic hallucinations. But if you experience your own minds contents as objects (read out there) more often, that per definition is in the psychotic range. But interpreting experience of course is also done on the basis of beliefs. Having grown up in a very fundamentalist {the apocalypse comes soon] christian sect, I can understand that deconnecting yourself from childish ideas about demons might be a problem, even when you are not having some schizophrenia spectrum illness. But it can also just be a way to delegate responsibility for your well-being or for the multi-facetted nature of your mind to some ""evil beings"" so you dont have to deal with that, or so you dont feel guilty. dx: SPD"

Yeah, if anything it just illustrates the Narcissistic psyche´s inability to take responsibility for their own actions. I think you hit the nail right on the head. Ok, sorry for the self-indulging slightly off-topic post but... As for what I was aiming at, along with the reference to bioenergetic breathing - essentially, a pwNPD comorbid with ASPD is so involved in their false self and detached from their feelings (basically equal to how sociopaths are able to detach from their feelings, with the difference that for them it´s just their emotions are short-lived) that the body feels just like a vessel at most times, like you wear the false self as a second skin. When I somehow find a way to ground myself and let myself ""feel"" in the borderline sense, I only feel despair and desperation. This usually happens when I fall ill. I regress very quickly back to that young self. Obviously, being that dreams have to do with your subconscious, after awaking for the first few minutes one might still kind of be drifting between dreamlife and wakefulness. What I experienced was like a split between my body and mind, as atotal misalignment. The ´inner critic´ was what I felt as somewhat of a foreign, possessive voice, whereas the sadness that I felt after the dream was very specifically stuck like a ball in my chest. And it was like locked in, feeling impossible to recover or to give that ´weak part´ of me any more power because it felt helpless, just stuck inside. With that holotropic breathing session I did a week or so later I actually released some of the emotion but only after I had done intense breathing for 15minutes+. It was very hard to break through that defensive layer and my conscious awareness did not at the very least want to relinquish control over my body. As I kept hyperventilating, I felt my hands tense up in a very non-human like way, like there was extreme tension in the form of cramping from my wrists and I actually heard slithers coming from my throat while I was breathing (i.e. reptilian-like). Now, one can speak of the reptilian bran taking over the mammalian one (the one that hosts feelings and affection. People heavily into spirituality might speak of a real war being waged on a spiritual level, in other dimensions, not seen in ordinary reality, but obviously felt by those more sensitive). When the instructor put a blanket on I actually felt like I was being cradled in this light. There was of course suggestive music involved but after that release of emotion I just laid on the mat crying for what was probably more than 30 minutes, I actually felt intense light and some sort of angelic presence in the room and it was incredibly soothing. (Again, there is no doubt that my beliefs growing up probably had something to do with it). Sadly, of course after recovering from it, I still was somewhat dumbfounded and was back to my old self. The ways of interacting with the world did not change in the very least (being all I know, essentially). But that hour or two there was a regression to that age I emotionally froze at. That emotional age (which bioenergitcally occupies only a tiny portion in my chest) I designated as the True Self. Which, obviously as you elucidated, is not the correct designation. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Destructive label The way I understand it is it’s simply a denial of your true self, your true feelings, emotions, and needs. As they were taught at a young age that they were inappropriate or not up to standard so the child buries these feelings and desires deep down along with their needs and feelings that most people have to guide them. Instead they learn to create an image of what people want to see, they want to be accepted and feel like they are good but at the expense of their own emotional and ‘spiritual’ health as their true needs and desires are not being heard. I was punished for dancing when I was young, it was seen as foolish so I was humiliated by putting me on display outside like a monkey to perform for strangers while I was being observed to make sure I did it the same. I still to this day cannot dance in public. I never made this connection except recently through therapy. So something I was so free and open with is now a buried fear, that I hide from everyone except you nice people. Anyway that’s what it means to me, people are so different that it’s truelly individual"
"Destructive label flightrisk wrote: The label of Narcissistic Personality Disorder, as a diagnosis, is simply wrong. It’s a diagnosis described through the eyes of those experiencing the disordered behavior, but it’s not reflective of what the pwNPD experiences. It would be akin to diagnosing cancer patients with “Hairless, Helpless, Burden on Loved Ones Disease”. It’s stigmatizing and it incites bad feelings. And it’s not helpful for the person afflicted. I am not sure this is a working analogy. A working analogy with cancer could be depression. A state where you aren't fully functional or fully present for your loved ones. People aren't mad at narcissists because they aren't fully functional, but because they can be controlling or vindictive. It seems that pwNPD often focus on how they are perceived, are concerned with whether they are perceived as bad, and how to correct this perception. But something Masterson hinted at, if I remember correctly, and that I agree with: the more you focus on how people perceive you, the more your own focus is shifting away from yourself and interpreting your own emotions. This is true for everybody but particularly relevant in the case of NPD, given the disorder's genesis."
"Compensatory narcissistic relationship questions Hi all, wondering if anyone else here with this type of narcissism has succeeded in getting and sustaining a decent relationship with another person. If you avoid others because of your avoidant features, and are self-absorbed/uneasy around people who are even close friends, how is this whole shazzam supposed to work out? And what of the splitting? At least I don't think I devalue others (and this is me thinking about my whole life so far and friendships) unless someone ""hurt my feelings"" which leads to the ""in-love"" feelings going away, not so much that they didn't live up to an expectation I had of them. It's more of a case of limerence for a short while followed by casually falling out of love with them/fearing them out of my own insecurities, then I start thinking about them again and going back into love, and so on and so forth. So really I guess people with this type of narcissism going on doesn't really have all that much to do with a full-blown pathological narcissist. I thought and still think I'm more avoidant to be honest, given that I avoid close relationships due to being abandoned, slighted, or rejected, not so much due to them not living up to something. So does anyone here relate? And what can be done about this?

""Has a history of searching for an idealized partner and has an intense need for affirmation and confirmation in relationships (Forman)"" I have only had one relationship in my life and I'm about 30. Mostly, I avoid people because I'm scared of rejection and of not being good enough. But I can say that I didn't think I used to split, or at least wasn't aware of the mechanisms or what it looked like from the outside, until I started seeing my current shrink, who told me I split him. And it's true. One session, or even moment, I'll see him as a savior and miracle worker, and the next I'll be almost talking down to him (he calls it ""psychoeducating"" him cuz I start using psych jargon like we use on this forum) and devaluing him. It's very bizarre. I honestly thought that's how everyone thinks, but he said it's not. So I guess what I'm saying is splitting can be hard to pick apart if you're the one doing it, and it helps to have someone more removed (and preferably an expert) tell you if you're engaging in it. Limerence is definitely something I relate to. I've gotten obsessed with people before. But if they reciprocate, I often lose interest almost immediately and like you say, probably a defense mechanism, pushing them away as a result of my own insecurities. I also feel like, ""how could he possibly be into me? Something must be wrong with him, I'm a defective POS."" Think there are only two options: a) therapy, or b) push through it and engage anyway, little by little. Ideally both... but therapy can possibly give you the boost you need, especially if as you say, you aren't a full-blown narcissist."

"On edge I could have written your post, seriously and literally, wow. I feel angry, homicidal, and/or suicidal (all sides of the same hypothetical three-sided coin, I guess) much of the time when being out in the world. For me it's mostly triggered by perceptions of rejection or being ignored by people. Then I need to reclaim and win the power struggle (I perceive) they've initiated. Maybe you don't just (or at all) have NPD, but some kind of paranoia, borderline, and/or OCD traits going on. It sounds a bit more complicated--like mine. Hate to say that as I know it doesn't necessarily help, but it may be the truth. I also found what you said interesting about not being able to read people. To me that suggests perhaps a form of aspergers/mild autistic traits? I have those for sure. Not diagnosing you, just throwing ideas out there if you truly have challenges reading body language and relating to others. Let me ask you this, do you feel a desire to truly connect with people and do you have empathy? Or do you merely want to dominate, control, and feel superior to them?

"Emotion, Intimacy and Personality Basically how progress with this goes is, I apply a cue sequence, and then maintain it - and it ultimately yields some kind of personal change in myself. And then I determine whether I like that change or no. Most recently - I had used the sequence "" force union, incite love "". Began to really, really really really - ridiculously not like it. ""Forcing"" a ""union"" is just - creepy, quite frankly. Doesn't resonate well. So it leaves me kind of stumped. I have the 5 cues with wave relevance, there's no more - just these five. There's other cues but, they don't embody wave relevance so, don't yield any effect. Plus, I had a contention that ""jealousy"" would be a naturally occurring external phenomenon, but, I didn't really feel it coming on just of its own accord. That is, without conscious implementation, it just felt lacking. So, with the cues I have - how could I form a sequence? I can't ""jealousy"" a ""union"", or ""jealousy"" ""love"", can I? Makes no sense. The implementers were ""force"" and ""incite"". But we're x'ing off ""force"" cause, it compromises the hypothetical non-impositional state of our personality. That is - we want male to female equality. Males are big imposing brutes. Females are non-impositional, non-confrontational etc And the natural flow is that females get the choice, selective control in the realm of sexuality. To equalize this - we must preclude the impositional element from our personalities as males - but without turning into spineless, emotionless nancies, incapable of getting females excited, basically. So I went into a deep state of thought. And what I deduced was that - perhaps there is such thing as, ""jealous union"". Slightly augmented the cue, or rather - stripping it down - from jealous y to just jealous. ""Jealous"" as a cue has the most emotional potency BY FAR, thus it must be placed first in the sequence. ""Love"" is more intimate that ""union"", so it must be placed after ""union"" in the order. In addition I feel ""love"" is like, a culminating application. Can't really flow-through-it, as such. ""Union"", definitely feels more flow-through, so we can place it mid-sequence, as a means to transition to something subsequent. ""Jealous Union, Incite Love"". https://i.imgur.com/R8C1Qu9.jpg Thus - I'm not really imposing a union - I'm just ensuring if a union comes to fruition, it's not doing so via imposition. It would happen I guess, via jealousy. Not something I'm imposing - but basically I'm ensuring that union would be the product of jealousy - via this cue setup. As in, being ""jealous"" could be considered a state of wanting something you don't have, or can't have, which exacerbates how much you want it, and with that ""yearning"" - per se - we can bring the individual forth toward a ""union"" - and from there further down the intimacy chain, etc. Does that chain of logic make sense to anyone else? Cause it's relatively a recent deduction and really only beginning to make sense to myself."
"Emotion, Intimacy and Personality At this point I must also reiterate my opinion that, communication does occur via perception of personality and appearance etc - yes; But at least equally in terms of ""waves"" - sensing each others wave patterns and emission. Waves waves waves. Can sense it almost in terms of a ""pulse"" - certainly when the emotion runs strong. A strong cumulative depolarization of the nervous system in some capacity. What's peculiar is, of course nerve regulation throughout the body stems from the central nervous system, which governs nerve activity through other areas. With the strong emotional depolarization, that pulse - what I get myself is, it almost seems to resonate most acutely through the mid-thoracic cavity; i.e. through the heart. Obviously the heart being composed of an array of concentrated musculoskeletal nerve fibres, so we actually physically feel the nerve activity. I guess that's why historically sayings regarding emotion and love, they use the ""heart"" as a reference. ""Broke my heart"" - etc etc. That emotional depolarization simply seems to be felt most acutely through that region. Gut-brain axis also, like when you're at the discotheque and some really cute chick you were gonna hit on starts making out with some other guy right in front of you. This is exclusively emotional, but it actually feels like someone has kicked you in the stomach. So currently some investigators are focusing on gut microbiome as next-gen mental illness treatment, understanding the brain-gut connection. Bottom line is, outwardly we've historically characterized our wave structure as our ""personality"", but I would say it's more accurately characterized as what it is. It's our wave structure."
"Shame Shame is perhaps my biggest problem. I don't approach people I'm attracted to because I go crazy when I'm rejected (and I'm conditioned to think I'll always be rejected), and the shame and entitlement go off the charts. A crazy, bipolar mix of, ""How dare they reject me? I'm really good looking (wait, aren't I???). Why aren't they into me? What's wrong with them? What's wrong with me? No wonder they don't like me. No one I like likes me. You're a piece of $#%^. You'll never meet anyone. I'm not as good looking as I thought. I'm not perfect. I can't stand myself."" etc. etc. The thoughts are bad enough, but the feelings are even worse and more unbearable. The shame I experience is incredibly toxic and painful. Among other things, shame causes me to further isolate myself and avoid people. It isn't just limited to romantic rejection, but that's perhaps the most prominent example. How do you guys conquer or manage shame, assuming you have it, and assuming you are able to manage it? And perhaps relatedly, how do you deal with rejection?"
"Shame You're setting yourself up for failure with each interaction if you see others as accepting or rejecting you in such a binary way. People can genuinely like you and want to spend time with you even if they don't see you as the most attractive person they've ever encountered. Physical attraction and perceived beauty is subjective. For me, an average looking person can become gorgeous in my eyes if I like their personality, and the opposite is true as well. Have you considered that perhaps your obsession with looks is a diversion you've created for yourself to avoid dealing with other issues?"

Have you considered that perhaps your obsession with looks is a diversion you've created for yourself to avoid dealing with other issues? Well, I guess it's partly a projection, because I'm very picky and judgmental, and have high standards, so I guess I expect/project they do with me as well. And it is true to some degree, because other good-looking people can inherently afford to be (and seemingly usually are) picky. In full honesty, I'm apparently so delusional and narcissistic that your ""even if they don't see you as the most attractive person they've ever encountered"" triggered the familiar panic and narcissistic rage in me at my false or at least desperately wished-for reality being questioned, even of course in your case inadvertently/unintentionally and even though I know intellectually that I'm not the most attractive person in the world. But the idea of someone not *seeing* me as that enrages and panics me, maybe in part because my black and white mind isn't able to process grays and see myself as attractive ""enough"" so I need to be at one extreme or the other, otherwise I can't cope. I've realized this is an inability, not an unwillingness or character failing, at this point, so I try to be easier on myself about it. (Of course, who *wouldn't* want to be seen as the most attractive person in the world? It's flattering, but not a reality for almost anyone.) Regarding your question, instinctively, I feel the answer is no, I never consciously constructed a diversion, just that I simply must feel good about myself before engaging in relationships. But you might be onto something, I'm just not sure how to tell; perhaps it's subconscious. How do you think I might go about finding that out?"
"Shame flightrisk wrote: covertunsure wrote: How do you think I might go about finding that out? Mental health professional? Your frequent experience with a 'panic' response and your intrusive thoughts suggest there may be more going on here than NPD. Yes, I've seen a psychologist for the past couple months, using transference-focused therapy (made a thread about this narcissistic-personality/topic214483.html ). I'm skeptical it will help. He doesn't think I have OCD or any other Axis I disorder, which makes me think he's a dumbass, even though he went to an Ivy League university and studied under (or, at least, I think he did) Otto Kernberg. This only leads him to then say that I'm in a cycle of idealizing and devaluing him. Which may be true, but it just makes me feel crazier than I already am. He doesn't think I have OCD because he doesn't see the compulsion followed by the obsessions (intrusive thoughts). I feel like the very fact I have intrusive thoughts should clue him in. With pure ""O"" OCD, the compulsions are either completely absent or, I believe more likely, less visible to the outside world. For example, I'll think, ""I'm gorgeous,"" to which I'll cringe and think ""I can't think that,"" and I have to think ""I'm not gorgeous"" to neutralize the inevitable disappointment of walking around thinking that and having it not be confirmed by the world. My last psychiatrist, OTOH, thought I had OCD and NOT a true Axis II PD. It's all so befuddling. What's obvious to me--and he agreed with this--is that whatever your training, specialty, orientation, religion, opinion, etc. is, biases you, kinda like the ""when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail"" phenomena. So he naturally lumps me into Axis 2 PD, whereas my last psychiatrist had more Axis 1 training (mood, anxiety, etc.), so he was more likely to think in those terms. This only further complicates the picture as it becomes impossible to get a clear and accurate diagnosis and, thus, treatment."
"Shame flightrisk wrote: That's gotta be frustrating. Sorry you can't get a clear answer. The mental health profession isn't doing itself any favors here by having such wildly different interpretations of the same behavior. Yeah, well part of the problem is that medicine, and particularly psychiatry/psychology, often isn't clear-cut or empirically, physiologically, etc. provable. You can't (usually) point to an MRI of the brain and say, ""a-ha! There's his OCD, NPD, etc."" So much is subjective. Also, I can't really explain everything sufficiently. My mind is way too complicated. It's interesting no one else has chimed in. I've read that shame is at the root of both BPD and NPD. Maybe most people with NPD aren't consciously aware of it as much?"
"Shame Whats the difference between shame and embarrassment? I feel some of my development-delays and stuff ""normal"" people kern in their teens or earlier and I have to work on them almost in my 40s now to be a bit embarrassing. But I'm not sure I am ashamed of it. dx: SPD"
"Shame Shame is a fear response with no resolution. Usually people react to fear by either running from the situation or fighting it. Shame exists after the event, where no more action can be taken. It's a realisation that you've caused a social problem that cannot be fixed, and your flight / flight process has nothing to work with. With the behaviour comes a recognition that you've contravened some widely accepted principle and your status in your social group is threatened. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"""All women want me - all men want to be me"" justonemoreperson wrote: Have you tried inciting jealousy to force union? I hear that helps. Yassss though - that's now modified. It appears that ""jealousy"" can only exist externally - can't embody it, as it's like trying to embody ""zealousy"" - which causes anxiety - translating as embodying something aversive, driving others away. However - we acknowledge the external manifestation of the aversive ""jealousy"" - it can actually drive others toward us. i.e. something aversive externally, drives others toward us; applied internally - drives others away. Capice? But attractive - we apply, ""Force Union, Incite Love"". Where love is the epitome of intimacy (and more specifically, as a cue, it resonates with wave relevance - thus AFFECTIVE). That's my break through - wave relevance. The cues must have wave relevance. Now - jealousy has this - but, it's more of an El Nino, versus a nice laminar placid wave (as Sarandipity was alluding to), thus, it can come about externally, but not be embodied, not incorporated into the cue sequence (albeit we're aware it's a part of the process - like Sara was saying - ""plant seeds of jealousy"" - alluding to their external implementation). ""Love"" - I overlooked initially as a potential cue application (it occured to me but I excluded it), as it simply doesn't really ""flair"" emotion. It's too placid. I had always thought I needed to embody something to send emotion high (thus incorporating jealousy). But now I know better....

"""All women want me - all men want to be me"" Waves: https://youtu.be/CyYQIcZacvA Everything is a wave. We connect, via waves. We feel emotion - via waves. Our intuition, is what perceives waves. Can someone tell Sarandipity to get in here - so she can intellectually humour my ramblings??"
"""All women want me - all men want to be me"" https://i.imgur.com/QFVnRX2.jpg - full size version. That small image, the largest size I can embed - is probably pretty hard to read. So - I've determined most critically - all the cues with wave-relevance. i.e. the architecture of the word generates a ""wave"", which resultantly has AFFECT, on the observer. That is to say, it implicates them emotionally. (if no wave-relevance, no affect - thus the cue effectively does nothing, no purpose to implement it). As to intuitive interpersonal wave generation, how this transpires on a neural to neural level via self dialogue - something implicating action potentials and thus neural activity perhaps? Hopefully this can be better clarified in time. For now - the wave-relevant cues pertinent to emotionality/intimacy are comprehensively isolated, and arranged quite simply in order from high potency to low potency - the lower potency representing greater intimacy - but of course requiring the higher potency as ""precursors"" effectively. And thus, we attain the most intimate possible state - ""love"". Which should theoretically give rise to nervous system regulation/optimization, alleviating nervous system related complaints and conditions. .... You know, Theoretically."

See - issue I struggled with in the past is, if no man has ever embodied the perfect wave state composition, thus effortless inducing orgasmic sex in a woman, then no woman could have experienced orgasm via vaginal penetration...?

A man (or woman) may not embody the ideal wave state, but RELATIVE to another person, it may basically have the desired effect.... at least at that point in time. I guess that's how the ""passion"" curve goes. Sex is great initially - then wanes in time as the wave state relativity shifts/weakens etc. Third party wave interference? Well - as Sarandipity mentioned - third parties can often facilitate unions, gettings others hooked up etc. They can also hinder and obstruct it. Re facilitation though - my contention is the third party makes communication easier. I've been observing this over the last few weeks. Three's a crowd - as they say. Can just make communication easier with that third sometimes. Breaking up buildings? Well - just say wave generation is via neural/nerve depolarization - I have no idea the frequency the subsequent wave occurs at but, I'd imagine it's extremely weak. Again - I know this post was effectively a joke but, like I said - it does raise some interesting points."

Yeah - I'm contending that's what happens with implementation of self-dialogue, when said dialogue contains cues with architectural relevance to wave generation, i.e. wave relevance In that, we're not typically conscious of wave generation, but can harness in the most optimal fashion - via the above diagram (which has been over a decade in the making - and I am not fully certain yet if it's even ""done""). But basically - optimization in this regard - we resonate with, everyone. Bridge cultural gaps, societal gaps, belief gaps - but most importantly - the gender gap. Whether the process implicates structural modification via neuroplastic changes, long term potentiation? Or simply cellular function/expression itself. What I can say is that, over the course of using and applying various cue and cue sequence, my body has undergone radical shifts. Slightly overweight, to ######6 huge and strong, ripped and lean etc. So - implication of MSK genes? Many possibilities.... -- Thu Dec 05, 2019 8:10 am -- That paper demonstrates to me that, certain scientists are vaguely aware of the concept of neural wave generation, its perception (which I contend is what we refer to as intuition) etc, and that there's something to be exploited, but just haven't got yet, how to fully do so. -- Thu Dec 05, 2019 8:19 am -- justonemoreperson wrote: There is evidence that brain waves can interact between individuals; that somehow we click with some people better than others and , although most of that is subtle body language we're not consciously aware of, there are some scientists that maintain that the waves formed in our brains can resonate with others. That's what I'm referring to in terms of wave relativity, doppler effect etc. The psychological thoughts - emotions - actions - paradigm seems to allude to something in this capacity; thoughts generating waves (emotions), dictating resultant behavior/action etc. Thoughts historically based on belief patterns, culture, religion, family values - whatever. We've tried to characterize insight as to others dispositions in terms of body language etc - as you mention and subtle cues we don't pay acute attention to consciously, but to - the unwavering truth is accurately perceiving and understand an individuals ""wave pattern"" - which occurs via intuition. As Nicola Tesla said, ""intuition always yields the ultimate truth"", and to understand the secrets, think in terms of ""energy, frequency, vibration"" - i.e. those things that waves are comprised of."
"Richard Ramirez: Psychopath/Sociopath/Malignant Narcissist? Good Evening, I was wondering which one of these criteria would Richard Ramirez (The Night Stalker) meet? Many would say he is a total psychopath, others say he was a sociopath. What about malignant narcissist? Could he also meet this criteria? He did appear to be very grandiose and loved the attention he's getting in court. Combine that with ASPD and sadism. I think a new Night Stalker documentary came out recently. Perhaps we can learn more info from that soon."
"Richard Ramirez: Psychopath/Sociopath/Malignant Narcissist? Difficult to answer. Serial killers' minds are so complex that someone proposed to group them in a particular personality disorder (a mix of narcissistic, sociopathic, psychopathic, borderline, obsessive-compulsive traits, and much more). It's a common prejudice that they are psychopaths only. In practice it's much more complex, and it's too much easy to confine and to expect a destructive behavior just from someone with that particular label. Everyone can become destructive, if he's blindly driven by his demons. “Humor is reason gone mad."" “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”"

From the point of view of the victim, the perspective is simple, it hurts, and is not warranted. 2.) From the point of view of the serial killer it is complex.

From the point of view of the serial killer who get's punished, it is no more complex then case #1 if that even, I don't like being treated this way!!! Serial killers don't get or won't get the parts in the middle, nobody else wants to be mis-treated either, and their feelings aren't special. So the only real complexity is why don't serial killers get that others have feelings too? We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

"Richard Ramirez: Psychopath/Sociopath/Malignant Narcissist? Personally I’ve always found serial killers dull and the continual interest in them somewhat tedious.

"Can someone with NPD form deep bonds? Can someone with NPD miss someone? Can someone with NPD love and form deep bonds? Can someone with NPD admit their wrongs and can they ever understand how their actions might have affected someone? Are narcissistic abusers abusive because they are narcissistic or are they narcissistic and abusive? Can someone with NPD ever change and be a bit more empathic, considerate, open to talk about emotions? Can someone with NPD remain faithful?"
"Can someone with NPD form deep bonds? I am not a psychologist, therapist, or whatever, but I think whatever you struggle with, whether it be a personality disorder etc, that YOU have a choice. No one, no disorder, can take that choice from you. And you're also still a human being with human feelings. Of course you can miss someone. Even if you have what might be considered an abusive personality, you still have the choice to do right by others and yourself. And making good choices, despite whatever your natural instinct is, is possible. If you want to be faithful, then you CAN be. Based on what we're struggling with, it might very well challenge our natural instincts and the patterns that we've developed, but with self-discipline and self-compassion and others supporting us, I believe that we can get there. In my opinion, just continuing to work on these things, practicing self-discipline, learning how to control your instincts and automatic reactions (while still being open and compassionate towards your true feelings) reflects a love, for yourself and for others. I also think giving up old ways and being open and embracing new patterns can lead to deep bonds."
"Can someone with NPD form deep bonds? They can form bonds, but that is out of their own necessity and has nothing to do about their love to the other person. Narcissistic people are self-centered and absorbed. I don't mean to offend but that's based on what I have read about NPD."

"Can someone with NPD form deep bonds? ... This smell concern troll-y, but I'll bite regardless. Maybe being measured in my response will change someone's mind somewhere, at least. Can someone with NPD miss someone? ... Well, yes? My disorder started manifesting flagrantly as a result of traumatic grief. Not to mention part of the disorder is wanting whatever may be on the horizon, to be the outward ideal of a perfect person who has it all together. In order to be reaffirmed of my value, even if it is part of a facade, I still have to have base social needs. This logically results in being able to become attached to others and desire their presences. Can someone with NPD love and form deep bonds? Yes? What are you reading to believe otherwise? Empathy =/= love, affection, or compassion. It's simply empathy. I don't really get close to people often, since people tend to disappoint me, but once I get past the initial stage of awkwardly gauging whether or not I want to bother my relationships are fairly normal with regards to establishing and building trust. Can someone with NPD admit their wrongs and can they ever understand how their actions might have affected someone? I can admit my wrongs. Sometimes. It's begrudging and the person prompting it has to have me emotionally invested in them in some way. If I respect someone, I'll cop to it. If I love someone, I'll cop to it. If you're someone I barely know and I already barely want to interact with you? I'll weigh the cost of saying ""I don't really care."" As for understanding how my actions affect others, this depends on your definition of understanding. I can logically work out why what I did was inappropriate and seek to curb behaviors like that in the future if need be but I won't feel any empathetic pangs. Are narcissistic abusers abusive because they are narcissistic or are they narcissistic and abusive? Narcissistic and abusive. Two different ballgames. Again, I can logically grasp the consequences of my behavior if I'm forced to stop and think about it, or if I see I've accidentally hurt someone by being careless. My heartstrings won't be pulled in the way most people experience it but often I still feel remorse in that I have failed to be the ""perfect person"" by visibly failing others. I want to be better for others in order to prove to myself internally that I have tangible worth. My long-term partner has been baffled by my odd reactions to things, sure, but all my empathetic blindness has meant consequentially is that I need to check in more frequently to see if I've done anything wrong. Can someone with NPD ever change and be a bit more empathic, considerate, open to talk about emotions? Again: you can logically be considerate as that's a part of the unwritten social contract of pretty much just interacting with anyone at all ever. Maybe I'll brush people off or push ahead of someone in the cafeteria, but when it comes to my close relationships I've learned to ease up a bit and not be too pushy. Can someone with NPD remain faithful? My last relationship ended because they were the one who had cheated on me. Again, I don't really care to form too many meaningful connections since my own unrealistic standards cause me to view very few people without a very obtrusive amount of contempt standing in my way of wanting to associate with them. Even if I flit about in terms of networking, I only have a few people I actually let get close to me. I don't respect the people I work with. It's especially tough to find something meaningful since any prospective friendship also has to be patient enough to let me know when I've done something thoughtless, rather than assuming I do things with chessmaster-like intent."

"Can someone with NPD form deep bonds? Of course. They just have to form it with people who see THROUGH the false ego. That is why so many people with NPD become friends with people who have NPD. They know it is all a front, so their little inner children are all laughing and playing when they sit around while they bolster each other's false egos. Somebody with NPD can eventually ""collapse"" and the false ego will go into extreme depression and die temporarily. That is the only time a psychiatrist, psychologist, loved one, etc. can truly enter the heart of the child and form a relationship. While it is very difficult, if it happens, the NPD can CLING to that ""parent"" for the rest of their lives (marriage). That is why the relationship between co-dependents and NPD are so strong. The parent just needs to keep the NPD in check or the NPD will rebel and go on a cheating spree like a child has no rules."
"Magnesium Supplement A little while ago I was discussing the benefit of adding a magnesium supplement to see if it would help the lack of motivation and attention span issues I've always had. I thought it might be useful to post an update. I've been taking the stuff for over a week now and I wasn't really expecting anything, but I have to say that I am finding it a little easier to focus. I'm not sure if it's the expectation or the drugs, probably a mixture of both, and I've not turned into some incredible organisation machine, but I have noticed a difference. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Magnesium Supplement Couldn't it simply be placebo? Even though you didn't expect anything, your subconscious may have believed in it enough to have some effect. I just can't see how magnesium could help motivation or focus. Especially motivation. Sure it can make you less stressed/depressed, but, I, for one, don't get more motivated when I'm not one of those things."

"Magnesium Supplement Just listened to a Rogan podcast that dissected this guy’s experience with chronic fatigue syndrome. He was besridsen for 15 years and finally was prescribed magnesium along with oxytocin, which is the first time i’ve heard of this. Said it made him trust people. Which is all fine and dandy but for the fact that pwNPD brains do not probably respond as well to this, since aversion to this is kind of part of our personality. So it probably won’t help a regular narcissist but maybe might function with those that have an underlying BPD core (which if I understand correctly, the Covert/inverted/hypervigilant type has), as it’s been used for BPD therapy. Another magic bullet on my list of reasons to not kill myself, yet. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Fantasies & Other Possible Narcissistic Traits When alone, I fantasize success about anything and everything. If I'm listening to a good song I'll picture myself performing it on stage and doing it better than anyone's ever done it. Especially when watching movies - I put myself in the movie and how I'd do things better or be more successful than the main character. I also fantasize a lot about serial killing or just generally going around causing havoc and destruction. The latter fantasy was especially strong in jail. My fantasies involve having fame/infamy, power, and/or success. Nothing to do with being seen in a good light or as good - just different and special. These fantasies are in the moment and thinking about them in my head satisfies the desire and makes me feel like I accomplished something. Moving on, wherever I am, I have a need to come off as different from everyone else around me. This manifests as ""having"" different opinions than others and being antagonistic to other's views just for the sake of debating and have no problem effectively arguing both sides of any discussion and winning(at least in my head I always win). I'll openly disrespect authority if everyone else is a follower or the reverse, speak good on an ""enemy"" of the group. I'll also alter personality traits like in jail developing a more formal, thoughtful persona to separate me from the more brash, loud, and low intelligence criminals. Or the opposite, behaving more like a fun jerk while in a group of polite people. Whatever happens, I need to win. I place personal power above everything else; especially in interpersonal relationships. I use calculated aggression to make sure I get my way or at least change the terms so I get some level of control and yeah that's still a win. Not always possible to control a situation but if I can't then oh well move on. Having a person escape my metaphorical chains is one of the few ways to anger me. When that happens of course I work on getting that back into my hypnosis. Though while losing something important to me will cause a flash of anger I never let emotions show because losing control is weakness, much less chase after the object. As such I come off as a rock and described as methodical. In jail fellow inmates called me a serial killer because according to them I was too calm all the time and had no feelings or emotions and that I looked like one day I would snap and beat someone to death. I certaintly do, I just don't behave like I do, because of my level of control. Closest I'll be seen behaving emotionally is when I use anger to make a point or get something. I've been consistently described as every narcissistic word out there. Arrogant, grandiose, egotistical, etc. I will say in my core I've always viewed myself as superior - but it doesn't manifest overtly as haughty, cocky behavior nor blindly thinking I can do anything. From my readings NPD worry about other's perceptions and feel a lot of emotions I don't. I also don't seek validation the way a typical narcissist seems to. I don't like being complimented or people being kind or touchy with me. It's annoying. I don't like people getting too clingy, following me around, or looking up to me as a superior. People who try to kiss my ass are weak. So, I don't particularly chase admiration, attention, unless I'm bored but not to regulate ego. I get my kicks and gratification from controlling people actions, perceptions, and emotions. I regularly ask people to do increasingly bigger favors because I like to push boundaries. That was quite a bit of info. Those with good knowledge on the core of NPD, do I seem to fit in your opinions? P.s: I've been dx'ed with Aspd on several occasions and never has a clinician mentioned narcissism other than one mentioning grandiosity. I don't fake it. I just make it."
Fantasies & Other Possible Narcissistic Traits Sounds to me like your ASPD diagnosis fits best. If its oriented more around a schizoid or a narcissists core is hard to say. I would say the problems with emotions and the way fantasies work for you point more towards the schizoid range though. dx: SPD
"Fantasies & Other Possible Narcissistic Traits @OP Most of what you describe could apply to the few highly successful people who go on to invent stuff like cool electric cars and send them into space. The only problem is that the curve of effectiveness slopes up to a point and then drops away dramatically, which is why you ended up sitting in jail. Your possibly great potential has been stirred in with an unhealthy amount of useless arsehole. I don't mean that to sound offensive, as I'm much the same, but it takes a while to spot the constantly repeating pattern and look for a way to control it. Visualisation, as you're described, is an effective tool. Use it to find other mechanisms to deal with situations. Otherwise you'll lose. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Fantasies & Other Possible Narcissistic Traits I assume that most narcissists like being complimented/admired, at least for things they value as admirable. Btw I don't agree that someone being kind with you is always weak, it depends on his motivations; he's weak someone that is going along with you, betraying his nature or his willing. But if someone is kind with you, even if you openly show that you don't like kind people, he is just following his willing and his attitude, despite you dislike them. “Humor is reason gone mad."" “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”"
"Fantasies & Other Possible Narcissistic Traits There's a tendency to believe that kind people are weak and they finish last etc. but I'm not sure if this is true. They're obviously going to be used at some point, but the majority of the time they won't. If you look at the big picture, I'm pretty sure that kindness, on average, leads to a person's success rather than their failure. It's basically a barter system, the more you're kind to other people, the more likely they are to be kind to you. It's no different to any other social contract we follow, and yet this is seen as weak to some. I think people are often so paranoid about being conned, that they sacrifice any opportunity for it to happen, even though the chances of it happening are very low. My mother was a good example of kindness. She's was very kind and, as such, she'd give everyone the benefit of the doubt and occasionally she got stiffed. Not in a major way, but enough for her to feel stupid. But she never really had to pay for much. She had friends who'd help her out, a builder who did a whole pile of work on her garden for her because she was there for his sister when she was ill. People took her on holiday, even paid for her to travel to South America for a holiday when my father died. So, yeah, she might have been shafted for a couple of hundred now and then, but if you look at it as a cost / benefit analysis, she won. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Fantasies & Other Possible Narcissistic Traits Agree with jomp, you can outmaneuver people and use them as a means to an end but ultimately this will catch up to you and blow up in your face if you can get people to genuinely like you they will do far more for you and not leave you high and dry when the day comes (and it comes for us all) that you have no means at all. I talk about how much I dislike humans and civilization but that’s probably an over exaggeration because I don’t mind helping people who really deserve it, I just don’t think most people do. If I had the option to help or piss on someone, one was nice and helpful to me and one was a chore to be around and never helped anyone in their lives guess who gets the help and who gets the piss."
"Fantasies & Other Possible Narcissistic Traits justonemoreperson wrote: I think people are often so paranoid about being conned, that they sacrifice any opportunity for it to happen, even though the chances of it happening are very low. It's more about lacking a real desire to be kind in turn. Doesn't mean I won't reciprocate, I will at times, but in my head I understand is a means to an end and not something I really want to do. When I get kind and giving people to repeatedly do things for me even though I've never reciprocated much but it's just their nature to do so it makes me believe this person is some kind of stupid. I gravitate towards kind people because they are more willing to give and I do recognize that people like that tend to be very happy and fulfilled; but I could never be like that and I would not like to be like that as I'd have to sacrifice personal gain and put more effort in others than I'm capable. Imagine your own attentional difficulties affecting work and school, but have it apply towards people aswell. I have that. I don't fake it. I just make it."

Same problem; being able to argue the benefit is a lot different to making it work. Part of the problem is that most people are really boring and not worth the effort. It's easy to see the benefit if it's immediate, but having to put in effort in lieu of some vague reward sometime in the future, possibly? No thanks; I'd rather be a c*nt. My parents took me to church in my early teens, I think as a last-ditch effort to make a difference, and I loved it. The people expected that you were nice and assumed you were good. It was like my birthday and Christmas rolled into one. I stole the wine, money from the collection plates, stuff that people left lying around. They were nice and they were naturally trusting. Add a charismatic, roguish personality and I got away with anything. I went to spiritual youth retreats, f*cked some bird who wanted to be a nun, took a silver cup from the convent or whatever it was called, and on it goes. All because the expectation was that people were good and they didn't see it coming. Short term, they lost. Long term? Well, I don't know how it turned out for any of them, but they probably have friends and relatives who still talk to them. And, given the chance, knowing what I know now? I'd do the exact same thing again. It was ######6 awesome. Better to burn out than fade away. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."

"Fantasies & Other Possible Narcissistic Traits What makes them appear more schizoid than narcy? Would you say people tend to have both coping mechanisms but one used more than the other? Suppressed affect or an inability to feel emotions is not an aspect of NPD, where emotional perception and range is typically unaffected. Thats really more an aspect of certain strands of dissociativity, psychosis-spectrum disorders and also - if not always - in SPD. Might also be a general aspect of ASPD though, I dunno much about that. Grandiose fantasies etc. or a fantasy-life like you describe is more typical for SPD. pwNPD also may have grandiose fantasies, but the quality is rather different I'd think. SPD is on the one hand side more about an inner retreat and the fantasies can be rather elaborate stories, while the narcissistic fantasies I would see as much moer ad-hoc and more towarsd the end of ""unrealistic expectations"". In addition SPD types seem - from what Ive read - to orient much more towards being ""different"", than NPD types; so unlike the [cliche] type NPD that needs others to tell them how amazing they are, SPD doesnt want others to tell him what they are at all, they dont want others to define them. So in general if theres a quality of ""splitting off"" I'd say thats more SPD, while NPD internally are orienting more towards integrating / merging others into their grandiose perception. My 2c. Would you say people tend to have both coping mechanisms but one used more than the other? Nah, I dont think ""normal"" people would use schizoid defenses, or maybe even anrcissistic defenses. Schizoid defenses are per definition indicative of some low-level organization, or in other words you'd be borderlinish or schizoid or something, not normal aka neurotic, to use them. Narcissistic defenses tbh I'M not sure what that would be, as there seem to be conflicting ideas about it. Just like with the former though I'd think that, if its about restoring grandiose self-perception, that might happen when the person is actively regressed, maybe due to some trauma or shock situation or something. dx: SPD"
What are your intentions? On a personal level I have good intentions but I find things turn to disaster quite easily if I don't follow a straight line. Just wondering if people with NPD have this kind of issue or not. I'm treading careful here because I don't know about this personality. England's Glory
"What are your intentions? Well...intention is a quaint word when it comes to NPD. The whole thought process of someone with narcissism is skewed because the rationalizations that go on through someone’s head are all to sheathe the true intentions to expell them from conscious awareness. That is because a lot of the times, the real underlying intentions might be looked down upon or completely invalidated and disallowwd by the superego. I went through 25 years of life almost entirely convinced that I was the good guy, no matter my actions, often being completely obtuse to how my actions and dispositions affected others. As far as I was concerned, my ‘true’ intentions were always good. I truly grew up trying my best to see the good in everyone, probably because I had hidden away how little I actually thought of myself. Also, a very odd thing about NPD is that somehow, the disordered mind is capable of also righting any wrongs like that and sometimes overwriting history/facts (either temporarily for convenience or permanently basically gaslighting one’s own Self) to set the record of intentions always to the side of the narcissist. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
What are your intentions? I think of something OJ Simpson said in an interview about him showing up and smacking Nichol Simpson around and breaking up her party. Something to the effect that he was mad at her for forcing him to act that way to help her see how she was screwing up her life. I can’t think of a better example of extreme narcissism justifying behavior.

I can relate to this. I don't go out of my way to have good intentions, but I do assume that I've not caused any harm, mainly because I under-estimate how my behaviour has affected people combined with a refusal to accept responsibility for it. I'll assume that people like me and that if they say that a problem isn't a problem I'll assume it's all over with and everything's back to normal. It's the grandiosity and narcissism. I know that I do it; sitting here and thinking about it, I know it happens, as there's too much evidence to deny it. But, I still don't really believe it. I still have the belief that people have over-reacted and I've been judged too harshly. Having someone in hospital because you've driven them to attempt suicide, I still think, ""It's their choice, they didn't have to stay,"" etc. Even as I write this, I still can't see it as my fault.

"What are your intentions? I believe I usually have good intentions that are thwarted by my defective brain, anxiety, narcissism, etc., although sometimes my intentions are to impress others at their expense. For instance, I sometimes tell people I'm going on a vacation for 10 days and talk about the details of the trip. I get angry if they don't appear impressed. And I know (or assume) it may make them feel jealous, insecure, or feel bad, but I do it anyway. So my intentions are mostly good, but colored by narcissism and insecurity. And sometimes if I'm retaliating against someone, my intentions are to right a perceived wrong and put myself back into the superior position. The intention isn't bad, per se; it's not sadistic just for the sake of sadism, although it can have the same effect. But mostly it is due to insecurity and the need to be the superior one. justonemoreperson wrote: SelfSerf wrote: I went through 25 years of life almost entirely convinced that I was the good guy, no matter my actions, often being completely obtuse to how my actions and dispositions affected others.

People with sociopathic/psychopathic traits tend to be unable and/or unwilling to accept responsibility for pretty much anything, and narcissists are quite similar, I think. I take some responsibility when I hurt someone, but I always try to find a way to blame them for some part of it, because responsibility is painful and exposes my imperfection and weakness. justonemoreperson wrote: SelfSerf wrote: I went through 25 years of life almost entirely convinced that I was the good guy, no matter my actions, often being completely obtuse to how my actions and dispositions affected others.

What are your intentions? My intentions are to satisfy me and me only. I don't give a $#%^ about anybody else. You get in my way and I'll take you down. I don't care who you are. I'll find a way to get to you if I think it's worth the effort.
"Respect, narc’y defenses and triggers Ok, so in a time long ago when testosterone flowed at peak levels this was perhaps my main concern. Anger perhaps alittle rage and conflict. The way I’ve chosen to deal with this is to play the perfect gentleman try to kill people with kindness and hopefully they don’t trigger (I hate that word) any unwanted reactions on my part. This works to some degree, I’ve kept out of trouble at work and I pretty much avoid all human beings whenever I can. Is it a perfect system no but it’s been working, sorta the problem is I detest that I have to do this, I feel like I shouldn’t have to change for someone else’s benefit. This also just causes the anger when it does come about to get turned inwards at myself, self medicating, other covert sneaky self destructive behavior I’m starting to catch on to. Today had someone deliberately trying to piss me off and I know what he was mad at but he didn’t know what was going on and was wrong, so I pulled my vehicle up on the side of him and let lose, absolutely destroyed him, am I proud of this, no but I did have a learning experience out of this, It felt good it felt great to just dump it all on him and not carry it around the rest of the day. Perhaps this is wrong, I don’t know that is just how I felt, right or wrong. I’d like to hear other people and what they think about this, I know kingping has mentioned looking for ways to better deal with these situations. If I had a volume knob this wouldn’t be an issue but I don’t I go from calm respectful normal guy to full on psycho with nothing in the middle back to normal again. I used to take it out in the gym only problem with that is I would intentionally push it to the point of destroying my body before I felt better. I told this guy after ear raping him to go f@$k himself and have a nice holiday lol Atleast I’m cordial"
"Respect, narc’y defenses and triggers I get pissed off real easy and get over it real quick. The thing is I can never remember what my anger is like. I have this really short memory for emotion it seems. I think it's because any emotion I feel at times is fleeting. It's there and it's gone again. A psychologist asked me once to explain certain emotions to her and I couldn't. How the f** do you explain something you hardly feel. Anger is probably the deepest emotion I experience but it's also shallow. I could be having an aggressive argument with one person online and having a pleasant conversation with another at the same time and neither would be aware of the other. One thing that triggers my anger is being disrespected, but that depends on the circumstance. You could insult me to my face one day and I wouldn't give a s***. Do it another day and I'll want to rip your head off. Another thing that triggers it is noise, certain noises that other people seem to be able to tolerate more, like someone mowing the lawn more often than expected. One of my neighbors used to mow his lawn a lot. I wanted to go out and put a f****** bullet in his head. I rarely express rage, but I think I must feel it a lot when angry because my first thoughts are usually always violent ones. It's funny, I can be calm as day in the middle of a severe storm (and I should know. I've lived through three of them) and yet I'll lose it over a pebble in my shoe. Sometimes it's the small things that bring out the beast in me. Last edited by realityhere on Wed Nov 27, 2019 4:32 pm, edited 2 times in total. Reason: Swear filter evasion not permitted."
"Respect, narc’y defenses and triggers @Zero I can relate to much of that. I have times when I'm less able to deal with keeping a lid on things. It started when I was a kid and I used to tell my parents that it felt like burning. I never really understood it, as it would come out of nowhere and I'd end up going feral. It still happens now, although not with the same ferocity. I think it's calmed down for a number of reasons. I think age has an effect, as you've mentioned. I'm not sure if this is due to physiological things like testosterone, as when I get aggressive I do so in the same manner as I used to. But I think there's an acceptance and a recognition of what's happening, and the awareness takes some of the power out of it. Having a wife who understands, to an extent, what's going on inside my head without judgement helps too. I think a lot of the problem is restriction. Good behaviour and following other people's guidelines creates a powder-keg of pressure which, at some point, is going to go boom. Now, when I'm heading there, she'll often notice before I become consciously aware of it, because I start becoming more distant and my language towards her is more detached. She'll then say, ""go out and shoot something; I've cancelled our plans to go out with friends tonight."" Weed helps too. Regarding confrontation. I'm very confrontational with pretty much everything, and if I get into a situation I'll push the other person hard to make a move and then all systems go, but usually people back down. I was driving through a local town and this guy was driving right up my arse, so I stopped the car in the middle of the street and got out, stood in front of his car and started shouting at him, what the ###$ he thought he was doing. I told him to get out of his car because I couldn't hear what he was saying but he just locked his door. I got back in the car and drove off. My wife said, ""Feel better?"" ""Yeah,"" ""Ok, stop at the shop, we need milk."" I guess what I'm getting at is, sometimes anger isn't a problem. Allowing it to come out in smaller doses will stop the build up so much, before you end up playing football with someone's head.

It still happens now, although not with the same ferocity. I think it's calmed down for a number of reasons. It sounds similar to the destructive urges I get, where I just want to destroy everything around me. They just seem to come out of nowhere because I don't recall anything triggering them. I just think it stems from a build-up of excess energy that turns hostile when there's not enough to stimulate and release it. I've had violent thoughts since early childhood, but the destructive urges didn't start until in my teens, so I don't know if it's even connected to that. As you know, I get homicidal urges as well, and while destructive urges may seem similar to that, they're different in that they make me want to destroy everything , not just kill someone. I think age has an effect I feel much more aggressive now than I did when I was younger. Regarding confrontation. I'm very confrontational with pretty much everything I find that hard to believe. Confrontational Tending to deal with situations in an aggressive way; hostile or argumentative . You've been on the forum for years and not once have I ever seen you show any serious hostility towards anyone or be confrontational. You usually come across as very passive. As far as I can tell, you don't even enjoy arguing and often avoid it. Me personally, I love confrontation. I love a good argument and the more aggressive it is, the more I like it, especially when there's potential for violence. It can be exciting in a mild kind of way (not always of course)."
"Respect, narc’y defenses and triggers Good behaviour and following other people's guidelines creates a powder-keg of pressure which, at some point, is going to go boom. This describes it quite well, usually because I’m trying extra hard to play the role, the role everyone else wants. I get a slice here and a slice there when it’s not reciprocated back. This goes on for awhile until there is the great release. Luckily I don’t get physically violent I just rant and rave. I’ve mentioned this to in therapy and her response was, She’s not calling me a violent person but she asked what would happen if someone did it right back to me... probably end badly for someone I’d imagine. Somehow I’d never thought of that before. I think I really need to get back into the gym after the holidays pass, just run it out of myself. -- Wed Nov 27, 2019 8:43 am -- @Reaper I’m the same way with emotions I experience them more in my head I can’t really describe somatic symptoms for most of it either. All I felt during this whole exchange was a little bit of anxiety in anticipation of what I might do and then a bit of exhilaration during the event itself, like a quick drop on a roller coaster then it was gone. Then I said ‘have a nice holiday’ and drove away."
"Respect, narc’y defenses and triggers ZeroZ wrote: I think I really need to get back into the gym after the holidays pass, just run it out of myself. It would be good if there was some way to be less reactive to it; some way to take control of the aggression in the first place, rather than just release the symptoms, but so far I've not found anything that really works. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Respect, narc’y defenses and triggers In jail, my anger management teacher taught to view anger as a secondary emotion which stems from a primary negative feeling, such as envy, disrespect, etc. I explained to her as well as I could my own system for dealing with anger. She liked my strategy, I deal with anger in a proactive manner in which I aim to get the particular thing that caused the emotion back under my control. You must regain the upper-hand if you wish not to have anger linger and possibly build up. When I'm successful, that anger turns into the satisfaction of winning. I use my emotions in a Machiavellian way rather than uninhibitedly letting out anger and frustration because I derive more satisfaction in asserting control and getting my way than releasing feelings to feel better. Of course I still lash out at times. Though even then, I'm consciously telling myself to let go and be aggressive because damn it sometimes feels great to induce fear. I don't fake it. I just make it."
"Respect, narc’y defenses and triggers I've been thinking about this a lot lately and I believe that I am my own trigger and I'll tell you why.. I was never an angry child. I always loved confrontation and fighting but I was always in control and I did it more for the reaction I got and the look on people's faces. I liked the status it gave me and the reputation, if you like. I came from an abusive home but spent most of my time in other people's houses or in care but I learned how to fake anger and aggression from my family even though I didn't feel the emotion behind it. But as I got older I started looking for triggers just so I could have an excuse to be violent. So I could have something to blame for my outbursts. Then one day without me realising the act became real and I actually started to feel the real pain of the anger burning inside me and all of a sudden I was out of control. I'm working on this nowadays and regaining my control back. Its been a hellish ride. I still like baring my teeth and growling. It makes me feel proud. I don't know why. England's Glory"
"Respect, narc’y defenses and triggers Haha @ growling I’ve done that. It’s just an impulse control issue with me, I believe, I don’t think well when I get to that point as your brain naturally turns off higher reasoning parts of the brain in favor of more primitive and instinctual ones. So combine impulse control issues with a brain that goes into impulsive survival mode and you don’t have a good recipe going."

It will make you the psychopath you always wanted to be. https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/books ... y_10026198 I should also note that nose damage has been linked to narcissim. You may have seen brad pitt, paris hilton and many others in the last ten years with significant eye problems. When an infectious agent gets into the nose, it irritates it, and eventually destroys the pituitary along with the eyes. Um. Enjoy the hong Kong riots! And btw.

"How does admiration make you feel? Hello, I am someone with a mix of ""Pure"" OCD (ruminating/intrusive thoughts) and narcissistic traits (I think); although where my OCD ends and traits begin, I do not know. I was wondering how admiration makes one with NPD feel? Might sound like a obvious answer, but I am curious. When I get admiration it can of course make me feel good, but it also makes me uncomfortable. I find that I try to brush it off and ""disperse"" the admiration to others around me, such as reflecting back to the person who gave the compliment with a compliment about them as well. It also triggers anxiety and intrusive thoughts. Any time I talk about myself I also get a uncomfortable feeling, and it makes me hyper aware of what I'm doing/saying, analyzing my interactions to see if I am indeed coming off as self-absorbed. I will also do this when thinking about previous conversations I have had, and frequently it makes me cringe. Do you ever think back on times when you've acted boastful/self absorbed? How does it make you feel?"
"How does admiration make you feel? Wow, we're very similar I think at least insofar as I have OCD traits + NPD traits, complicating the picture of both. For me, my OCD ""obsession"" (but it may be more a narcissistic obsession or grandiosity, or a mix of both) is about my looks. When people don't notice me or find me attractive, I go beserk internally (and sometimes do virtually anything to get their attention). That's a narcissistic thing, because I can't tolerate not being perfect and universally attractive to everyone. But when I do feel like I get lots of attention, I almost resent it and feel objectified. Basically, I can't win. More later, perhaps. Going to the gym now."
"How does admiration make you feel? Hi Covert, Thanks for the reply, and sorry that you're suffering. For me, my OCD manifests itself mostly as ""oh my god, what if I'm ___?"". This can various things, ranging from gay, narcissistic, pedophile, asexual, psychopath (that one was interesting ), etc. Currently my mind is stuck on narcissism, but just a few weeks ago it was gay/asexual. Since I do have self esteem issues I can get a little talkative and annoying, although idk if that is just my perception of myself (distorted by my OCD), or what others think of me as well. I basically just wish that I could live my life without the constant questioning. Do you find that you also have other ""obsessions"", or are they all narcissistic-focused?"
"How does admiration make you feel? Listening to this makes me think I’m more anti social than narcissistic, I generally don’t like people and don’t want their attention, I give respect and I want it back if I don’t get it I get violent urges. Sometimes I need validation on certain things but I don’t expect people to admire me and I tend to hate overt narcissistic types, loud flash people I don’t want them near me."

First of all, I'm gay, and being gay isn't that bad, so even if you are (and I highly, highly doubt it, given that OCD makes us think of things that usually aren't true and are worst-case scenario), it's not a bad reality. Yes, I do have other obsessions. Many are narcissistic, but some are not. I've had homicidal OCD where I worried I ran someone over. That no longer predominates. I've had hypochondria (arguably a form of OCD) where I was convinced I had brain cancer, schizophrenia, MS, ALS, etc. (sort of in remission, but rears its head quite often in more mild ways) I have a thing where I say the number ""77"" in my head when I'm avoiding attention or trying to repress my grandiosity (very weird, I know) I feel like if I do X, Y either will or won't happen—magical thinking part and parcel of OCD. But this often ties into my narcissism. For example, I have a need to be the most attractive person in a given place. So my intrusive thought is, for example, that if I have the thought, ""wow, I'm the most attractive person here,"" and I really obsess and get excited about it, then someone more attractive will show up. Weirdly, that seems to actually happen quite often (someone more attractive showing up randomly out of nowhere), so I can't help but believe there may be truth to it. But, this may be delusional. So, this may be an ego-dystonic thought, since my grandiosity makes me cringe--or, alternatively, it's simply me being worried about the possibility of that scenario (someone more attractive showing up) coming to fruition."

Thanks Covert. I've done some reading on Pure O OCD in the past, and in all of the things that I have thought I had (NPD, ASPD, etc.), Pure O was the only one where there was no anxiety/ruminating involved... Pretty telling if you ask me I definitely have no issues with actually being gay or gay people (I have tons of gay friends that I play sports with), I think it's more of the fact that it would I guess go against that I believe is a core of myself. Kind of like a betrayal to myself I guess? I dunno. Just curious, have you ever gotten therapy/medication specifically for your OCD? How effective was it?"

Just to clarify, do you mean when you sort of tested the thought of having Pure ""O"" OCD you didn't feel anxiety about it? I am familiar with that feeling, too. I mean, in theory, it could be a false indicator, since who wouldn't prefer to have an ego-dystonic order than a major, ego-syntonic characterological defect. Not saying it is in your case at all, just pointing out that it may not mean a whole lot in and of itself. But it's funny, because I can relate to testing different thoughts against the OCD thought processes/framework, seeing how they feel, and coming to conclusions based on that. Assuming, of course, that is what you meant. I have read a good book about OCD (Brain Lock) and seen several therapists more generally...probably 8-10 in my relatively short life. None has diagnosed me officially with OCD I don't think, but several have said I have tendencies/traits. I don't know why I can't just get a ######6 diagnosis. Driving me crazy not to have something definitive to latch onto. I have heard that CBT and exposure therapy can be effective for OCD. CBT requires you to do the homework, and since I have some kind of personality disorder or at least serious traits of one and I generally dislike myself very strongly, I always end up self-sabotaging, just to sort of prove to myself and the therapist that I'm too specially defective to fix. And as far as exposure therapy, in my case, I don't see what I'd be ""exposing"" myself to. There are no specific fears really at the moment, just obsessions and rumination."
"Anyone here an entrepreneur? Hey guys. Curious if any of my fellow narcissists here is an entrepreneur or small business owner? If so, how do you build your business and stay the course with narcissistic traits? There's virtually no instant gratification and lots of ego blows and rejection. And when something isn't easy and doesn't immediately work, I find it's super easy for me to give up and my grandiosity kicks in and says ""this other shiny object over here will be far easier and far more instantly successful."" I have virtually no sticktoitiveness. I've ""started"" countless businesses that I always lost total interest in within a few days to a maximum of a month or two. I split the businesses, like borderlines/narcissists do. When it's exciting and new, it's the greatest idea. When it gets too hard or not as novel, I split it to the extent it sounds awful and not right for me and I can't pick it up and work on it anymore and need to move onto the next exciting, short-lived thing. I want to be successful, but I feel like this disorder precludes it. In so many ways, this disorder is torture."

Your post is a bit abstract in describing what you do (and of course I understand that given this is an anonymous forum), so it's hard for me to understand, but it does sound like you enjoy what you do, which is important. As far as what I like doing, you're right, I probably do need supply, though I'm not positive. My supply now consists almost solely of strangers staring at and ogling me for my looks in my public. I've just started a podcast about current events and comedy, which may generate admirers/supply, but based on my track record, confidence and faith that I'll keep it up and really work on it and build it up is almost nil. I also love technology and have since I was a little kid. So I enjoy creating software products/solutions, but I never see them through to completion, and I find the sales and marketing daunting and usually give up when that becomes critical. -- Wed Nov 20, 2019 1:45 pm -- salles wrote: Apparently having narcissistic traits should be an advantage to being an entrepreneur according to this article. https://www.fastcompany.com/3061922/entrepreneurs-four-worst-personality-traits-and-the-one-that-can-redeem-them It looks at four of the more common negative personally traits entrepreneurs tend to share, plus one.

Most majorly successful business leaders--especially outside the Silicon Valley software/hardware companies which seem to often be the creations of seemingly well-adapted young people out of Ivy League schools--has some significant personality quirks. Bill Gates, who seems level-headed, has been known to be pretty mean and blunt when he doesn't like something; same with Steve Jobs, who however possessed far more charisma and persuasiveness. Even someone like Richard Branson seems to possess the ""excessive"" risk-taking and boldness the article mentions. He's also a maverick, eccentric, and a bit of a daredevil physically, doing kitesurfing, skydiving, flying across the Atlantic in a balloon, and sailing."

"Serious question NPD... I don't meet the full criteria NPD supposedly, but ""narcissistic defenses"" according to my psychologist--which is surprising, because vulnerable narcissism causes me misery every single day. My father is narcissistic, but I don't think he is quite pathological. Or maybe he mellowed with time. The narcissism mostly manifests in him thinking he's always right and knows everything, almost a God complex. He pretends he's humble and says he doesn't know much, but actions (or in this case, advice or wisdom in specific situations that call for it) speak louder than abstract words. He also has a lot of followers in his business, which I'm sure he enjoys. But he isn't the traditional, peacocking overt narcissist. More subtle and less harmful, which is why I doubt he meets NPD criteria. Studies have shown that narcissism is one of the most heritable traits, so this makes sense. I wish I never inherited it. It's a curse."
"Magical thinking Do you engage in it and to what extent? Maybe it’s a manifestation of OCD or just weird beliefs/jinxes, anything goes. Even paranormal theories if it comes to that. Like, as a child I used to count my steps while out walking. It was kind of something to ruminate on. It did not involve any beliefs about the steps necessarily but I felt compelled to count to 5 on certain kinds of pavement, then start from 0 on a different path. Things have escalated from that quite a bit. To the dismay of Akuma here I engage in a variety of frequency programming stuff, i.e listen to energy centred meditations every night and hypnosis from time to time. Until I discovered this...which freaked me the ###$ out. Will refrain from describing exactly what I felt while using this video, as I’ve engaged in many a long rant about my supernatural experiences in prior threads. I do urge any you to give this a try though. https://youtu.be/mWxuQphPCWI “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
Magical thinking Nice synchronicity selfserf. Ill just add that Ive been temporarily cured from NPD (true self revived at full capacity and in control) by my twin flame (same soul in two different bodies) being in love with me. I felt her fall in love telepathicaly and that gave me narcissistic injury and a psychotic epsiode. Im cured as long as she loves me. She doesnt know Im cured yet and I got fired.
"Magical thinking I engage in magical thinking constantly. I have OCD, I believe, never formally diagnosed because it doesn't fit the classic hand-washing or checking (although I do get the latter to some degree), but is more pure-obsessional (pure-O) OCD. For instance, if I'm an airplane, I'll have a positive, optimistic, yet intrusive thought like ""we won't have turbulence."" I then have to neutralize that thought by thinking ""we might have turbulence,"" which leads to me obsessively focusing on and looking for any signs of turbulence. I feel like there is a true connection between thought and the real world (thought-action fusion). It also ties heavily into my narcissism. For instance, I'll have the thought, ""I'm gorgeous,"" which makes me mentally cringe and feel the need to immediately resist and counter that thought with ""no I'm not""."" Because if I think I'm gorgeous, I'll walk around with overconfidence (grandiosity) and inevitably be shot down by the real world and my actual attractiveness level (vulnerable narcissism). Magical thinking also occurs for me in perhaps non-strictly-OCD related ways and more narcissistic/borderline. For instance, I'll split into two fragmented ""personalities"" of sorts, where in one split I'm perfect, everyone finds me attractive, no one will reject me, etc. And in the other split, I'm disgusting, repulsive, no one wants me, etc. The magical thinking is that each split actually creates its own, independent reality, if that makes any sense. Very strange and very disturbing. Torture actually."

"case study: ""cured"" narcissist SelfSerf wrote: If I may ask, Ive been wondering — how is your wellbeing so many months after your revelationa with psychedelics? am assuming a lot of it has faded into the background and is not so pertinent anymore Yes I have doubts whether I truly understand her or if its a psychotic bubble. But I still think only about her and how to get in touch with her. My mate will be sending her a message. The psychedelics were usefull in facilitating change. Mostly dealing with the feelings I still have for her. My feelings have been changing depending on the understanding of the situation, and psychedelics make it easier to find and integrate the new feelings and the Jungian views on personality. Example: Ive just been integrating the perspective that we might have been mirror souls http://www.thelawofattraction.com/twin-flames/ . And that means that only she is important ever. I would have never thought Id be looking to sites like that for answers but they are the best explanation I have for what happened. And Im wondering why Im still a ""we"" and why I still dont understand that other people exist. I mean what Is there to admire. I have nothing left to do except thinking about how could I be so ###$ up and why I never had anything becouse of it. Why I couldnt even spend time with her. At least Im not feeling lonely. Not becouse im not, I am lonely, but im not feeling it, all I realy need is myself. Also the new Joker film perfectly describes my situation, so I do feel understood in ways.

Yes I did try, all I did in my last 5 workplaces was looking for a girlfriend. And I got fired from each and every one becouse Im still mentaly ill self abusive. No matter that nothing will ever be as good, I just dont want to be alone anymore, like you said hopefully I learned enough to not hate the next girl. But recently after the 2nd hyperspace event me and the OCD friend that's been seeing me through this agreed that if Im still self abusive, doesnt make sence to have other people in my life. So I realy have nothing except what I learned from my ""relationship"" with her, so I dont know the only solution I have for the moment is dreaming up the relationship, holding my pillow thinking of her and imagining her forgivness. I had that idea before Arthur imagined his relationship in the Joker by the way. I am still repeating the same mistakes, unable to change anything. At least I had an in-detail illustration how the disociative processes work while chatting with her best girlfriend, over the course of 9-10 months. How I just imagined the person im talking to, as stupid as old me, so she didnt need to write back. She was too stupid, she just listened to the wisdom of the buddha. How your not able to understand, even thought you wrote it precisely . That she hates you becouse you broke her best girlfriends heart (thats not the reason). And what was realy happeneing was I had to trust her completely and go desperate for her becouse she hated me, like for all the girls before. Always a disaster. What I thought was love, thats why I didnt know I wasnt in love before."

Case in point. Yes, 100%. Individuation is exactly what I´ve been pondering about lately. It´s boiled down to the idea that I absolutely abhor my dad on some days but on most days this hate towards him and his mannerisms is the only emotion I experience so am really defined by this. Am defined by my enemy so to speak. And so is it with my Grandmother where on some days it seems like she has this trouble with individuation herself being HPD and having parentified me after her daughter (my mother) died. The thing is, all that you (Akuma) have written in response to my rambling threads was difficult for me to fathom when you first posted the because I was expecting something different - validation mostly I reckon so I swept it aside. Some of meanings of those posts have started to make more sense to me. I had some weird epiphany yesterday where I admitted some fearful thoughts and feelings of regret about my life so far. It didn´t necessary lead anywhere but a part of me kind of snapped out of the bubble of a victim mentality and understood that if I don´t change my circumstances, nothing will either. A complete snap out of it unfortunately does not seem possible for now because this weird mixture of defenses I have keep shifting the blame - ASPD traits externalize it to my lack of good parental figures during my upbringing, my current situation, the way the world is set up and the schizoidish part is more like (I´ll just wait here until someone takes notice of me, which realistically could be forever because everyone has their own lives). Am not out of the woods by any means but I guess this weird split of ruthlessness VS absolute idling (you need to be productive to make something of yourself - you´re okay doing ###$ all - none of it matters) is something I´m at least getting the hang of. But yeah the truth is it´s very difficult for me to care about much these days so making ""real goals"" for myself is kind of on the wayside. And I do believe some of what you wrote might apply to AProphet as well... I would also add that the problem with doing psychedelics for someone with a personality disorder is obviously the disillusionment one goes through, like ""WHAT? This didn´t bring any insight either?"" Coupled that with entitlement ""THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK"" and you have yourself a foul mixture. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"

Learning complex theories from the internet and looking for answers isnt childish, childish would be running away and retreating to a imaginary world where she forgives me and we live happily everafter, which I do too, just becouse I have no better solution at the moment and it realy hurts. The spiritual solutions arent quick fixes mind you, Im still using them to further understand the new perspectives, just becouse they work best. Dosing 2c-b and looking inward, locating the feelings I have and working threw them (they call this ""the feeling process"" for the ""emotional body"", Idk it realy is that simple). Im doing quite the oposite of denying my needs, Im actualy aknowledging them for the first time. Whats interesting, in analytical psychology proposed by Jung individuation means something different. He understands that as the lifelong process of furthering your awareness, f.e. integrating unconsciouss aspects into consciouss awareness. About the symbolic relationship you mention: thats actualy the fundamental problem of NPD, that the internal representations are disconnected from the real world. The ideas in the mind are always some kind of symbol or representation, but for NPD especialy this relationship strays into pathological territory (other people dont exist etc.).

NPD perspective what will realy help ? So I am the SO to a workaholic narsaccist. When it was just me in the firering line I didn't mind I know my NPD has issues of his own and he needed to take them out on some one. I am DID (aka multiple personality) so when things got bad I would just switch. I could cope. But recently the controling behavior has been moved onto our daughter. She is not equiped to deal with this and doesnt understand why daddy flips between loving and bullying. I dont want to break up our marriage but if things keep going this way (tageting daughter) then I will for her sake. What can I do to help my husband he wont seek help. If you could honestly talk to your SO's about what you need. What would it be? just Peter now cos the others all hidin

If you could honestly talk to your SO's about what you need. What would it be? Any difference in behavior causes a shame reaction in the narcissistic parent. They naturally treat their offspring as extensions. You need to accept the child as it is, all its strenghts and weaknesses, for a healthy upbringing. Challenge your husband and explain that, see how he reacts. Warning, criticism might upset him."
"NPD perspective what will realy help ? Wow, that sounds hard. If he is highly narcissistic he may not listen to your explanations. I fear you will not be able to protect your daughter always. I work with people who are going through this and its very tough. You may decide to leave both for yourself AND your daughter. get support and maybe go on a carer forum as well as this one - there are FB groups for partners. I wish you well."
"NPD perspective what will realy help ? I wholeheartedly agree with the 2 posters above. People who try to control their children often feel helpless deep down, if you could try to get that through to him and stand your ground, you might challenge his ego just enough, that he will think about it twice."
"Loneliness I am a recovered Covert NPD and have found myself at the age of 58 alone. No kids or partner. I had 9 years psychodynamic psychotherapy and am now helping others in their recovery journey. I have lost a few friends over the last 10 years. some I regret, some not so much... Some it was definitely due to my illness, some it was because they werent really friends just wanted to suck me dry. One betrayed me and I was devastated. I have one close friend who I helped through a major physical illness. She's good, but could do with therapy herself. Sometimes she annoys me, though. Others interstate.

"Loneliness Hey Stillface, You are definitely not alone. Stillface wrote: Some it was definitely due to my illness, some it was because they werent really friends just wanted to suck me dry. One betrayed me and I was devastated. Wanted to comment on this thought. Yea, I think people with NPD can end up consciously or unconsciously choosing others who value them for appearances, and what you can do for them. A repeat of what many people with NPD learn. 'I am valued for what I accomplish, for my independence, for what I do for others' Good to read that you are aware of that, and even though that awareness has now lead to a position of feeling lonely, I think it's wise to avoid getting into another round of friends/partners who will bleed you dry again.

"Loneliness Sorry to hear this. I'm a self-diagnosed vulnerable narcissist (though apparently don't qualify for full NPD diagnosis) and I'm extremely lonely. Even when I'm with a group of people, I often feel alone and not really a part of things, like I'm a fraud and they''ll find out I don't belong in the friend group any minute (which isn't unfounded, since that seems to almost always happen after some time). I haven't been able to form romantic relationships because of my entitlement and constant narcissistic rage at not being admired, people not giving me the respect and admiration I feel I deserve, etc. I often don't feel life is worth living and have suicidal thoughts several times a day. So yes, you are definitely not alone... have you checked out Meetup.com? They have groups where you can meet others with your interests. Can be cool."

"Self-Loathing xDude evoked self-loathing in a previous post... Being hypercritical myself, this is a topic I explored in therapy, but mostly with a few people during private conversations. Anywho, I'm curious about how self-loathing manifest itself in your daily life? If it does at all? What's your take on how self-loathing articulate with narcissism?"
"Self-Loathing Technically I would always say, self-loathing is never really in good harmony with narcissism, because narcissism is about positive investment into yourself, or about withdrawing [love] energy from the outside and plugging it into your self. Personally I dont self-loathe really. I might have negative perceptions of myself and sometimes rather bad ones, but I see them more like unemotional facts. The only place where I could find self loathing is if I regard my mind/body split. There I loathe (is that a verb) a lot of my physiological reality. I loathe migraines, I have some weird new asthma-like crap that is very distracting and annoying, vertigo and other possibly psychosomatic (?) things that I really hate. So in a way I could say I find this body really crappy and with that, if you would remove the split I would of course say that I find a big part of myself crappy. But it doesnt occur to me like that. Overall, while I'm more of an internalizer than an externalizer I would still think that I am much more prone to loathing reality and life itself. dx: SPD"
"Self-Loathing I pretty much hate myself 99% of the time. The only time I don't is when I'm in a grandiose mood, but even then I hate myself for being grandiose, lol. I've accomplished very little in my life. Many people are impressed when I say I've started a business, but it's been flagging and hasn't grown much, if at all, since I started it nearly 9 years ago.

"Self-Loathing This has manifested in me recently. I engage in a creative endeavour as a hobby, and recently had some minor success with it. People were telling me they really liked what I did. All the time I'm telling myself I'm just an imposter who got lucky, that all those other people who do what I do are the 'real' ones. I see the compliments but instead of feeling pleased or uplifted I feel bemused or even completely indifferent."
Self-Loathing Self loathing is at the core of NPD from my understanding in fact it’s the entire reason the narcissism develops in the first place. The narcissist isn’t usually aware of this I don’t think. I would bet this is what is behind a lot of the self destructive behavior

But I agree, most pwNPD are not aware of this self-hatred, and they likely don't actively self-hate. So for all intents and purposes, there is no self-hatred, at least in grandiose narcissists. Not sure about people like me, the more vulnerable sort."
"Transference focused psychotherapy Has anyone had success or heard anything about transference-focused psychotherapy, pioneered by Otto Kernberg, for NPD and/or NPD with BPD traits (or the other way around)? I'm looking into this. Unfortunately, it looks like it requires 2-3 sessions per week, which in my city would probably amount to about $2,000 per month. Ridiculously unaffordable. But I'm curious about any feedback anyone might have?"
"Transference focused psychotherapy The Internal Family Systems Model (IFS) is an integrative approach to individual psychotherapy developed by Richard C. Schwartz. It combines systems thinking with the view that mind is made up of relatively discrete subpersonalities each with its own viewpoint and qualities. IFS uses family systems theory to understand how these collections of subpersonalities are organized. This is suposedly cutting-edge psychotherapy. But yeah, Kernberg knew his $#%^."

Everyone needs to put bread on the table, and some want more than that for their families or themselves. I’m conflicted about that because on some level, it does seem to make the profession less “pure” in motive and for a cynic like me can make it seem disingenuous, but it’s also a necessary fact of life and of humans to want to make money and feel secure and comfortable."
"Identity disturbance in NPD? Does pathological narcissism, esp of the vulnerable kind, have identity disturbances or identity issues like BPD? If so, how do they typically manifest? I've been told I have identity disturbance (although only after one session, so I'm taking it with a grain of salt until I see him a couple more times), so I'm curious. Examples: Career-wise, I've done everything from sitting for the police officer exam (even though I kind of hate cops) to sales to IT. I've been in IT since then, but I still get new ideas all the time. These ""phases"" last anywhere from a day to a few months. I also feel like I don't have many internalized, strongly held values or beliefs. Never had a favorite color or favorite band as a kid. I've always felt insincere, uncommitted, and arbitrary when people asked what I believe in, so I make up whatever approximates something that I feel I should have. Maybe not that extreme all the time, but sometimes it feels that way. I moved to the city I live in now for no real reason. I started doing stand-up comedy with my friend but it feels empty and I don't know why I'm doing it. Basically, I feel like I'm always lost and drifting with no real purpose, intention, or ""why"" in life. I know I'm interested in computers and business, and that's about it. I kind of feel like a shell and a fraud of a human being."
"Identity disturbance in NPD? Ok interesting. I do have certain fixed interests. But all in all - there is no fixed me.

But you could put me anywhere and like a plant I would just go on and adapt to that situation. But I dont feel bad about it.

I moved to this big city where I live without knowing anyone and I've managed, albeit being pretty miserable.

"Identity disturbance in NPD? This is Kernbergs view on personality orientations. https://www.seabhs.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&id=584 It does a good job of explaining the differences in identity structure between the three types.

Also I can relate to what kingping said about survival of the fittest. I feel like it’s the only way to survive at times and that everyone would leave me for dead if I let them.

I relate very well to the BPO. On a more practical, dsm oriented level, I feel, at least intuitively, that perhaps one of the biggest differentiators between a more narcissistic orientation and a borderline one is that narcissists reinvent themselves in that survival of the fittest way you and Kingpin describe. It sounds like it’s not necessarily painful or ego-dystonic for you, or is that an incorrect assumption? For me, it is quite painful. I don’t like and feel tired of acting. I most of all long to be comfortable and happy just being me and being accepted. I want to be perfect, but I think it’s mostly out of fear of what it means to not be perfect to my mind—rejection and exclusion. I feel I must be perfect to survive and be happy and loved. I do still have elements of grandiosity, but if I could feel safe and good about myself dropping the need to be perfect, I probably would. It still hurts badly on an egotistical level to think about not being universally admired or better than everyone. But hopefully I can get over that."

I would comment becouse If you are indeed affected by the disorder, you are not the person you think you are, rather a false-self. But identity is a very personal thing. Every understand this differently and the view is distorted becouse we pick and choose which facts we pay attention to. I would only comment that a false-self has no identity (and no personality), an adaptive reaction like kingPinX described, side you show to the world (Jungian Persona).

"NPD bf of 2 years has been seeing a man. Is he gay? I'm confused and heartbroken. I've been in a rocky, on-off-on-off again relationship with a covert type, somatic Narcissist. I did not diagnose him on my own, he has several times over the years told me his issues and that he suspects he is, but refuses to get treatment for it. Sometimes he has periods of clarity where he doesn't seem disordered at all, but most of the time he slips into it along with all the typical somatic behaviors that come with it. I've been working on myself to erect boundaries and extract myself from the relationship and I'm in a much better position than I was before, but I still slip up and get involved with him again. The entire two years we've been ""together"" (I say that loosely because we could barely go 3 months without him vanishing without a trace, before resurfacing again several weeks later.) he would triangulate me with three specific women. I never met these women, nor did I know them, but he would give me context clues such as where they lived, what they did for a living, etc. Whenever he and I were on the ""outs"", he'd invariably let it be known to me that he was with one of these women. He is a businessman and splits his time pretty equally between 3 cities. Long story short, and unfortunately I can't give all the details here because they are too specific, but I accidentally found out, unexpectedly, that all 3 of these ""women"" he's been talking about are actually all the same person, and that person is a gay man. There is a plethora of information about this person available online. This person also lives in, works in, and regularly travels to the exact same cities that my ex-bf spends time in for work. In fact, they used to live less than a mile away from each other. All the details match, age, career(s) (he has more than one and they all match each of these mythical women he's told me about), living and working location, 100% the conclusion is that all these women he's told me about is actually just a gay male he's been seeing. Further, I've drawn the conclusion that their relationship pre-dates ours and that I'm likely the ""side"" person in the equation here, and this man is his primary relationship. Again, I can't go into the details without seriously risking their privacy but this nearly for certain is the case. I really don't know what to think. I'm in a state of shock. He has several gay male friends, one of his work partners is gay, he seems comfortable in his sexuality and being masculine or feminine, so I'm surprised he feels the pressure to be in the closet. I am so confused! I'm oscillating between sadness for him that he feels he has to hide this big secret, but I also wonder if this is just how pwNPD are, they don't care where supply comes from as long as it's supply? This ‘other wo-man’ is clearly good supply. Semi - famous, intellectual, beautiful, essentially a younger v 2.0 of himself. I'm not mad. I'm not going to call him out. I’m not going to confront. But I have no idea what to do or say or think now. I spent all night bawling, partly out of sadness, partially relieved for having an answer to this weirdness, finally, but now I feel numb and I need to talk to someone about this. If I stuff this inside of me and move on without discussing this with someone, I'm afraid I'm going to end up falling into a depression of this whole charade of a relationship that I stupidly hoped would still somehow work out in the end. I just need to get this out. I haven't said anything and won't. We're not on speaking terms as of yesterday, which is also when I found out. Any advice on how to proceed in a responsible manner in this situation would be appreciated."
"NPD bf of 2 years has been seeing a man. Is he gay? Most of what you writing here seems to be head-cinema. If you want to be ""responsible"" , then have a talk with him about your fears. In addition I would suggest talking to your therapist about this and if you dont have one then to get one, at least for short-term counceling, that can be very helpful in getting another perspective on things. dx: SPD"
"NPD bf of 2 years has been seeing a man. Is he gay? If by ""head cinema"" you think I'm making it up or imagining things, that's not the case. I know for a fact he's been hiding a long-term relationship with another man, and has instead been pretending to be seeing various women instead. As mentioned in the post, I didn't include those details for privacy reasons, but suffice it to say, this is not something that I'm pulling out of thin air, there's pretty concrete evidence, I'll leave it at that."

I mean youre wasting time by trying to figure it out via your imagination and making a thread on a forum. Noone here knows the guy. You should talk to him or let it go. But even if you let it go you probably wont get around talking to him sooner or later anyways. What is clear from here are two things. First of all gay men dont date women, so theres some issue there you should resolve. Secondly you have a relationship with someone you apparently dont trust and where you would rather ask total strangers who can't give you answers, instead of having a talk with him. Thats not healthy, which is why again I invite you to see a therapist. dx: SPD"
"Inverted Narcissistic Craving Hello! I'm a 24-year-old gay man in Australia. I have a younger boyfriend, it's not yet apparent to me if things will work out but so far it's going okay. I read a link someone posted about Inverted Narcissism and am surprised to find parts that strongly apply to me. Would I call myself an inverted narcissist? I don't think so... but maybe. I literally only discovered the term a day or so ago. Narcissism usually seems to come from our upbringing. I've looked back on my life, early developmental years, and found interesting circumstances and things that could have shaped my current personality. Childhood: It was lovely. Before I hit puberty life was lovely. Sometimes my parents confused me with their irregularities. In kindergarten I was nice to everyone and my classmates would ask me why I was so nice, why I'd lend things without expecting them back. And I just understood the Golden rule and that was that. I was rarely ever a brat. I did, however, have a weird masochistic compulsion that made itself apparent when I was as young as ten or eleven. I don't know what caused it. I tried to make myself the butt of jokes. I actively humiliated myself and made myself out to be an idiot as a ways of entertaining other people. I feel uncomfortable to admit that. I don't understand where the pathology came from. If you believe in past lives and spirituality, there could be something there. Anyway, what I did went beyond being a 'class clown', I was never one to misbehave. I encouraged people to mock and ridicule me, and I don't know why. I made myself out to be an idiot. As a teenager I had intense self-hate and depression for no reason I could understand. My family does have a history of mental illness on both sides. I continued to be a disgusting idiot, I think I degraded myself to please other people. How strange. I had a form of dysphoria about body hair and it made me disgusted by myself. Anyway I think that in my late teenage years after some changes (including shaving, which had never occurred to me at the time), my self-esteem slingshotted the other way into narcissism, in some regards. I do believe the inverted narcissist can alternate as the situation allows, but perhaps only in some ways and not completely. A truly fascinating condition now that I've read into it and its counterpart. I did and do often feel that I'm extremely beautiful, sometimes the most beautiful person I've ever seen. I became deeply religious at a young age and so altruism became further embedded in my psyche. I'm not religious anymore though still have spiritual beliefs. I am, even now, realising how much my personality is truly shaped by this disorder. I'm undiagnosed. I never believed I had a disorder, until this literal moment. I'm well-functioning. I do get obsessive and delusional. Wow... narcissism... inverted narcissism, a personality disorder. I was very lonely all my life and wanted nothing more than a boyfriend. I even self-harmed over it I was so depressed and despairing. It was all-pervasive, this need to have a relationship. The genetic disposition of my family, the intense depression and self-hating of my early teenage life, tendency to be stuck in mental loops and later despair over and need for dating is probably what shaped me to be this way. My first relationship lasted six months, he had anxiety that he takes medication for now. The relationship was one-sided and I was extremely attentive and doting, I believed that he needed the care because of his condition. I didn't love him and didn't care much when he broke up with me. I believe my current and former boyfriend also felt that I was in love with them just because of how I was, but the truth is I am simply very attentive and doting and enthralled by my partners. I crave someone to worship, someone who I can be their narcissistic supply. If I had to choose I'd rather date a codependent because I want stability in a relationship, certainly need it if I am to love at my strongest. I sometimes like to dominate, I certainly like to provide care, which is why I'd want a codependent. The idea of being with or worshipping a narcissist is still exciting for me to contemplate. I don't think I could give an inverted narcissist the bullying they may require. Anyway... input will be highly valued by me. Thanks for reading."
"Inverted Narcissistic Craving Thanks for sharing. Lets start with this. I could have edited your post, but on second thought there is no need for you to read your post again, you spent enough time editing, so just a sample so I can get threw to you with what I mean: ""As a teenager I had intense self-hate and depression for no reason I could understand. I always hoped for the best, tried to apply the golden rule to everyone, care about everyone, even if I didnt care about myself, didnt think I could undo the damage done to me. I never liked myself the way I was, I often drifted off into fantasy where I was better, more witty, successfull and accepted for who I am. I actively humiliated myself and made myself out to be an idiot as a ways of entertaining other people. I thoughts its ok, I liked making others laugh, maybe most of all things. I was always the class clown. I missbehaved a lot, could never fit in to societie's rulestructure. Anyway I think that in my early twenties after some changes (moving out to student dorm, taking care of myself), my self-esteem slingshotted the other way into narcissism, in some regards. I became deeply atheistic at a young age and saw humanity as a kind of a ""spaceship earth"". Altruism became deeply embedded im my psyche, I thought I love all people, becouse of the destiny we share on this planet. This made me often taken advantage of. Im undiagnosed, but I always believed myself to be pahological. I shared this thought with my sister, who also held this belief. I was very lonely all my life, but didnt believe a girlfriend would help that. I could connect to some people in some regards, but never felt anyone truly understood me."" My hope is to illustrate how much the disorder shapes your behavior. Now about your newly aquired self-awareness (""I posses inverted-narcissist traits""). You must understand that this awareness does not equal the awareness of ones actions, why one does the things he does. One of the characteristics of NPD is the lack of the capacity to self-reflect. This one makes sence. One couldnt be self-abusive if he understood, that he does it. You cannot know, or you might actualy stop. You say: ""Wow... narcissism... inverted narcissism, a personality disorder"" Yes, I faced disbelief like that, just like you did, when I first found out. Now you bring up a key difference. I had many short relationships, which all failed and I just didnt believe I should make someone unhappy, by being with a pathological person like me. I thought Ill just be alone, doing my things, learning about the world, an observer, living vicariously threw my intellectual and artistic pursuits. Your craving to be with someone has led you on the right path to answer the questions you've always had. NPD is to be primarily understood threw your relations to other people. You must be aware by now that you lack emotional empathy, the ability to empathise or emotional intelligence, and whole object relations,without which you cannot understand or meaningfully relate to other people. We can talk later in detail how this works, but for now be aware that the feelings you are having are not the same feelings other people have. You dont think of yourself as emotionally shallow do you? Did you think you were the most empathic, caring person as well? You say that you crave to be supply to someone, but that is a very recent realisation right? I did exactly that, it was stronger than me, but without realising it. Actively seeking the abuse. I am very ashamed of that. Id advise you to investigate codependancy further, you dont have the right idea yet. A codependant is primarily someone who stays in the relationship regardless of the abuse inflicted. They are deeply sacrificial and need the other persons validation. I have no doubt you could make a codependant happy, though, just by accepting her as she is. You could give another invert the bullying he requires under special circumstances, one author explains a method, you'd have to be in a life crisis following narcissistic injury, to shift your patterns while he restores your supply and hope. Dont be so sure about that anyway, I did find myself abusing inverts when I felt justified by their actions (stupidity, dishonesty). Not for my pleasure, becouse I believed I have to give them a lesson."
"Inverted Narcissistic Craving Thanks for the feedback, though I'm a little confused by parts of it. I don't need to edit my post at all, I'm happy with it as it is, which is why I posted it like that. I have only recently seen that parts of how Inverted Narcissism is described apply to me, but as I have many successful friendships and relate to people mostly well, I wouldn't say I'm all that sick. You could say I'm in denial, but due to my life evidence and experiences I just really doubt I'm consumed by any disorder. I think if anything, my personality may be atypical, but I have atypical interests. Thanks anyway."
"Inverted Narcissistic Craving Inverted narcissism is a theory coined by Sam Vaknin. Not that Mr. Vaknin is wrong on everything, but all of his subtypes certainly are rubbish. You either have a grandiose sense of self or not. You either crave perfection and superiority or not. A person having little actual narcissism, healthy or pathological, being a narcissist themselves makes absolutely no sense. NPD has very specific criteria. There are no subtypes that deviate from that criteria. Look at the criteria, do you think any apply to you? If not, maybe you just have low self-esteem or anxiety issues or even another PD. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hndyTy3uiZM"
"Inverted Narcissistic Craving Hmmm I dunno. I used to have self-esteem issues but not anymore. I'm not so fixed, I swing around but in ways that seem pathological. Something was realised by me when I read that article, it was fascinating and I could sense that parts were correct. I know that when you're disordered your feelings are the last things you want to trust, but it just sounded right and felt right, so it's worth considering."

Only the expression and severity of the traits actually differs inbetween you. Like I tried to show in my example, editing OP's words as if they were my own. dontlookathim wrote: NPD has very specific criteria. There are no subtypes that deviate from that criteria. No subtypes for NPD? why is there million google results for covert narcissism (realy should be called inverted, but its the fault of the researchers that they still cant clearly define the category, that confuses people). Maybe you should start thinking, instead of following your holy book, DSM-5. Anyway your idiocy is enraging. Just like mine was enraging. Still is enraging to me."

Your self esteem depends on external validation, aka narcissistic supply at the moment (Asuming your intuition is correct and you do see inverted traits in yourself, but best go to a specialist for a diagnosis) so any fix is nescesairly temporary. They wont be able to diagnose you with inverted narcissism becouse they dont believe that criterion exists. But being diagnosed with NPD, or even knowing you lack empathy or self reflection is a big step forward. Exactly the oposite, you need to trust yourself. Not your feelings, thats true, becouse you dont actualy have genuine feelings yet (not getting into the details). But you should trust analitical psychology, fathered by Karl Gustav Jung. Start learning about his methods and terminology. Start recording and interpreting your dreams.

"Inverted Narcissistic Craving I can relate to a lot of your post. I'm also gay, almost 30 in the U.S. I almost always feel lonely. I crave and require admiration and attention—although you didn't mention much about this, which if you didn't need this as a narcissist would be very rare, almost excluding such a diagnosis. I also felt terrible about myself (and my body hair, for that matter!) in adolescence--and still do most of the time. I also felt ugly and slingshotted into the other extreme of often feeling amazing looking and beautiful when people stare at and admire me. Your belief about being the most beautiful in the world borders on, if not being, delusional, as literally NO ONE is the most beautiful in the world or the smarter. I say this as someone who's been called ""incredibly handsome,"" beautiful, etc. (Never gorgeous though, which is still upsetting.) So I'm not coming at it from someone who's not attractive and wouldn't get it. First, A) Beauty is subjective, and B) there is ALWAYS someone better looking. BTW, this is something I really cannot tolerate either as a narcissist. And I understand it intellectually but cannot emotionally accept it and when I'm confronted in the real world by a more attractive person, I typically freak out and find a way to boost my self-esteem. When I'm with a good looking friend and they get more attention, I get extremely jealous and angry. Your class-clown type behavior, your self-hatred, all these sound like low self-esteem with compensatory narcissism. Maybe vulnerable narcissism, as I think they're often related or even one in the same. The main questions are, do you have empathy? Do you have the real ability to self-reflect and introspect or do your internal mechanisms seem inaccessible? Do you apologize and feel guilt when you do something wrong, or is it purely shame-based or externalizing?"
"Inverted Narcissistic Craving Pathological narcissism is all about a fragile ego and low self esteem covered by a grandiose or idealized version the narcissist thinks want to see. The pwNPD may or may not be aware of this fact, most aren’t as it would disrupt the delusion, but some know deep down it’s all a sham. High levels of healthy narcissism isn’t a personality disorder, thinking you are great no matter what happens is great, I don’t see any downsides too it, narcs if nothing else have an UNSTABLE ego."
"Unashamed Narcissists Are there any unashamed narcissists on here? People who accept it's just the way we are. It's just the way the world made us so who cares? I don't ever see posts in this part of the site about narcissists talking about how great they are. Everyone here seems to be ashamed of the condition, but surely there's got to be worse things to experience than being self-involved and self-aggrandizing? I've not come across any 'mean' posts here. Nobody talking about things they've done and enjoyed. It's all very moralistic and subdued."
"Unashamed Narcissists im relatively unashamed, compared to the average person w NPD. someone by the name of greebo aka quoth once said i was the unprincipled sub type. when i first joined PF in 2013 under the username ""My Username"", i was convinced i had NPD. after years of.. getting older and wiser, i relate more to sociopathy. i think the unprincipled narcissist is actually quite spot on for me for this reason. yeah man i dont come to this forum for the exact reason u outlined in the OP. maybe ill stick around if some others similar to me come out of the wood work. - ur gril saucy"

Also if pwNPD could accept themselves for they truly are they wouldn’t have NPD to begin with. I read a story by Ellenor Greenburg who’s probably treated more cases of NPD than just about anyone. She gave an example of a classic NPD his first visit he pointed out his expensive shoes, his tailor made shirt, his accomplishments at work. This was a defensive mechanism to cope with the stress and anxiety of first visit. The same client in his 3rd visit was a shell of himself, in a deep depression because he waved to someone at work and they didn’t wave back so he felt snubbed.

"Unashamed Narcissists Hm well I genuinely think I'm objectively great. Beneath that, I'm more so embarrassed to admit that I believe I'm a godlike figure. This belief is something I calmly believe, I don't want to shout it from the rooftops, I don't need other people to see it - though I do want people to see that I'm great, I'm just sure most of them can't fathom my true greatness. See what I mean?"
"Unashamed Narcissists I’ll defer to Akuma and Greebo if they choose to comment but from my knowledge if you have a self regulating ego and self esteem that isn’t dependent on how others see you or treat you than it’s more likely narcissism in its non pathological form but then again, it could be a shell of armor you’ve created for yourself than you aren’t aware of. It takes a pro to tease out pathological narcissism sometimes"
"Unashamed Narcissists ZeroZ wrote: it could be a shell of armor you’ve created for yourself than you aren’t aware of. It takes a pro to tease out pathological narcissism sometimes this is something i struggle w. i had a relatively trauma-less upbringing, but my dad is probably a classic narcissist, not sure if in the clinical sense or not. did i build a shell? i think so. its just really hard to fathom, which is why i post in the aspd forum mostly because on a conscious level i dont see the shell. and speaking of conscious, my therapist is ""unsure"" if i have a conscience. not sure if that can apply to ppl w NPD or not, and if it could, what it would look like. - ur gril saucy"
"Unashamed Narcissists Unashamed ... hmmm. Well I am aware of my negative impulses sometimes and I often try to supress them. So if I would be unashamed I wouldnt need to do so. Would I? Idk. Of course the ""fear"" of negative consequences is an important factor as well. But I in general do not feel ashamed for being qho I am at all. pwNPD here. Message me if you have questions."
"I'm ugly and can't live without the mask I know it deep down. I can't not wear the mask. I expose myself. I don't even know why. I guess I just want to push everybody away from me. The rage I experience is immense. It feels like I want to destroy someone else. Rejection at this point while being this mentally sick, is debilitating most people get over it and move on. But I linger because I have nothing else to focus on. It's torture."
"I'm ugly and can't live without the mask I'm sorry you're not coping so well at this point in time. Hmmm as someone who isn't suffering from what you are, I hope I don't come across as condescending as I come up with ideas that may be wrong or things you've already considered. Just trying to help I like to be self-serving and value intelligence over all else when it comes to managing things. Perhaps you should make a list of all things that give you narcissistic supply and then consider which options are feasible? When it comes to self-esteem I'd say do more things that you are talented at or activities that will give you a sense of accomplishment. But if you can't/don't want to work on your true self and instead focus on your false self, I suppose you could try to think of ways that safely benefit that image, so long as doing so isn't going to turn detrimental to you (i.e. the need is constant and insatiable, like fueling a growing fire). Good luck with whatever you decide to do to cope with this time!"

Can you expand on that? What is the mask and who is the real you. Maybe familiarize yourself with the terminology of analitical psychology. Jung uses terms like Persona,ego,shadow etc. So you could more precisely define your predicament for us. Or maybe just be ugly. Why not? Doesnt make you worse than the rest of us in the slightest. Remember that self acceptance is also a possible way, not only self denial."
"Parents being sorry Some of you may know I walk to my grandma every week to buy her groceries. It turned out like that because a few years ago I was calling her and we were somehow getting to the topic of her food and she said she only had dry bread to eat, which after first thinking this was a joke, realized that it was actually true. So I decided - on top of being irritated that her children or more mobile grandchildren didnt care about this - to get her groceries... and it became a regular thing. Since I cant drive a car due to health issues I walk there, which takes me about an hour. So today, since there is a fair close by, I was calling her to check if she needs something since I was on my way to the fair and I would come around, before grabbing some candy on the fair for myself. So she tells me it ""must have been telepathy"", because she is in need of milk. While on my way I call my mother, who to my surprise tells me that she was just at my grandmothers place this morning. Inquiring why she didnt buy milk her reply was that ""it was a spontaneous visit"" - when I voiced certain irritation she told me if I wouldnt want to do it this week, I could do it next week when I buy her groceries. Now keep in mind the grocery store is 5 mins per foot from there and my mom has a car, while I walk there an hour. Arriving at my grandmothers I ask her about it and she starts defending my mom, too, explaining that she ""just wanted to show me some pictures"" and that she ""had to go to town"" etc. Now this isnt the first time this happened, I guess in the past three years this must have happened like five times. It also happened with an aunt who was buying stuff from town for my grandma and then left and my grandmother called me shortly afterwards if I could come around to put the trashbins out. Back then I called my mom being rather irritated why I should walk there now for some ######6 trashbins while my aunt had just been there, and there, too, it was all excuses along the lines of ""your aunt has so much [problems / stuff to do] already"" etc. Now aside from one more nail in the coffin of my family being a sack of $#%^, and to where all my possibly silently introjected ideas about being bad comes from, I was wondering... the normal response would be to apologize, wouldnt it. I mean if I do something wrong, then I apologize for that and am not trying to find reasons why it's not an issue or why someone else is at fault. So - on-topically apologizing here for the extremely lengthy introduction to such a short question - anyone else has parents who are unable to realize they're wrong or saying sorry? dx: SPD"

You seem to care for your grandma. It's certainly good for her food and health, and good for her in general to have your regular presence. So today, since there is a fair close by, I was calling her to check if she needs something since I was on my way to the fair and I would come around, before grabbing some candy on the fair for myself.

Maybe she can close the plastic bag and wait for some days. Now aside from one more nail in the coffin of my family being a sack of $#%^, and to where all my possibly silently introjected ideas about being bad comes from, I was wondering... the normal response would be to apologize, wouldnt it. Let's project own history on yours. I come from family with narcissistic traits, specially on my mother's side. That means that people are enmeshed to each other and it's difficult to sort and preserve myself. What i do is - as much as possible - try to relate 1-1 and protect boundaries. So if i look at your story, here is what i see : You offer your time each week for your grandma. So she should think of asking you for milk and the trashbin out that day. If not, sorry, you don't have infinite time. Sorry grandma, i come on thursday. We'll do it that day. But you don't do that. You decide there is emergency and it should be done immediately. Then resent other family members I mean if I do something wrong, then I apologize for that and am not trying to find reasons why it's not an issue or why someone else is at fault. You mean she is at fault about you or about grandma? What i read makes me remember the plenty of tracks that i try to protect me of. Mother sees grandma? It's her problem. Maybe grandma didn't ask mother because she prefers to see you. We don't know. All people have different reasons. Now there is a practical problem. Grandma has lost autonomy and needs regular help. If for you it's heavy, a solution should be found to help her. Depending of the country and the context, there can be help provided. Maybe grandma or mother or some family members can pay some neighbour to help grandma regularly. Of course it's precious to have grandson helping, provided it's ok for him and it stays in certain limits. So - on-topically apologizing here for the extremely lengthy introduction to such a short question - anyone else has parents who are unable to realize they're wrong or saying sorry? In my experience, consistent sorry is very rare. Particularly coming from parents. My comments come from own history and difficulties. Of course i don't know your context. I just explained how i see things with own family"
"Parents being sorry Here is the question : do you think milk was really important for her? Or that she needed milk and would be happy to see you if you are around? Well another family member has told me two years ago that her dependence on groceries might also be an attempt to have someone around. In addition, looking into that direction the symbolic nature of milk doesnt elude me. But then I feel used. What connects to me being pissed about what my mom said about ""just doing it next week"", because it implies that its a natural thing to do that is just expected, while I am doing it exactly because apparently it's not natural apparently for the other family members, including grandchildren who actually have cars. It gets complicated additionally by the fact that I really dont like my grandma, or at least my conscious part doesnt. I mean she was originally my surrogate caregiver but really rarely wanted to play with me or anything as a kid; and from a more adult perspective she is a rather weak person who is very egocentric and doesnt admit to her faults. For example she is complaining about grandpa not being able to walk normally anymore, while it's her who canceled the therapy activating him, because it was ""too much"" for her. So now feeling expected to be there for her is quite a strain in terms of conflicting inner states. But you don't do that. You decide there is emergency and it should be done immediately. Then resent other family members Well in this specific case with the milk I was on my way anyways, because I wanted to take a walk and I was pissed primarily because I find it hard to grasp how my mom or aunt or whoever can't just ask if she needs something when you are ######6 around already. Its true though I dont like to put things off - but this might in the case of the trashbins have more to do with my ambivalences towards my grandmother, especially about where her old age (91) starts, and where her personality pathology ends. Hm I cant remember the word now. Theres this skill where you draw boundaries and kind of explain what your position is and how far you go. I still suck at that; but also at even knowing what I want heh. Now there is a practical problem. Grandma has lost autonomy and needs regular help. If for you it's heavy, a solution should be found to help her. Depending of the country and the context, there can be help provided. Maybe grandma or mother or some family members can pay some neighbour to help grandma regularly. Of course it's precious to have grandson helping, provided it's ok for him and it stays in certain limits. Well they are having services already because grandma is ""caring"" for her husband who has dementia. I'm not clear about this. dx: SPD"
"Parents being sorry Hi akuma, It's understandable that you feel ""used"" and ambivalent about both your grandma and family members who visit her but don't help out while there at her place. Your grandmother is at an age when it's difficult to get around physically, so there is that to consider. The other part may be that asking for milk is her way of getting to see you on a semi-regular basis to get some attention. With a husband who has dementia, she could be climbing the walls for adult conversation, however brief, and relief from the ""sick room"" atmosphere that likely focuses a lot of attention on her husband in their home. Have you considered making your walk to Grandma's a routine thing, like every Thursday, for example, and asking Grandma if she needs anything? This way you commit to that one day of the week (your boundary), whether or not other family members have come to visit or help out (or not). You can also state what chores you can do or won't do for for her. If you don't want to take out the trashbins, then make that clear with your grandma, e.g. You have your limits, and caretakers should limit the demands, otherwise they get burnout. You can't change others' behavior, but you can put down some boundaries for yourself. From my experience of looking after elderly parents-in-law, it's no picnic. However, there does come a time when an elderly person can no longer drive or do some things for him/herself and needs family assistance with daily living. Some have partners who are no longer mentally capable of having a reasonable conversation with and that can get pretty lonely. Being in touch with family members probably makes your grandma's life a little more bearable."
"Parents being sorry There is a high probability she is lonely and wants company and she may even be afraid being alone and might like someone checking in on her occasionally, I’ve seen this happen myself. I can see your frustration with other family members but maybe she prefers for you to visit. If I’m correct that you tend to lead a very Schizoid like lifestyle and don’t get out much they may see this as beneficial for you too (getting you out of the house) I’m just speculating but these are things I’ve run into myself."
"Parents being sorry Akuma wrote: Here is the question : do you think milk was really important for her? Or that she needed milk and would be happy to see you if you are around? Well another family member has told me two years ago that her dependence on groceries might also be an attempt to have someone around. In addition, looking into that direction the symbolic nature of milk doesnt elude me. But then I feel used. It's interesting that i tend to feel opposite. I accept to offer some regular presence to older family member (if not too heavy) and i put limits when family asks for more practical help What connects to me being pissed about what my mom said about ""just doing it next week"", because it implies that its a natural thing to do that is just expected, Yes i understand - plus she enters in your relationship with grandma - and she takes your presence for granted. while I am doing it exactly because apparently it's not natural apparently for the other family members, including grandchildren who actually have cars. It gets complicated additionally by the fact that I really dont like my grandma, or at least my conscious part doesnt. I mean she was originally my surrogate caregiver but really rarely wanted to play with me or anything as a kid; and from a more adult perspective she is a rather weak person who is very egocentric and doesnt admit to her faults. For example she is complaining about grandpa not being able to walk normally anymore, while it's her who canceled the therapy activating him, because it was ""too much"" for her. So now feeling expected to be there for her is quite a strain in terms of conflicting inner states. in my own experience conflicting inner states take sometimes much energy. I try to take decision then follow decision (then protect myself from people around as much as possible) but this might in the case of the trashbins have more to do with my ambivalences towards my grandmother, especially about where her old age (91) starts, and where her personality pathology ends. I can understand that. Plus if she was always egocentrical, maybe there are plenty of dynamics around her that take energy. I experienced that with some family member. Be so centered on them that i was forgetting myself. Like for instance be preoccupied (i just imagine this) that their dog should be washed weekly while i had no time to buy food for myself Hm I cant remember the word now. Theres this skill where you draw boundaries and kind of explain what your position is and how far you go. I still suck at that; but also at even knowing what I want heh. I think one never knows exactly - but can take decision and review them just sometimes. I never draw boundaries with my family because they'll try to cross the line I do protect boundaries instead For instance if they say (i imagine) : please can go to grandma and water the flowers i'd say : i'm sorry i can't (or something like that). It's not their problem to know that i decided to go to the grocery regularly for grandma and that's enough for me it's how i (try to) protect myself Well they are having services already because grandma is ""caring"" for her husband who has dementia. I'm not clear about this. I suppose it's good for them to have your regular visit. It sound like very structured thing. Very clear. Depending how heavy it is for you..."
"Parents being sorry It's interesting that i tend to feel opposite. I accept to offer some regular presence to older family member (if not too heavy) and i put limits when family asks for more practical help I think its probably part of the affect isolation where I can just function in a way that might not necessarily have a lot to do with what i might be feeling somewhere inside. If you dont have such a disconnect it makes sense that practical help might have more meaning for you and may necessitate more boundary-setting. I experienced that with some family member. Be so centered on them that i was forgetting myself. Like for instance be preoccupied (i just imagine this) that their dog should be washed weekly while i had no time to buy food for myself I think some people are often very busy evacuating stuff into other people, deflecting stuff or just generally trying to control people around them. So if you show that you are an individual and you are in fact a seperate being, or you have needs yourself, or feelings that are not in par with what they want, then you will either become demonized or you will basically be surrounded by stuff that they are just deflecting. When I explained to my grandma for example that I am angry at my mother, at the end she laughed about it. She has no way to deal with this apparently. Maybe sometimes an automatism to become so wrapped up in their demands is just a way to get around the drama and crackles and explosions thats to be expected when you want to actually start unwrapping yourself. It's not their problem to know that i decided to go to the grocery regularly for grandma and that's enough for me Sorry, I didnt understand what you mean here. I suppose it's good for them to have your regular visit. It sound like very structured thing. Very clear. Depending how heavy it is for you... I actually aborted the whole thing now. Of course my grandma didnt take it well, but also didnt have any interest in actualyl understand my position. Kind of waiting for the angry call of my mom lol. dx: SPD"
"Parents being sorry Akuma wrote: If you dont have such a disconnect it makes sense that practical help might have more meaning for you and may necessitate more boundary-setting. yes. It can look infinite It's not their problem to know that i decided to go to the grocery regularly for grandma and that's enough for me Sorry, I didnt understand what you mean here. I say that the more i explain the more boundaries i offer to cross I can draw the line in my mind (for instance, if i compare to your story, decide that i do enough with the grocery) but i'll never say ""i do the grocery and it's enough"" because then they'll naturally ask for more something like that"
"Is it normal for narcissists to be obsessed with dating site I'm extremely sexually repressed and inhibited. I'm very picky too. And since I really don't match with people I find attractive, I almost never date. I go on the dating and hookup apps once in a while, but it's an exercise resulting in narcissistic rage, anger, and/or frustration that I don't match with people I like. ""How dare they not match with/like me,"" etc. It stirs up so many negative emotions that I avoid it. I fear I'll die alone, but I guess there are worse things. Maybe."
"What to expect now? Will he finally leave me alone? Last night my ex was being verbally abusive as usual. I've had years of abuse and now he is abusing our child too, so I put a stop to it and I want him away from us! Anyway he started sending horrible messages and I decided to send him one last message before I blocked his number. He absolutely hates his dad, I think the reason why he has npd is because of his dad, horrible things happened during his childhood and now he is trying to be like his dad and doing what his dad did. Anyway I sent him a message saying that he was just a lost little boy, his dad never loved him and that no one can blame him as anyone would have left him (his dad left him when he was younger and even though they kept in touch he always felt neglected and abandoned as his dad was more interested in women), I also told him no one loves him. I then blocked him, just as he was writing another message. So, I guess my question is, will he finally leave me and our child (who he never cared about and when he does it's to show off to other people) alone? Or will he try to contact me? Get revenge? How do you think the narcissist felt when I told him what I did? I feel scared and fear that something will happen to me, my child or a member of my family, so I need to prepare myself. Thank you"
"What to expect now? Will he finally leave me alone? Apparently a common symptom of NPD is clairvoyance.

For whatever it's worth it was posts like these on the HPD forum that prompted the opening of the Significant Others Family & Friends forum, the only significant difference being it was mostly males asking about their wives, girlfriends, etc. @hurtforever - You can also ask your questions on the Significant Others Family & Friends forum, or I can link this there for you if you prefer. You may not get any answers there either. On that forum the questions often tend to turn toward 'why did you choose this person?' versus a focus on 'what is going on with them?'

I apologize for the others, this is a forum for pwNPD and they just have no ability to care or empathise with you. Your post sounds realy confused, like your still in shock from what happened. It was difficult to understand at first, becouse you were referencing 3 people and the spiral led to dad of his dad (your husbands father). I dont know wether he will leave you alone, even thought you made it clear you want no contact. The narcissist feels no shame and if he decides he still needs you (purely for his own needs) you might see him hoovering."
"What to expect now? Will he finally leave me alone? HF, just want to add to Prophet's post, people with personality disorders can be very reactive. So the ""no one loves you"" type of comment is likely to get a negative reaction, retaliation even, out of most people with PD, not just NPD. I'm not excusing, just explaining. If you genuinely want to be left alone, try fully ignoring the person (find ways in yourself not to react to provocations or abusive baits) on top of blocking them in every way possible. Good of you to try and protect your child from further abuse though. Another way you can help protect and raise healthy children is by trying to figure out what attracts you to temperamental partners, so that they can model their confidence and insight into themselves after yours."
What to expect now? Will he finally leave me alone? Do you think provoking the pwNPD in that situation and shutting him up by blocking him is the smartest way to deal with it? It probably would leave him frustrated and angry. Well no contact surely is the best option. But provoking and making him feel bad is no good idea I think.

Thank you I have not participated in this forum for some time though I still occasionally visit. I was once much more active under a different username. That being said ... Posts such as these now amuse me. You come here, to an NPD forum at that, and tell us how abusive your ex is/was. You then go to explain about how you want him away from you and your child. Yet as he is writing you 'horrible' messages you just had to reply one more time. In that one reply back to him you made sure to tell him that he was unlovable. You did this even in knowing he always felt neglected and abandoned. Get the f@ck off here. People such as yourself want to make themselves out to be the victim as they INTENTIONALLY inflict pain upon another. Are you really incapable of seeing that your behavior is just as much abusive as his? You feel scared for you and your child? Yet instead of just leaving and blocking him you felt the need to provoke him. You are playing a game. You WANT him to contact you. You want his attention. You wanted to have the last word/power/control that is why you sent the message you did and then blocked him. Feel better now? You're welcome."

"Getting worse, going down a dark path? Despite making some progress socially, getting a nice new apartment, etc. in the past few months, I think I'm getting worse and headed down a very dark path. Some of you may remember that I have an obsession with my looks, specifically my facial attractiveness. I compare myself to movie stars and other extremely attractive people. I have an obsession with the word ""gorgeous."" I've never been called that. I'm a guy, but I know some men are called gorgeous and as a gay man, I've used it to refer to other guys). My mom the other day bluntly reiterated that I'm not gorgeous and said I don't need to be to find a partner.

I feel angry, agitated and narcissistically injured when I think I don't measure up, and I can't stop thinking about it and repeating things to myself like ""you'll never look that good"".

It is when you realize that the reflection back is false. It is significant damage to the ""false self"" that we have had so long. It usually comes with age or some significant event where you suffer from severe injury/rejection. Just realize that you are not alone. The psych ward helped recover from this phase to destroy the false self somewhat and to accept reality a bit more (it's expensive though). A psychotherapist is somewhat helpful, but not that impactful because they don't understand it unless they are also NPD. The homicidal ideation is actually quite normal. Many people go through it. If you have some BPD in you also (you may because you fear the rejection), it might pass into psychosis, which releases extreme anger and attention needing. Do you have any coping mechanisms? I think what helped me the most was either getting professional help in a psych ward, or meeting others who are like me. Then you just realize you're not that crazy.

Can't we disagree philosophically about these things? It's often been asked why so few ""narcissists"" post on this forum.

And the differential diagnosis between NPD and OCD is f.e. based on pwNPD feeling empty, while pwOCD being very self-attacking. Since the OP is always self-attacking it seems to be a mixture of introjective depression and OCD. How ""deep"" an obsession is depends on a lot of things, for example if its organized around a borderline structure or not or in his case a delusional one.

You choose to find your own solutions, you act as though you are this deep thinking, philosophical loner who is the only person who can truly know himself, and the only person he can trust with his mind, wasting decades barely getting one foot in front of the other, while rationalizing this as necessary or normal.

"Getting worse, going down a dark path? This thread is definitely triggering, because I'm hearing words like delusional, not being what I want to be, etc., which creates that familiar sense of (what I believe to be) narcissistic panic/anxiety at my False Self being questioned. Not attacking you guys and I do really appreciate the help, and please don't filter—I'm just stating what it's triggering, in case it helps. Went out last night and felt on top of the world, like a million bucks, felt like everyone was looking at me at the bar, but I stayed in my own ""autistic"" fantasy world and naturally I wouldn't look around much to confirm or shatter my fantasy of being constantly stared at and admired. Delusional as it may have been, it felt good. --- Akuma , as much as I'd love to believe it's just OCD, how are you convinced I don't have NPD? I feel a LOT of emptiness when I'm not getting supply or when I'm putting in lots of work into something with no immediate reward. Typical of pwNPD, right? Covert pwNPDs also self-attack a lot, from my understanding. I also score 26-28/40 on the NPI test. I also test as BPD on some tests but have never directly self-harmed but I am quite impulsive. dazn153, in one of your posts here, you say ""I've said all I could to him.

It is when you realize that the reflection back is false. It is significant damage to the ""false self"" that we have had so long. It usually comes with age or some significant event where you suffer from severe injury/rejection. Just realize that you are not alone. The psych ward helped recover from this phase to destroy the false self somewhat and to accept reality a bit more (it's expensive though). A psychotherapist is somewhat helpful, but not that impactful because they don't understand it unless they are also NPD. The homicidal ideation is actually quite normal. Many people go through it. If you have some BPD in you also (you may because you fear the rejection), it might pass into psychosis, which releases extreme anger and attention needing. Do you have any coping mechanisms? I think what helped me the most was either getting professional help in a psych ward, or meeting others who are like me. Then you just realize you're not that crazy. What triggers the annihilation phase? I don't recall a singular triggering event or trauma. Maybe it's just been a gradual reduction of supply seeking in public, or getting tired of the #######4 facade. I don't know, I can't pretend to understand it. My obsession as a teenager was about my intelligence and constantly posting on Internet forums as a substitute for IRL social interaction. I constantly got into arguments and debates to prove my intelligence and get validation/supply. I was obsessed with IQ, although (much like my looks, interesting...) my IQ isn't quite the genius level I wanted/want it to be. Now it is an obsession with needing to look like a movie star, gorgeous, etc. This obsession definitely transcends a mere ""oh, I wish I were better looking *moves on with day*."" It's an all-consuming experience that consumes at least 50% of my waking day's thoughts. Basically it is torture. Especially when I'm confronted in the real world, on the street, with not being constantly ogled and gawked at. (Yet strangely, when I am ogled and gawked at, I don't much like it.) But why should I care in the first place how good I look or how I compare to George Clooney and other movie stars? That's the important, substantive question, and one my parents and my former therapist ask(ed) me all the time. How did you meet people like you, and what do you mean more specifically by people like you?"
"Getting worse, going down a dark path? Akuma, as much as I'd love to believe it's just OCD, how are you convinced I don't have NPD? I feel a LOT of emptiness when I'm not getting supply or when I'm putting in lots of work into something with no immediate reward. Typical of pwNPD, right? Covert pwNPDs also self-attack a lot, from my understanding. I also score 26-28/40 on the NPI test. I also test as BPD on some tests but have never directly self-harmed but I am quite impulsive. OCD seems to be seen as something very unproblematic, when you people always use the word ""just"" hehe. OCD can completely destroy ones life, creates intrusive thoughts, internal endless-loops, basically make you withdraw into your own world, where you are mostly thinking about your topic of obsession. I've just yesterday watched this 4-part series about Bedlam , which followed a few peopel with extreme OCD - especially that woman who was always afraid she had unkonowingly put strangers into recycling bins was interesting. I mean as I've already said to heracles it's of questionable worth of course diagnosing, but I dont think you are NPD, because you are primarily obsessing and obsessing is simply not an aspect of NPD. Secondly you would have to be grandiose and you would have to either expect people to mirror that or devalue them, which you arent doing; if I read you correctly you have a conviction thta you need to look a certain way, not that you do look a certain way and youw ant people to share that conviction, which also means you invest a big deal of energy into what others think of you, or at least if others share your idea of hwo you should be, again in an obsessive way. Then, in CNPD, you would need to idealize other people, not your self, which I dont see here. And lastly, most importantly, you seem to display a pretty sharp cut between yourself and others, I'm not sure if I read this correctly. In NPD such a cut doesnt exist, others especially when part of your grandiose-self are [albeit mostly unconsciously] part of yourself. More pragmatically though, if you had a therapist, what kind of therapy was it and what did he/she tell you you would be suffering from? And how are you supposed to battle that problem? dx: SPD"
"Getting worse, going down a dark path? I think you meant me when your were addressing dazn153. I've already written loads about my looks obsession and I doubt I can add much more or answer any questions about it. You can explore them in my forum and blog posts if you want, but I don't feel up to writing more. I don't feel a need to look gorgeous, but I'd like to remain young looking. I'd be happy in the 7 to 9 range. I don't want to look like a movie star or a model. I have an obsession with the past, my past. (No, I don't have an exact definition of that, it's a rough way of indicating looks, not an objective measurement, of course.) I think a lot of mine is an identity crisis. I want to remain forever perceived as in the young world, in my bubble of my ideal-self projection, like a ghost, in my eternal performance. I can't go into it any more because there are nuances that I can't even put into words, layers I can't even peel away. I don't think it's just me. I'm obsessed with the whole ""tragedy"" of the loss of youth. I'm guessing you're about 30 now. In 10 more years you'll be 40. In 20, 50. And on and on. You don't know what the years will do to your face. (Google Mickey Rourke, images.) At some point, you'll have to find some other meaning, some other source of fulfillment in your life, or it'll be hell. I've always had idealism and still do. My looks obsession has just been a flaw, a weakness, I know I have to transcend. But if you're unwilling to at least start working on this, on internalizing values about yourself other than your looks, then you're in for some real emotional misery down the road. It's up to you. Get some depth. The inner life of the secret schizoid is incommunicable."

Without the ego-driven rewards, endeavors like this feel as though they are lacking in purpose. Anyone relate? I don't have any answers, just some related thoughts - I think unfortunately what most people with cluster B disorders lack (sans Psychopathy, which is different), is implicit self-esteem. We can layer on the explicit self-esteem efforts to fill in temporarily, even hide it, but yea, without that implicit self-esteem backdrop, foundation, choose your word, it's always there in the background. I don't know how to fix a lack of implicit self-esteem, but it might be worth it to you to peer into the looking glass. You may find no answers either, but I guess the one benefit is I'm somewhat less hard on myself now. I know what is broken, not how to fix it, but that I should stop beating myself up over it. I am more aware of how shame, guilt, and remorse that I didn't deserve have affected me. The only warning is it's a tough thing to look at, you may need some support while doing so, and you might end up feeling worse off for it. So definitely not suggesting doing so, but yea, that takes guts to start to put those explicit self-esteem boosters aside for a while. We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here.

In return for spending/wasting time with work or chores I want to do what interests me afterwards.

"Boundaries Not the first time I´ve listened to this but it really made me think and consider again my experience of growing up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBKPQsKHgck I know that I have fairly crappy boundaries and the lack of bodily ones have become especially clear to me as of late. If I wind myself up and go around without being grounded (majority of the time), it´s like my mind gets ahead of my body, am not really well situated in it. My dad (cNPD, just to reiterate) held off on physical contact throughout my childhood and the majority of memories I have of him doing it were always in somewhat of a ´scientific´ manner, if you will. As he has always been a fitness freak (a liftime jogger of a religious nature, to the point where he got irritated if he hadn´t for a reason or another done it and lashed out on us), one of the things he would do when my sister and I were little was take us to cross-country skiing trips and I always had this sens that he expected us to get into jogging like he has done or smth of the like as well. His touches wer always in very rational, i.e. noting to us which muscles had seen the most use during the excercising and so on. Tbh, throughout my life his presence always felt distant like it was too well-considered and came from a rational place, without warmth. There was the odd acknowledging (but very selective) pat here and there and he had the habit of giving (again, awkward) high fives when he dropped me off for a longer time period. The single hug I ever remember him giving us was when he announced to us that our mother was very sick (late stage cancer) and he gathered us around and told this to us in a solemn way. Other than that, it´s just been emotional neglect from his part because he simply lacked the capacity. As a teenager I was quite isolated and a loner so I didn´t really partake in anything I deemed ´rowdy´ with others. I had only few fights in school but they were just that, fights - they got started quick and intense and subsided as fast. Well, anyhow fast forward to 27yo me who has done little to no contact sports (always felt team sports were too cookie-cutter) but with action sports. The only boundaries to be found out are the truly physical ones like when your skin or worse bones break and it has nothing to do with other people and sensing their boundaries. I have a friend who is quite well socialized but suspect had a somewhat narcissistic father (he´s told me as much and has some codependent traits) who oftentimes tries to mess around and wrestle with me, which leaves me dumbfounded because it´s quite difficult for me to gauge how I should respond. Am somewhat of a strong believer that people with empathy intuitively know. This is something that I´ve not and there´s a part of me that thinks maybe this could be something missing in my life that when improved, could carry further benefits to other areas of life as well? So the takeaway from this to me is - lack of contact=lack of socialization. Do any of you relate to this at all and how were your parents with physical intimacy? “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Boundaries Yes, without empathy (or feelings, you dont have those eaither remember, only the most basest emotion) you cant understand other people. Boundaries means what we find acceptable interacting with other people and what not. Your actions have consequences and other people have thoughts and feelings about them, and the other way arround. Or are you asking specificaly about the issue of touch, as you keep coming back to that (contact sports, wrestling) suggests? The 27 year old you has no sence of boundaries, except for the truly bonebreaking ones, is that what you ment to say? Yes people with empathy know intuitively, its a superpower. You can read other peoples minds with it. To answer your last question, mommy slept with me up to age 6-7, I can still remember it albeit vaguely. Dad was not present, working in america.

I really do appreciate it. That bold part made me laugh out lout. In my mind it´s quite typical of you to write something like that and I´ve been realizing this more and more. Yeah, that ´summary´ wasn´t exactly anything earth-shattering. Figured that people would probably not give the YT link an actual watch-through. Briefly put, Peterson talks about the importance of rough and tumble play in there and the effect it has on the child´s psyche. I guess my childhood was not absolutely deficient in play as such though but there certainly was no real physicality between us, as if he was always afraid of it. Now I know for sure that actually was the case. Weak father figures make for weak agency and meaningless drifting as is also well known. As for with other boys, I was always quite a sheltered child in that respect also, maybe overly sensitive from the start. Then later on the rowdyiness of a group of guys always felt weird to me somehow, reckon it has to do with lack of certainty in myself and seeing others as bold and sure of themselves, whereas I always had a weak sense of self. I opted out of it completely, thinking I was the sensitive, creative type whereas internally it was actually kind of a ""I´m better than that"". It was probably just that I felt I didn´t belong and it became a strong layer of defence (""I don´t need to do that guys stuff, that´s dumb"") As for not giving my dad grief, my whole life I´ve spent hung up on what I feel I was cheated out of in childhood, which is the love of my mother. After she passed, my grandmother blamed my father (and it was reiterated by her that my father´s father had done so also) and it painted a picture in my mind of how things had been between them pretty quick. Nowadays, what there is to learn about trauma, bonding and constantly being anxious about someone, makes it all very likely that they were both right. He was never violent with her but I know for a fact he didn´t love her as he simply wasn´t capable of it and always left her guessing. What I learned about my father as a child were large part of the reason why I tried to make decisions so as to not end up like him. Nonetheless I dug myself into the hole that I am currently in by trying to evade that destiny. My whole state of mind became absolutely twisted after realizing that all I hated about him, I have embodied. The self-hate was augmented even more-so because I understood that even though I had tried my hardest not to end up like him, in a cosmically ironic fashion, I have become that and even worse. Anyhow, the physicality of a mother with their children is obv a lot different than between a father and child, as it carries a totally different aim. Assuming it was one of the few times in your life when you actually felt cared for, does it carry a deep significance do you? At least that´s how it is for me, as I remember vividly a very pecific moment which also could have been somewhere around age 6-7. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus"
"Boundaries Im sorry I just dont like Peterson. I just saw the video and its the same as all the others. The conclusions he draws, and he no doubt thinks those are very significant, are not actualy very significant at all and in fact trivial. You should try someone who is a buddha, like me. Like buddhism, means 'awakened one'. Emerald https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvW2U2 ... BzUYOw0DwA or Teal Swan https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSpiritualCatalyst for example. Its excellent that you drew the conclusion that you are like your dad, someone you detested. That was my first step to self-realization too. That how I treated Bony was a mirror of how my mom treated me. Yes I was cared for, by many people, my dad too, although he was distant but he was an ok person and being manipulated by my mom constantly, all the girls that fell in love with me and even the mom of the first girl that fell in love with me, when I was 13. She fell in love and my mom and sister was present and her mom, right there, it was a on a winter camp in Zakopane, carpathian mountains. Her mom said she fell in love and what I should do (reciprocate). I said I wont reciprocate and I remember her hurt and my mom so pround of me. That Im hurting this girl right in front of her. I learned more from her mom in that moment, that from my own mom EVER. Althought I wasnt able to understand the significance yet. A friend in the warehouse that saw me fall in love with Bony, knew we were both in love with eachother, he wanted to tell me just becouse I knew english and made jokes to him, If I just admitted to him that Im in love, thought he will be telling me something that is obvious anyway. Not to the narcissists. Instead he got to see all the insanity firsthand. Becouse he didnt have thoughts yet, I was mentally ill. Only the narcissists has thoughts. Another friend in college in the student dorm when I was breaking the heart of another girl by being insane, wanted to tell me too, nagged me to admit to my mistake of getting naked and getting in another girls bed, as a joke (the two girls were friends). So I had poeople care but I couldnt understand it and hated them and only just understood that recently, and its still very traumatic. Id rather not have known. Many people that wanted to spend time together and not abuse me, becouse I secretly craved to be treated narcissisticaly by a narcissist aparently. So things like that, when other people had your best interest in mind, had plenty and it still wasnt enough when your self abusive. The example of my mom sleeping with me when I was 7 was actualy and example of abuse and not respecting my boundaries, not of being cared for. She did other things like asking me to touch her tits if front of my dad. Or demeaning me in front of the family, laughing at me, telling me Im the bad one and I need to be fixed, thats what realy damages a child. Or when a guy puched me in front of my house, my mom saw it and screamed ""good, punch him again"" and calling me by my nickname. Even the guy who punched me was kind of terrified at the pathology. PS what do you mean written in bold? you mean what you put in italics?"

Its one of the times again that you use a word but you dont really talk about it at all in your text. What you talk about is your father objectifying you, you feeling like an object, and you still being on the level where you think you need physical touch to feel real. Or at least thats what I gather. But that doesnt have much to do with boundaries, except for that you might have a lack of physical boundaries, because you cant decide if you want guys to touch you or not. But what you dont do is actually ask the guy. You resort to magical thinking about what ""empathy"" could do for you. Next time he ""wrestles"" with you, if you dislike it ask him why hes doing it, or to stop. If you like it, ask him out. If you are unsure if you like it or dislike it well... you can guess, right. As to personal experience I dont think examples fit here very well. But a lot of my imaginary world consists of physical things. Its a developmental step that needs to be taken at some point and is a part of mentalization.

"Boundaries Ever seen a post written in all capital letters? Per internet etiquette, all caps is considered ""shouting"" and therefore, rude. Users who peruse or lurk on this forum may or may not have the NPD disorder. For those who do have the disorder and are self-aware, it's a real struggle to understand empathy as nons understand it. They themselves didn't get much empathy or positive attention as children from the very ppl who should have provided it, their parents or primary caretakers. The defense mechanisms and sense of entitlement often kick in as coping methods to deal with a hostile world, real or perceived. Human beings deal with their environment in different ways, and humans who have this disorder are not any different in trying to survive their circumstances."

"cNPD and selective reclusivness, work etc. Wondering if others on this board have this problem. I had read some past posts on cNPD, and also some posts from partners of people with cNPD on another forum, and it seems like this is a common thing with people with cNPD. They say they can go through ""phases"" of spending ages at home without any real social interaction, or their partner will go ""weeks without leaving his apartment"" (which is probably another reason why I have a hard time staying interested in someone). I used to chalk this up to introversion, but if you define introversion it doesn't make full-sense in my case as I'm slightly ambiverted (although I do have problems switching from being home a lot, to going out again)... it's actually probably due to self-absorption. Like, someone with this is so involved with their own interests, and also might have a bit of social anxiety, internet addiction etc. that become completely absorbed in what they are doing whilst also neglecting the lives of the people around them, as if it would be to much effort to bother with that so they just remain locked in what they want to do. If anyone here with this relates, either with yourself or someone you know/have known I would be interested in hearing it. Another thing, what do you with cNPD do for work?

"cNPD and selective reclusivness, work etc. I can identify with a lot of that particularly going through phases, when I’m in a good head space I tend to fill up my day with my interests, things I want to work on, it’s to keep myself busy and have something to think about and focus on or I tend to just get absorbed online or playing games or whatever have you. An Ex, said to me that there is no room in my life for anyone but me, and to a degree this is true, I tend to keep myself so preoccupied with my interest that I don’t have time to do the things other people want me to do with them. I deal with customers at work, I’ve had opportunities come my way which included speaking in front of people in a meeting type of setting, it’s so far out of my comfort zone I avoided the promotion, I can speak publicly when it’s my own terms and I know what I want to say but to have pressure put on the situation turned me off to the idea."
"cNPD and selective reclusivness, work etc. I can go weeks without going outside and socializing with anyone because that's just my personality but sometimes I will turn reclusive because of blows to my ego. I have some compensatory narcissistic traits so when I feel like I have been constantly slighted and criticized I turn extremely defensive and paranoid so because of that I am sort of forced to isolate myself. The latter kind is fueled by my social anxiety and lack of social skills. I don't work yet but I am studying for a bachelor's in english. I would prefer to work from home since I would have more peace of mind socially."
"cNPD and selective reclusivness, work etc. I can relate, though being aware of my cNPD (inherited or trained) traits for many years, I still go into reclusive mode quite often. I do think you are on to something. When I am in that mode, it's quite literally painful to have to interact with others, except maybe online, but that's selective, and I can log off when I've had enough. It raises a thought for me, a question about something I read, where the author wrote that cNPD types may give a LOT (could be work, could be a relationship, hobby, etc), until they burn out and then shut-down, at least for a while. Thoughts of... I've given as much as I can, and even get pissed off that others just want more, that's the only reason you like me, what I can do for you. The darker thoughts.

"cNPD and selective reclusivness, work etc. To answer the general topic, my mother tries very hard to avoid people who don't mirror her the way she wants to be mirrored, who don't support her external persona. As a consequence, she cuts almost everybody out of her life. But there is more to this: xdude wrote: It raises a thought for me, a question about something I read, where the author wrote that cNPD types may give a LOT (could be work, could be a relationship, hobby, etc), until they burn out and then shut-down, at least for a while.

I read recently in an article that the anxious-preoccupied type can mistake boundaries for signs of rejection while the dismissive types can erect walls and confused them for boundaries, thus mistaking desire for intimacy for invasion. Seabreezeblue used to say that she ""unpicked"" her way to becoming a healthier individual. I believe in both cases, dismissive and anxious-preoccupied, there is a confusion around boundaries, and it is a matter of unpicking and ultimately discriminating between who is trying to take advantage of us and who is simply attempting to get closer. Those are cases where feelings aren't necessarily the best indicator of what is happening."

"cNPD and selective reclusivness, work etc. I rather think the OP essentially pointed out the irony... The stereotype is that people with cNPD *always* want validation, affirmation, whatever word works. Ironically if they go into reclusive mode, they may get criticized too, for not being more available, not being more ... of the wanted ideal. I doubt others are trying to be harmful, but we write about this in the SOF&F forum repeatedly. He/She was some ideal, then couldn't be anymore, what is wrong with them? They seemed so perfect, then no. Of course they were never that ideal to begin with, just acting out a role that they had to do to be valued, and yes, then they shut-down too.

"Schizoid or NPD do you think i could have both Szpd and NPD ? Its possible to have mixed SPD/NPD yea. In your case though the most striking issue is your writing style and your thought derailment, which aren't typical for either illness. They can be caused by other illnesses or if you were acutely intoxicated while writing your post. In any event if you want a diagnosis you should see a professional. dx: SPD"
"Schizoid or NPD /nod We aren't qualified to diagnose here, and even if someone had those credentials, no professional with any moral code would do so online.

"BEAUTY (and uglyness) for the Vulnerable Narcissist Here's my problem, and I'd appreciate any suggestions on this: I don't think I have NPD. I used to go to therapy and my therapist told me I was a narcissist. It was a couple of years ago and I never got to ask more about what he meant because I abandoned therapy sessions. I do think I have narcissistic traits though, especially of the VULNERABLE/COVERT kind. My main problem is my looks. I am not an attractive guy, quite the opposite actually. I have a few scars due to acne on the left side of my face, a slight lateral deviation of the jaw and assymetry in the jaw (I mean besides the lateral deviation, it's like my chin is not really symmetric). I also have a bad posture. But really my ears are the problem (""cup"" or ""lop"" ears). When I was younger I wasn't too concerned about my looks, or maybe I was but I managed not to dwell on the matter that much. But as I grew up, all my friends started dating and guess who didn't. At some point in my life I started doubting whether any girl could possibly be attracted to me. I also tend to feel inadequate and stupid, although I always got good grades in high school and at university. When I'm with friends I always feel like they're putting up with me and wish I wasn't there. I'm convinced there's a couple of ""friends"" that just don't like me, but the more I think about it the less able I am to tell objectively if that's the case (because it may just be my imagination or self-loathing). I think I could deal with all this, but what really bothers me is that whenever I go out, I look at every man in the street with envy. I envy their good looks, but above all their ""being normal"". It's like they have it easy--- they will get the girl, have a family and be happy. I don't have the guts to talk to a girl for fear of rejection. But it's more than that. I feel like if I ever invite a girl on a date she will politely say no but also she will be surprised at me asking her out. It would be like a man with no legs that wants to run a marathon not knowing that he's disabled and can't do it. (""Boy! You'd think he knew he has no legs by now!"") I look myself at the mirror and can't really tell whether someone could possibly find me attractive or not. And I know looks aren't everything, but the uncertainty is killing me. I don't know if there's any piece of advice you could give me, but anyways, it's good to have a place to say what I need to say."
"BEAUTY (and uglyness) for the Vulnerable Narcissist Hey nicoonic, I am not such a pretty picture myself, but understand the struggle with if only I looked better, life would be easier (maybe, or maybe not). Like you suggested, I've tried to compensate by being narcissistic at times, over-the-top confidence, a good show, but yea, kind of pointless too. I have no advice to give, people do tend to judge a book by its cover, but perhaps you will always need your narcissistic side. Nothing inherently wrong with that either.

My advice to you is to try talking to women more, I don’t mean just walk up to them and ask them out, just start a conversation with them. Agree with this. It's not a lot of effort to start saying 'hi' to women, just do it, practice it. You'll be surprised at how many women will say hi back, and you've already started the connection. Most women don't feel good about their looks either. Many are more self-conscious than you are. A 'hi' can go a long way toward breaking the ice.

"BEAUTY (and uglyness) for the Vulnerable Narcissist Thanks everyone for your answers. I do see what you mean. Feeling ugly (and insecure as a result) has made me isolate a bit from people, especially women. It has done more than that, actually. It has made me always approach girls as if they were my sisters, because other kind of relationship seemed impossible. I will take a leap of faith and try your advice. Thanks a lot for replying."
"BEAUTY (and uglyness) for the Vulnerable Narcissist You sound like a textbook vulnerable (I like the term inverted) narcissist to me. My advice is to stop abusing yourself. Think of yourself only with compassion and self acceptance. You are good enough and fine the way you are. You deserve to be loved. Just be yourself and trust the universe. The science does say that looks are realy realy important (investigate ""blackpill"" on incelopedia). But that only means that women are assholes. So know that if you are rejected, its not your fault. You didnt choose how you look. Go for it anyway."
"BEAUTY (and uglyness) for the Vulnerable Narcissist AProphet, thanks a lot for your answer too. It is eye-opening to hear that I sound like a textbook vulnerable narcissist.

Its striking, especialy the thoughts of overwhelming worthlessness and pathological envy. But dont take my word for it, you need a proffesional diagnosis. Make sure you are nice and patient and listen to every girl, ask what she is feeling. (EVERY with NO EXCEPTIONS) Some girl is bound to fall in love with you sooner or later. They all fall in love with you when you have this. Thats when youll meet someone."
"BEAUTY (and uglyness) for the Vulnerable Narcissist Someone else from the AsPD forum chimed in on some other thread, and I think his advice is sound. The reason he meets women is he is willing to try, maybe 20 failures, but once in a while it works out. It's that willingness to try, even if you may fail that makes the difference. Hey none of us likes rejection and again I am nothing to look at it, but he is/was right, if you try and say 'hi', you may be surprised at what happens. Women are also motivated by looks, but it's not the only factor. If you need a degree of NPD to get you through it, then so be it. Say 'hi' to the next woman you pass. In a way it's that simple.

"I think I may have covert narcissism This is my first post here, so I'll tell you I'm 22 and I live with my parents. I've been going to therapy for 4 months. No, I have not taken any psychology classes... I think I may be a codependent and have narcissistic personality disorder. My therapist once described me as having self doubt. I believe that narcissists have a difficult time making decisions. I'm dishonest frequently. I sometimes lie to my friends and parents, but usually to reassure that I'm doing okay with my life, while I really feel so ###$ up inside. Despite feeling ""bad"" talking here about hurting my parents almost every single day, I never really regret having hurt them. My mom makes me feel bad and I tend to blame her for my issues, never helping her, saying terribly demeaning things about my dad in order for her to get on my side (it seldom works that way, but I try to make it so). My parents do enough for me, superficially, I've been through two years of college thanks to their help. Though I hold them accountable for a lot of my problems, which are usually things I never share, and keep secrets, even to my therapist. I know there is really something wrong with me, but I'm unable to confront myself about it because guilt it unessential to my ego. I've been to church recently, I have tried praying and doing other routines to keep my mind ""positive"", but I don't consider myself religious. My mom knows I'm not, and that I don't believe in anything. Still, I went to church a few times thinking I could play her into thinking I was going to church for spiritual development. I felt this might be putting her at ease, so she wouldn't worry about my anger issues, but it didn't. My game was figured out quickly. Despite spiritually abusing her in that way, I didn't feel guilty, just disappointed that I wasn't able to continue playing my game with her. I'm confused at this point, and wondering if I'm just a sick person, or maybe I have Covert narcissism? diagnoses: major depressive disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder"
"I think I may have covert narcissism Check the following DSM-5 diagnostic criteria: The essential features of a personality disorder are impairments in personality (self and interpersonal) functioning and the presence of pathological personality traits. To diagnose narcissistic personality disorder, the following criteria must be met: A. Significant impairments in personality functioning manifest by: 1. Impairments in self functioning (a or b): a. Identity: Excessive reference to others for self-definition and self-esteem regulation; exaggerated self-appraisal may be inflated or deflated, or vacillate between extremes; emotional regulation mirrors fluctuations in self-esteem. b. Self-direction: Goal-setting is based on gaining approval from others; personal standards are unreasonably high in order to see oneself as exceptional, or too low based on a sense of entitlement; often unaware of own motivations. AND 2. Impairments in interpersonal functioning (a or b): a. Empathy: Impaired ability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others; excessively attuned to reactions of others, but only if perceived as relevant to self; over- or underestimate of own effect on others. b. Intimacy: Relationships largely superficial and exist to serve self-esteem regulation; mutuality constrained by little genuine interest in others? experiences and predominance of a need for personal gain B. Pathological personality traits in the following domain: 1. Antagonism, characterized by: a. Grandiosity: Feelings of entitlement, either overt or covert; self-centeredness; firmly holding to the belief that one is better than others; condescending toward others. b. Attention seeking: Excessive attempts to attract and be the focus of the attention of others; admiration seeking. C. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's personality trait expression are relatively stable across time and consistent across situations. D. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's personality trait expression are not better understood as normative for the individual's developmental stage or socio-cultural environment. E. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's personality trait expression are not solely due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., severe head trauma).

"I think I may have covert narcissism I don't think you are. Sounds like you have a lot of guilt. Sounds like you're 22 and trying to figure love out. When you start trading Sex to get things, when you play games with people to get what you want, when you date with no intention of living them past the gratifying feeling you get from their affection, you've got a problem with npd, narcissism whatever. Remember that a little bit of narcissism is self preservation and good for your survival in life. Be brave with who you are and the pursuit of what you want by being honest about it and you can avoid developing a life long dysfunctional style of npd. I think it's a style that is developed and reinforced through repetition and also some other factors bUT you sound line a normal young adult who is simply struggling to figure out where your personal boundaries start and stop and that your parents might be crossing your boundaries. Sometimes parents can force you info situations that crOSS healthy boundaries so keep that in mind and be strong and tell them to back off if you feel like you have to lie to stay sane."
"I think I may have covert narcissism I identify as a compulsive giver, I perceive that my parents are mentally ill or desperate because once, when I was in my car leaving to drive across the state to get away, my dad stopped me in the middle of leaving, by physically putting himself in harm (he jumped in front of my car so that I couldn't leave). I'm unconsciously holding them accountable by evidence proving that this event as my parent having a certain inferior neediness. The only thought I have that supports I have this inkling that tells me that NPD and BPD are linked which is the only evidence I have that supports that fear of abandonment is shared by bpd and npd. I won't question my own actions because, staying around my family because I feel superior to them by giving them things. I am odd and delusional. Sam Vaknin's Narcissist as a compulsive giver video described me in a nutshell. I'm not very manipulative. For example, when I start watching something interesting on TV and someone comes to join me, and they ask what I'm watching, I'll just assume that they're displeased with whatever I'm watching and I'll tell them but then I'll say that I'm not watching it, so that they can watch whatever they want. It's just one of many examples of my passive nature. And it's ironic because I do this just so that I can people please, so ideally I get narcissistic supply from those that I please and in effect regulate my self esteem, but really the outcome is never enough coming back from them. I am stuck as a codependent in an endless chase for self esteem and then I become angry with myself. And when I get angry with myself I become frustrated the other person.

Out of control irrational fears begin to take control about people disappearing when I need them most (even when I'm left alone for a bit knowing that my parents aren't going indefinitely). Doing things doesn't make me feel good anymore, and I never know what I want out of life. I'm normally bored. About 10 months ago my therapist diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, and it had occurred to me that I had been in a chronically depressed state for many years.

"I think I may have covert narcissism Hi, I hope this finds you well and that you're in a better place than you were in April. I am codependent too, and I am 34. At 22, I acted, felt, and thought a lot like you. I was enmeshed in my parents' lives in an unhealthy way, felt like I needed to please them to get financial help, would always hand over the remote compulsively then resent it, and even went to church with my dad because, well, consciously, I needed his help with money. But underneath this, I wanted him to approve of me. If you are indeed codependent, you likely have a lot of unresolved trauma from childhood and early adulthood. Trauma doesn't have to be rape or violence. We do not become desensitized to pain over time; we actually become more sensitive. The same repetitive pain can eventually bore into us and create trauma--a damaged area that doesn't heal with time, and causes reverberations of anxiety, low self-worth, numbness, sadness, anger, and so on. If you were traumatized in your childhood home--if you are still being traumatized, as smaller slights hurt more over time--you will have a toxic environment with your parents where you are basically living, eating, and sleeping in your trauma site. A man tried to rape me once when I was 26 outside a campus apartment and every time I passed that area, I got scared and anxious. So I stopped taking that route. I didn't realize until later that this same fear and anxiety was occurring in my home because of unresolved trauma there. It is not healthy to live where you were hurt (or are being hurt), and that doesn't mean you don't love your parents. In my 20s, my codependence looked a lot like covert narcissism. I was numb. There were a lot of people in my life, but they were shadows more than anything. I pretended a lot.

Two disorders can look the same, but they are not born out of the same motivations, and their internal structures will be different once you start to deconstruct them. Connection is about sending something of yourself out into the world (or to God) and having an Other (a sentient ""object"") respond to you with their own something that they have sent to you. The two currents meet and connection is forged. In both codependents and covert narcissists, this connection is broken. Narcissists have fortified the wall separating self and other, a wall that is supposed to be semi-permeable, and thus their signals just get bounced back to them. They are locked in a frozen lake looking out at the people on top. Saying stay here, look at me, see how many flips I can do, I'm beautiful right? Going a little crazy by myself down here but the good news is that I'm so frozen, I stopped feeling most unpleasant things a long time ago.

And you can see how envy, rage, coldness, the false self, and so on would come into play. Their signals coming back to them, they think are coming from the people on top of the frozen water, and that is projection. Codependence is different; the barrier that is supposed to be semi-permiable has become perforated, and too many foreign agents infiltrate the self. We don't know where we end and other people begin. We think their problems are our problems. The narcissist says, you owe me something! The codependent says, you say it is true, and so it must be. The narcissist says, you will help me believe that my false self is a real, special, beautiful person so that I can keep believing I'm ok and not down here by myself. The codependent says, well I can't just leave you alone down there can I? Never mind that we never actually touch and I am so, so lonely here with you. o;p[]\. And because we aren't sure of ourselves, don't trust our volatile emotions (is this real or is this traumatic injury), we want other people to tell us how we are supposed to feel and act. I know these are hopelessly garbled metaphors. Maybe they can help though. The narcissist is frozen. The codependent is injured. Both can help the other feel special to compensate for low self-worth.

I always thought, well it wasn't bad enough to say I was traumatized...and I had heard about codependence, but it didn't seem dire enough to cause all of those crippling problems.

"I think I may have covert narcissism marishimo wrote: Hi, I hope this finds you well and that you're in a better place than you were in April. I am codependent too, and I am 34. At 22, I acted, felt, and thought a lot like you. I was enmeshed in my parents' lives in an unhealthy way, felt like I needed to please them to get financial help, would always hand over the remote compulsively then resent it, and even went to church with my dad because, well, consciously, I needed his help with money. But underneath this, I wanted him to approve of me. If you are indeed codependent, you likely have a lot of unresolved trauma from childhood and early adulthood. Trauma doesn't have to be rape or violence. We do not become desensitized to pain over time; we actually become more sensitive. The same repetitive pain can eventually bore into us and create trauma--a damaged area that doesn't heal with time, and causes reverberations of anxiety, low self-worth, numbness, sadness, anger, and so on. If you were traumatized in your childhood home--if you are still being traumatized, as smaller slights hurt more over time--you will have a toxic environment with your parents where you are basically living, eating, and sleeping in your trauma site. A man tried to rape me once when I was 26 outside a campus apartment and every time I passed that area, I got scared and anxious. So I stopped taking that route. I didn't realize until later that this same fear and anxiety was occurring in my home because of unresolved trauma there. It is not healthy to live where you were hurt (or are being hurt), and that doesn't mean you don't love your parents. In my 20s, my codependence looked a lot like covert narcissism. I was numb. There were a lot of people in my life, but they were shadows more than anything. I pretended a lot.

"Are either of these NPD? I'd like to know if either of these descriptions are typical of a personality type, NPD or something else. Because both of them are VERY intelligent, I wondered about aspergers, but one of them (Nathan) took a test and scored nowhere close. Thanks. Pete - Has to be the smartest person at all times. Constantly pushes his point of view, retains information well so is able to back up his claims. Can't prove him wrong without evidence. - Does well in social situations because he puts on an act - he is funny, charming, witty, loves attention - but at home with his wife, he is a miserable person. Doesn't smile, barely talks to her, is negative and depressed. - Not warm/caring/empathetic but yet he hugs friends and family and it feels sincere. - Not emotional, never cries. - He does seem to know how he is / has self-awareness, and probably knows/understands the cause. Nathan - first point verbatim. He is also right about everything. However, I noticed he seems confident about something (ex. driving directions) but then gets confused (got lost). This does not happen with Pete. - In social situations he is a complete bore. Goes on and on about things and has no sense of humor. Comes across uptight yet he claims he never lets stress get to him (I had the impression he was easily stressed, cause he never seems relaxed.) - Not warm/caring/empathic and hugging him felt like hugging a statue, though he said he didn't mind hugs. - Gets sentimental about things and cries at sad movies. - Has absolutely no concept of how he comes across to others, has no self-awareness."

"Are either of these NPD? Actually this is a support forum for people with NPD, diagnosed or suspected. That, and NPD is a personality disorder. Not a personality type. If you’re in a relationship and being affected by someone’s behavior, and you want to ask for input and advice, there’s a relationship forum for that. If you’re just trying to better understand your friends “to have a healthy relationship” as you said, try talking to them and actually getting to know them."

"Are either of these NPD? Thanks Prophet. I was emailing this friend weekly for over a year, and we got together in person every few months (the 4 of us, 2 couples). I repeatedly noticed his insensitivity in emails, his lack of ability to say please or thank you, then finally the friendship ended when I asked him about his insensitivity (in a nice way, I wasn't mean), and instead of answering me he went off on me, and said I was completely wrong about him. Like he's the expert in how he comes across to people - he has no way of knowing that! I told him how 4 different people perceived him and he said I was wrong."

Best therapy for narcissism I have the opportunity to go for therapy with a psychologist. I think this will be a good opportunity to work on my issues. But what do you think is the best therapy to focus on? I have suffered a tremendous amount of abuse in a childhood that is very different than most. Should I consider trauma therapy? How effective is this therapy? Or should I focus on some other aspect?

But foremost: What goal(s) do you have for therapy? As to trauma therapy, I'm not sure what that is I'm not sure what it's called but I guess what I mean is a form of psychoanalysis focused on childhood trauma... As to what I am looking for, it's mainly to improve my connection with people in this world. I have contacts but I have always struggled to make meaningful and long-lasting connections with people. My lack of empathy, arrogance and general asshole like behaviour/attitude does not promote me feeling connected to people. A while back I became so isolated I developed psychosis. To defeat what I considered a weakness (ie: needing people) I killed a part of myself off which triggered the psychosis. I felt that now I can be self sufficient on my own and not needy of others. To be honest this has worked in some ways. I am still isolated but I don't struggle with feeling soy sadness or depression associated with it. The problem is that now I make ""zero"" effort to connect with people, even on a superficial level it has died down to almost nothing. I do keep in touch with some people by phone but they are so far away that there is no inclusion into their lives. The issue with all this o course is that I have no meaning in my life. I am not depressed as far as I am aware (I work, hit the gym, eat healthy, seek women out...etc). But my life feels good and meaningless. I have plans but they feel like nagging in the wind and I believe the issue is a disconnection from people and the affairs of society. This is the main thing I want to work on but I also suspect I need to process my childhood trauma (mother attempted infanticide, assaulted strangers in front of me, sexual acts in front of me, trying to burn grandmothers house in front of me, emotional abuse). I believe the trauma is at the heart of my narcissistic defender and why I can't connect with others."
"Best therapy for narcissism Well when youre more schizoid then if I may give a tip, I'd look for a therapist that can complement that a bit. Else you might end up in a therapy where he gives you supercool interpretations to your absolutely amazing free-associations, which might leave you convinced that its working really great and you might feel very good about it (or relatively) but in reality its just a sort of wanking circle and no real progress is made. Also psychoanalysis I think is suited pretty well, but the speed of it will probably be slow. I dunno if youre aware of this, so its probably good to say this up front, thats a thing of many years. It depends a lot on your psychological setup and the therapist himself. My therapist is very ""respectful"" as he always says of my kinds of defense and what is defending against so even while I'm irritated sometimes that its so slow, its less dangerous - both in terms of you leaving therapy abruptly, or becoming more ill. Also - but that also will be talked about with your therapist after a while I assume - it might be necessary or a good addition to get into a rehab center or psych-clinic for a while while in treatment for specific stuff - some stuff can be resolved more quickly in that way, or so I hear. Finally as to childhood trauma, I dont think theres a therapy form that ""focuses"" on this per se, if its psychoanalytic, because the focus is on whats on your mind currently. So while that might be a bit weird and chaotic, it also means you can talk about stuff and in ways you feel ready for it when youre ready or when you feel like it. dx: SPD"
"Best therapy for narcissism That's exactly what I am now, schizoid... I will keep what you said in mind. I guess we both agree I need psychoanalytic. Good. That's at least a starting point. What I'm also starting to realise is I need to make an effort and may be required to invest in this therapy. The issue I have is that I cannot ""yield"". This act feels like a defeat of some sort and in worst cases like putting my head in a guillotine. Too much vulnerability. But I'm sure I will need to make efforts to change if I want to improve as a person."
"Best therapy for narcissism Psychoanalysis is not the treatment of choice for childhood trauma, and yes, there are therapists trained in the treatment of it, so you should seek one out. It sounds like you are very cut off from your emotions--dissociated from them--which is very common in traumatized people. Someone who is an expert at treating complex PTSD and dissociative disorders would probably be the most helpful. You can find a list at ISST-D.org (International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation). Most people don't realize that prolonged abuse in childhood causes complex PTSD and dissociation and that this accounts for many of the symptoms that we have as adults. One can't really put one's bad childhood behind (as I used to think you could) and just go on from there. It comes with you in all sorts of ways, and most of them are hidden from awareness. It affects basic things like relationships, trust, self-image, etc, and people often think that's just how they are when it really has a lot to do with how they were treated as a child.

I'm surprised you ask me o_O. I think the question contacts a lot of layers. On the very basis I would say affect tolerance is the essence of all psychotherapy, learning to tolerate what you cant tolerate and understand the reasons and connections. But I think its also very naive to think that one would be able to just ""get in touch"" with stuff one can't get in touch with. Since we have lots of ways to forget what we dont want to remember and to not see what we want to see, it seems obvious that what you can get in touch with is mostly stuff that is not hidden and therefore also not a deep, causative problem - or that might be even mistaken for something it is not, because one gets blinded by some things [apparent] intensity. My therapist has tried out a lot of methods and been in a lot of workshops and he for exampel is very opposed to therapies that purely promote ""letting out"", like primal therapy and the like - he says he has seen people being ""mentally destroyed"" by it, and I think it makes sense, because it can promote disintegration, false ideas, and paradoxically moving away from central issues and oneself, too. On the other hand side the pure contacting of emotions itself is narcissistic of course. If you keep on staring at yourself, at your thoughts, or at your feelings, that can be a form of narcissistic withdrawal or obsession and since you are using only the visible to look at the visible, while having no means [and no motivation] to look at the invisible, in the best case it wont change anything, in the worst case its going to give you a lot of false impressions and make you worse than before - or in a different way. So no, while experiencing unpleasant mental states is of course an aspect of therapy, pathological narcissism can't be battled by withdrawing into your chambers somehow and meditating, or taking drugs and hallucinating, or whatever. The narcissistic idea stream can only break itself in the prism of another person - the identification with the idealized imagos or the withdrawal into the schizoid shell only be solved in the interpersonal field. I dont think I've understood much yet, but of this I am absolutely certain. dx: SPD"

Well I wasn’t planning to start advocating it but my knowledge on the subject of NPD could only be charitably referred to as primitive while your depth of knowledge is considerably greater. I was curious what your view was and to a degree was using it to check my own understanding. Also the OP was asking about therapy to deal with trauma. I’ve no experience of either behavioural or analytic therapies for a PD but treatment for PTSD does tend to involve a lot of being encouraged to get in touch with your feelings. I could see how that would be benificial when it comes to processing a traumatic event but was failing to see how it could do much for a PD and thinking it would potentially lead to going further down the rabbit hole.

"Thoughts on *The Wizard of Oz and Other Narcissists* I do know that there is a book called *The Wizard of Oz and Other Narcissists*, but IMHO the author really missed the mark on identifying the NPD in that particular story. The following is just something I thought of while watching *The Wizard of Oz* yet again, while struggling to understand what on earth happened to my NPD ex-husband who had once been such a good man and loving father. As most people know, the condition of narcissism is named for a character in a Greek myth, Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflected image in a pool and pined away for it until he died. This has led to the idea that narcissists love only themselves, but that’s not exactly what the story means. Because he was so empty on the inside, Narcissus only existed when he saw himself reflected somewhere else. And that’s how someone with the condition called “narcissism” goes through life: An empty hole on the inside, with no sense of self-worth or self-validation to make them feel whole and human and good. At some point, possibly in response to some loss or trauma or pain, they stopped looking inward to create those things (that takes work) and indeed cut that off completely so that 100% of their validation comes from the outside - from other people (because that seems so much easier and so much more rewarding, the way it's always easier to use a drug to get a quick fix of whatever you're looking for.) But of course no other person can give them what every human really needs - which is self -worth and self -validation and self -respect - and so narcissists spend their lives as bottomless pits for attention, admiration and validation. And they only end up more and more and more empty, because that sort of pit cannot be filled from the outside. It can only be filled from within. In *The Wizard of Oz*, our famous four characters search for the things which every human needs: A brain, a heart, courage, and a home. But just like the narcissist, they make the mistake of searching for others who will supply those things instead of looking within themselves and finding what they need on the inside. The Munchkins represent well-meaning friends who actually encourage the narcissist to search outwardly instead of inwardly. “Follow the yellow brick road!” they say, because the yellow brick road leads you to the someone who, the Munchkins believe, can give you what you seek – namely, it leads to the Wizard. Glinda the Good represents a true friend who wants to help but knows she cannot, because she understands that she cannot give the characters what they seek and no one else can, either. The Wicked Witch represents full-blown narcissism run rampant. She is surrounded by evil, misshapen characters like the Flying Monkeys who try to bring her what she wants – namely, attention and admiration that she has not earned – and by thralls, the Winkie Guards, who are enslaved by her cruelty but don’t know how to break free of her. In the end, the Wicked Witch is vanquished by simply washing her away with honesty and courage. And then the Flying Monkeys are gone and we see that the Guards were not really loyal to her at all. The Wizard is a fraud, of course, because no one can give you what you must create and nurture from the inside – courage, wisdom and love. Glinda finally tells Dorothy that she had the power to go home all the time. “Why didn’t you tell me?” Dorothy cries, and Glinda says, “Because you would not have believed me. You had to learn it for yourself.” And so they did. As we all do. NPDs spend their lives looking for love and validation from Flying Monkeys and enslaved thralls - who have the power to destroy you and will not care if they do - instead of the NPDs using their own power to simply go home. In this story, ""home"" is the place *within yourself* where you will have all the intelligence, love and courage you ever wanted or needed - including people who will love you simply for yourself, as Auntie Em and Uncle Henry and all the other ""real"" characters loved Dorothy. That's why there's no place like home. The Witch wanted the Ruby Slippers, but they were unobtainable for her. That's because the Ruby Slippers represent Home and you must make your own Home - you cannot just take someone else's and expect their home to be yours. And of course the Flying Monkeys represent the enablers, sycophants, lackeys, toadys, groupies and hangers-on that powerful narcissists and other addicts virtually always attract. The Monkeys are pathetic, unnatural creatures who exist on the crumbs and leftovers of the narcissist but really care nothing for him, because if he's gone they'll just attach themselves to someone else. Remember the ""Memphis Mafia""? They were Elvis's Flying Monkeys, enablers who lived at his feet and would bring him whatever they thought he wanted - even if it was really very harmful and would ultimately kill him, which it did. Michael Jackson had Flying Monkeys, too. One of them was right there with him when he died. (I don’t know that Michael Jackson and Elvis were NPD, but both were certainly addicts for prescription drugs and, like every addict, both of them cut off their family and all non-enablers in favor of Flying Monkeys. Every addict of every kind has Flying Monkeys.) Elvis and Jacko are just two examples of people who chose - yes, chose - Flying Monkeys instead of the genuine love and respect they could have had from real family and real friends. There are many more, both famous and not. I looked at some excerpts from *The Wizard of Oz and Other Narcissists.* The author seems to feel that the Wizard himself represents an NPD. But the story didn't strike me that way at all. As I mentioned above, it's our four main characters who represent the NPDs because they're the ones looking for others to supply them with what they need instead of looking inward to find it. And the Wicked Witch represents NPD run rampant at its most destructive. But the Wizard - now, think about it: The Wizard is first shown as nothing but an ugly and very angry face, shouting and growling and erupting in fire and fury, living as a recluse and trying to get rid of all these NPDs who keep trying to Get Things From Him. He's not trying to get anything from anybody. He hides from everyone and tries to get them to leave him alone. He clearly looks to be angry, lonely and suffering. ""GO AWAY!"" ""I was hoping the Wicked Witch would kill you and I would never see you again."" ""PAY NO ATTENTION to the man behind the curtain!"" No NPD would EVER say such things. They live for constant attention and emotional feeding from others. They are the polar opposite of the Wizard. To me, the Wizard represents the spouses and adult children of all the charming, sweet-talking, innocent-looking NPDs who have been tormenting them to death for years. There is a lot of talk about “narcissistic rage” from the NPD, but I can tell you that the NPD’s victims often find themselves literally raging and screaming from the extreme frustration and agony of being used as a drug instead of treated like a real human being. Finally, when the Wizard's true form is revealed as a gentle and quite ordinary man - who is a fraud only in the sense that he cannot give the NPDs what they want any more than anyone else can - he is able to get the NPDs to look inside for what they want, and then he is able to get free of them and go home himself. It's left to Glinda to help Dorothy with the biggest hurdle of all - understanding where Home really is. I don't think the Wizard represents a full-blown Narcissist at all. That's The Wicked Witch. The angry, hideous, reclusive and lonely Wizard represents the NPD's tormented and isolated victims. I was thinking about where Toto figures in the story. I think that because Toto is an animal - a normal, natural animal, not a fantasy creature like the Lion - he therefore represents the kind of innocence and purity of spirit that can never be contaminated by narcissism. He can neither be one nor respond to one. It is in protecting Toto that Dorothy finds the courage to destroy the Wicked Witch, and it is Toto who reveals that the angry, blustering, supernatural-looking wizard is also a ""real"" creature who should be treated as such - not merely used as a source of supply for NPDs, which is what left him raging, suffering and reclusive. When the innocent Toto pulls back the curtain, the Wizard can finally respond to the NPDs as his real self and *then* he is able to get free of them - presumably to go back to a normal, natural world. The only place where the metaphor doesn't quite hold, IMHO, is that the Wizard actually *is* able to turn around the behaviour of the NPDs simply by pointing out their own positive traits to them and showing them that they didn’t have to go looking for what they needed from someone else – that they would find they had brains, love and courage all along if they would only look within instead of demanding these things from others. We know that such a change happens only rarely, if ever, in the real world – maybe because NPD is never treated as the addiction it really is. Maybe we should all insist that an NPD start looking within to find positive traits and a loving Home - and maybe they would. Surely that is a better life than being like the Wicked Witch, who was indeed powerful and the focus of attention but was also despised and feared and alone with only thralls and Flying Monkeys for company - and they cared nothing for her in the end. Surely we wish better for the people we love, whether they are NPDs or not. Perhaps especially if they are NPDs."

"Thoughts on *The Wizard of Oz and Other Narcissists* I agree with everyone else, Great Post. I haven't seen the Wizard of Oz for years, think I'll watch it again. Only one thing I disagree with, you say; Elvis and Jacko are just two examples of people who chose - yes, chose - Flying Monkeys instead of the genuine love and respect they could have had from real family and real friends. There are many more, both famous and not. Could Jacko have had genuine love from his real family? Surely that was his big problem his family was so dysfunctional. His violent bullying father put him on stage whilst he was very young and beat him if he didn't get it right. He never learnt to play and socialize with other kids, it was just work, work, work. He was not close to his siblings, when his career took off big time they got left behind maybe causing resentment creating more rifts between them. I don't think he chose Flying Monkeys I think they were just better than no one at all . The Jacksons particularly the Father are just SO Narcissic. UGH. Jacko probably went low contact to get away from them and their toxic legacy. I sure he yearned for a loving family. He was abused by his 'real family' that's why he was so messed up. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Lao Tzu"

"Thoughts on *The Wizard of Oz and Other Narcissists* At the risk of sounding like a Euler groupie, (I chimed in with a message of support the last time that you posted, Euler) - I just wanted to say that this is why I am so glad that other narcissists still post on this forum. The unrelenting stuff about how wicked/evil/bad we are can be a bit disheartening, but the posts from narcissists remind me that I am human, we aren't monsters. I know that you (the nons) have been (very) badly treated, and I can't begin to understand how that has made you feel, but at the same time part of the function of this forum is to support narcissists. I also acknowledge that you (the nons) are supportive when talking to us directly on here, & probably hold back on a lot that you'd like to say. Anyway, I do understand that this thread wasn't particularly created for narcissists, but it lifted my spirits to see that Euler had posted on it, even before I read what she had written. She's 'just' another human being, struggling with the sort of self awareness and attempts to improve that the rest of us on here are struggling with - although my problems are much milder than some other narcissists'. (Sorry, Euler, I'm not trying to assume that I know how you think, or what your own problems are.) Well - that wasn't really to do with 'The Wizard of Oz and Other Narcissists' - more just general thoughts that I've been having; I'll be off now."

Personality Disorders weren 't identified much less singled out until the past couple of decades (that's not including treatment options). Get real. sorry, this is zombieworthy. Had to agree with Euler: Frank Baum was an economist and the book is about the ""Bimetallic standard"" ie silver and gold that money supply based on (not that I didnt love the PD version) but this story is all about that debate which i think was closer to 1898. And since it's such an issue-the wizard I think represented William Jennings Bryant. But the story is an economic allegory and very indepth in symbolism - for one thing, there's no ruby slippers, theyre Silver. And at the end -the wizard I believe gives them all bimetallic gifts (ie those with both gold and silver, and thus showed Baum supported the bimetalliic standard as a macroeconomic solution to ""How to increase the money supply?"" (it was the olden days-money was backed by actual commodities of value, like precious metals (til '73 i think trickydick) Anyway couple key things-dorothy is america, tinman the industrial worker, scarecrow the farmer... i forget lion, Toto i think represents ""Totallitarians"" and emerald city is DC and everyone there has to wear Green glasses (self explanatory) and it got really indepth with how many stairs and what they represented and notice the road-paved in gold all the way to DC. THe opium fields, in the book there's a China City where they kinda jack things up based on our US Imperialism at the time.. EVen the Phillipines is in the book and there's whole lot more... SO it was an economic allegory that Baum wrote to promote the bimetallic standard argument, who knew! But just wanted to make sure you all knew.. Euler -not crazy"
"Question about ""loss of self"" Hello there. This will meander, I apologise! For a while now I have been experiencing a flatness of emotion, motivation and all that, brought about by ""pretending to be normal"" all the time to the extent that I don't know who I am anymore. Hence the title of this thread. I feel I have lost myself and am seriously going through the motions. It's a weird detached feeling and ""brain fog"" sums it up pretty well. The reason I post this here in the NPD section is that despite a diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome nine years ago, I identify very strongly with the definition of a covert narcissist, albeit sub-clinically, insofar as I have not been diagnosed as such. I expend a vast amount of mental energy projecting a self that I want to see projected, repressing interests that I don't think others will approve of, and this has taken its toll over twenty-five years now. The artificiality of my performed self and the energy it takes to maintain it have led to me avoiding almost all social encounters outside the workplace. I live far away from my family and see them for a couple of days every few months (on separate occasions as my parents split up when I was twelve.) I have no friends except for my girlfriend who I have lived with for over ten years now but am concerned that she is drifting away from me. I assumed that as time went by and I got older I would care less what other people think but if anything it's got worse. Basically I am wondering if anyone here can point me in the direction of any tips or advice as to how to find out who I am underneath the performance, if there are any reconnection techniques or methodologies I can look into, before it's too late to have any kind of authentic life to speak of. (Not to sound too dramatic!) I have searched online but it is very hard to exclude the many results that are for people on the ""other side"" of narcissism. Thanks in advance, Cult of Byron.

"Question about ""loss of self"" I’m not as familiar with the subtypes of narcissism, I believe at the core of NPD there is a lack of self, most who develop the condition were shamed for expressing themselves or taught they weren’t good enough, so a projection of what they idealize or they think other people idealize becomes the what they are to an extent except it’s not, and deep down they know it and the bad behavior you tend to see from narcs is them trying to protect this fragile balance, which of course is impossible to do because the self that is hidden was determined to be defective by the narc long ago and discarded sometimes along with most of his own feelings and the perfect persona they try to project is impossible, everything is a cycle of going back and forth back and forth."

Bromberg, Philip - Awakening The Dreamer wrote: A child's core self becomes internally bonded to the early parental objects through interactions that reinforce who the parent perceives the child to be and who the parent denies the child to be. The main source of power that parents have over children comes not so much out of what they tell the child to do as from ""showing"" him who he is. That is, by relating to the child as though he is ""such and such"" and ignoring other aspects of him as if they do not exist, the parents ""disconfirm"" (Laing,1962) the relational existence of those aspects ofthe child's self that they ignore. This disconfirmation, because it is relationally nonnegotiable, is traumatic by definition and is intrinsic to the existence of developmental (relational) trauma. Such trauma is typically cumulative. 1f the child's sense of self is to remain intact as he matures, he has to preserve the early attachment patterns on which his core self rests by continuing to exist in the mind of each new significant other that comes along as the same ""self' that was ""his parents' child."" As he does so he continues to dissociate those aspects of self that originally were too disjunctive with the core attachment to be contained as ""me."" This is a major reason why it is so difficult for many people to change in treatment. An unreflective attachment to the early disconfirming object means having to be whoever the other person seems to see you as (in order for you to prevent self-destabilization), not simply having to do what the other person seems to want you to do. Thus, a central goal of any treatment is that the therapist enable the patient to move from experiencing his enacted patterns of behavior as the person he is , to experiencing these patterns as something that he does , and thereby facilitate the development of self-reflection. Again, for many patients characterologically, and for all patients in some areas of their personality, the development of self-reflection must precede any attempt at investigating conflict. In the areas where development has been thwarted, the analyst attempts to help a patient change what is classically called ego syntonic to what is classically called ego alien. Thus the enacted ways of being are no longer ""who I am"" but are gradually replaced by the cognitive perspective of ""what I do."" As this change takes place, a person is more able to hold, reflect on, and potentially resolve disjunctive self-experiences as states of conflict without the effort's being automatically short-circuited by dissociative processes designed to protect self-continuity. dx: SPD"

"BOOK COMMENT REVIEW SYNOPSIS GRB comments on Alistair Munro's Book ""Delusional Disorder..."" I highly recommend the website http://shop.ebrary.com/ , where you can read the above book online for free. The information below is taken from p. 232-234, which deserve to be read in their entirety. For me, this section of the book has given me some modest hope, as it paints a picture of the treatment process and some possible favorable outcomes. There is also some practical advice for the psychiatrist. By necessity, I will paraphrase Munro: Because of the patients reluctance to trust psychiatrists, ideally, assessment and treatment should be by a family physician... but they may not always have the necessary familiarity with this condition and recent advances in its treatment. The psychiatrist must be patient and will often have to spend more than one session gaining the patients confidence before even trying to persuade them to take meds. The patient will usually vehemently argue against taking medications, ""but calm persistence does finally pay off in a reasonable proporatioon of cases"". Medication should be started with a ""very low"" dose which is then raised ""gradually and cautiously"", to prevent sudden onset of side effects, ""an event guaranteed to induce immediate noncompliance."" Munro recommends that the patient see the psychiatrist at least once a week during this early stage. Munro is a champion of the drug pimozide, used in low doses (""starting with 1 or 2 mg daily...and in most cases [will need to be gardually raised to] no higher than 4 to 6 mg per day""). He has used this drug primarily to treat delusional disorder of the somatic subtype, with good results. Minor improvements may be seen within a few days (e.g., reduced agitation, somewhat reduced preoccupation with the delusion), but it takes about two weeks (on the average; sometimes as much as 6 weeks) of treatment (assuming the patient is compliant and responding to the medication), before significant amelioration of the delusion is observed. I will quote the following passage in whole, as it addresses a scenario which has caused me worries (the person stops taking their meds), and actually manages to turn it around into something hopeful: Quote: Quite often the patient feels sufficiently improved early on in treatment that he or she decides to stop the medication. Inevitably the delusion and the accompanying agitation and preoccupation start to reappear and it is then that the treating physician has the best opportunity to obtain ongoing co-operation. Even when the patient is still adamant that his beliefs are real, the experience of improvement followed by incipient relapse seems to make a deep impression and if the patient now trusts the physician he or she will often become extremely compliant. In successful cases the complete turnaround from rejection to trust is both remarkable and heartily gratifying. Munro also observes that in the cases where the patient makes a ""good recovery"", it is often ""relatively rapid and notably complete... even when the delusion has been present for a very long time"". Sounds great, doesn't it? [icon_smile.gif] He also talks about long-term maintenance of treatment (which not surprisingly typically involves continuing meds indefinitely), and mentions that of the (admittedly small) group of patients he has been able to follow up with over the long term, about 1/3 have actually been weaned from meds. These occasionally have relapses, but apparently have sufficient insight at that point that they actually voluntarily resume medication. I also found the following passage very interesting: Quote: There is a dissociation between acquired insight as to the desirability of continuing treatment and in-depth insight into the illness itself. Many patients never accept fully the psychotic nature of their experience, but so long as they agree to take treatment, it seems unimportant, and probably unkind, to face them with the fact that they were delusional before the medication took effect. Munro concludes with a few thoughts on non-drug treatment of delusional disorder, stating essentially that psychological (""talk"") treatment is essentially not helpful until possibly, in some cases, after the delusions have been resolved using medication. A final warning is given: ""There is a general consensus that psychotherapy of an exploratory, uncovering type is not appropriate in delusional disorder. "" I'll say it again, this section of the book deserves to be read by anybody dealing with a loved one suffering from delusional disorder. It helped me, and I hope it will help you, too. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Roger C comments on ""I am Not Sick, I Do Not Need Help"" by Dr. Xavier Amador Dr. Amador writes from his own personal experience, both as brother of a schizophrenia patient, and as a clinical psychologist. A large problem with treating people with schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders is that many times they won't stay in treatment. The usual explanation for this is that they lack insight into their illness. That is, they are not aware they have a mental illness, or in many cases even that they are exhibiting symptoms. Attempts to reason with such patients about their illness are futile. Dr. Amador postulates that this inability to perceive their illness is caused by the same kind of brain disfunction that is responsible for the illness itself. Experiments have proven this to be true. So, since most of these patients are incapable of understanding that they are ill, how can doctors and family members convince them to stay in treatment programs? Dr. Amador gives a four-step method for providing patients with insight into the benefit of treatment, thus giving them motivation to stay in treatment. For example, one schizophrenic patient wanted very much to be able to hold down a job, but had only a few jobs over the years, most of which lasted only a short time. Rather than simply telling this patient that a job was out of the question, the doctor empathized with the patient's desire, and then helped the patient look back to the times when he was able to get a job, and the events that led up to losing the job, and related these events to the patient's treatment program (or lack thereof). This helped the patient to gain insight into the benefit of treatment. The book finishes with a couple of chapters about knowing when to commit a loved one, and how to go about it. All the advice sounds reasonable, and Dr. Amador's track record of success with it speaks for itself. It should be universally applicable, since the method is based on identifying issues that are important to the patient himself; anything he is dissatisfied with and wants to change will provide a means to motivate the patient to stay in treatment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sean et al comments: I saw Dr. Amador speak at the 2003 NAMI National Convention, if you ever have a chance I suggest seeing him. He spent a great deal of time at the end of the session answering questions from people with a mentalli ill loved one. His sympathy and understanding towards the person with the illness was incredible. As he spoke he explained Schizophrenia and the inability to recognize the illness in simple terms: He asked someone from the audience to give a brief bio about themself. The woman who volunteered (I'll call her Susan) was a Psychologist with a loving husband and two children. She gave a brief description of her job, her family, and her life in general. Then Dr. Amador then went on to talk directly to Susan, saying basically the following: Quote: Susan, I have some bad news for you. You aren't really a Psychologist, in fact, the practice where you think you work called me and asked that I tell you to stop going there every day. There's more though, you aren't really married. Tom also has asked me to help you get help and to stop going to his house. Those children aren't yours, and the house isn't yours. You're sick Susan, and I'm going to take you to the hospital and get you some help. This demonstration, more than anything else, made me aware of how frightening it must be to have Schizophrenia and have your reality stolen from you. No wonder someone with such an illness has conspiratorial thoughts. If someone came and told me my entire life was imagined I'd think they were lying. When they went on to say I needed help and then started trying to make me take medication I wouldn't trust them. I know I haven't done the demonstration justice, but try and imagine yourself hearing those words. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GRB comments on Amador: One approach is to ""empower"" the patient to make their own decision about whether to stay on meds, by promising that no one will object if they go off the meds, under the condition that they keep a journal during the periods that they are not taking medications... Also, a thought on the idea mentioned above, about finding a motivator for the patient to stay in treatment (and which could presumably be used to motivate the person to seek treatment...). Roger had mentioned difficulties in applying this concept in his case. I would agree that this approach would work much better with schizophrenia, for example, than delusional disorder, because in the latter case the person is only affected by the disorder in a limited way, due to the ""encapsulated"" nature of the delusions. The person suffering from DD is likely to be highly functional within society in general and professionally, whereas the disorder primarily affects interpersonal relationships with those close to him or her. So, I think it is a general truth that many people with DD actually do not perceive a worsened quality of life as a result of their (untreated) condition. They might notice a positive change after starting medication, which might be helpful in assuring future compliance, but the problem of how to get the person into treatment in the first place remains vexing.... Dr. Amador introduces his four steps. Listen Effective listening is really a skill that needs to be cultivated. You will need to learn to really listen to what your loved one feels, wants, and believes in. Listening without learning is pointless. First, you need to walk in the other person's shoes to gain a clear idea of their experience of the illness and treatment. For the uninitiated, this is not as easy as it may sound on the face of it. Too many times we make assumptions without checking them out with the person about whom we are making assumptions. Knowledge is power. When you know how someone experiences the idea of having a mental illness and taking psychiatric drugs, you will have obtained the leverage you need to begin to build a treatment agreement. But you will also need to know what their hopes and expectations are for the future, whether or not you believe they're realistic. And finally, you want to identify the cognitive deficits (e.g. problems with memory, attention, focusing thoughts) that are creating barriers between you and the person you're concerned about and between that person and effective treatment. Empathize The second step involves learning when and how to express empathy. If there were a moral to each step and chapter, this one would go something like this: If you want someone to seriously consider your point of view, be certain he feels you have seriously considered his. Quid pro quo. That means that you must empathize with all of the reasons he has for not wanting to accept treatment, even the ""crazy"" ones. But don't worry; empathizing with how a particular delusion makes one feel is not the same as agreeing that the belief is true. This may seem like a minor point, but, as you will learn, the right kind of empathy will make a tremendous difference on how receptive your loved one is to your concerns and opinions. In the chapter devoted to this step, I give you step-by-step instructions on how to do this using techniques such as reflective listening. Agree Find common ground and stake it out. Knowing that what you want for the other person is something she does not want for herself can make it seem as if there is no common ground. She doesn't think she needs medication or therapy, and you think she does. Like any conflict of beliefs between two people, to resolve the disagreement to your satisfaction requires that you discover what motivation the other person has to change. Common ground always exists even between the most extreme opposing positions. The emphasis is on acknowledging that your loved one has personal choice and responsibility for the decisions he makes about his life. During this step, you become a neutral observer, pointing out the various positive and negative consequences of decisions your loved on has made. That means refraining from saying things like, ""See if you had taken your medication, you wouldn't have ended up in the hospital."" Your focus is on making observations together - identifying facts upon which you can ultimately agree. Rather than making an observation or statement about what happened you ask a lot of questions such as ""So what happened after you decided to stop taking your medication?"" ""Did the voices quiet down after you stopped?"" ""How long after stopping the medication was it before you went to the hospital?"" If you are truly collaborating, asking questions rather than giving advice or direction comes a lot easier than it may sound. Partnership Forming a partnership for recovery is the last and, in my experience, the most satisfying step in this process. The aim of this step is to help you to collaborate on accomplishing the goals you agreed upon. Unlike the previous steps, this one involves both you and your loved one making an explicit decision to work together and to become teammates against a common opponent. You may call the enemy different names, but the names are irrelevant to arriving at a plan of action. The final step culminates in arriving at a treatment agreement. _________________"
"Welcome Welcome. I have been recently asked to moderate this forum on Delusional Disorder. I am not a doctor, but I believe I have some first hand experience. What is Delusional Disorder? This illness is a psychosis characterized by non-bizzare delusions which last at least one month. The intensity of such perceptions may wax or wane over time. The person suffering from delusions is often functional in all other aspects of their life. Statistically this illness strikes woman more than men. There are at least six sub-types: Erotomanic: Belief that another person, usually of higher status, is in love with him or her. This other person may be a boss, coworker, celebrity, or stranger. Grandiose: Belief that he or she is much more important, powerful, wealthy, or talented than he or she really is. Jealous: The belief that his or her partner has been grossly unfaithful without regard to substantiating evidence. Persecutory: Believes that he or she is being plotted against, spied on, followed, or harassed by unknown enemies. These delusions sometimes involve conspiracies of people out to ""get"" the sufferer. Somatic: He or she is ill or has other types of health problems. Mixed type: Suffers from more than one of the delusions listed above. Delusional Disorder is sometimes a associated with other personality disorders or a subset of other psychoses; and there is a certain overlap with Paranoid Personality Disorder. It may be helpful to you to check the posts in that forum as well. The above information was culled from various internet sources.

"Glitch On Thursday, August 7, around dusk (9 pm), I let the dogs outside. I opened the wrought iron door, and all four dogs ran outside. First, the Australian cattle dog, then the two little beagles (a blue and tricolor), while growling and nipping at each other, and finally my lovable Bernedoodle. I shut and locked the door; it felt darker in the house with the door shut, so I turned on the light, and the blue beagle was somehow still inside. My friends say they call that ""getting old."" They say it happens all the time with their keys, glasses, tools, etc. I've read about the concepts of samsara, duality, nirvana, and the Matrix theory. Not to mention my news feed on MSNBC has stories about alien technology, AI utilization, and even physicists discussing the concept of the multiverse. While modern psychiatry has a place in recovery, it isn't the solution for every part of perception and experience that can't be solved. I feel well. I'm not insane, just pay attention mindfully. I've been meditating more lately. Most people are so plugged into technology and living in distraction, they'd probably not even notice if something like that happened to them.

"Did Taylor Swift read my thread before writing Fortnigt? I’m not saying Taylor Swift owes me concert tickets... but Fortnight hit me like a lightning bolt straight from my own therapeutic writing journal. The imagery. The emotional wreckage. That line— ""I love you, it's ruining my life... I touched you for only a fortnight..."" It reflects something I wrote in January 2023: “I feel like I'm driving a Ferrari without brakes... When years of CBT hit, the engine glitches. A painfully hard feeling.” Coincidence? Maybe. But when you post historic romance scenes set in 1886 (August 2020), and the Fortnight video shows up with gothic aesthetics and heartbreak experiments... it’s tempting to believe in synchronicity. If Taylor was inspired by reading online diaries like mine (yes, it’s catalogued under therapeutic writing in the delusional disorder forum at PsychForums), I’d be honored to gift her the owner’s manual I’ve been trying to write my whole life. Also, as a recovering alcoholic, that video? The costumes, the silence, the mourning? Absolutely nailed my aesthetic. Swifties—what do you think? Are we cosmically entangled?

I'm thankful that my mom was cooking, and offered me to stop by for a bit. I didn't stay long and even though we've all had our vaccine's we still socially distanced. On the drive home along the *mod edit* route, I was awestruck by the moon rise on the Eastern horizon in the middle of my windshield. It was amazing. It took up most of the sky in the distance. According to my moon app, it was only at 95%, but awesome in all its glory on the horizon. It made me feel better about my pickup line that had autocorrected. I was working to set plans for tonight. He'd said, ""You are a persistent little gal.."" I replied ""I am:) The question is, are you into that?"" He said, ""Of course. It's been a while"" I attempted to persuade my audience with a promise to only ""commit to thirty minutes."" When I pressed to send the message, the text sent to him said, ""I promise to only vomit to thirty minutes."" Autocorrect foiled my potential plans. I still haven't heard back from the man since the terrible autocorrected typo. Apparently, he didn't find it funny. Technology is great; when it works. At least he has yet to delete or end the conversation. I tried to explain it was autocorrect at its worst, but I'm afraid I spooked him.

"Growing Hope - The Gratefulness Thread Tonight I'm thankful for my dog Honey. She is so loyal, that she won't even walk away from my car with the vet tech without me getting out to walk with her. She refused to leave my car, eventually, the vet tech asked me to help (even though the sign explicitly says ""Do not leave your car."") Honey made me so proud of how she waits for me and only me to walk with her. None of the other dog owners had the distinction of being their pets only trusted other. Then when I turned to leave her at the front doors with the tech, all the other pet owners watched as she slipped from her collar to escape the vet tech. The other pet owners saw her run into my arms as I caught her before she found her way to the massive intersection with 3 lanes headed in every direction. From the warmth of their cars with their headlights shining towards us, I was thankful I caught her, but I wished I hadn't worked from home today. My outfit and shoe choice was questionable at best, and my cotton hem fluttered in the breeze, I'd skipped the tights, and my wool coat had half the dogs shedding hair clinging to the fabric. Another nice spring day was cooling off from the sunset. I hope Honey's treatment goes well tomorrow. It's too quiet without her here to guard her spot outside my door. I miss her grumbling growl at every headlight that pulls by the house and her intense show of defense against pedestrians who dare walk by. Tonight, there is only Buddy's faint snoring and the distant rumble of the train rolling along the edge of the prairie sounding its horn, as usual. Earlier, I read Joan my article, a submission for an online publication. She thought it was amazing but then again she's my friend. It was going great until my teenager came in to ask, ""what's for dinner?"" I realized it was almost 8 pm Central time. By the time I finished cooking it was almost 9. Late-night for dinner.

"Growing Hope - The Gratefulness Thread Tonight I took my daughter to the super Target and Trader Joe's. I am grateful that they had what we needed in stock. Cleaning supplies, dog food, breakfast, lunch, snack, and fruits and veggies, and some chicken. Tonight is trash night so I went around and found all the trash cans and took out the garbage to the curb for when Mr. Jinx comes by. My trash collector said he likes home-baked food and treats that time I had over 20 bags of leaves from my dozen trees, and he knocked on the door to let me know the max is 6 bags, but I'm lucky because he is my trash man, and he planned to take all of them. He and the other trucks usually roll into the neighborhood early, like 7 am. This evening I'm on top of things. The bins are at the curb. I won't have to run with the giant rolling recycling bin and household refuse in my sleepwear barefoot to the curb. I wonder how many other moms have a relationship with the trash service where they'll pause in the neighborhood if the bins aren't out and purposefully compact the load in front of the house, giving me the precious seconds to get down and get the bins to the curb. I'm grateful for the disposal service, Mr. Jinx, and his colleagues because I really don't like managing the routine with the garbage. I really need to learn to become more organized and keep my household in better order.

So, if we are to hide some facts about ourselves, that means that we are being dishonest... ...I dunno. I just don't 'get' socialising, but I do have Asperger's Syndrome. Don't just suddenly stop taking your meds again - bad move entirely! I have done it a few times, and all have resulted in a feeling like the whole world is out to get me. I don't believe that meds should be given if they do this but, then again, they help me so much when I take them correctly. I don't know, Sunng, I guess we will all get there eventually if you we just hang in there. Take care my friend, Kevin Last edited by Chucky on Sat Aug 02, 2008 11:23 pm, edited 1 time in total."
"Hi, My brother says 'Namaste' too, and he is a part-time yoga teacher. His partner is too. What does it mean, exactly? I have made a lot of posts here - yes - but it is very stressful for me. I cotinue to do it because I know what feeling mental pain is like, and I want to use my experience to help people. It doesn't always work though, because some people turn around and start attacking you, even though you try to help them. Yes, when I said that we will get 'there', I meant to a recovery. Well, maybe a complete recovery is something that is unattainable, but we can certainly learn how to live alongside our problems and not allow them to interfere too much. Keep on truckin', as they say! Kevin"
"Okay, at least now I know what my brother means when he says it to me. I should really have just asked him though, but I grew tired of asking him so many questions about his yogic philosophy. He went to a retreat centre in Austria about three years ago and met his [now] girlfriend there; and he's now living with her in England. Anyway, namaste, Kevin"
"Thank you Sunny - I appreciate that you are trying to help. One thing puzzles me though: They say that they don't "" advise, judge, or discriminate "" - What do they do then? The only thing that I can see as being possibly missing from this list is listening, so, maybe that's what they do, right? Kevin"
"Cool - it sounds very much like the group session that I went to for depression a few months ago. I did not enjoy it too much because everyone there was mu ch older than me, but I think I would have enjoyed it if there were people there my own age. Everyone seemed to know each other too, and I felt very much like the outsider. Kevin"
"Question of how delusional beliefs are caused Option 3: delusions are created by the introduction of a false statement which is incorrectly perceived as truthful, which then in turn influences the perception of anything that contradicts the new ""truth"". A bit like how you could teach someone for their entire youth that 1+1 = 11, and then you provide proof of it being 2, so the brain has to adjust. Once it chooses to believe 1+1 = 2, it then discards any old memories saying otherwise. Gaslighting works similar too. In general you can make someone believe a fallacy if you are persistent enough. To look at your options, it's a bit of both but also neither of those options. You don't make these things up. You are somehow triggered to believe something.

I did wonder if development believing in false memories or lying to yourself too much can create unhealthy self-delusion, like in severe form of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Some people believe that people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder lie to to themselves too much that bags to question if they became delusional overtime, not that it's the same as as traditional psychosis. But only some people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder lie to themselves that are harmful to others, most of them cause relationship issues that severe harm. Some people generalize people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder as being all the same, but because not every person with Narcissistic Personality Disorder are the same, generalizing people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder as being all bad is stigmatizing. Some websites say that people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder lie to themselves too much and are delusional overtime, but I get confused, because they don't use the word 'some', because not everyone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder are going to have all the traits. Please, educate me if I am wrong"
"Question of how delusional beliefs are caused I'm terribly sorry. Life was rather chaotic and busy for me for a while there. So the thing with narcissism is that it usually is a behavioural front for an insecure person. They need the attention and suffer physically if they aren't the centre of attention. So a delusion or psychosis requires you to believe what you're thinking /experiencing. At least initially, and then behave accordingly. In example, your delusion could make you believe that you are the envoy of God with magic abilities. You will believe this. A narcissist doesn't believe things that are improbable or even impossible unless they experience delusions thanks to a different problem. Narcissists simply are convinced that they are deserving of better things than others. It's a difference between arrogance and having lost touch with reality, to put it very broadly. Does that explain it a bit ? Grey, she/her Kay, any pronouns Raven, she/her Bipolar 1 | Dissociation | (C-)PTSD | Recovered from anorexia nervosa"

"How to deal with what I believe is delusional jealousy? Hi, I’m new and I hope this is the right place for this topic. At first, when my partner started acting strangely, I thought maybe it was me giving off the wrong impression somehow, or perhaps he was just abusive or narcissistic, but his behavior has morphed into something else and him into someone I don’t recognize. We’ve been together for 2 years and are living together. His main behaviors a- wanting access to my phone and phone password. Going into a frenzy if I receive an app notification thinking it’s from another man. - contacting me constantly wanting to know what I’m doing and mad if I don’t reply -slowly trying to chip away at my friendships saying all men are in love with me and I can’t have friendships with men. -constantly accusing me of having online and offline relationships - when I go to visit my family he thinks I’m out doing it with random men when I’m with my family. - if my friends are male, male coworkers, or even a male female couple they want me and I’m doing it with them. I cannot even mention talking to a male coworker in my break room without setting him into an episode of yelling screaming and accusations for hours on end. -looking at and misinterpreting my social media and thinking I’m doing nefarious things that are actually incredibly innocent. I could go on, but these are the main ones. I have never cheated on this man (or ever tbh, it’s just not who I am) and I did eliminate my male friendships to make him happy and so I didn’t have to put up with his behavior. Even when he is presented with proof (like my Google location, calls to show I’m with my parents, showing him the apps that have gone off, giving him my phone passwords) he still insists on the delusions. The most recent was that I was in a hot tub at my friends house doing it with other men. My friend does not even own a hot tub (he has been to her home), and furthermore, I was at my parents home and in bed and calling him to show him this, but he wouldn’t believe me. I sent my Google maps location and he didn’t believe that. I finally got a hold of him on the phone and showed him my child sleeping next to me and he somehow didn’t believe that and turned it around to say he was calling because I’d blocked him on text (I didn’t). He does not even think he is jealous nor controlling, and sees no problem with this behavior and thinks I am 100% cheating on him. If I deny and provide evidence I’m cheating. If I say that I’m not going to argue because he won’t believe me either way, that’s also proof of the cheating. He is not sorry he hurts me or makes me cry. He offers no apologies for his behavior, and when the constant accusations upset me and I try to leave the room or start crying, it just angers him even more and he says I’m just upset because he’s right. I am not in a position to leave for another few months due to life circumstances. He has already grabbed and thrown my phone and I am worried for the behavior to escalate. How do I keep him calm until I can get out of this situation. Any suggestions would be so much appreciated."
"How to deal with what I believe is delusional jealousy? I am so sorry that your post has not had any responses yet. I think it can be hard, for family members of those suffering from DDJ, to get on this forum without making them angry. I understand you saying that you cannot leave for a few months, but PLEASE leave as soon as you can. It never gets better. It only gets worse. I have been with my DDJ husband for 23 years, we just recently separated for the last time. (There have been many separations) He did not always act that way but I think it was always there and I just didn't realize it. The episodes used to be few and far between but increased with time. The past couple of years have been never ending accusations. Just like with you, any males or male/female couples are fair game for him to accuse me of sleeping with them. I have been accused of knowing and having affairs with complete strangers at the drive thru window, as well as at stores, recreation areas, etc... And I have no male friends and I had to quit jobs over men working there. Most of the time, I was not even allowed to work at all. I was even accused of sneaking off to see someone during covid lockdowns. (I didn't) DO NOT RELY ON GOOGLE MAPS!! I went to a grocery store that did not have good cell service in the back of the store. I guess google maps tried to triangulate my position and was off by several blocks. Even though I had a receipt from the store showing that I checked out with a huge amount of groceries at almost the same time it showed me at the other location, he refused to believe me and to this day swears that I was having a threesome during that lost 5 minutes. I started recording myself on Facebook live after that and just set it to private. He of course had access to my facebook account. You would think that would solve everything, instead it made it worse. It seemed to make him angry that I had proof that I had not done anything wrong. A couple of times, especially going into stores, the livestream would get interrupted and I would be accused of doing it on purpose to ""hide what I was really doing."" I fully believe that abuse and narcissism go hand in hand with this condition. My husband has been abusive as well, and he definitely displays narcissistic traits. Sometimes I wonder if he really does believe these things or if he is just projecting his behaviours onto me. He accused me of secret social media accounts, when he actually had them. He accused me of sneaking around to see someone, when he was doing that. Most recently, he started talking to an old female friend and became obsessed with her and confessed his love to her. It was not mutual and now he blames me for that. I must have done something to drive her away. They say that most with delusional disorder will exhibit signs of more than one delusion. He has had the jealousy delusions, the thinking someone is in love with him when they are not at all delusions, and the paranoid delusions that everyone is out to get him, that random people are laughing at him and talking about him, that he is being spied on or posioned, etc... It literally doesn't matter what you do. Argue, don't argue, have proof, don't have proof. He will take whatever your response is and make it proof of your infidelity. I have taken 2 lie detector tests. I passed both but they did me no good at all. He has even been to a therapist on more than one occasion. He lies. When I have gone with him and they realize that he is lying and try to actually help, he will not ever see that therapist again. Even the other members who have been able to get their family member to get the correct therapy and take the correct meds, will tell you that the previous delusions are there to stay. He will never be able to be aware that he was wrong. You will always be a cheater in his eyes and he will never trust you. If you have no choice but to stick it out for a few months, then just understand that he may lose control and become abusive. He may also tell everyone how horrible you are and they may believe him. GET OUT AS SOON AS YOU CAN. I wish I had. I stayed with my husband because I really love him and wanted to help him and fixx this. There is no fixning it and he does not really love me."
"How to deal with what I believe is delusional jealousy? I'm really sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing in your relationship. It sounds like you're dealing with a complex situation involving extreme jealousy and controlling behavior, which can indeed be quite distressing. It's important to prioritize your safety and well-being. Seeking support from friends, family, or professionals who specialize in relationship issues could be beneficial. This situation does highlight aspects of male delusion where irrational beliefs and unfounded accusations can create a harmful environment. Remember, your safety and mental health should always come first."
"How to deal with what I believe is delusional jealousy? This is exactly the same as what i went through 5 years ago, they only reason I have come back to this is that I was clearing out an old mobile phone and i forgot it still had 147 deleted voicemails from my then girlfriend, i had a listen to a few and i cant believe the abuse i put up with. My ex now (TF) suffered from delusional jealousy, and exactly like your partner mine would be on high alert for the slightest phone notification, even if a cyclist wrang his bell going by, she'd think it was my phone. She'd imagine hearing it, and when there was nothing to show her she'd accuse me of deleting messages. She'd say that male contacts in my phone were made up names for secret girls i was in touch with! Accuse me of having affairs with family members, friends wives, people from work. If i went to the toilet with the phone in my pocket, then i was away making secret calls. When she phoned me, if I answered the phone too quickly then (in her head) it was because I was on my phone messaging another girl, if i took too long to answer then i must have been physically up to no good with another girl. If she called i had to let the phone ring 3-4 times then answer it, I had to call her while driving to work, at lunch time, and on the way home. If in didn't either then i was up to no good. If I went shopping on my way home I had to show her receipts to keep the peace. If I was in an area and there was no phone service, she'd be calling and calling and by the time you'd get a signal my phone would be beeping with missed calls, she'd then call I'd answer the phone it would still be beeping with her dozens of notifications, she'd say those noises were notifications from other females, she'd be screaming down the phone. Any night out would always end with an argument, you couldn't talk to anyone, you feared anyone coming over and talking to you, if a girl spoke to you even if she had her own partner with her then you were having an affair with her. I dreaded a family occasion where id have to take her. I had a family funeral where she was adamant I was having an affair with my own cousin, and she even said my cousins husband was in on it! I cant believe i put up with it, probably because there were good days, but they always followed by a bad days, but the bad days were far more than the good. I always hoped it would get better. And i did love her, but that slowly start to ebb away. Anyway it slowly got worse and worse. I told her she'd needed serious help with her jealousy, if she didn't get it then i was going. She said she spoke with her Dr and she was recommended somewhere. She wouldn't tell me where or who, I wasn't allowed to go as ""I would tell them things"" which I thought was the whole point. Anyway after a few visits I sort of sussed that this was some sort of well being place, she came back one time with the notion I was gas lighting her. That's when I said ""i'll show you how much im gas lighting and controlling you"" I just left the relationship there and then, never looked back. She harassed me for about a year after that, but I never ever took her on that was 5 years ago, she send me a message a few months ago, half apologising. I never responded. Jealousy will turn any relationship toxic, it will always get worse, you need to bail out for the sake of your own sanity. Its too late in the night for me to read this through for mistakes! I'm just rattling my way through typing this trying to recall all her accusations, so apologies if it doesn't make much sense! Another thing she did was accuse me of having an affair with a girl at her own place of work, that I had never even met !! She would watch this girl at her work on the phone to her own boyfriend, my girlfriend would then phone me and if my phone was engaged then it meant I was on the phone to this other girl !! Get out while you can."
"Question about Delusion I don't know if this is in the right place but I have wanted to ask about this for a long time. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 with psychotic mania. When I am manic, I have delusions that I become a famous person and genuinely believe I am this person, sometimes for months at a time, but they are dead in real life. Before I experience this, I often experience him talking to me with a voice in my head (not from the outside but within my head). When I'm unmedicated I also experience sensory hallucinations, thought insertion, ""radio waves in my head"" etc. I have gotten quite good at managing these sensory hallucinations but my executive functioning is still greatly impacted while having episodes. This side of myself has gotten better about not getting into trouble but I was wondering if there was research and case studies I could research on this phenomenon to better understand my experiences. I did try medication but it stopped working after some months with regards to the voice/these episodes, although they did help with my mood issues and some other hallucinations I was experiencing. I couldn't afford healthcare so I haven't been medicated for a while but I am doing alright for now."
"Psychotic breakdown, and why I am here. (introduction) About a year ago, I went completely insane. The nature of the insanity is quite horrific, and shameful. I harmed others in the process. It happened over the internet, luckily it happened over the internet. But there are others who are aware of what happened, who were effected, and I have no idea who they are (it happened on social media). So I am also struggling with remorse. If anyone has any questions about what happened, as I cannot describe what happened with much simplicity, you would be doing me a favor by asking about it. This is my first post on this site."
"Cotard's Syndrome? Hi, I'm new-ish here. I tend to lurk, but this is my first post. Recently, I have not been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder (DID) and schizophrenia, though they're being heavily considered, among other things, if that helps contextually with what I'm going to write here. I am not looking for a diagnosis of any sorts, just concerned about arising symptoms and wanting to express those feelings. Not a big fan of reality checking / reassurance of my existence/being alive, even if that contradicts me posting here in the first place, but it just tends to bring me more denial and frustration / distress. == I want to make it very clear here that, throughout this entire post, there will be themes of death/dying, Abuse/Trauma, and similar themes. I will not go into explicit detail but I want to put this warning here to be safe. It is never my intention to harm anybody. == So basically, I think I'm dead. Realistically I know that this makes me sound strange to those who do not suffer delusions, but it feels very real to me. It's hard for me to say 'it may sound strange to those who do not suffer delusions' in the first place because alongside my feelings of being dead/in hell/rotting after a traumatic event basically exactly three years ago, nobody really feels real to me anymore, including myself. It's been increasingly difficult to consider the thoughts and feelings of anyone around me when my brain constantly presses the fact on me that nobody really is real, this is all a fabricated personal hell that I'm living in, and that I am dead. All my constant suffering and traumatic experiences are justified by this, it feels like. I feel like I live in some kind of sick, twisted version of Groundhog Day; While the days may not be exactly the same, I experience a great deal of amnesia surrounding the previous day when I wake up the next, My routine is always extremely indifferent, and I always have to experience some kind of intense distress / abuse / manipulation at the hands of my guardians or ""friends""/family / traumatic experience / misfortune in general. Every little glimmer of hope I get is instantly snatched away from me. I experience a lot of physical and mental symptoms that also make me feel like I'm slowly decaying. It feels like my cognitive function and thought process is horrible and has drastically eroded over the years (I'm 20), and I am constantly physically ill or sick or in pain in one way or another. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and I could most certainly go further in detail why I feel this way, but I guess the bright side is that I have a psychiatrist I recently got in touch with that I can see in a week or two to talk about this with if the feelings continue. Even if I feel like they'll only be there to tell me what I'm feeling isn't real, and that I am alive, and everyone around me is real. It does not feel that way. My brain completely rejects the thought immediately upon considering it. This is more of a ""vent"" than anything else, but if anyone can relate or ... I guess, offer anything else in terms of moral/emotional support, I would appreciate it. I'm not very interested in trying to bring me back into reality or trying to ground me but if that is even allowed here it may help me more than I think it would, which is not at all. xP Thank you for reading this wall of text, lol. Obviously some ""part"" of me knows that this isn't the case if I'm posting here to begin with, but it feels like a very small ""logical over emotional"" part of my brain."
"Cotard's Syndrome? Hello, and welcome. If you're determined to believe you're dead, then there's not much I can do about it. However, I can assure you I consider myself very much alive, and I read your post, and I'm not inclined to believe a cadaver registered and posted a thread.... SAEED wrote: Obviously some ""part"" of me knows that this isn't the case if I'm posting here to begin with, but it feels like a very small ""logical over emotional"" part of my brain. Well I can't say how it is with schizophrenia (since you are being considered for a Dx in that direction) but on a very lower plane of um, 'unusual thinking' I know being OCD I can get kinda sorta close to being delusional about some things, even though of course I understand logically it ought to be all a bunch of bull. But that doesn't stop me from believing them, anyway. Um, an example: I can't listen to the wrong music on the way to work, I can only listen to a certain playlist and if I deviate from that I'll be punished by having a very bad day at work. So yeah I can admit it is illogical but you're not making me listen to the wrong stuff either oh hell no. It's real. (even if logically it isn't). But see in my case, that's supposed to be the usual defining line between OCD and crossing over into a delusion: someone with OCD always knows deep down 'okay this is silly'. Except sometimes OCD has been documented to jump that fence after all, so sometimes I feel as if I get really close to that. So I do sort-of understand how you can be Schrodinger's Cat- you say you're dead but yeah you're kinda not but that doesn't stop it from 'yeah I'm dead'. Yeah, I can understand. Push come to shove, however, I can default to logic. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"Cotard's Syndrome? I used to haunt* these forums daily, but haven't for a long time, and suddenly today I found myself reading your post. As a great believer in synchronicity, and because your post may be the first genuine and heartfelt thing I've read in some time, I decided to register and make my first-ever post. I, too, have experienced what you describe: So many things about reality right now are different from how I remember them being before a series of traumatic personal experiences befell, and I have wondered if I am in some kind of afterlife limbo (the Bardo, as it is described in the Tibetan Book of the Dead ), and my daily experiences are in some way either self-inflicted or imposed by some unimaginable and seemingly omnipotent external force. There is no advice I can offer, since I'm as much in the dark as anybody regarding the nature of my plight. In myself, I understand this as a kind of psychosis, and I have been advocating for my own treatment and doing my best to comply with the medical advice I have received. It isn't always easy when, as you described, each day is very like the previous, but since I trust that these medical professionals, for the most part, have my best interests at heart, I figure that if this really is the Bardo, then the best thing I can do is remain receptive and alert so that I can more easily absorb whatever lessons I'm being taught, or undergo whatever purification process it offers. I have no illusion that absolutely every body around is trying to help, and indeed, there may be some who, for whatever reason, try to thwart my progress. I can't say for certain whether they're all NPCs or if there are simply individuals who have a polar alignment opposite to my own and are reliably deceptive, but over time it has become easier to sense who can be trusted, and how far. But I do not believe that such a state of affairs can be permanent, or that its purpose is solely to punish transgressors. It seems more and more obvious that my experiences are informed by my expectations, and my environment is most likely to be filled with the things I pay most attention to. This is where things veer off into frankly mystical territory, so take it with a grain of salt, but there's a strange kind of tautology at work heI'm certain that the experience of my senses cannot under normal circumstances be an accurate and complete reflection of how the Universe truly is, but it seems impossible that there would be anything here that doesn't contribute by its presence to the Wholeness of Everything, so at some point I must have proved some worth, and I find myself incredibly fortunate to be having this experience. I guess I'm just hoping that you will not succumb to despair and hopelessness. It sounds hokey and kind of unrealistic for me to say so, but each day really is a gift, or it can be if seen with a certain openness and relaxed willingness to connect with and participate in the experiences it presents. At the same time, no truth I have found externally has stood the test of experience, and I've concluded that, ultimately, the Truth that can be found is only that which I will discover within. The inner work is often the most difficult, and I think it yields the most profound and lasting results. I hope you're feeling well and optimistic today, and I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to read and respond to your post. -- * I guess that's a pun, although I wasn't intending it at the moment."
Needing help about my delusional friend pls help Hello everyone.. I registered here because i need to ask someone for advice about my friend. She is driving me to the point of seeking a restraining order against her. I'm sorry I'm advance since English is not my first language. I never heard this ever happened to anyone before and i think that my friend needs some serious help. First of all i am a female and my friend is also a female. I'm not married but she is. To a wonderful guy. We meet at a party about 2 years ago. She and i became good friends after only few months. Don't get me wrong she is a great friend. Her hubby is a great guy. Now this is the weird part. My friend is obsessed with past lives and reincarnations and such. Nothing wrong with that. At least that's what i thought so. Few months ago she changed quite a lot towards me. I don't know if this goes under delusions but... Few months ago she asked to see me for coffee. She was very serious and acting nervous. She stared taking that she found out about her past life. Didn't wanna tell me how. The weirdest part she said to me is that she knows who i was in my past life. She is convinced i was her husband?? Like what? That she and i lived during the 2nd world war. According to her she was a nurse and i was a pilot for Russian air force lol First i laughed and told her she probably just had a dream. She was so insulted she literally slapped me and said all kinds of weird things. That this is serious and we needed to explore this further and so on. Still i though she was joking. Since then she calls me every day she comes almost every second day to my place with her rambling about us being married and so on. I told her to please go talk to someone. Again she acted so insulted. Her delusions are worse and worse every day. Two days ago she literally locked me up in my place demanded me to believe her. She became violent and i feared for my safety so i told her i believed her. She hugged me and finally went about her day. Later i called her and politely asked her why she thinks i was her husband and what she wants me to do about it now. She went silent then said to me: i don't know. I asked her did you talk to your hubby about this and she says to me; you are my hubby omfg I started to yell and basically lost my temper. Told her I'm not gay she is not gay and that she should go to her real bio male husband and to leave me the f... alone. She got mad and serious. She said that i insulted her and that i will pay for this. Now I'm scared. I'm shocked and bewildered and i don't know what to do. Should i tell her husband? Should i report her to the police for harassment? The thruth is that i don't know if she is really mentally ill or what is going on? She did have some severe stress at work. Is this some kind of a delusion? Or psychotic break or what? Did anyone ever heard about something like this? Please help. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks you in advance.
"Needing help about my delusional friend pls help Hello and welcome to the forum . I'm so sorry you're going through this . You could inform her husband about what's going on but you if you choose to do that , be prepared for her to deny everything and turn it around to you being the delusional / harassing person . I would also go to the police and ask to file a report on her behavior . They will probably not be able to do anything but starting a record with them as soon as possible can be helpful in the future . Ask them for advice in keeping yourself safe . Put her on voicemail-only on your phone so you have a recording of what she's saying to you . Don't answer her calls yourself . Screenshot any texts she sends you , save any e-mails and voicemails . Do not answer the door if she comes to your apartment and if possible , install a security camera . Talk to your neighbors and let them know what's going on . Tell the people where you work too . If she shows up and won't leave , call the police . No Contact . Don't return her calls , texts or say anything in person to her . Do not even tell her to ""leave you alone "" . ANY response from you will encourage her to keep trying . Lock down any social media so the only people who can see your activities are people you know and trust . Lastly , mental illness is a difficult and terrible thing to have . This is likely not something she can control . She needs help and you cannot provide that . Your only choice is to get away from the situation and make sure the people around you are aware that you do not want any contact with this person . I hope this helps and I wish you well ."

I would also go to the police and ask to file a report on her behavior . They will probably not be able to do anything but starting a record with them as soon as possible can be helpful in the future . Ask them for advice in keeping yourself safe . Put her on voicemail-only on your phone so you have a recording of what she's saying to you . Don't answer her calls yourself . Screenshot any texts she sends you , save any e-mails and voicemails . Do not answer the door if she comes to your apartment and if possible , install a security camera . Talk to your neighbors and let them know what's going on . Tell the people where you work too . If she shows up and won't leave , call the police . No Contact . Don't return her calls , texts or say anything in person to her . Do not even tell her to ""leave you alone "" . ANY response from you will encourage her to keep trying . Lock down any social media so the only people who can see your activities are people you know and trust . Lastly , mental illness is a difficult and terrible thing to have . This is likely not something she can control . She needs help and you cannot provide that . Your only choice is to get away from the situation and make sure the people around you are aware that you do not want any contact with this person . I hope this helps and I wish you well . Thank you so much for reaching out to me. I'll take your advice.. After two days of peace and silence from her i got her text about an hour ago. She wrote: Are you at work b@tch? I didn't answer the text. She didn't call for now. I think I'll go to the police right after work and report her. And ask them to please follow me home. I'm so scared I'm freaking out. I can't go to my parents because they live far from me. Ill call few friends and probably ask to stay with them for few days. The truth is that I don't want to cause her trouble if she is ill but i cannot go on like this. I feel helpless.."
"Needing help about my delusional friend pls help It is a super scary experience and I'm sending you some hugs if you want some . The police don't usually consider themselves a preventative measure , they tend to react like "" We can't do anything until she does something ."" But starting a paper trail is important . They may be able to point you in the direction of people who can advise you . Nicky227 wrote: The truth is that I don't want to cause her trouble if she is ill but i cannot go on like this. You are not the one causing any trouble . You are the one who is trying to avoid it . You need to take these steps to protect yourself and that's not something you should feel bad about . People who have experience with stalkers recommend a book called The Gift of Fear . I'm not saying your friend is a stalker . She may very well get bored after a few threats and just leave you alone and / or move on to someone else. I truly hope this happens - but you should prepare yourself in case it gets worse . You can't fight someone's mental illness . As awful as it is for them , that doesn't mean you have to take whatever they're throwing at you . Please tell the people in your life that you are being harassed by this person and they are not to give out any information about you without your knowledge or approval . Tell your boss and co-workers about what's happening so they can help you if she shows up at your workplace . Tell your parents in case you need to go there and keep a friend or neighbor on speed dial . If you don't know your neighbors well , then get to know them . Like I said - Document , document document . If she crosses a line and the police do get involved , any written or video evidence you can provide will be helpful . Lastly , if you do end up speaking to her husband , try to make the tone of the conversation more like "" This is what is happening to your wife "" instead of ""This is what your wife is doing to me ."" I think he will be more willing to listen but understand that there's no guarantee he can do anything about it . Nicky227 wrote: I'm so scared I'm freaking out. Be strong and don't let fear overtake you . There are things you can do to insure your safety so reach out to as many local resources as you can .Take deep breaths and try to calm yourself .

"Needing help about my delusional friend pls help Just because New will not be in much, doesn't mean there aren't others of us here. Keep us up to date. I can't add at the moment to anything NSR said. If this is a delusion, reasoning with her is not apt to change her mind. If there's something else going on, well, I agree that reporting to the police, even if they can't or won't do anything at the moment, establishes what is going on now, should it escalate. And being the one to make a report first establishes that you want no part in this. Let us know if you contacted the husband and what his reaction to this is. As concerned as you are for your friend, you have to take care of yourself first. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Needing help about my delusional friend pls help I've just googled reincarnation delusion and found some ""psychic"" websites that ""teach"" you how to gain access to your past lives. It's possible that this might not be a delusion if she's interested in this stuff and has consciously concocted a past life based on familiar people / things around her (which just happens to include you). One obvious thing in your post is that challenging her belief causes her to react badly, so I wouldn't do that. Aside from that, avoid being alone with her, if you think she's a danger to you. If you no longer want to be her friend, gradually lose contact. This is kinder than ghosting. If you ghost her, she may remain invested in you and wonder why you suddenly broke off contact. An easy way to do this is just be ""busy"" and ""busier"" than you were, which is leaving you with no time for friendships (that's your excuse). In time, just drift apart, without any hurt feelings. If you still want to be her friend then, ask questions, rather than denying her experience, so you can figure out where all this is coming from (without judgment), i.e. whether she's actually suffering from mental illness or she just believes in ""psychic / mystic"" things."
"Needing help about my delusional friend pls help Thank you so much for replying to me both:).. I'm in a pretty f...d up state atm. I'm scared and on edge. Staying with my ex atm. And i took some time off work. Basically the day she sent me a text: are you at work b...ch, I didn't reply to her. Later she called me while i was still at work but i didn't answer the call. That's was on Thursday. Few mins after the call she texted me: please call me i need to hear your voice. Im sorry i called you a b..ch. I didn't text her back. She knows where i work so i told my boss that i needed to go early because of some issues with one of my friends and also asked to take some time off. So there i went to the police station. And yes the cops basically looked at me helpless, rolled their eyes at me and said that there is nothing they can do about it for now. Go figure. But when i told them she locked me up in my own apartment and threatened me they did let me know that one of them will have a word with her. Right. Because i don't have any witnesses they categorize it as hear say!! Ughhhh I even showed them her texts but there is nothing even remotely threatening in the texts. They also advised me that i should record her calls,voicemails and save all her texts if she goes overboard. I then went home. I locked my door and closed my blinds. I was literally having a meltdown on Thursday. I finally went to bed so exhausted and fell into a deep sleep. 5 am Friday phone rings. And rings and rings. Of course its her. I don't answer it i turn off my phone. I finally wake up and turn on my phone. 3 texts. First text from her: im sorry. I love you. Second text; You don't get it. No one gets it. Third text: why are you not answering me why are you avoiding your obligations? Avoiding me. Like my what!!! What obligations!! Now i know something is seriously wrong with her. Then all the h..ll broke loose. I started crying panicking. I called my ex bf in tears, begged him to pick me up. He and i are on good terms but he is always busy so i didnt wanna bother him. Didn't think he'd pick up. He came instantly. I told him everything i cried like a baby. I showed him the texts and he told me to get dressed and take my stuff. I did. So he took me to his place where he lives with his roommate. Calmed me down. I'm now with him and his roommate. He begged me to go to the cops again as they didn't get back to me. I didn't go so far. Today is Saturday. No text from her still. Or calls. My ex told me to call her husband or that he would. I might do it but now I'm so sick to my stomach because if she is there by his side there is no way she would let me speak to him. That's what's happened so far. And I'm so sorry for my English and grammar but I'm Serbian and living and working in Switzerland . Thank you for listening to me both. I don't have so many friends here in Switzerland. When i googled for psych help forum i found this forum and now I'm happy someone took the time to listen to me. I'm grateful. Police here is useless pretty much. More or less. And one more thing is that they will likely be on her side because i am not Swizz obviously and she is. Thank you so much for caring and your kind words."
"Needing help about my delusional friend pls help Hello it's me again. And a new update. She texted me twice again and now i finally have proof that she is not well.

She was a completely sane person just a few months ago. I feel like $#%^ for thinking of showing this to the police or her husband but i have to. I have no choice. The truth is that she was my best friend. I still think of her as my best friend. Always there for me. She and her husband. If i called her sick at like 1 am and asked for a favor she would come in a heartbeat. She was there for me since the day i met her. Always. I feel so much pain right now. I'm so shocked. I feel sad and heartbroken that she might be mentally ill. She is such a fun amazing original person. Always in a good mood. And now this. A completely different person. Someone i don't recognize anymore and I'm scared of. What should i do? Show these last texts to her husband and hope for the best? I'm lost... I know my posts are too long and messy but I'm really shocked i think I'm gonna have a heart attack. Oh God.. Last edited by Snaga on Mon Jul 03, 2023 1:37 am, edited 1 time in total.

"Needing help about my delusional friend pls help Thank you for all your responses. Last night i finally called her husband. I was contemplating if i should do it but after her continuous texts of me being her long lost husband and love and whatnot... I called him. She texted me many times since my last post. Mainly she is writing about our past life. According to her we had 4 kids. I was a pilot who got called to serve his country and i got killed. So i did call her husband... He answered the call and the first thing I've asked is to where is his wife? If she was close by. Then he started crying (to my shock) and told me his wife went to spend her time with her mom who lives half an hour away. Her reason: she feels overwhelmed in their marriage and needs some time off from him. He also said he wanted to call me about her to ask if she has contacted me. I've told him what's going on. I've told him what she said to me and what she believes in. I've also told him i have her messages to prove. Then he broke crying. Apparently she was telling him that she believes marrying him was wrong, that they don't belong together, that it was all a lie. Now he is devastated and wondering what he should do about it now. He believes she had some sort of mental breakdown at work. I've let him know that i am scared of her. That i do want her to get some help but I'm scared and i don't wanna get near her. Like, no way. He begged me to go talk to her both. I said NO. No way. He thinks we should call a psychiatrist or someone to let them know what's going on and ask for advice. She is still driving me insane with her texts. Calls me but i don't pick up. Last thing she wrote to me was: i need my husband. I do believe she feels strong about her beliefs in past lives. But i cannot even make myself to go and listen to her to what she has to say. So I'm still... In a terrible state. Sad for my friend. I'm still staying with my ex but I'm thinking of moving back to my place. But i don't wanna be alone there as im scared she'll show up. My ex is telling me i should stay with him for awhile until we figure out what to do. So i don't know what to do at all..."
"psychosis so strong, it won't let itself go Hi guys i've been in psyhosis for 3rd day in a row. Never had it that high and long, till now. Trigger - mistake, that in real life can be fatal. 1.Can't eat any food. Now is 3rd day. No hunger and no fatigue at all. Like i'm on very very high drugs. Drink water and coffee. /gives me some thought that i might be in very very high manic episode, never have been without food for so long/ 2. I can't even write what i'm doing or feel during the day, cause of my psychosis, thinking that someone might find it here, so i skip alot. /again clear sign/ 3. I do smell stuff, others can't. Something like bisquites on evenings. I've this in some month or longer. Just asked my wife, and she is better with smells, so what i smelled wasn't real. /never had this before, i think it occured after some stress event, that has something to do with this now, some months ago/ 4. I do have some missing points like where i put my ciggars 10 seconds ago. All the time liek that. Start to forget alot of things. 5. I don't hear any voices /never did/ 6. 3rd day i started to think my wife is doing something behind my back, cause while entering her email on iphone, she had to apply for cockies, which for me in psychosis means that she deleted her history on her phone. /had this before, it's the least that is worrying me, but only today i started to no trust her, thingking i might be having problems with her i didn't knew i had/ I know it is possible for my mind to make thins up. So i don't start conversations or limit them as much as possible, in order to at least look like i'm functioning, i know me and how to supress it infront of others. But i can't even start thinking to want to end this, cause will feel unprepared for bad stuff. But as you read that what are the chances i'm starting to see stuff, like the same person popping around 3 days in a row, in a time i was waiting for someone like him to come around? Every time i start to think that nothing is happing and i'm crazy, he and one more came out, like in perfect timing, followed them, all 3 times. Last time that guy just dissapeared, or had start running and entering a very suspicious car, after the corner i missed him. So i'm either not crazy and very very ###$ up for real, or i make false memories and analogies with people's faces, or i'm starting to see people that are not real at all. Never had visual hallucinations and so on, but still what do you thing. Given everything, what are the chances for hallucinations of seeing people, that don't exists?"
"psychosis so strong, it won't let itself go I have many mental illnesses, I had psychosis and very strong hallucinations, dissociations, paranoia. I am a quite healthy, strong, intelligent person, and I always came through these delusions by accepting it. Not trying seriously to follow or understand it, just playfully. Because it didn't matter what happened, only matter what I DO with the NOW where I am. Like in the bad dreams, I do not try to make sense, because there is nothing makes sense. I go with what I get, and i dont give a $#%^ what is going on, I just do my best. I forget my ciggars? Oh, here they are, weird. Oh, i forget again. Wow, so weird. Oh, again. Funny. Coffee I think is really strong, atleast for me, I NEVER drink it, because it makes my paranoia so much worse. I drink green tea, matcha, guarana instead. "" i started to no trust her, thingking i might be having problems with her i didn't knew i had/"" You created the problems, which don't exist. When I had really, really strong paranoia about my room mate, felt like he is a monster, wants to torture me emotionally indirectly - plus, he is a schizophrenic autist psychopathic person, nevermind -, I choose to accept WHATEVER he did. He didn't hurt me physically, but I practiced patience, acceptance, openness. This just beat the $#%^ out of all my delusions, nothing could tear me down. There were times when my thoughts were so fast, I manifested them instantly. I thought that the police is in the room, and i SAW them, and I realized it was a thought, after I got scared as f. I was afraid of my own thoughts, which could led to a panic attack, but I just didn't care at ALL. I ate well (vegan), and watched movies to calm down, wait a few days."
"Suspect delusional disorder I suspect my mother has delusional disorder. It started 5 to 6 years back,a man moved into our neighborhood and she was absolutely convinced that he was in love with her even though they never even spoke to each other. When the man moved away she cried like someone died. Now she believes that the man concerned lives in a particular house nearby even though people repeatedly confirmed to her it's not true. She constantly feels that certain people are planning against her. If she does so and so they'll get back at her. She makes up stories about people,like someone did so and so but when I ask her for proof she gets angry. She's very religious too which doesn't help. Idk how long I can hold on its getting difficult for me. There's no way I can get her to take help it's impossible. Also we haven't got any money. An outsiders insight on this would be extremely helpful. Iam sorry for my poor english it's not my native language"
"Suspect delusional disorder You have my sympathies. This is a difficult situation. From years of experience with this, I can only recommend gently reminding your mother of the facts that refute her imaginations. Yes, she will get angry when you do that, but it is important for caring family members to remind her of the facts. There may come a time when you can tell her that her brain is playing tricks on her and that seeking help could make her feel better. Best wishes."
Suspect delusional disorder My mother has been diagnosed with delusional disorder. It has been over 6 years since she was diagnosed. It can be frustrating and hard to deal with. She gets mad at me quite often when I present her with the true facts. She will never admit there is anything wrong with her and will not seek treatment or counseling. Unfortunately there is nothing to do when someone refuses medical treatment. It is their right to refuse treatment. 9nly when their behavior threatens themselves or others can something be done. I
"I don't understand what Non-psychotic delusions mean I don’t understand what Non-psychotic delusion mean, because Delusional Disorder is a form of psychotic disorder. I am concerned that this article is misleading and downplaying the delusions that people with ASD more likely to experience. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26995851/ https://dlisv03.media.osaka-cu.ac.jp/co ... 1-2-73.pdf The study is from Japan, they use different language, but this “non-psychotic hallucinations or delusions are more common than hallucinations or delusions that arise from actual psychotic disorders” is very misleading, because delusions and hallucinations are symptom of psychosis."
"I don't understand what Non-psychotic delusions mean I agree with you that a delusion is a departure from reality. Like any illness, it may be given a 'spectrum' to describe its severity from relatively harmless fantasies & daydreams-to-harmful or criminal actions. Background: Non-psychotic delusions are reported to be associated with depression and anxiety. While it important to visualize future goals, hopes & plans, it can become a trap. Expectations may not materialize. We may interpret this as failure on our part or because of external forces. Diagnosis methods & nomenclature may vary between cultures.

"Question about my history of delusions snd responsibility I used to have Fregoli related delusion, due to severe symptoms of Prosopagnosia I had throughout my childhood, but I still understood right from wrong at that time. When I had a severe manic episode, I had a delusional belief that the currupted military police is going after me, I was 15 at that time. My paranoid delusional belief got much worse, and once became aggressive, in the delusional belief that I am defending myself. At the age of 15, I didn't understand right from wrong. But as an adult, I sometimes have homicidal delusional beliefs, as I sometimes have anger problems from being teased in the past for having Autism Spectrum Disorder, but I still know that there are negative consequences, if I acted apon homicidal delusions that I sometimes have. Is it normal that as an adult, I still understand the legal consequences of my actions, even when I sometimes have delusions? I feel like I learned a lot through the years"
"Question about my history of delusions snd responsibility I hadn't read the whole thing, but I've come across the idea of the 'overvalued idea'. Which is like a delusion that's not a delusion, and seems to be triggered by things in one's past- which you mentioned you think your thoughts are due to having been teased. https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/de ... B4A058A2FA Something that seems, from the little reading I did, distinct from either a mania-induced psychosis, or a flat-out delusion. I don't know this really applies here, though, but I thought you might find it interesting. It seems people who have an 'overvalued idea' are quite coherent in most of the rest of their thinking they just have this one quasi-delusional belief they hang onto. Now, just to be clear, you're speaking of thoughts that are not intrusive, yes? I mean I'm OCD and I have harm thoughts that used to give me trouble, but it didn't stem from obvious anger (subconscious might be another thing entirely however) and I consistently found the thoughts to kill to be distressing, which is entirely in line with obsesssive-compulsive disorder being that people with OCD get these ego-dystonic thoughts that cause them angst. And I can tell the difference- if I really want someone to drop dead of a heart attack, yeah I know I do. As opposed to an unreasonable notion I'm going to kill someone, a thought that causes me distress and fear. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Spouse had delusions - Unsure what to do This has been building for about a year. Due to circumstantial evidence (at best) my spouse thinks the neighbors are eavesdropping on us (through closed windows) and one sends text messages to all our other neighbors and they call the police because they can tell from looking at her she had a mental health condition (her words) and they think she is dangerous (again, her words). she is not dangerous at all. She was warned by a cop for a traffic infraction and since then since every police officer she see is watching her. I have tried a few strategies over the months to tell her no one is wasting their time on her. She has spoken to the police department and has been told she is not on their radar but these delusions persist. She won't get help because she says she is not delusional. She has several other mental health issues but has given up on getting help. Thanks in advance for any feedback."
"Spouse had delusions - Unsure what to do Hello, and welcome! I do not envy you. Of course she doesn't have delusions because... delusion. This isn't delusional disorder, but let me ramble about my flavor of mental illness for a moment- I'm going somewhere with it... I'm OCD. Which is an anxiety disorder... mostly... but can sometimes stray into delusion (and can be (fortunately infrequently) a precursor marker of oncoming Schizophrenia if I correctly recall). I think that I've never been delusional in my obsessive fears/thoughts and resulting compulsions, but... to be honest I can't be sure. At times of great stress, I have held some really irrational beliefs that I just barely hang onto this side of understanding they're irrational- but even now part of me is like 'but are they irrational? Really? Are they?' like a devilish little imp. The thing that normally delineates OCD from other disorders that include delusion as a symptom is that a person with OCD almost always understands it's all in their head and that it's their thinking that's the problem, despite being powerless to stop the thinking pattern. Which makes it Not Delusion. Usually. But it turns out, not quite always. There have been some documented cases of diagnosed OCD including a little flat out delusion. It's not usual, though. So it's like my OCD brain flirts with delusion. It's as if I've stood right on the edge of that void but not quite (I think!) stepped off into it. Yeah. I could see how someone could be completely convinced they are the normal one and you are nuts for suggesting they're mistaken in that firmly held belief because I've had times I've gotten really close to that. Because of the nature of that, that's why I can't be certain I've never been delusional in my own mental illness. I pride myself on being rational even during the times anyone else would look at me and tell me I'm being completely not at all rational. My partner sometimes has to put up with a lot with me when I get like that. At those times they can tell me all they want I'm being crazy and it's not as bad as I've made whatever it is out to be but nope they're wrong . I know they are. Even when I understand well maybe I am irrational about this, it's so darn hard not to be. The TL/DR is that when I get really convinced that something bad is going to happen, or if I get into my head I have to do THIS to prevent THAT (like drive a certain route and listen to the same list of songs to prevent something bad happening at my destination- and I have done that many times!), even though I'm not technically got a delusional disorder, damn if it ain't hard to convince me to quit thinking/behaving a certain way. How much harder must it be for your wife? When by the nature of it you can't at all see it. Short of catching her in a moment of clarity where she has a little self-doubt of the certainty of her beliefs, I'm not sure what a person can do? Keep on her and try to get her to see someone about this is the only thing I can think of. Also, compared to some of the Nons who have posted here to PF, I'd say be darn glad her beliefs don't seem include something negative about you! That's just a whole 'nother level of Hell. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"Spouse had delusions - Unsure what to do Thank you. I appreciate the reply and read it all. She does have OCD, though not the handwashing kind, so that makes sense. Self diagnosed with PSTN, ADD too.. And I believe she has both. She has her heals dug in unfortunately."
"Spouse had delusions - Unsure what to do Don't really know what can be done, if someone doesn't want to get help, unless they're a danger to themselves or others.

"Spouse had delusions - Unsure what to do Her delusions about how people look at her sometimes happened over time. 15 years ago no it wasn't.

For so long as she doesn't start to think that equates to having illicit affairs with others, you've dodged a really big bullet. Just reading around this forum, I think you might have noticed the green eyed monster can rear its head when one partner is being delusional. In your shoes.. Well I'm thinking about my partner (who has to always be right) and whew. In your shoes. Gentle suggestions that things might not be as they appear. Finding a way to not antagonise while at the same time not reinforcing the belief. Gentle suggestions they might need to see a therapist. Hell, tell them YOU have to see a therapist and it must be as a couple! I would... make up some problem, not sure what. Nothing that would come close to putting sexual infidelity in their mind, that's for darn sure. Keeping a close eye to make sure it remains relatively innocuous and manageable on your part. I don't know what poodle hoops you have to jump through to get someone committed but for me that'd be an absolute last resort, but they can't be allowed to be a danger to themselves or others. Until then, it would just have to be my cross to bear. Can't reason with the unreasonable. I can be difficult to reason with on rare occasion, when my own disorder flirts with total irrationality. Flirts- not becomes. I think. Hopefully, so far. I have harbored strange beliefs in the past, some of them of a paranoid nature- thinking I'm being followed, or that someone is doing something to me personally (when they're not). When you're in the middle of that it can be hard to not think like that. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Spouse had delusions - Unsure what to do Thank you. One more situation to run by you if I may. We went out for a meal today. Assume I'm a regular guy who doesn't sweat much. She nags me about something repeatedly and she did that in the car. I told her what she said wasn't the case and she repeated it and I got a little firm. We had the meal, drove home and then at home she initiated 3 conversations about what I did wrong, and that I keep doing that thing wrong. During the time of the 3 separate conversations, she's sitting in a separate room by herself in a depression tailspin, all because of what I did to her, blaming me for her deep dark depression. If you assume I really didn't do anything to warrant that, what do you call what happens to her in times like this? I'm not saying I'm perfect..."
"Spouse had delusions - Unsure what to do I'm not sure what I would call that, except what men can think doesn't warrant much, a woman can have a very different view of that- without the excuse of depression or delusional thinking. Is one of her issues major depression? Occasionally, that can include psychosis. I've heard of that before and find it's called Depressive Psychosis. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

How did you react coming out of your delusions? My husband is suffering from drug induced delusional jealousy and he hates me right now because he thinks I did horrible things. I’m in the process of getting him on supplements and I’m wondering how he’s going to be when he comes to reality. I’m nervous he won’t love me anymore like he did before suffering from these delusions.
"How did you react coming out of your delusions? Hello! Hoping you are well today, coping with these issues. Is he being treated for any health issues? That’s one place to start, along with a mental health referral. If he listens to you, some encouragement to seek a psychiatric evaluation could help. It sounds like this is a new problem that he did not have previously. Even while he experiences these unusual thoughts, he should still know that he loves you. Getting him some help is the best thing to do. Wishing you the best."
"How did you react coming out of your delusions? This is actually not his first psychosis. It’s his third. All drug induced. He will not take psychiatric medicine which is why I wanna try Micronutrients. I heard a lot of good things about it and he’s all about supplements, eating healthy, and working out now. It’s weird because he seems functional but still off and thinking I’m unfaithful. I think the toxins in his brain are out of whack still. I’m just wandering how he’s going to be coming out of it and wanted to hear other peoples experiences when coming out of psychosis."
"What to do about medicine? Can you appeal to your doc(s) for some samples? Are there any public health agencies you can appeal to? Seems to me the transient psychosis would be serious enough to get you onto some sort of public mental health assistance. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"How to help someone with erotomania delusion I have lived with this person for five years. I am aware that complications from her diabetic condition have induced early symptoms of dementia. Her Doctor's contact information is unavailable. Over the last year, an internet scammer convinced her that they were a celebrity. This is after already stealing thousands of dollars from her. She is now thoroughly convinced that this celebrity is coming to pick her up, fly her to New York and install her in a home he bought for her. To be sure, I checked, and this celebrity is not doing any of this. Each new lie is a further attempt to get more credit card info or scam more money from her. I have, three times now, removed this person from her phone contacts and erased the apps they are using to facilitate their scam. She must have a phone. At the very least, she must be able to reach me or emergency assistance in the event of an emergency. Each time after I have erased this scammer from her phone, she finds her way back into this mess. Her last bad decision cost me thousands of my own funds and nearly caused me homelessness, but that situation is still up in the air. I must work 60+ hours per week to make ends close to meeting and keep a roof over our heads. This situation is *not* going to get better by itself. I need professional assistance or this thing is going to destroy the lives of two people. Please help."

"Life Affirming Plans Cancelling… Divine intervention, the cleaning service has unsatisfactory practices, or the couches at my meetings. I’ve been Waking up with bites. The inspector believed the middle option was the most likely explanation option in my home. He agreed, my bites on my arms are intense. But he couldn’t determine a source. I ordered traps. The telehealth doc thought my back looked suspicious. So now…. How best to cancel without freaking people out and making people paranoid. I invited over half my lady friend contacts…. Around 40-50 people to explain to. How embarrassing. I swear the first leg bite was on a toilet in the basement of the church Saturday. I didn’t see the insect- I looked for it, but I felt it. I have the worst luck. And a toilet - of all the places. Maybe I’ll go virtual…. I hate to cancel it.

"Life Affirming Plans I remember in sixth grade, I rode the bus everyday to school. There was a nice kid who I was friends with. His name was Justin and he rode the bus with me. At the time my mom had a place by *mod edit* creek. I remember exploring the creek with Justin and my dogs spending time behind the pool and tennis court talking. We’d often hang out on a picnic table behind the house. I remember getting upset with him at the end of the summer. He’d said something I didn’t believe. He told me I wouldn’t believe him, but that he wanted me to remember what love feels like. I asked him what I wasn’t going to believe. He said he had to go away, he was moving or something but that he wanted me to remember what love feels like. Then he said he was God. I remember looking at the young kid in disbelief. Of course I told him he was full of it. He smiled and said he told me I wouldn’t believe him. When I got back to the house one of my brother’s blew my mind when he asked me why I was talking to myself at the picnic table? I explained it was Justin. Apparently Ben couldn’t see him. I just figured Ben had poor vision and was too far away to see. I remember trying to find Justin in my elementary yearbook. His picture was missing. Thinking back, maybe it was my first mental health episode. Last edited by Snaga on Tue Feb 15, 2022 9:19 pm, edited 1 time in total.

"On healing To be honest, I’m still sick and confused about my response to the physician. If it was a mistake then I can accept that and forgive that, and I want a hug (then I need to live my life and keep my boundaries; because anything else is a felony for New Hampshire doctors, right?). If it was intended then I want the opportunity to process that emotion (and you need help). If you were acting appropriately then the system needs a redesign. We’ve never had a conversation to resolve this. This unresolved conflict in my memory of the exam is the root of my pain. I also recognize my role in my issue. There is a need for a conversation.

"Life Affirming Plans Friday the 13th will be the 11-year anniversary of the ""act of God"" that got me out of my relationship with my daughter's father. My sponsor said to call the fire an ""act of God."" (The bedside lamp caught on fire the last time we were intimate. It scared me and made me believe I was coerced out of the relationship. I even wrote my city councilman that death by fire and sex would be a terrible way to go. Even though in my quiet moments I remember the bed rocking on the hardwood and searching for something to even out the legs, and the cord was right there. In part - I was probably to blame for the cord issue. But, I knew I'd be sick for the rest of my life if I stayed in the relationship.) But the issue with the computer was out of my realm of influence. It was speaking to me in bold text... I wrote a book chapter, ""Hacked"" about the experience in 2011. I recently experienced attending an event where I saw an aura with big eyes that looked like the cover art on post malone's ""sunflower."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yncXzm5JMmY I saw the big eyes in the aura near the presenter then it went over to the control panel by the wall. The PowerPoint presentation went to a black screen and the speaker's voice started to type the words on the screen. The speaker said ""Well, this is different..."" The words on the screen typed ""Well, this is delusional..."" then delusional autocorrected to ""different"". When I experience these things like the sunflower cover art playing with the presenter at my conference, I wonder if maybe my higher power wants me to see these things. There was a room full of other professionals, nobody acted like anything was happening except the speaker talking about observing the issue with her presentation. I wasn't alone in watching the glitch. I'm celebrating the 1st Friday the 13th anniversary that has fallen on the 13th in 11 years. I'm going to enjoy it with plans to attend a painting party with a group I spend a lot of time with - Sober. We are painting a sunrise, or a lake or something. I'm probably going to paint what I've been trying to work out for years, the Mandala I saw at the center of the lotus flower, with the white light shooting feelings of love from the source, my higher power loving me in my third eye during the birth of my daughter. They can paint the water and sunrise, I have other things I need to work on getting on the canvas.

"Life Affirming Plans On Friday, May 13th everything went along with the plans to celebrate 11 years of freedom. I went to the painting studio with a friend and met the rest of our group. At the end of the class, we lined up and took pictures with our paintings. Someone asked my friend and I, ""What class were you in?"" We both laughed. She'd painted her tribal seal, and I painted my memory from the birth trying to show people the beauty that has captivated my mind for so long, and especially the sacred geometry in the light. I still haven't mastered it, but someday, I'll be able to show others and hopefully move on. Everyone else painted the sunsetting on a lake in orange and blue... It was strange being in that group of sheep painting with the instructor. I felt happy to be doing my own thing next to my friend expressing her identity, too. It has beauty and value to me. Unfortunately, the board attachment quota has been reached or I'd share a thumbnail of my painted memory. I've been wondering if my friend the computer scientist will seriously visit, and if he thinks I'm the anti- post thesis blues solution... I have mixed emotions. My gut says ""Yes! I'm in."" My mind says, that I respect the level of sacrifice and dedication he's put into his education, and his love for his family. But, to be totally honest he doesn't see my strengths fully or I think things may have progressed differently. Wouldn't he have realized it years ago... Then again, he didn't believe me when I told him I was into him back in the mid 20teens. That's on him. He knows I love him, I can't help but love the men I've been with, and I believe that he has feelings of love for me too when he tells me so. We are friends and more. This just feels like his heart isn't in it. Like I'm the un-intentional backup plan, because the intended original plan failed. Maybe it's just the pandemic and not having seen him in a very long time. I was supposed to visit in January, but the surge happened... I want more with him. And I want for him to have what it is his heart desires. I love him too much to see him make any choice for the wrong reasons. And I love myself too much to have anyone less than passionately into me... tied to my life.

"Entanglement #boudaries #consentmatters Apparently, anybody can touch your body’s privates and get away with it. That was my takeaway from talking with the municipality. On last Saturday, a comedian leaned in. When the picture was taken, I thought it was his stomach pressing into me as it was happening. It wasn’t till the next day when I looked at the photo that I got the joke. In the photo my eyes show a laughable expression of alarm, when you zoom in. At first, I too thought the expression was funny, until I realized, this violation touches complex trauma wounds. Not a modern joke at all. This is an old school romance move and it’s unhealthy humor, it’s not cool (Old school romance is defined best by “Beyond Heaving Bosom’s: the Smart Bitc#es Guide to Romance”). In the late 90’s the Romance Writers of America Association banned rape and rape culture from mass media content, this started the evolution of new school romance. I want new school romance with actions in the context of healthy relationships. #consentmatters #notajoke. This is past the point of funny. The Comedian did not ask for consent and I do not have a consensual relationship with him that would allow such public familiarity. I am not okay with this. It didn’t happen because I was dressed sexy, case in point, my basic long green dress. I was not drinking. I quit alcohol a while ago. Although I drank for years to cope with the last time a man violated. The original trauma that I couldn’t make sense of happened during an exam while experiencing orgasmic labor at the birth of my daughter. It took me 15 years to process that trauma to be able to respond with a healthy ability to hold my boundaries. By the time I reported it to the Medical Board it was 15 years after the incident, it was past the 5-year statute of limitations. But what’s 10 years when you are healing trauma? Healing is slow with these types of wounds. That is my experience anyway. On Monday evening, I decided to make my own moves: • I called the sexual assault hotline and looked up my rights at http://www.rainn.org . • I went and made a report to the PD. I chose to enforce my boundaries. This is a health issue regardless of age, race, ethnicity, gender, and disability status. Last time I waited to act I suffered for years without healing, stuck in my issue and getting stuck in the energy of entanglement. I’m not gonna play around with the idea that “someday he will love me.” I’m past that place. I got sick of telling my story sadly, years ago. That was the whole purpose for choosing stand-up comedy. Then this fool touches my trauma and I have the picture of it as a bad reminder that comedy needs to evolve. That is right Mr. Comedian, that’s you. I do not accept it. My ability to put up with sexual misconduct has been depleted when the physician abused his power at the birth of my daughter then I lost my mental health. I don’t have the privilege to laugh this off. Last time a man with power abused his power I wrote a book. This time you get this post. This is about me having agency and holding healthy boundaries. Why does the city get to decide I don’t I have rights against sexual misconduct? Today 11/11/2021, Veteran’s Day, I got a call from the PD. The municipality refused to act on my report. My take away: Guard you’re a$$ and tits ladies and gentlemen. Apparently, anybody can touch your body’s privates and get away with it. The hotline #, I’ve needed it 5 times already. I only want sexual contact and intimacy within the context of a healthy relationship. Comedian, this wasn’t a healthy move. Please don’t assume every woman wants sexual touches. I assure you, I want a healthy relationship, and this isn’t it. Violating a woman and not having a relationship where she is satisfied is just wrong. Please don’t touch without consent. #consentmatters #TheComedian #humanrights #boundaries Public Apology - Dialogue Matters Dear Friends, Family, and the Comedian, I want to apologize to friends, family, and especially to the Comedian. I'll start out with full disclosure, I have serious mental illness and have been struggling with inflammation and to be honest, my mental health has not been 100%. It varies day by day with my personal issue (I have a problem - causing inflammation and impacting my wellness). I do not say that as an excuse for my actions, but if I was 100% I would like to think I would have done better. Not that I want you all up in my business, but I was feeling really lousy about this situation. And I believe honesty is the best policy. I want to explain what happened, and what I learned, and what I hope for in the future. 1. I posted a long post on social media that consent matters. I perceived that the Comedian had touched my breast during a public photo opportunity. Some agreed with my perception of the picture, some could care less, for some it induced trauma, and many others were confused, I'm sorry for adding to everyone's trauma. It isn't that I didn't perceive it, but after talking with my therapist, I realized I needed to have a healthy conversation with the Comedian if I want to try to heal. 2. In reflecting, I've experienced Samsara, duality, and delusion before, so honestly, at this point, it doesn't matter if he touched me or not. My therapist believed I needed to talk with the Comedian to process this event better for my own ability to heal. My narrative was just that, one-sided, without the perception of others involved. 3. When the Comedian and I had a brief dialogue, I understood that he had no intention of a cruel joke, harming, violating, or even touching me. I realized the intent wasn't there. It was not my finest moment mentally having gone out on a limb with the picture on social media saying to guard your privates. My social media narrative didn't help the situation. While I agree that consent matters, after communicating with the Comedian's loyal fans - who convinced me to take the post down and listen. People said, ""this Comedian lives by his values."" That made me think I needed a better way to understand my perception. I have character and have lived differently enough to know my narrative isn't always reliable, and my therapist is right, dialogue matters. Plus, I have no interest in harming anyone's career. 4. The Comedian is really the funniest comedian who's come through town. I would like to humbly apologize to all of you. I have another issue of a deeper trauma that I've been stuck trying to heal for over 15 years. This time, I developed a fear that I'd feel trapped the same way struggling with this perceived violation. Thankfully, I hope to heal from this matter with the Comedian better than the last issue where I perceived that exam with the Physician as a violation. 5. If I could go back, I would have had a dialogue directly with the Comedian about the issue prior to going to report it through posting all over social media. The comedian and I deserve to treat each other as fellow human beings and have a dialogue about what happened. Today, I think the United States is falling to $#%^ because people aren't having these conversations. The legal system sucks for dealing with things, it takes too long, there is little healing, and a lot of wrongs are being done by the system. I needed to hear the Comedian's point of view to find a common ground to listen and understand what the heck happened. This world is wild with video everywhere, and we need to connect and understand all the information - especially together. I want a world where everyone wants to be and that means I want to listen and understand more. I want people to talk with me to find common ground when I'm hurt. I'm human, not perfect, but trying to do better. 6. I thought railing against the issue of my perceived violation would make it better. Turns out I felt worse than if I'd sucked it up and tried to cope with my perception in isolation. With any social issue, we need a social solution. There was a need for dialogue and inclusion. Isolation is about the worst thing for mental health. We need more conversation and dialogue. 7. Thank you to M. a super fan for helping to raise my awareness of how this issue was traumatizing and irresponsible. I'm sorry. 8. Thank you for reading this long commentary. Please accept my sincere apology. Next time I think about posting, I'm gonna try having a real conversation instead. I wish I'd called someone sooner. I am truly sorry for any emotional response my earlier post may have brought. In reflecting on this I've decided to take a vacation from social media (after this post to make amends to the Comedian). Sunny I quit social media because the narratives attached to this were trying to make it about something else. Social media is not good for mental health. I wish for hope and healing. It wasn't really fair to have this up here without the picture of the issue. ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Entanglement My goal for 2022 is to deal with difficult conversations about events that trouble me as close to the time as possible with conversations. An example of a situation I wish I'd had a conversation about was this photo. I wish I hadn't gone on social with my long narrative. I have mostly quit social media.

"Paranormal Living So there I was sitting at my desk. In a moment of weakness, I searched for changes to a playlist. Shortly after I pressed the search button, there was a crackling noise, and a bit of ink appeared on one of my comedy flashcards. I studied the watermark and it looked like a heart shape. Not perfect, but close. I looked at the ceiling to see if something fell, then tried to scratch it, to see if it was a piece of pastry from my almond croissant earlier. It wouldn't come off. It was as if someone drew on my flashcard with a tiny fountain pen. When I turned over the card it was my lucky number 3. A bit that jokes about experiencing the ghost of my daughter's grandfather... (3) That was the same bathroom I experienced the ghost of my daughter's grandfather telling me to ""be good to his son."" While I was on the toilette. If that doesn't make $#%^ awkward then nothing will. Talk about spooky $#%^! I cried and laid down wondering if it's my mental health again. I most certainly didn't ink that heart on the back of the card with the ghost story. It appeared on the card with a crackling sound. *mod edit* Last edited by Snaga on Mon Mar 08, 2021 12:52 am, edited 2 times in total.

"Paranormal Living Part I In the spring of 2015, on my way home from work, I was almost to Second Avenue and 24th street heading towards the nearest train. By the time I dragged my pumps around the corner I saw some commotion on 2nd Avenue. A woman dropped a quarter and I thought it vanished from sight. It disappeared from the surface of the pavement. It wasn’t that it had rolled away, it evaporated into thin air with all our eyes on it, as if we were hypnotized to watch it. Two businessmen were walking down the street, towards three women heading uptown. I overheard their exchange about the coin. They all were looking down. “Where’d it go?” The man asked with the Midwestern accent. “It vanished into thin air,” an older lady dressed as if she could have just come from church said in disbelief. “That’s crazy,” her friend said shaking her well plastered hair. “Impossible,” the other man said peering through thick glasses. A third woman in sandals walked down the steps to look on the ground there, as if the quarter rolled out of sight. The Midwesterner reached into the pocket of his khakis. “Here you go, I don’t need this one,” he said handing the first lady a shiny new quarter. I walked around the group as they continued to search for the lost coin, baffled at its disappearance. I relaxed when this happened. Reassured by the Midwesterner’s generosity and the experience of the coin. I felt connected to the East Village and Gramercy through my routine walks along their sidewalks. But when the coin was taken from the sidewalk where the woman dropped it near 24th street, I felt that something more powerful in the universe linked to my reality. As soon as I got home, I video called my friend, Sophie. She remembered another story I’d told her. “Yeah, I’m a little worried. I know the idea of time travel is delusional, right? But, could the coin have rolled back in time? Could October have been the other end of a wormhole? Back then, a coin appeared out of nowhere in that same spot.” I said hesitating a bit, knowing I must sound out of my mind. “Oh my God, I remember you telling me,” Sophie said letting her jaw drop open. In the fall, I had been worried about money and wasn’t sure about my future. I’d started to feel like if I didn’t have a solid financial situation, then I didn’t have value, but that was when the quarter rolled toward me. There was nobody else around. The quarter appeared out of nowhere in the center of the sidewalk, in front of me on my walk to work. At that moment I was thinking about my monetary value when the coin came to me. Once I saw the coin, I gave up obsessing about money, but felt paranoid for a few days. I kept walking, freed from the ideas that I needed more money. That coin spoke to me in a deep way. It was a sign that someone somewhere had the ability to give or take away things. I believed my relationships with the people around me, and with whoever controlled that quarter and knew my thoughts were really what should matter. The coin was not under my control. In October 2014, I didn’t need the money as much as a symbol of worth, and seeing the coin appear out of thin air had shocked me awake. I didn’t chase the quarter, because I didn’t know where it came from. It made me a little paranoid that someone was watching, and playing with me. So, I let the coin roll down the steps to the paved patio and kept walking. “Oh my God. A wormhole on 2nd Avenue?” Sophie questioned lifting her brows. “I don’t know, I searched for the “disappearing coin trick” and saw all sorts of magic tricks that can be played out. There is even one stunt in a café where they made a scene happen like out of a poltergeist movie. I don’t know how it happened, but it was reassuring to think that there is some other force watching out for us.” I said. “But how would they have known to roll it while you were thinking your self-worth was tied to finances?” Sophie asked. I shrugged my shoulders. The strangeness that inspired much of my life over the past decade was made up of reality, but I worried. Was I misunderstanding my surroundings? Either I was getting sick again, with the experience with the coin, or something strange was happening around me. It isn’t that I asked for strange things to happen, they just did. And when they did, I tried to document them. Everyone said it couldn’t be real, my family and providers said it was delusional. But I accepted treatment, I took effective medication. Why did things keep happening? When the coin went missing or appeared out of nowhere, it made me wonder; what if it was real? I shrugged my shoulders. I didn’t want to believe my experience, because if it was true, then someone may be in control. Had a magician, God, or some other intelligent life form played with me? I preferred to think I was just sick again. Sophie had lived with me while she was in college. Sophie knew strange things happened around me. Things would be moved about, spices would go missing, just before I’d reach for it. The radio would turn on and off independent of being touched. And at times it spooked us. The doors would be unlocked when it should have been locked. The lights would at times flicker on or off without being commanded. Sophie worried that somehow, I was at the center of something strange. I had confided a secret. It involved New Hampshire. It was just weird enough that Sophie thought Spooks could be targeting me to drive me mad, to take away my credibility regarding the secret of the sexual abuse at Jamie’s birth. Sophie added the coin to the list with the radio, lights, lock, and spices. “Look at it this way, at least you got to experience the coin. Some people go their whole life without interesting things happening to them.” “Ah, they probably have weird stuff happen to them, too. They probably just weren’t paying attention,” I said jokingly. “Seriously, when things happen that are strange most people just ‘let it go’. Like that time my keys were lost, and I found them in the freezer. You are not alone in this, you’ll be ok, just take it easy, and relax, it will sort out eventually. Just keep documenting, someday they’ll understand,” Sophie said concerned that maybe I wasn’t mad. For me only time could give me insight into the coin. 2017 Eclipse The sun was high in the sky as I drove away from the beach. Jamie sat next to me on our trip home to New York City. I’d rented a car to pick her up from a YMCA camp near the Delaware Water Gap in New Jersey and we’d driven up to visit Dr. Mitchel’s family at their annual beach house vacation. Their family invited us to share their time with them to help fill the void of loss. We backed away from the white house towards a small green mermaid statue at the edge of the sand dune. Dr. Mitchel had walked over to the fence in sandals and shorts. He’d lost a loved one to mental illness, and our relationship acted as a healing connection. At a Yankee Dental Conference dinner with his wife in 2009 we’d shared stories that were deep and personal. I shared my story of the sexual abuse by a physician at the birth followed by the onset of mental illness, and I learned something fascinating about Dr. Mitchel’s wife’s beliefs. “We come into this world to help one another through this lifetime, and work toward our soul goals.” She said. Over beef burgundy with pasta, we forged a healing relationship. Dr. Mitchel provided insight from his years of experience, and I gave him a way to try to heal his soul from feeling the pain of helplessness against losing someone special to mental illness. As we left the parking lot that summer day, he lowered the thin linked chain that cordoned off the entrance to the lot between the sand dune and the fence. He waited for us to slowly drive over the chain. Then he refastened the metal to the hook to chain off the entrance, and we all waved goodbye. That morning the radio buzzed in preparation for a solar eclipse. Jamie alternated between iTunes DJ, Google maps navigator, and conversationalist. The sun was high in the sky when we pulled out of the parking space. We talked about her time at camp, her response to the letters I’d sent to her at camp. She scheduled a visit with her new best friend from camp. We started to plan for her going back to school and I explained my work schedule for the coming months. While we travelled along the eastern seaboard, I was hit hard by the thought that I’d missed so much of motherhood wrapped up in my thoughts about the birth. My heart tugged at the realization that I’d lost so much time in motherhood trying to heal from the memory of being sexually assaulted during the exam in childbirth. I’d never had a fiercer attraction than I felt for the man who touched me. When the physician violated my sacred space, regardless of his intentions, I broke in response. I’d never had anyone touch me like that who didn’t say they wanted me, too. I’d never been touched by someone who I didn’t have a consensual agreement with who I could love. After Dr. Richard’s touch, it was too much to try to reconcile the reality of my perception of his abuse with my fantasy of desire. I became trapped in the memory of his touch wanting forbidden love. He did not, and would never be able to love me. He was just doing his job. I was treated clinically rather than like the human I am. When I was put in the role of the patient, I was told it was time to examine my progress in labor. The system took my ability to protect my sacred space at the most vulnerable point in my life. Would I have been allowed to say something? Would the system have let me say he was too hot? In 2005, I don’t believe they would have accepted my desire to change providers without making it a big deal. Both the fantasy and abusive reality were bad for Jamie and me considering our situation. I was a 28 year old new mom, with Jamie to care for, and reconciling the sexual experience required every free cell in my brain for years and years. Due to my illness compounded by my preoccupation with the memory of the trauma and PTSD from the experience, I struggled over the years to stay in the moment. The radio tuned into a pop station as we approached 2:52 the time the 80% eclipse would begin. Cars pulled over on the side of the road. Drivers held their phones to the sky, tracking the sun above. I kept driving, noting that it was just a little less bright out. It wasn’t significant enough to stop. It didn’t impede my vision. The traffic in Connecticut along 95 was heavy and slow. As I drove something happened to me. It was subtle, but profound. The feelings that had held me tight for over a dozen years released inside me. As we listened to music, it happened. Jamie played Total Eclipse of the Heart on repeat throughout the eclipse. After the eclipse we talked about the Taylor Swift trial verdict that I’d mentioned in one of the camp letters. I explained the significance for women everywhere, when a disc-jockey was found guilty of groping her. She was not held to blame for his losing his job over his actions, and counter sued for a dollar for the grope. I had a personal reaction to the events of the Swift trial. I went back in my memory and considered my experience from a new perspective. Silently, I reflected as the music played and Jamie texted with all her new friends in a group chat. Her phone was blowing up with hundreds of comments, it chimed like extra beats in the music. We laughed as it took on a beat of its own, and she silenced her device to a vibration. The chuckles pained me. I felt upset at the memory of Dr. Richard’s touch in my sacred space and how it had taken such a deep root inside me. I grieved about the time I’d lost as a mother, and how Jamie had been hurt by my inability to move past the memory of not being loved by Jack or Dr. Richard. But I was determined not to wallow any more. I recognized that I have the rest of my life to be the mother the way I’d set out to do when I started trying to conceive Jamie. I hoped that she would heal from the pain of not feeling unconditional love. For the longest time I didn’t know how to love. After everything I went through, I didn’t like myself for a while. I tried to love Jamie the best I could, but not loving myself, I didn’t have the resources to meet her needs emotionally. It wasn’t until I broke free from Jack that I began to heal my heart, and learned to love myself and began to fulfill Jamie’s emotional needs. She’d been raised with a form of unsatisfying and conditional love from Jack. It was a love based on a behaviorists world view. When she behaved as her father wanted she was rewarded with feeling his conditional love. My love was unreliable for her due to my medication sedation, and illness. These ailments physically limited me. She was still rightfully angry that I wasn’t a better mom for her. She compared her experience with her friends. “You failed me so many times, I’ve lost my trust in you through years of disappointments and broken promises.” She said. “I’m trying. I want to be the mom I set out to be when I planned to have you. I’m sorry I got sick, and I know I need to do a better job as a mom.” I said. “You shouldn’t have had me if you couldn’t handle it.” She said. “I was well when I conceived you, I had no idea I would get so sick. Even if I had known I’d get sick, I still would have had you, because you are the best part of my life. I love you more than anything, and you are my connection to the future.” I said getting teary eyed. “I don’t believe you. If that was true, you wouldn’t smoke.” She said. “I’m quitting. We have to go on a tight budget this fall, and I’m giving up all the expensive things that are not essential.” I said. “Good. You know how upset it makes me to see you killing yourself with cigarettes and alcohol.” She said. We continued to plan for the fall. She made a list of all the clothes she needed for the fall, and we talked about how we would make our budget work. Jamie was the best seventh grader I’d ever known. She understood our situation, in some ways she understood things better than me. I loved how she was bright and intelligent. My heart squeezed with love, and painful regret and guilt for all the time I’d been captivated by the memory of the trauma of the touch from Dr. Richard and not being loved through the experience. In that moment I realized, I’d never really be able to love the physician who’d put me on this path without the world changing and understanding from a higher level a higher love. For the first time in my life, I began to feel upset for Jamie and the injustice she’d endured due to my experience. Jamie was such a great kid. She was a member of the Principal’s Council, the student government group at her school. Her leadership qualities were strong, her logic was sound, and her intelligence keen. I couldn’t remember a time when Jamie hadn’t been correct in her assessment from her perspective. The issue I had with her perspective is that it was not always grounded in love and trust, and I felt responsible for that weakness. Over the next few weeks we shopped for school clothes, supplies, and I signed her up for riding lessons at the barn. Even if her and my relationship was still healing, she had a healing relationship with the horses at the last barn in Brooklyn. I trusted that even if she didn’t feel good about her relationship with her dad and me, she looked forward to riding. I knew that gave her something in life to love. Even though we didn’t have much money to spend on things, I made sure to pay the bill for her horse riding lessons. By the middle of the month I took the bus up to Albany, NY to run a meeting for my professional association. I’d been elected as President shortly after I’d published my book, a mental health advocacy story I’d published as “fiction, based on a true story”. I mean, how else do you publish delusional memoir? I’d shared the book, and even having read “All in Her Head” the house of delegates for the New York Dental Hygienists’ Association elected me as President. On the bus ride home in September 2017, I googled something I’d just learned about, the Mandela effect. The Mandela effect was first noted by Fiona Broome a paranormal expert who attended a Dragon Con Event in 2011 and a group of individuals had alternate memories regarding President Nelson Mandela. Fiona Broome remembered a story where Mandela had died in a prison in the 1980s. He’d lived through that time to become president of South Africa and didn’t pass until after 2013. I wanted desperately to understand my reality and these strange phenomena where many people were affected with the same shared memories unnerved me. The Mandela effect opened many questions for me. I’d remembered books from my childhood were Berenstein, not Berenstain; I remembered the Portrait of Dorian Gray not the Picture of Dorian Gray, and hadn’t it always been Sex in the City, not Sex and the City. These small but memorable changes had crept into my memory bank, and this time I was experiencing something that I wasn’t alone with. Up to 20% of Millenials and Generation X’ers were Mandela effected. Most disturbing to me were the changes in my recollection of geography. According to news stories there was a terrible hurricane, named Maria, in the Atlantic ocean. I read and overheard people talking about Puerto Rico described as the 52nd state. I’d remembered it as a territory rather than a full state. I remembered the flag had 50 stars because there were 50 States. However, I returned to understanding that the group consciousness agrees with me that there are 50 states. When I exhausted the news on the Mandela effect, I meditated on my emotional response to the time I’d lost on my journey through motherhood to the memory of the physician’s touch. Tears fell from my eyes at the injustice Jamie had suffered due to my inability to release the trauma of the memory of his assault. Jamie was with her dad that night. I got home from my trip after midnight. On Monday morning September 18, 2017 after I walked Jamie to the train for school, I finally came to a new conclusion. I didn’t feel right blaming or holding the physician accountable for my grief for Jamie. I decided that forgiveness was the best way forward. I found peace in my decision to love myself. I forgave myself and the physician. My phone buzzed with a reminder from my step mom Jill to take my medicine. When I reached for my pill bottle, which should have been half full, it was empty. It scared me. I’d noticed spices and things around the house coming and going again. Like the fingernail clippers the year before. September 2016 Last night I went to Bar Chord. I sat at a picnic table in the backyard where the murals are painted. It was the first free night I’ve had in a while, Jamie was at her dad’s. One thing led to another and I ended up going home with an artist. I hadn’t meant for it to happen. I learned the artist was married, and I knew that it was wrong for me, but it felt so nice to connect. So intense. I liked it intense. Part of me worries I’m playing with fire. I don’t know how I’ll feel once I bond with him. In a weird way, he feels like my equal. I like that, but I know I could never trust him. I worry it will turn into a dark and unhappy space for me. I think about Dr. Richard and it makes me cry. I know, that will NEVER happen, but I still want Dr. Richard. People like the artist help me forget how sad I feel about not knowing Dr. Richard. October 2016 Last week I looked everywhere for the fingernail clippers. They disappeared from the place I expected them to be. The small china cup that held the clippers was missing. I searched and searched, the kitchen, bathroom, closets, my daughters room, her closet, my boxes of things. It was 1:30 AM by the time I gave up. Everywhere I looked there were no clippers. I finally found a fingernail file, a gift from the Empire Conference I attended a few years ago. I grated down my nails irritated at the missing clippers. Then tonight, when my friend, the artist, asked to smoke a cigarette, I went to get something to take to the terrace to ash in, and there it was: the small porcelain tea cup with the fingernail clippers. It was sitting right there, right where it was supposed to be last Saturday when it was missing. “It’s back,” I said. “What?” My friend asked. “The ashtray went missing, and now it is right here. Do I have selective vision? How did I not see it before? How is that possible?” I asked. My friend had no idea the significance of my find. He was oblivious to the irritation I experienced last Sunday night at 1:30am. I had searched and searched for the clippers and that tea cup. I would swear on my life that it was NOT there just last Sunday, but it returned to me today. It was a full moon, and I told my friend the artist that I couldn’t be intimate with him anymore. I felt too guilty having a relationship with him. He had commitments outside of the connection we shared. So, I told him I needed distance. He played some songs for me on youtube, then I said it was time to walk the dog. We said a hurried goodbye, and I returned home to consider the significance of the reappearance of the nail clippers. I wondered if it had something to do with my email. I’d told everything, the truth of my story. I felt reassured when things I needed were returned. If ever something goes missing and isn’t returned I’ll worry that my protectors failed. For now, I feel safe. When my medication went missing the morning of September 18th, 2017, I worried that I wasn’t supposed to take the medication. In my state of fear, I lied to my family about taking my medication. On Tuesday, I went to work. I’ve been told that the medication doesn’t leave your system for some time. I didn’t feel like a threat to myself or others, so I didn’t consider going to work a problem having missed my dose of medication. I slept okay that night, not as soundly as I usually do, but I made it to work on time. It was a good day, filled with positive interactions with student learners in the clinic and their patients. However, the computer system AXIUM was acting up. With one of the patients the odontogram where the teeth are charted on the computer screen said a front tooth was missing, but looking in the mouth and looking at the x-rays, the tooth existed in real life. We couldn’t figure out how to make the tooth appear on the chart. I brought over Dr. Burns and she confirmed the tooth was there, then we emailed everyone in IT to address the computer glitch. It unnerved me because I’d read a story about the mysterious planet Nerbu X in our solar system. I was starting to see signs in my environment, and this error message made me wonder if AXIUM, our flawed electronic dental records system, might be a metaphor about our world. Like Nerbu X, the glitch in the system was showing the tooth as missing when it was actually present in real life. After that, every time something happened, the error messages in AXIUM would give me warnings. It had me on edge. “I don’t know why it is giving us all these error messages,” I told one student I was working with. “I know, I’ve never seen it be this bad before.” She said. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say it was a sentinel being.” I said half joking, half serious. “What does that mean, sentinel,” She asked. “A sentinel being is something with consciousness,” I said. Everyone in the cubical chuckled as we dismissed the error message and the signatures were accepted. At home that night I was getting more messages in the form of things appearing around the apartment. A stray orange Gatorade bottle appeared in the fridge half empty. We didn’t know where it came from. Then, the radio was also acted up. It turned on randomly to sing pop music with lyrics that were a little different than I’d remembered them. In response to my decompensation, I created a key to interpret the signs and signals. The key used the alphabet to interpret signs using my assigned protective concepts. I used the semantics reading the words in the reverse direction. For instance, “Trump” meant: “Plan. God, You Are Thankful.” Trump T Thankful R Are U You M God P Plan When strange things happened, I’d use my key composed of protective concepts to guard me from fear of the experience. I believed I was being saved by semantics, a form of a game. It felt as if mythology was real dealing with my experience of being played with. Wednesday morning came, and the morning was going well until 10:30am. I walked over to the reception desk on the fourth floor by the CD side of the clinic floor. Each clinic floor was divided into sections: AB/CD. I saw a grey metal hole punch with “CD4” etched by a dental drill. When I saw the shaky hand scratched letters I became afraid. Explosive, I thought when I repeated CD4 in my mind. The chakra at the back of my neck opened in fear. Then, the fire alarm sounded as I stood in front of the reception desk and printer. It howled throughout the building the second after I had my fearful thought. Unsure what was going on, I walked back to my students who had just finished the final step I’d assigned. I’d already checked everything else. We dismissed the patient beneath the ringing sirens, and flashing lights. There were lines at the stairs as the building evacuated. My students asked me if I was afraid. “No, I have faith in a higher power,” I said and made eye contact with the people nearby on the stairs as we waited to descend. I prayed to God for protection from the siren and the fear of an explosive. When we got outside the sun was so bright and warm. It was a beautiful September day. I took a deep breath, and after a few minutes they let us back into the building. That night I got home and hugged Jamie tight. We made dinner after she finished homework. I set out my bag for work the next day in Queens. When I went down to walk Buddy, I read the dramatic news stories between Trump and Kim Jong-un. The stories were so funny when I used my key to interpret the news, that it made me laugh hard. The belief system was rooted in a deep level of feminism, whereby women could take back power in the world through withholding climax from their men for the sake of world peace. A car parked along the service road began to blink with the right turn signal on. The car was empty. It almost felt like the lights were laughing with me. For as long as I could remember, when I walked Buddy the automated lights we passed would shut off in response to our presence. I worried that somehow the lights were responding to Buddy and me. It bothered me that my presence caused darkness. I’ve always preferred bright lights. Brightness diminished my perception of bokeh or light refractions on the lenses of my glasses and helped reduce my perception of auras that sometimes surround people and objects. I took the f train Thursday morning to Queens. I sat at my desk in the morning light and looked over Kew Gardens. The lush greenery of early fall had yet to turn into autumn splendor. Class began on time and I worked with students in anatomy lab to support their learning. Things were going well with the exception of my issue with flickering lights following me. As we entered the clinic the lights started to blink. The small LED lights flashed like we were at a disco. Even the large overhead lights would randomly turn on and off. “These lights are weird, it’s like supernatural.” One student said spooked by the strange phenomena. “It’ll be ok. Just think of it as ambient lighting,” I said trying to reassure her. “I guess, but I’ve never seen anything like this. Do you think it will be ok when we have patients?” She asked. “I’m sure it will stabilize before we see patients.” I said. A man came in from the side door to the clinic and flipped off and on the light switch observing the unusual lighting effects. He tried every switch near the door trying to figure out which switches were impacted. “Are you here to fix the lights?” I asked. “I’m the electrician. It’s something happening with the transformer,” He said. We all chucked at the twinkling lights above. After he moved to the other end of the clinic floor, the student and I began to work. “Welcome to supportive learning,” I said. “My goal is to help you to review any content you may not have gotten right the first time and help you to review your study habits so that you can build both your core knowledge and your process knowledge. By that I mean the things you memorize – core knowledge. And how you learn or check your knowledge base – process knowledge,” I said. I noticed that it was emotionally challenging for students to feel like they’d failed when they missed questions. I reassured them that by reviewing things and approaching the errors with a growth mindset, where learning is a process and not a fixed objective, they’d make it through their educational journey as life-long learners, and I worked to reassure them that the knowledge base in the profession was expanding rapidly. “When I was a student, the difference between non-succedaneous and succedaneous, was not core knowledge that I retained. The injustice in the dental educational system is that it abuses student hygienists by making you pay for and learn more than an associate’s degree, then it fails to give you full recognition, but don’t worry, this program’s master plan allows you to put your earned hours towards a baccalaureate degree. Sorry, I’m getting off topic.” I said, and we returned to the corrections. I asked the students to open their text books and find the text with the correct answers, underline the text, then write the terminology in a notebook to make flashcards later. “This will help you to learn your source material and be able to easily access where your knowledge came from at a later date,” I said beneath the twinkling clinic lights. I believed my higher power was showing me through these student’s lessons a simple truth. I thought the instructions had two meanings. One was teaching students how to find their sources and become researchers. Second, these instructions could be used later for determining that we live in a multiverse. I knew I’d never be able to prove or disprove my belief in a higher power and how I’d been shown the multiverse. I read something about “disco lights” and the prophesy of Jesus. I wondered if someone was playing with me again, or if my reality was being influenced by a higher power. That night Jamie was at a friend’s home. New York City public schools were closed for the Jewish and Islamic holidays. I reached her about 6pm, and we both felt tired and hungry. By the time we got home, it was past time to eat. I fed Jamie a quick snack, and started heating water, and chopping garlic and peeling potatoes for a meal of fried catfish and garlic mashed potatoes. Buddy stayed by my feet hoping for me to miss the trash can or drop a scrap. I changed his water when he scraped at his bowl. I searched for the recipe for the catfish meal but couldn’t find it. Rather than abandon the attempt at cooking, I decided to use the quality ingredients delivered earlier that week and rely on my skills as a cook. I dipped the catfish in an egg batter then dredged it in flour and added some ground sage before frying it in the buttered pan. In the other pot the potatoes boiled with the garlic. The raspberries and whip cream topped snack had improved Jamie’s mood. She joined me for our meal that night. We talked about how our budget was working. She continued to understand the limitations of the budget. I didn’t share my concerns with her about the fire alarm, the “disco lights” at work, or the missing menu card. Instead we focused on her. She wasn’t feeling well. Her sinuses and “allergies” were acting up. I suggested we rest the next day. “I’m not feeling very well,” I said. I was beginning to feel transient physical, visual, tactile, and other sensory symptoms of medication withdrawal and amplification of psychotic symptoms and an altered perception of reality. I was too sick to think of the consequences of going off medication cold turkey. The burning skin was back, in addition to pins and needles, heartache, chills, burning souls of my feet, chakra bursts, pulsing energy, etc. The list of my symptoms was starting to grow. “I’m not either and I have so much homework. I have to write pages and pages for English.” She said. I was struggling with fear and fatigue, and our home showed it. There was stuff on the chairs in the living room, I needed to do laundry, scrub the kitchen, and pick up the laundry on the bathroom floor. Plus, I needed to take out the trash. The building’s trash shoot was closed off for renovation, meaning I had to walk outside to the curb with the trash, and I hadn’t done any house work since the previous weekend. It just felt like too much. Jamie was old enough to help but she told me it was my responsibility not hers. I tried to explain that we were a team, but she would get upset because her teachers had overwhelmed her with assignments. I chose not to argue. Instead, I took down the smelly trash when I walked Buddy. As I walked Buddy, I noticed my surroundings. There were police in the neighborhood that night. A long NYPD van with 6-8 officers sitting inside looking at their cell phones was parked at the corner of Ditmas Ave. and Ocean Parkway. I read NYPD “Delusional Plan. Why, Nation.” It made total sense that we needed police, to protect against some people’s delusional plans. Fortunately, my plan was the love orgasm plan. I felt safe within my semantic game. Buddy and I walked past the NYPD van to cross Ditmas. I saw a captivating woman in the crosswalk. She stopped dead in her tracks when she saw Buddy. She lifted her gaze to mine. She wore a wool skirt and shall wrapped around her shoulders. She connected with me through thick glasses. She looked young for such a look, and when our eyes met, the pain in my chest lifted. I walked Buddy past her path to clear the way for her to get out of the middle of the lane and thought about her calming gaze for much of the rest of the walk. Her stare helped me feel comforted. That night was to be the fall equinox, and that witchy woman’s gaze soothed my pain. We passed down the block past the rose bushes to the corner of Webster, where Buddy always marks the corner of the fence. As I looked down at the bushes inside the fence, my vision went to black for a split second. When I could see again, I saw a black and brown spotted Tabby cat sitting between the bushes with a downcast gaze. The second before I’d only seen dirt between the bushes. I felt safe with this animal there. Buddy was indifferent stopping to smell the patch of grass in front of the fence. Knowing that woman’s gaze helped me and being watched by the local wildlife (stray cats) reassured me. This night the lights stayed on as we passed by the buildings. I wondered if the cat was a shapeshifter, or if I’d slid between the veil. Jamie was in bed by the time we arrived home that night. I felt exhausted. I threw off my shoes and climbed in bed. But my mind was a buzz. High on a mixture of curiosity, fear, and hope, I couldn’t stop my thoughts. They just wouldn’t turn off. They slowly progressed. My mind wasn’t racing, it awakened to a new type of processing. My thinking lifted. I could no longer perceive time normally. The months of the year were hard to recall. I struggled to schedule tasks. However, my ability to play a game with semantics wildly expanded. When I wrote notes about my experience on the computer screen, a text box appeared. It simply said, “compare and contrast”. The message assigned me a task to look for contradictions and contrasting events. What I learned as I played this game was that it was inappropriate when reading about death, dying, or most news of sadness or terror. As I read the news, I listened to music on iTunes, iHeartRadio, and from my radio. Everything felt predetermined and intentional. Did someone know my thoughts? When they didn’t like what I was thinking, the phone froze, song paused, or a new story launched for me to read. The devices controlled my perception. When I asked if the fire alarm was their doing, they were perplexed. “You mean you don’t know?” The text in the browser asked me. When I searched my memories trying to know what I didn’t know, that was when the browser launched independent of my key strokes to a news story. It was an article about Durga, the Hindu goddess of justice appeared from the American Institute of Vedic Studies. I’ve been feeling for a long time that someone was helping me through my struggles with mental illness. The great mother goddess, who appears as Durga has been given many powers by Gods and Goddesses. She is a super power in the realm of the supernatural. I tried to understand the significance of this information. The songs on the radio sang sweet love ballads. It made me wonder if maybe God loved me. I kept sinking low when I had the thought that only God would love me. My dating life was fun, but when I reflected on the inability of the men in my life to love me through my mental illness, my heart ached. I wanted unconditional love. The type people at church talked about in my youth. When I thought that God loved me romantically, it was a powerful aphrodisiac. I liked it, but I sank low when I thought of how I felt about the men in my life. Pulling back from the memory of the men who’d failed me, I lifted my mind, and thought about my history of my romance with God. I couldn’t forget the way I’d taken my virginity. The first time I’d had sex was with Jamie’s father, Jack, which was true. But, I’d climaxed before that on my own. I’d used the most powerful thing I could think of in high school. I fantasized about God. I knew it was wrong, but it was fun. Part II Durga’s Plot While I was coming to grips with my new understanding, and the intensity of the grandiose idea of God’s love. The messages continued. From a combination of the text on the screen, music on the radio, and my thinking I came to believe that Durga and the angels of heaven or Gods, depending on what religion you used to try to describe the higher order of our subjective reality and the higher realm of power. I believed that Durga plotted with others to design a “bad romance” whereby all religion paints the backstory for this love affair with the third eye, a higher power, and sexuality. In romance writing the force is the thing that brings two characters together so that a romance can blossom. In my story that force was the concept of healing. Someone in the higher dimension thought of using “healing” as the force to bring God into proximity long enough for humanity to fall in love romantically. In 2005, I broke when I couldn’t separate my fantasies of the physician from the reality of the abuse of his exam during my labor at the time of my daughter’s birth. Then my husband didn’t love me through the experience, and I struggled. I believed that God was slowly healing me through time, and modern interference. Until the 2017 eclipse, I was unable to conceive of my experience as sexual abuse. I wanted to believe in the physician’s humanity and believe that he didn’t intend to assert his power over me. But thinking back, I remembered the look on his face when my husband took a picture with the physician’s camera for a picture album cataloging all the deliveries he’d attended. His trophy collection. I couldn’t forget his cruel expression when the flash exposed him, I lost my mind as I tried to erase that memory. I wanted to love his humanity and failed to connect with reality in my attempt. The experience changed me. Eventually I couldn’t sit with the anger, I didn’t like feeling that toxic, so I chose to forgive, but still, it left me forever touched, and the ramifications for my daughter and my relationship were significant and long term. When I deeply reflect on my perception, I am uncertain of any reality that is not verified. Memory is subjective. It can be influenced and twisted by many forces. It was also the most vulnerable moment of my life. Plus, with having experienced so many versions of reality in the multiverse during my illness*more later, I have stopped believing that there is a simple reality. The physician may be the well-intentioned version of himself, and not the power player I remember being touched by. Anyway, at this point, the intention doesn’t matter. I perceived it in my reality, and I’ve forgiven him. He is free. I am free, too. I chose to love him unconditionally, regardless of his actions or my delusions. Even though I don’t get to be with him in the physical world, I feel alive in my higher level connection to the universal source. I live in the Light and live my life with love, and it feels divine. I am better not having him in the physical sphere. Any connection to him is of a higher level. It only happens when I lift up and feel the energy rise within and through me. But I find sometimes we go to the sitting place in my mind and spend time being sad when I cannot lift beyond my visceral needs. I’d been through so much. A song played on my iPhone by Rockell who sang “Show Me the Way.” The song wanted me to show the way. I couldn’t escape the reality that I need to care for my child, and I knew I was suffering with my illness. I knew I would need to return to medication to treat my illness and return to sanity, but I knew the side effects were severe with the medicines I took. After over a decade of medication compliance my body was suffering from the medication side effects. The smooth muscles throughout my body had become stiff. Even breathing was at times labored and uncomfortable especially when wearing a constricting bra. Instead of worrying about me, I started to worry about the physician and his world. I was told not to worry about the physician. I was told that when his time comes, he dies a peaceful death. The messages told me that on the journey through to heaven, God (or whoever was playing with the messages) looked back in the rear-view mirror and saw an image of his likeness in the physician. Who knows, maybe Durga forced Him to do it. There was a country love song about those two meeting in the back of an old bar and falling in love. I think maybe it was all an elaborate setup. When I focused, I worried about reality. I read news stories about the threat of nuclear war. Then the messages started coming. I was instructed that I had to decide the future with my action. I was given the choice either to climax, or the world would be destroyed. The messages told me our futures were at stake. Thinking of my role as a mother, of course I chose to climax. What was the worst that could happen if I pleasured myself? It was so strange feeling as if someone could read my mind and control me so intensely. However, I never felt my free will was taken. Despite being played with so completely, the choice to act was always mine. Although, the perversion of psychosis is real. I felt coerced into action. It was my understanding that some higher power needed to ejaculate on the solstice, or the next thousand generation would be baron. Somehow, I was the focus of the attention of the higher power and by climaxing I believed this started a religious chain of events – beginning the Rapture. My delusion of grandeur about the end times is a common theme in mental illness, although my experience of it may be different. Granted, looking back on the scripture, my belief is impossible. The bible clearly states the pregnant woman gave birth with “labor pains” to a male child. And I didn’t have the wings of an eagle, I had mental illness and a half-written romance novel titled the “great blue heron”. At climax I felt a sensation of honey like energy spread over my body. I was vibrating so intensely, I felt like I was buzzing. The music on the radio sounded so alive and fresh to me. I felt high. That night I didn’t sleep. As I understood it, He needed to climax to reproduce to create a new heir for his family. Somehow my climax helped him out. Minutes later a story about a dynastic heir emerged in my news feed. When I stopped sleeping, my mind kept slowly thinking new thoughts. It wasn’t going fast, just slow and steady. I needed to consider to understand what was happening to me. I was captivated by the game, and my experience. Throughout the night I read forwards with the authors intent, then applied my semantic language reading backwards in loose associations that I found to be ironic and funny to read. It felt like I was experiencing the feminine and masculine forces of the ethos. It created a funny and ironic balance. The basic protective concepts when placed together explained something about our God, who I came to understand as coming from a higher realm like magicians in a parallel universe. I believed he was King Arthur, the King of Heaven, and really the leader of Islamic, Jewish, and Christian faiths, who is a masculine force. Past experiences with things appearing and disappearing around me had altered my understanding and perception of time. When I shared this story with my writing group, they cautioned not to share it, because my story may be radically insensitive to religions around the world. But, I have lived experiences of mental illness that defy reality. I still remembered the story of the coin. Unsure of what to do, I’ve kept my story silent for the most part. Taking it out and working on it when I am able. When I read the signs, they explained that He (God, the Male God) orgasms. I mean, we were made in his image, right? So, why wouldn’t He orgasm? “Orgasms Are,” I read when the messages told me to “Grow.” The humor tickled me at the notion that Durga, the supreme mother goddess had set up the author, my God, in a sort of a bad romance, where all world religions form the perfect backstory for the setup for this new mythological reality. She assisted using the character in my imaginary world “Sunny” trying to help me through my mental illness. She’d plotted for Arthur to work to heal me from the original sin of the physician’s abuse at the birth of my daughter, and to rebalance the male and female forces in the universe. Even Jesus worked into the backstory to create a reality where America exists as it can today to allow our higher power to fall in love. Even the Pope was part of the conspiracy to create a world where God can heal us all. The music sang to me with unusual lyrics to a song I had heard before. The lyrics were nothing like I remembered them. I’ve looked for the song and can’t find it in my library or locate the artist, but I remember the story vividly. The lyrics told me a story where God and others saw the holy Light but failed to descend in time. “We’d just taken you to walk the plank. We were so surprised. It was so surreal. We didn’t look at what happened until it was too late.” The music said. Putting it together with the messages I was reading in the news stories, I figured Durga was who they saw in the Light. They could see Durga, because she is a goddess. Their family in heaven share a third eye. They’d explained that they saw their family’s sins and sins committed against them. I saw into the third eye as I gave birth to Jamie and looked into the holy Light beyond the lotus. The flower opened with the purest Light I’ve ever seen at the center. The lotus flowered during the transition in my labor hours before I gave birth. I sat and breathed deeply and used techniques I learned in yoga practice in my early 20’s to deal with the pain. As I meditated, the sensation of the contractions of labor was intense. They felt similar to the orgasms of pregnancy. The lotus flower pulsed and bloomed with one thousand petals of every hue of color. Reds, greens, yellows, oranges, purples, blues, and at the center was brightest Light filled with love and sensual energy that shot sparks through the entranced imagery. There was darkness all around the periphery of my vision of color and Light. The radiating flower pulled me towards the Light and held my attention through the labor. There was also a Mandela in an electric yellow/green and orange pattern that emerged from the lotus. It was hypnotizing. I understood that because Arthur explained He saw Durga, they determined a sin had occurred, but seeing the holy Light transmitted simultaneously, they were confused. So was I. They later explained that being sexually abused during the birth violated me. But they hadn’t immediately gone to look beneath the veil to understand my story. When the sexual abuse was registered as sin, it changed everything. He said the world could never be the same. I believed they were changing timelines to prepare for a new reality – one where equality and justice ruled. In response to my curiosity about the romance plot, I looked back at the story I’d written in 2011. Originally inspired after my first professional encounter with Dan, my boss’ boss whose gaze made me feel things I’d forgotten I knew how to feel. I remembered something. I remembered being taken by the browser and shown the sir name for a line of English Nobility. I’d laughed at the idea that my writing used the sir name for the King of England. This was too much. It was impossible, wasn’t it? I’d debonded from Jack with the hope in the delusion that someone loved me. The idea that Dan (my boss’ boss) could love me burned hot, until Father Figure by George Michael played, and I realized he was too old for me. I was young enough to be his daughter. Plus, I didn’t believe he’d abuse his power that way. I knew I was sick and delusional, and that in fact, my computer was hacked and leading me around the internet. I’d chosen to believe that someone could love me, and the content on my broken computer, over trusting my broken relationship with Jack, the head of information security. Looking back, I wondered if I’d trusted Jack, if things would have turned out differently* footnote story about the hack in 2016/2017. I found a copy of one of my stories saved randomly on the hard drive of my computer rather than saved in a file. It was randomly dropped at a high level of my organization system. I usually kept my written works together in a file under my projects folder. Romance with God When a revised version of my failed submission for the Flame Contest showed up on my hard drive I opened it up curiously. I couldn’t remember revising it with such a strong masculine voice. I wondered how it got on my computer. Was I blacking out, or forgetting the memories of my work? I started to read it, and that reading played over in my mind creating new threads of thinking from which delusions formed. Had Durga helped me again? Or, my heart skipped a beat, Arthur?

"Paranormal Living Part III The Back Story of God’s Love This fall something happened to me. I experienced things that can't have been true. I mean, it's just too much. The basic premise is that Durga Plotted to seduce the God of the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic faith. She did this using the theme of healing to bring God into proximity with women to heal them from the sin of sexual abuse such as the Me Too movement. God fell in love and realized why America exists, because this is where he has the potential to love and be loved. SO, the premise is sorta freemason... where God forgave Lucifer, because He fell in love. To accept Lucifer back into heaven, He (God) participated in a ritual to become the devil. I know, it's complicated. My Reaction to the Bad Romance News stories about the royal family, the third eye conspiracy, thoughts of my story linked with God, God the devil. And more. Holy Fire and Druga’s Protection When I looked up the holy Light in the bible, there was a reference about Jesus emitting the holy Light. The Mormon’s go into great detail about the belief in Jesus bringing the Light to every person. More simply, I think the Light I saw was coming from within my brain. I also found references to Jesus and the idea of the holy fire. Then in the thirteenth century, the miracle of the Holy fire was deemed a fraud. But it made me think of all the fires and fire alarms. Thankfully I reminded myself Durga is the goddess of protection against fires and things. I had a history of being afraid of fire. With the name like mine, who wouldn’t. Part IV – Chapter 1 Karma: Motherhood and Mental Illness I wondered if somehow Jamie was Durga’s child – Karma. Durga’s daughter is Karma. But Durga had never stayed after a major defeat in one of her battles, she always disappeared. I worried about Jamie if anything happened to me, and I couldn’t repair our bond, because you know what they say about Karma. I also worried that Jamie belonged as the daughter of the King of Heaven. Since the conception, I’d struggled to believe that Jack was her father. I had an alternate memory about the night she was conceived. I’d written about it in the book I’d published. I’d told myself it had to be a fantasy, an implausible fantasy. But, I remembered it clearly. In June 2014, after I’d had sex with Jack and he’d fallen asleep next to me, I’d masturbated to climax. The sex toy I’d reached for felt sticky and warm, but I used it anyway. I was too turned on by the idea that someone wanted me badly enough to trick me into getting pregnant with their child. Although, it did occur to me that it was wrong on so many levels to masturbate with my husband asleep by my side, he’d left me wanting more. Our home in New Hampshire was being painted that summer and an extension ladder leaned against the back of the house by our open bedroom window. I heard it creak as I climaxed. I postulated that if I was right, and Durga together with others from the spiritual realms set up Christianity, Islam, and Judaism as a backstory for the romance between a sort of a masculine King of heaven to transition from a male dominated society to a balance the power on earth between men and women. If I was right, the future would be filled with large sustainable cities, that were environmentally friendly, and where justice reigned. The images they took me to allowed me to have hope for the future. It reminded me of the ancient Mythology, where women united against men to end war and create peace on earth. Another possibility included that it could have been my soul emitting the Holy Light. I mean, I’d seen it during the birth. Must have been my Light, right? If true, then I doubted my understanding of “God.” I wondered if I misunderstood the role of the King of Heaven and the Mother Goddess Durga. A collective third eye that emitted love was more likely the true God. The one that I know and love, who is eternal love. I loved that male God of Christianity too much so I preferred my higher power to be the God that existed in the third eye as a universal truth that belongs to all of us. I figured maybe I was right and it is as if we live in an ant hill or a bee hive. Confused by the number of messages coming at me, I tried to understand, even if nobody else would agree with me. My story explained a new perspective for the reason behind the intelligent design of our universe in ways I could understand. The United States of America was intelligently designed with the eye at the top of the pyramid waiting for women to climax in a form of spiritual ecstasy. When I explained the story to close friends, I found many women in my life shared about their own close connections with God. “Every Sunday morning, I have a romance with God,” one friend said enthusiastically after I explained how I loved Him. Another friend said her mom relied on God’s love to raise her kids as a single mom. My heart started to sink low when I let myself get down into the details of the failed relationships with the men in my life. When I rose up and saw the bigger picture of the systematic failure of culture and religion, denying women power, I felt better. The thought of any one man failing me pained my soul. But looking back from 2021, I can at times lift to a higher vibration and love unconditionally. The protective concepts in my list of keys were a plan that defined the ultimate feminist ploy. The notion that women uniting to deny men climaxes and refuse to participate in sexual unions without love was divinely funny. Even the word porn made me laugh. When I read it I understood it to mean: “Nation ouR Orgasm Plan.” Reading forwards that orgasm plan for America was “porn”, which usually isolates people, which contrasted nicely with the notion that a love plan for orgasms could work. The associations were bright and vibrant in my mind. The connections taking place were crystal clear to me, although looking back, my friends, family, and medical providers struggle to follow my ability to associate so flexibly. The looseness of my thinking allowed me to make associations, find irony, and discover humor where nobody in their right mind would find anything. It kept my experience lighter than I’d ever known when confronted with a mental health crisis. I believed it was a game with our higher power playing with my reality. One of my favorite words was Durga, which when I read backwards, it meant “American God, Are You Delusional?” Durga clearly was a Hindu Goddess. Later that night I walked Buddy, strolling slowly on the sidewalk along Ocean Parkway. Buddy liked to stop at every tree, hydrant, and corner to sniff and mark the objects. When he lingered his face at the base of a puddle of possible markings from another dog, I’d gently nudge him on. “Don’t lick that, Buddy.” I said. Buddy loved to lick everything. I’d seen where his tongue had been. It made me uncomfortable at the thought of him licking my feet. I experienced time distortion where I thought I was only gone for our typical half hour walk. When I walked in the door Jamie said it was two hours, and she was just about to call me. When she explained the length of my absence, I tried to retrace my steps and think about how long it should have taken. Buddy and I must have been moving slowly, I thought. Exhausted, I kicked off my shoes and laid down. Still unable to sleep my mind continued with its progressive thinking. The music played on my phone, and I read stories. I wondered if I’d been taken through the veil and kissed by God. When I looked at the star charts, everything looked to be the reverse of reality as I knew it. I began to imagine that I’d slipped to the other side of the galaxy across the Milky Way. Thinking I was in a mirror reality helped to explain my experiences. I was still in the grips of a Mandela effect, where everything was similar, but different from how I remembered it should be. I’d began to see the veil, a lapse of darkness that caused time to be distorted, and I felt surrounded by spirit animals like pigeons, starlings, finches, flies, parrots, cats, and dogs in my neighborhood. When I came home that night, I worried about the threat of an atomic war, I prayed for peace. I was told that my next task was walking all the world leaders into the Light to protect the world from harm. I focused on Kim Jong Un first. I lured him towards the Light with the promise of the honey of my love. When things became dark, I turned on my dental lamp and he laughed and came into the Light. I repeated my task with Putin. Using the dental lamp when it became darker than I liked. I was worried that I hadn’t done a good enough job, then I checked my email. Apple iTunes sent me a password reset from two days in the future. That reassured me that the future still existed. When I laid in bed again, my thoughts took me low. I surrendered to my experience. I felt hopeless against the power of the perversion of my psychosis and inability to sleep. I understood that the realm of higher power is in command orchestrating every moment in the dynamic dramatic program called life. In the morning, Jamie opened my bedroom door. She poked her head between the door and the frame with the hall light shining behind her. It was early Saturday morning. “Mom, I’m going to the barn soon, but I don’t feel good.” She said. She talked to me, but I had a hard time hearing her. I had just explained with my thoughts that I wasn’t afraid if they chose to take me. They’d told me that I belonged home in heaven. That is when I began to see the Light in the upper left corner of my vision. I refused to look at it though. I chose to focus on Jamie. I need to stay for Jamie. She needs me. The thought was firm in my mind. “Ok?” Jamie asked. “Sure,” I said, not sure what I was agreeing to. Jamie turned and then came back carrying my small black hand bag. She explained again that she needed money to go to the convenience store for lunch with the volunteers at the barn. I pulled out a twenty and gave it to her. “Text me when you get there, and when you leave. Please be home by sunset,” I said. “Love you, see you later,” She said and closed and locked the front door. By Sunday, I wanted to get out of bed. I felt disoriented, even though I was eating well, the sleep deprivation was taking a toll. I’d ordered plenty of food and water online for delivery. I was able to cook healthy food for me and Jamie. But Jamie’s mood was grouchy. “I think I’m sick, look at my throat.” She said and opened wide handing me her L.E.D. flashlight. “Honey, it looks a little red, but I don’t know if that means you are sick. Maybe we should go to a doctor. You seem irritable.” I said. Reading the signs, when Buddy lifted his right paw, I interpreted that we needed to take her to get an exam. We’d been to a walk-in clinic in park slope before. I put on a nice yellow dress, flats, and a light weight jacket. Jamie’s terrible mood showed as she whined and yelled about everything. She was hungry but refused any food I offered her. Thankfully, Durga was there to help. Jamie got stuck in her pants. It was as if Durga had cast a spell to make the pants impossible to pull up. “Help me get my pants on,” Jamie demanded. I went to the couch to help her. Both Jamie and I struggled and laughed as we attempted to pull up the jeggings. It really was an impossible feat. By the time we were laughing hard, the struggle ended. When we got outside, it was a beautiful and sunny fall day. Jamie put the park slope address into the phone. A driver with a Russian accent picked us up, but the app on the phone took us to a Bay Ridge location. With everything I was experiencing I just went with the experience. I didn’t try to get to park slope. I figured we were taken to Bay Ridge because the signs said the eye was delusional and God’s energy needed to protect me and Jamie. I was worried that Jamie was God’s child. I was concerned that Jamie would be harmed by those who were in power, or worse that Jack would intervene if I failed to address her needs adequately. We arrived at the clinic shortly after 9:00 am. The email receipt said the charges were made by EZ-Car, but I thought I’d used my UBER app. Ignoring the strangeness, Jamie and I signed in. I shared her insurance information and we were quickly called into the exam room. Jamie sat up on the exam chair. The attendant had a nice yellow aura and wore a hijab. I started to realize that we shared a love for God. My God was her God. When the physician’s assistant came in he was glowing in Light. It was quite amazing. I’d never seen such a glow. Even when I chose Jamie over the Light the day before, she and the Light had glowed half as much. I was unsure what to think of the Light surrounding him. They recommended a variety of allergy medications, antihistamines, and even antibiotics if her condition didn’t improve. They suggested seeing an allergist to help with understanding her condition and getting the right care long term. When we left the CityMD we walked to a pharmacy around the corner to purchase over-the-counter remedies. Then Jamie was hungry and wanted Starbucks. She typed into her phone and found one a short walk away. We sat inside and ate hot sandwiches and sipped on iced tea. On the way home, Jamie talked for a bit as she read the labels of her medications to me. I looked out the window and read the graffiti. The Brooklyn Queens Expressway seemed to be further inland than I remembered it being. It was a strange ride home. The landmarks I knew were missing from the Brooklyn Skyline. The only landmark I could identify in the distance was the Freedom Tower. Everything else seemed to point a Pisa Dynasty. I figured the lack of sleep had taken its toll, and I must have misunderstood my surroundings. Once we were home, Jamie decided she was too sick for a party at a friend’s so she stayed home that day. I cooked pasta and chicken with ground sage for dinner. I couldn’t find any other spices. By the time Monday came, I knew I had to tell my family what I was experiencing. That morning while I walked Buddy, the signs written in the cement on the sidewalk were reinforcing what I read from MDs office. The message said that Jamie was God’s child. They’d taken a throat culture to send out to the lab. When I thought paternity tests had to be blood based, a message appeared on my phone. The message when I read it both ways said He was family. The sidewalk in front of the Jewish Center had a single letter “C” etched when I looked down. When I read the sign to see, it hit me hard that God told me so. I called my sister, Chloe, a little before 6 am her time. I choked on my tears as I explained about falling in love with the King of Heaven, and telling how the Hindu Goddess Durga was helping Jamie and me. My Mom, Dad, Sister, and Brother, each called each other to plan how best to help. I needed medical attention. Chloe called my psychiatrist to notify her that I wasn’t well. A new prescription was called into the pharmacy along with a refill that my brother would bring to me that night to add another medication that I’d been well with for years before that I’d stopped because of the side effect, and I’d refill the prescription that I had been switched to. My sister-in-law came over that afternoon to be with me. When she saw the kitchen she immediately stepped into action. My nephews played in Jamie’s room, we put Buddy away in my bedroom, and in something of a daze, I spent some time at my computer reading the news as physical sensations began to take over my body. Sensations were rolling over me in waves moving from one area to the next transiently. After I had made calls to all the family members, I must have saved a sewing machine that Jamie wanted in my list of purchases to make. I also must have moved the radio from the kitchen to the dining room table that night. The next morning when I got out of bed to get breakfast for Jamie, I asked her how the radio ended up on the dining room table. “You put it there last night, don’t you remember? You were talking about how much you like to listen to music out here.” She said. I couldn’t remember having gotten up from bed the night before, but I trusted Jamie’s memory over my own. Either I’d blacked out on my memory, or Durga was helping me again. I looked for a message in the sign from the radio, but I couldn’t understand. When I realized I’d become too sick, I knew I could not go into work in the condition I was in. I sent an email to my department leader asking for coverage for my shifts in clinic. Chloe scheduled the next flight from LA the next day, Wednesday, September 20th. She arrived at noon. I took both my medications that night. And got the first few hours of sleep I’d had in days. Thursday morning Chloe took over getting Jamie ready for school, making breakfast and walking Jamie to the train. After I walked Buddy that morning we sat and she helped plan the schedule of doctor’s appointments. That afternoon I had a physician’s appointment in Manhattan. They called to say that my insurance company said my usual physician was not listed as the primary care provider on my insurance. I called to straighten out the provider information with the insurer. For some reason they had changed the provider. I called the office of the physician who was listed and the office was closed that week, so I figured the error was not mine. I couldn’t remember making the change or scheduling any appointments with this other person. We kept the appointment with my doctor I’d seen for the past seven years. After we made the calls I got a text from the CVS pharmacy near my home that a prescription for Jamie had been filled for antibiotics for her sinus infection. We picked up the medicine on the way to the train, and because Jamie was still feeling ill, decided to pick her up from school so that she could take her medicine. We decided we’d be gone for too long to let Jamie stay home alone, so we had to take her with us on our trip. We’d need to go into Manhattan to my appointment. I’d also received a notice that the new laptop I’d ordered had arrived at the Bookstore. I let Jamie use this device sometimes. A few weeks before one of my devices stopped working. I’d sent it into Apple and they’d determined liquid had been spilled on the keyboard making it short out. When I got to the store, I struggled to find the email to pick up the computer. I’d given up on finding the proof in my email that the order had shipped. Chloe had helped find the threaded email lost in a list of old emails due to google yahoo issues. Once they found my invoice and brought out the computer, we left the store. We walked down Broadway, I was reading signs everywhere in my surroundings. When I looked at the back of a Benz, the tag said “RIZE”. I thought God was saying I needed to lift my spirits. “Energy Sleep. I. R.” I read that he commanded the extra energy to sleep and reassured me of His presence. When we rounded the corner to the nearest coffee shop, with a sticker over the In Living Stereo sign, it was aptly named “Dark Star” Coffee. I thought it was funny considering the darkness of my mood at believing God was the only thing that loved me. I also found humor to the name In Living Stereo, considering how the signs were found not only in visual cues from words, but also found in music this time. I tried to order tea, but chose a bubbly water instead. The glass walls surrounded a man at a broad desk inside the music store. It created a fish bowl effect for the man working at in living stereo. We climbed the stairs to the loft and started to recollect ourselves after the challenge of finding the email in the computer store. Jamie had made a point to remind Chloe “You’re not as cool as you think you are, you know that, right?” Jamie said when Chloe tried to get selfies with her. I stared at the pictures hanging on the walls, a picture of the cow made me smile. I thought it meant God was telling me See Orgasm Woman. I thought the picture of the cow was proof of my experience being real. Jamie and Cloe looked through our purchases. The wooden stools were comfortable enough and I liked the music on the stereo. After we’d felt done sitting we went to walk further down Broadway, but our group wasn’t feeling well, so we decided to take a car downtown. We sat near a statue of balloons by CUNY in lower Manhattan. Jamie was irritable and wanted some hot tea, so we found a starbucks, and headed to my physician’s office. At the office Chloe explained to my physician that she was there because I was sick again. And that my psychiatrist wanted to rule out a physical reason. They took my vitals and gave an EKG to check my heart. I’d shared my list of physical symptoms I’d been experiencing. Everything looked normal. Then the nurse came in to draw blood. During the blood draw, I lost consciousness. I felt like I was in an altered state. When I looked down at the needle, I worried I was transforming into something where my blood was inaccessible. She was not able to withdraw a sufficient quantity for analysis. They laid me back to recover. In the visit notes the physician said it was over an hour, but it felt like much less time. My perception of time varied from reality. We took a car home from the appointment, and when we got to our door, a package was waiting. Jamie’s singer sewing machine that I accidently purchased had arrived. It was a great distraction from everything I was experiencing. Jamie and Chloe spent all evening trying to set it up. They finally asked me to help when they couldn’t get the needle and bobbin threaded. I found the automated threading button, but put the bobbin on backwards. They figured the rest out as I went back to resting. That night I went to flush the toilet and the handle to flush the toilet fell apart. Annoyed, I lifted the lid on the back of the toilet, and looked at the apparatus. I realized the handle linked to a chain that lifted a rubber stopper to flush the toilet. I pulled up the chain and the toilet flushed. I explained how to flush the toilet to Jamie and Chloe and we laughed. “Sorry, but you’ll all have to pull your own chain,” I said. “Ewe, that sounds gross.” Jamie said. “At least it’s safe in the clean part of the toilet. It just feels cold when you reach in the tank.” I said. Chloe started to make a list of all the issues going on in the apartment for Erik to address. She called him up and suggested he bring any tools he would need to repair the refrigerator’s insulating trim that had detached from the door, and fell off everytime you opened the refrigerator. He’d need to purchase a new toilet handle at the hardware store, and we needed him to bring a ladder to replace Light bulbs. Once Erik finished with his chores I asked him to push one of the carts filled with our bagged laundry to Laundry Mania. I set out with the first cart about 5 minutes before him, but I’d run out of cigarettes. I decided to cross to the Ocean Mini Mart to buy a new pack. When I arrived half of the employees had red marks on their foreheads, the other half didn’t. When I got to the counter, everyone had red dots on their foreheads. I’d been their customer for years, and I’d only seen it on their foreheads a few times. “Is it a holiday today?” I asked gesturing at my forehead. “No, I wear this every day,” The cashier said. “What does it mean?” I asked. “It is for my God,” He said shyly and when I asked what the God’s name was, he said the name which I typed into my google app as soon as I left the store. Something like SamSara. The website that I landed on explained it was the god of duality and illusions. When Erik looked up my browser history later in the month, everything in the browser history had been wiped clean. I couldn’t find the right God when I went back to look for the source of this knowledge. One man was blowing up a black number 3 balloon. At first, I wondered who would buy a three year old child a black balloon, then I realized there must be a zero missing for a thirty year old’s birthday. At that moment my vision went to black. When I recovered my sight there were no balloons being inflated. I stood in front of the counter with my twenty dollar bill in hand to give the cashier without a red dot on his forehead. Perplexed by what had just happened, I pushed my cart back towards Ocean Parkway stopping briefly to light a cigarette and search for the name of the “god of duality” samsarah, when Erik called my phone. “Where are you?” He asked. “I just stopped at the Ocean Mini Mart for cigarettes. I’m on my way.” I said. He was already at Laundry Mania waiting for me. It was a ten-minute walk to the laundry mat. I’d set out five minutes before Erik. How had I lost at least 10 minutes? When I added the lost time to the fragments of memory of seeing the black balloon inflated, having my vision flash to black, then having there be no balloons in sight, and no red dots on foreheads, I was confused. I couldn’t find the right God when I went back to look for the source of this knowledge. Chloe’s favorite pants disappeared in the laundry. She looked everywhere for them, but they weren’t there. I explained that when they were found I’d ask mom, who was coming to visit next, to ship them back to her. I had experience with things going missing. They were always returned, but on their own timeline. Chloe flew home at the end of the weekend to be available to work in LA. On Monday I visited my psychiatrist, and we talked about everything. I showed her the key I’d been using to keep my experience light and funny. She said it was a classic symptom of Mania to create a key. She wanted to add another medication that should be soothing and help with sleep. I still wasn’t sleeping well. She offered for me to be hospitalized. I wanted to continue to recover in my home, with my existing support system in place. My team of family and friends had circled the wagons to provide support and help. I’d spent years cultivating relationships that were prepared to take on the task of being there in the short term and long term to 1. Listen, 2. Dad would facetime to observe medication compliance, 3. Help in little ways by picking up the phone and being present for Jamie and me. The thought of going to the hospital when I already had a support system, would have done more harm than good at this stage in my progression into illness. I was not a threat to myself or others, and leaving my home, my daughter, the dog, and not having access to technology to pay bills and take care of my life would create more issues than it would solve. I explained that my current support system could function through this event in my home. We talked and discussed other options. Alternatively, I suggested if I didn’t improve, I would consider a residential care setting. It would probably be a better fit than a hospital for me, if I got worse.

Healthy Communities Green Sustainable Equality Peace Light years to go. 12/2/17 I thought the feelings were getting better. Then last night was hard again. 1. I just can’t rid myself of this affliction. I’ve tried everything to forget the memory of the physician’s touch and his presence in my sacred space. 2. Running from it. Makes me cry. Makes me feel like a monster. Like I’ll never deserve to be loved in this life. 3. Running into it. Brings it back front and center. Reminds me that my love for the physician is delusional. He never loved #metoo. 4. Praying to God. Believing in love from my higher power just makes me want to escape this reality, and be with God. Then I start to feel like, no man will ever compare to God’s love. Why bother dating? Why am I even here? Then I think of Jamie. She needs me. 5. Blaming the physician for stupidity – makes me feel bad. It makes things feel very dark for me. I don’t like to blame the physician for touching me during the exam. He was too young, my clit was too swollen, and it was my mind that was broken. 6. Distracting myself real men. I have yet to meet a man capable of loving enough to help me heal my soul from the physician’s touch. 7. Playing with power exchanges, trying to heal from the physician violating my sacred space has made me feel very dark and hopeless. Although, fun in the moment at times. 8. Writing about my feelings helps me to better understand my emotions, it creates a salve for me to ease my psychological pain from the trauma of my experience of not being loved after the physician entered my sacred space. 9. The greatest psychological harm was caused by treatment where we were forced to act as if we weren’t both humans and like there was some construct that separates us clinically after I was touched in my sacred space. 10. After he touched me in my sacred space, I needed to be treated like a human being after the physician’s exam tapped my desire. It left me isolated with zero way to resolve my conflict between reality and delusional love with the physician and therefore the Hospital. 11. I understand the need for rigid boundaries in hierarchal healing relationships, but I’ve never been given the ability to resolve my emotional conflict with the physician and being trapped by desire the way I was. 12. I want to heal, and I felt so much trauma from my experience, I’m not sure how to move on and remain intact, with my heart full. In 2005 I experienced medical trauma at the birth of my daughter. I’m past the initial stages of my trauma, I’m out of the marriage where I felt vulnerable and unsupported. I live in recovery with a diagnosis of mental illness, and live in acceptance of my condition of mental illness, but medication has not healed my soul. The problem was that I felt trapped by the traumatic experience, and emotionally unable to resolve my conflict with the physician over my experience alone and in isolation. My therapists didn’t have the understanding to help me critically reflect on the issue from multiple perspectives. A supportive dialogue would have helped me so much. I feel like I was stuck in the plot of a terrible romance where bad communication drives the plot development. It was a misunderstanding. He never talked to me like a human, because our #healthcare model forbids it. The story should have ended years ago with good communication and conflict resolution. Instead it has festered. I’m tired of crying about it. I want a process to help me move on with my life and escape this the trap. I like to think of myself as emotionally able to adapt. Instead, I was treated with silence about my emotional health and wellbeing, because that is what the system deems appropriate. There are two roles: Doctor and patient, and moving beyond that into critical reflection is forbidden. There is no process to deal with a situation like mine. I need a process. The medical system failed me when I was assigned the role of patient, where some construct separates us as “Doctor” and “patient”. I’m a human. I want conflict resolution, critical reflection with experts, and the ability to have dialogue to move on. I want to understand, and move on. At this point, I want a process where a team of concerned experts gather to discuss this long lasting trauma with the hopeful outcome of helping me get out of this trap. It’s 2017, almost thirteen years after my experience, and I still struggle with feeling trapped by my memory. I needed to talk about my perceptions, and have the people who were involved share their perspectives without the fear of litigation. I want a process where I can understand what happened by hearing the medical perspective, and juxtapose that with my emotional response to the memory. Instead, my perspective was silenced by the Hospital’s legal team. Being treated clinically as I entered motherhood emotionally devastated me in my postpartum. To not have my identity including my sexual response to the physician’s examination, the lack of acknowledgement of how it impacted my mental health and wellbeing, the lack of support of the medical system in my healing journey from my perception. Real or perceived, I’m beyond the medical model. I want to heal my soul, and there is no process available to heal from a system error. My emotional health and wellbeing were compromised by the physician entering my sacred space. The system needs a process to learn from these types of events. I also do not wish to harm the physician and his family. And wish for peace physically, spiritually, and psychologically. I needed to understand what happened, including my desire that left me trapped in the memory. We are at such a strange time in history. The #metoo movement must look to reform the process and ethics that guide us as a society. The only way to do this is to develop a process of critical reflection, where two individuals either directly or indirectly work with a panel of experts to deconstruct the situation where a medical error, or medical trauma occurred. I understand the need for rigid boundaries in a hierarchal healing relationship. I’ve given up on the idea that a simple apology will help my cause, and I already know that it didn’t help having him telling me my behavior was inappropriate and should stop. I wanted to be touched by someone who loved me, and I’m not sure that I’ll ever be able to move forward to find that until I resolve my emotional conflict with the physician, and not feeling loved after his touch. My ability to protect my sacred space was taken from me by the system when I was made a patient. Every other man who’d touched my sacred space always had a consensual relationship with me. I understand, logically that he didn’t love me, but emotionally, I needed a dialogue, some process to inform my emotions and escape from the memory. I’ve forgiven myself for getting sick, and forgiven the memory of the physician’s abuse, but I’m still haunted by my desire for him in my sacred space. Maybe it is erotomania, but I’m mostly normal in that if we had been able to have a honest discussion (directly or through a process) where he expressed his perspective and reflected on what happened from his point of view, either directly or through mediation with experts in communication with him, I’d be able to resolve this affliction. Relationships are my greatest strength in my recovery from mental illness. Why is communication forbidden regarding my perceptions from the birth. I broke in response to his touch, and I don’t want to hurt any more. I want to heal. When I was a kid, my parents learned that if they didn’t want me to do something, punishment never worked. If they wanted me to change my behavior they needed to explain why they didn’t want me to do something. I need to understand why it happened, and why he doesn’t, won’t and can’t love me. I understand that it is against medical ethics and all, but the harm this situation caused me is undeniable. I want to stop hurting. I want out of this trap. Communication through a process with healthcare reform and improving the medical malpractice laws are my only hope to freeing my soul from this trap. My friends and family have explained that he can’t love me repeatedly, so I understand cognitively, but emotionally, until there is communication through a process of critical reflection, I don’t understand what happened, and/or why it happened. I’m stuck. I’m still broken over a decade later. I know there can’t be anything beyond this process for resolution, and I’ve accepted that. I mean, when I’m honest with myself, I feel too much pain and trauma from this unresolved conflict to form any loving relationship with a man after what I felt in response to the memory of the physician’s touch, and being silenced by the Hospital’s legal team. --- Another 4 years later, 2021, I feel that I'm starting to rise to a new place of being with my story. I know I get sick, but I don't always sink into sadness. About half the time I can lift my energy and connect to the source and ground. I feel such love from the universe when I am able to do this. I just want to love and be loved. ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Paranormal Living A note on the ability to lift my spirit and the 12-step program In September 2021, I found my way to a 12-step program. I remember standing in my kitchen one Saturday afternoon and realized, I’ll never get sober alone. I had the insight that I needed social support. If I stayed alone, I wouldn’t have the strength to abstain on my own. In recovery, I've learned it requires myself to be stronger than I like. Through finding other people who are doing the work and willing to lend support to my program, and through working these steps I’m beginning to reliably stay a little bit better emotionally, physically, and spiritually. Plus, by not drinking I don’t nearly drown in the self-pity of my experience. The principles of the 12-steps require that I’m well to do the work – in my humble opinion I don’t think I can do it when I’m unwell. It is too messy to try the steps while I’m sick. Mental health recovery needs a strengths-based program. Recovery from alcohol and addiction focuses the light on the shadows. Must be well to do this. I’ve been feeling healthier again so started to read more. The program is basically a set of spiritual steps that work as a type of metaphysical instrument to extract oneself from the depths of despair. In my experience, I’m predictably experiencing relief when I actively work through the program. What I’m finding to be true is that – There is no magic in recovery. We get what we work for. In the first 111 days, I’ve attended over 133 meetings. I’d heard that to aim for 90 in 90 days may help, I found that through learning from the program, I felt something I’d been searching for a way to see my own role in the trauma. A way to appreciate how my character defect escalated what might have been a problematic incident with the physician at the birth, but for most people would not have resulted in the personal devastation and total annihilation of self. The devastating tsunami wave of pain and misery knocked me out for a very long time. I’m not claiming that this method is perfect, I have a long way to go, but it is the beginning point for a new start of my spiritual healing journey.

"I think I have something Hi, I just want to talk to another human being is my hope. I want to be suffering from delusions. My entire outlook on reality changed and it only took something (not me in my own body) 4 weeks. I don't know where I am anymore. I go outside and look up at the sky and see things that used to be clouds but are now streaks across the sky. What are they teaching kids in school what clouds are now? I saw the sun screwed in like a lightbulb. It hasn't snowed and it is December. A lot of TV channels look fake now. Extra words and crap sometimes from my thoughts are in TV shows. God or whatever literally through my tv told me that life is about progression otherwise I might as well not be here. I was fine working and watching TV. There is a telepathic something on my forehead which I don't really want to use or care much about because it seems to be connected to highly manipulative dicks. This similar issue happened to me last year but I kind of ignored it. Now there are just way to many syncronicieteies in my life for it to be just a coincidence anymore. My TV and radio has a lot of harassment on it. Whatever it is likes to talk through stories and analologies and raidio. Some days I wish the whatever it is would just take me out of Time already like it did before and either put me back to 2020 or just that's it. If the world ended why the F am I still here? I now seem to live in a simulated reality or a highly manipulated one. It only took a short while for me to learn the government isn't really what I once thought it was nor are creation stories. I might get it to keep a good job I have because there is still money and I have a body and my whole life was taught to eat sleep take care of responsibilities etc but now don't know what its for really. I hope it would stop all the radio harassment and bring back media if I got the shot but the crap on my TV and radio lies so I don't know. Oh and I don't know what the Covid shot is for Any comments?"
"I think I have something Hi Idunno123, Welcome to psychforums... I hope you find the support you seek here, and I hope you feel better. I've found help through talking with a psychiatrist, treatment, and growing healthy coping skills. Granted it doesn't cure my illness, and my core trauma haunts me. When I'm not feeling well, I avoid tv, and other recorded programs because they are programming, and not helpful when dealing with illness. What helps is human connection, having conversations, talking. There are warm ear lines and NAMI has support groups, many communities have clubhouses, too. These are healthy options to pursue. I too work. Best wishes with getting the care you need! National Alliance on Mental Illness has a great booklet called Navigating a Mental Health Crisis. You can search for it on your browser, and it will help you find care in your community. Peace and hope you feel better soon - and find the care you deserve!

"I think I have something I found that my delusions when young stemmed from over trauma with no help. I attempted to fit in; I had to believe the people around me were on my side. When in reality I was a stranger to the world. I needed help and thought others could see this or were decent enough to see this; In reality; I Was not in a frame work for them to judge me correctly. I found myself at others homes thinking they were my saviors; when young; and they must have been sent to help me; God sent them; I needed to believe this. In reality; no one was sent from God in the direction I was heading. Looking back; I told myself that specific people; when up close; because of there behavior and the way they looked at me; I was right; they did like me, and thought they were on my side. And I created a giant narrative of such things. Later; all things fell through. I was brutally wrong. No one was my friend and those people were not who I thought they were. I was devastated. Later under therapy realizing I had been delusional the whole time I had to admit no evidence ever existed to even suggest I had been invited properly to meet these people; it was all in my head. I had taken strangers and tried to mold them into false relationships within my head. In reality; They were just strangers; and I was a quiet mentally ill person who kept showing up around without being invited. I assume they were just being polite and nice when in reality they were concerned and nervous about having me show up. They were scared. . I didn't know this was a specific disorder.

"delusional jealousy in Spouse?? Hello All , My husband as recently started accusing me of anal sex with our tenants and neighbors and sometimes says I am having threesomes and more with them. He told me that he has a video of me doing porn with a guy and when he called this mystery man confessed to him it was me and him that made the video together. I asked if I could see this video but for some reason he says I cant however he let me mother see it who said that she did not se anything to the effect he was talking about well i stopped talking to her and said she was on my side and she was taking up for me. I told him I didn't want sex and he just started to go off on me telling me I do not love him and I wish he was dead and I want to move my lover in because I want my lover more than I want him. I told him I think he needs to see a doctor...well why did I do that he said I would rather him in the hospital on meds rather than just tell him the name of my boyfriend or that I am cheating...and trying to deny or show him any proof of what he is saying is not true...… It's useless. He said I should leave him alone and go be with my lover and he gets very aggressive if I do not want to have sex with him. Oh and I have told the doctor what to say so they will be on my side and then he says I should go and have myself checked. We have been married 11years and this has just started back in April after his father died... Advise please...how can I get him to see a doctor?"
"delusional jealousy in Spouse?? Hello! You have my heartfelt sympathies for what you are going through. It’s so perplexing. You have done nothing to warrant his suspicions and accusations. Whatever you do, don’t ever take a lie detector test, or go to a mental health evaluation yourself. None of that will prove to your husband that you aren’t cheating on him. I’m husband has had the same behavior. At times it has been bad and at times it has gone away. He also had other odd beliefs: that his ex-wife was alive and following him (she died in 2006). After he went through chemo, his thought processes really took a hit. I don’t know if it was the stress of the cancer and chemo or the depression due to his changed condition or the chemo itself, but it got pretty bad. He started taking testosterone shots due to ED and this caused his jealousy and accusations to really escalate. Every time I left the house for an errand, to get my hair done or have lunch with my girlfriends, he thought I was meeting this guy and having sex with him. Life got pretty bad. Eventually we realized the T shots were a huge problem. After he stopped them his delusional behavior lessened dramatically. I don’t think it’s gone away completely. Is your husband on any medication that could be causing this? Keep trying to trouble shoot this!"

At least, that's my beliefs on it. I was a solid bundle of nerves the moment they strapped me into everything; and despite having a stellar interview beforehand, I didn't get the job.

delusional jealousy in Spouse?? Thanks everyone for your replies. So he told that he does not want to be around me. So I slept in the other bedroom and that seemed to cause an episode. So he said he wants to split up because he has everything I say to my lover on tape he has recording devices in the house. So am trying to find a job so I can get an apartment. Am really sad I just burst into tears. its emotionally draining and I really want to have hope he will see the truth.He says he wants me gone he is so mean to. It really hurts.

delusional jealousy in Spouse?? Sallysea I’m so sorry for what you are going through. I have been there. But you have done nothing to cause this. His brain is not functioning correctly. It’s heartbreaking to see someone in this state. Getting some distance could be very beneficial for you. Best Wishes.
delusional jealousy in Spouse?? Hello Everyone thought I would post and see if anyone has experienced this. My husband seems to be back to his old self. I told him I was leaving but it has been a good few days and I so want to believe he is back. Not sure what to do its almost our Anniversary. Is he really back to his old self or is this just a phase?
"delusional jealousy in Spouse?? I personally wouldn't believe anyone was back from that without some serious professional help of some sort- but glad to hear that he's backed off some. Your statement on leaving might have got his attention- I just hope it lasts... but if he's truly delusional, I'm not holding my breath. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"delusional jealousy in Spouse?? Sallysea, the few times I started packing things up (and when I moved all my clothes out of our closet into the spare room) my husband stopped making the accusations that I was having an affair, etc. I believed he still had the same thoughts, but he didn’t want me to leave. Even now, when his behavior has de-escalated (stopping testosterone shots helped immensely) I believe he persists in those aberrant thoughts. He just doesn’t talk about them. You can expect this to wax and wane but not to go away. I would continue to gently encourage him to get an evaluation and help."
"delusional jealousy in Spouse?? Hey everyone! Just an update, I think Snaga was right..his old self only lasted a few days. He says nothing is wrong with him and that I am cold and not person he thought I was. He is back to saying his strange delusions again. Hard place to be in. But I think it would be best to be apart so he can get some clarity."
"Wrote a letter to my husband’s doctor Day before yesterday was the pits. More paranoia from my husband, more bizarre thought processes, and the continued accusation that I’m having an affair with that poor guy Albert. As his anger grew, he kept screaming at me that he knew when I did it, and he was going to text Albert and call his wife, and go confront him and knock him on his ass. I told him I was tired of denying bs statements that were not real, and I’m done doing that. If he wants to text that guy, we’ll he should just do it. I just kept brushing off the horses and he kept coming out of the houses to yell at me. He was really unhinged. This is so sad. Last week he said he’d been feeling really tired, and asked if I was poisoning him! I told him that since I’d been on a diet, I haven’t even been cooking for him, and it looked like he remembered that was correct. Day before yesterday I again told him that his brain was playing tricks on him, and that he really needed help. He just yelled “you always want me to think that, but I know what’s going on.” So, I wrote a letter to his oncologist, a doctor he likes and trusts. I told him what has been going on, and frankly it’s been much worse since the chemo he had in 2018. Last year he was supposed to get an MRI of the brain because I asked him to please tell this doctor about his increased anger episodes. He did, and the doc ordered the MRI. But, because my husband’s allergies were so bad, he was unable to lie down and get it done. He tried twice. I asked the doctor to please make a neurological referral if he felt it was appropriate, and to please try to get that brain MRI done. I’m starting to suspect the onset of dementia or something like it, or frontotemporal deterioration, or something similar. But a neurological evaluation could only help at this point. Now I’m just waiting to see if his oncologist actually initiates anything. It felt like I was “ratting” on my husband and his bizarre behavior, but I’m at my wits end. This has to change or I’m leaving. And that would be horrible for my husband."
"Wrote a letter to my husband’s doctor Hi Aggie78, I just wanted to say, you made an important step, and if you're husband was well... he'd probably agree that the letter was necessary. Medical health declines can create brain health issues, as I recently learned while I had an infection and hypertension. I wish you and your family the best.

"Wrote a letter to my husband’s doctor Thank you Sunny. I’m still waiting for the other shoe to drop, as it were. I hope his oncologist calls him, and states some reason for ordering the brain MRI and a neurological referral. The oncologist is young, and from Pakistan. I don’t know what his familiarity is with older American men and their macho approach to “i’m all right, you are the one that’s messed up.”. Surely he has encountered this in his oncology practice. After all, many cancer patients are older, and also have some mental decline. I’m really just out of options to try to help my husband and try to save my marriage in the process. To be honest, I’m less concerned with the marriage than I am with him. Bizarre things happen daily, screaming and insults, etc. but I put up with it because I care for him and I believe he has something wrong that is causing this. Today, he couldn’t figure out how to get the ratchet binders loose so he could unload the tractor from the trailer (it was in the shop). I tried not to get involved, because I know nothing about ratchet chain binders. But he insisted and I tried to help. It ended as these usually do, with him finally saying I should just shut my f***ing mouth and do what he says. Well, darn it, I didn’t want to get involved in this in the first place! Then, he promptly forgets that he just insulted me, and acts like nothing’s wrong. Right now, he has gone to bed early as he usually does an dI am sitting here wondering if I should go back in the bedroom when I’m ready, or go to the spare bedroom. He now takes his phone with him into the bedroom, probably so I can’t see his odd sex texts."

"Wrote a letter to my husband’s doctor The day started out ok, but went to hell. We actually had a few good days, and my husband talked about how the chemo he had possibly could have changed his behavior. He said it would be a good idea to get an evaluation, and asked that I call and schedule. And that call was on my agenda today, before everything blew up. We had finished working outside, and I had told him I was going to get some weed killer to spray the weeds along the edges of the pasture we just baled. He said he didn’t want me to do that (he has reasons but they don’t make sense, so I won’t add to the story). Later in the house, he accused me of always being against him because I wanted to spray the weeds. He started yelling and accusing. It’s like some little seed starts in him and blossoms way out of proportion. I said “well, here we go” and grabbed my purse and took off to town. He immediately texted that he knew I was going to meet that poor guy, and his other usual hateful stuff. I went into town, did some errands, and had a lovely time shopping at Home Depot for a few things. I got home and headed back to my home office. About an hour later he barged in, yelling, accusing, demanding that we get a divorce. He hates me, despises me and how could I be such a slut as to have sex with XXXXX. I told him to get out. He kept screaming that he wants 50% of everything and he means 50%!! He kept screaming and yelling through the door. It was a little scary. So I spent the next 2 hours downloading the divorce forms and filling them out. They are ready to file in the District Court tomorrow. I’m not sure where I will go but I have to find a place, have to get this house sold, sell the horses and cattle, and all the equipment."
"Wrote a letter to my husband’s doctor Let us know if he acts as if that didn't happen. I've known- well not Delusional Disorder- but I mean I've known folks who would say they wanted divorce as a bluff, then were kinda surprised when they got exactly that. Hugs. Perhaps it's for the best.

"Wrote a letter to my husband’s doctor Yesterday I thought the best idea was just to move out, get my own place and start divorce proceedings. But I didn’t. I came back home, worked on the painting in my home office, cleaned out some closets for Goodwill and straightened up my bedroom and my office. Lots of work! I also looked at the financial implications of a divorce. We are fairly well off right now, with a farm and a house that’s close to paid off. If we were to divorce, sell the equipment for probably half what it’s worth, sell the cattle and horses, we would definitely have cash, but not enough for either of us to buy a place nearly as nice as this farm. I have money of my own that I inherited, and he has no separate assets. Just thinking of selling all this and starting over is painful. So, what if I just stay? If he wants to get a divorce, then let him go do all the paperwork, or find a lawyer to do it, and get it all underway. This morning, I got up and went out to do some errands: Goodwill, Home Depot and Walmart. When I got home he was out and I had time to keep cleaning, and then work in the orchard. He came home and asked if I was going to get fertilizer for the fields. I said why are you talking to this disgusting slut? If you want fertilizer go get fertilizer. He said he had to work on the borders (we irrigate tomorrow). I said I don’t care, do whatever you want to do. He kept asking me to do it. I told him I wasn’t going to do anything for someone who calls me a disgusting slut. He kept saying he couldn’t do both, and the fields need fertilizer (true). So I said from now on, we are just business partners; you have your life and I have mine, and I got in the truck to go get the fertilizer. When I was done with all that, I was filling water troughs and he came to talk to me. I didn’t talk to him at all. He started ridiculing me and again said how he knew what I was doing, etc., etc., escalation again. He was now screaming that he wanted a divorce. I said fine, go get one. He went into the house and I went back to the orchard. I spent an hour there and went in the house and showered, and now I’m on the front porch cooking chicken fajitas on the grill. I think he’s cooking in the kitchen. The point is that I’ve discovered a new resilience and a thicker skin. His screaming insults now have no effect. I wonder how he will take that. I’m no longer trying to save a marriage. I’m trying to save a human being from himself. Still no contact from his doctor though. Oh well, I truly am doing what I can. All the firearms have been removed or hidden, so no worries there."

I'm betting he either won't want to go start legal proceedings himself, or won't have a clue where to begin. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Wife with Delusional Disorder refuses treatment...help I'm not sure how this works but I will get right to the point. My wife had been experiencing some major paranoia since the 2020 election began, and she got caught up in the whole Q-Anon phenomenon. Since then she's had many delusions running through the whole Delusional Disorder spectrum (Grandiose, Jealous, Persecutory & Somatic). She's been in residential treatment twice (voluntarily) in the last two months, but each time she refuses treatment and medication. She thinks I am an enemy of the state and wants me to leave the house and leave my kids with her. Each day we are all walking on eggshells. It is obvious she's trying very hard to hide her symptoms and I am hurting because I can only imagine what's going on in her head, as are my kids. I do not know what to do...how to get her to seek help...and how to get her to accept medications. I would love to hear some suggestions or learn about how you were able to get your spouse/friend/family member to seek help. Thank you in advance!!"
"Wife with Delusional Disorder refuses treatment...help This last week since she came home has been difficult on the whole family. It's not that she is violent or having any obvious delusions that we know of, she's just living as if I weren't there. For example, she just throws my clean laundry in a pile, makes everyone else's dinner plates but not mine; not that I care but we used to do these things for each other and I still do. She contradicts everything I say to the kids even if it's not in their best interest, just to make me look like I am in the wrong; the kids can see through it and even question her about it. She just has nothing for me and it's hard not to take it personal, I know its the illness and she's probably dealing with what Dr. Xavier Amador calls anosognosia (the inability to realize you're sick). Every time I talk to the kids she stops and makes sure she can hear what I say, she believes I am turning them against her. She still wants me to leave the marriage, believing she will get full custody of the kids because I am at fault and I'm causing this mental anguish she is experiencing. This too is really affecting the kids. I have them in counseling but I don't know where to draw the line before I remove them from the situation because she is refusing treatment and wants to take the holistic, naturopathic route without the us of medicine. Everything I read says that this route doesn't work for Delusional Disorders. I know what the answer is but I wish I could speak to someone who's gone through this! getting a counselor in my area seems to be impossible as I get no call backs and when I do, no one is taking on new patients because of covid, go figure."
"Wife with Delusional Disorder refuses treatment...help Hello, and welcome to the forums! Ordinarily threads like this might be posted in Significant Others, but a lot do go ahead and get approved for here, since it seems so few people (we do have a few) with the disorder actually are aware enough (or possible just honest enough with themselves) to post here. Well it sounds as if she's found a new twist on the Silent Treatment, hasn't she? Despite my avatar, I'm bio male, and I been on the wrong end of that before- I sympathise. But ofc the big difference here is that it goes far beyond thinking your spouse is in the wrong. And she's caught up in political mess. We're not allowed to talk about politics directly, in PF- but as an accessory to what's going on, it's going to be next to impossible to not talk some about it. No matter which side of the political divide she's on, if she got caught up in that Q-anon stuff, well, my sympathies. I can well imagine- either on the one hand, you're hanging onto false hope from Q about how the damn cavalry is just around the corner to save us and the arrests are going to start at any time- or you're on the other side convinced a bunch of racists are about to stage a violent coup. Both are, in my eyes, equally delusional. I had to quit looking at social media because I couldn't sit on my hands any longer and wanted to start hollering at folks to just shut the hell up already. So, you're an enemy of... whatever her version of Freedom is. I really don't know how you can win that battle- it's hard enough among people who don't have DD. I'm just a mod here- well sometimes I think I borderline on having some mild delusion because of my OCD (which can occasionally stray into territory that's a bit 'out there'). But most of the stories I've read in the forums from spouses of DD, it doesn't seem to go well. Sort of like dealing with some of the personality disorders- I'm thinking OCPD in particular- they're the ones who are right, everyone else is doing it wrong and that's all there is to it- I used to have some Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (which is definitely different than OCD, the two are sometimes confused by people) traits at work- it was we must do it my way, or the world was going to ######6 end . And when you're down in that, you can't see it. There's just little to no self-awareness of it. And it's like my OCD rituals that I've had sometimes, that border on outright delusion. It's like part of me knows this is bullcrap, but.... but but but.... but at the same time, it's real and I must act on what I think will prevent what I am convinced will happen if I don't. I have to drive to work a certain route. I even have to listen to the 'right' music. I have to think the 'right' thoughts. And calamity will ensue if I don't. And I can write with intellectual honesty about it all day long in forum, but I'll go right back to acting that way, only stopping it with effort. Because when you're caught up in it, it's awfully hard to get out of it- and this is from someone that merely flirts with delusion- as far as I know . I mean, I know I already tend to it- would I know if I was seriously delusional? By the very nature of it... no of course I wouldn't. So it's probably one of the most uphill battles I have observed significant others with, here in PF. It seems to be hell on steroids to get someone to where they will admit that just maybe it's not everyone else, but it's them, and seeing a professional and taking some meds really is in their best interest. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Wife with Delusional Disorder refuses treatment...help I'll add I have a lot of respect and admiration for the folks with DD who DO post in this forum, even though they're caught up in it, they're... able to understand on some level 'hey I know this is wrong with me and I'm trying to counter it'.

"Wife with Delusional Disorder refuses treatment...help Hi KidKrysko, I’m so sorry you and your family are going through this. You are very wise to have the kids receiving counseling. Talking with their counselor about whether to move them out of the environment is probably a good idea. It does look like your wife is trying to force you to leave by treating you so badly. For the last 2 years, my husband’s delusions have gotten worse. When it gets bad, I tell him that his brain is playing tricks with him, and that what he believes is not real. I printed out his ex-wife’s obit, to counter his belief that she was alive and following him. I printed out articles on Delusional Disorder and the contact info for our insurance’s behavioral health clinic. I have done this a few times. The last time, I found that he actually saved the printouts! I was very encouraged that he might be starting to believe I have a better grasp on reality than he does. But all this has come with angry words, yelling, extreme discomfort in the relationship and much emotional distress. I can’t imagine doing all this with children involved. A discussion with the kids’ counselor about how to have honest conversations with your wife, when the kids are likely to overhear, might help. Unless your wife gets help, your marriage may not survive. Consider speaking with an attorney so you know your legal options in this situation."
"Wife with Delusional Disorder refuses treatment...help That is a tough situation but one that you can overcome. I left my spouse because of her delusions and, after a serious legal proceeding that is ongoing, got full custody of all of our kids. The environment you describe is very unhealthy for your kids. If your wife is unhealthy and you are staying with her, there is a very good chance that you also are unhealthy. Get a good lawyer and a good therapist and do whatever you need to do to protect your kids from further harm. Good luck."
Questions About Certain Behaviors that go with DDJ I have noticed that some of the spouses of DDJ sufferers have stated that their spouse uses drugs. There were also some that noted that their DDJ husbands were pushing for a threesome with another man. I am wondering how common those two behaviors are with DDJ men.
"Dualing with deClerambault Episode 1: A college crush that somehow finds a way to my dreams where it weaves a world for us to live in. A beautifully intoxicating home for every stray thought and hope and desire. A world that evolves and solidifies with every visit until I’m falling in love with my crush and the future I dream of. When the story threads dry up I create another world and another with different career paths, different friends, different locations but the same easy companionship and the same love. It isn’t long, however, before the dream world clashes with reality. I see her with a guy who couldn’t possibly be her boyfriend because he isn’t me, but of course I’m lying to myself and the dream world crashes down around me. With an extraordinary amount of resilience, the dream world picks itself up, dusts itself down and rebuilds itself. The foundations are now cracked but somehow I start to dream again, at least until the next reality check. I crash and burn over and over and the heartache is real. I’m losing my dream partner, after all. I leave college and try to put myself back together. Eventually, the heartache fades. I’d never had a mental illness before so I’m shaken that my reality was so distorted. I try to rationalize my experience and find a name for my episode, deClerambault’s Syndrome (DC). I discover all I can about my enemy, identify all the indicators and try to arm myself in case of further attacks (counterDC). Episode 2: I avoid any big DC encounters for years but my luck runs out with N. Some similarities with Ep 1. Crush that goes nowhere but hungrily devours my thoughts. DC is on one shoulder encouraging me whilst counterDC, on the other shoulder, is urging caution. DC distorts and counterDC over-corrects so it’s almost impossible to find my way to the true reality. Inevitably, I’m left broken and I promise myself that next time I start dreamweaving I’ll stay clear of possible dream partners so that I don’t feed my DC. Episode 3: Two years ago I see L for the fist time. I feel a strong attraction to her but no reciprocation. Second meeting is brief and uneventful. Third meeting is also brief but there’s some eye contact and it feels like something is brewing. Covid strikes and I don’t see much of her during the first lockdowns but then I start hearing her voice in my street. At the sound of L speaking my name DC wakes up from his long sleep and begins to weave his magic. The new dream-world begin to grow and deepen and demands more and more of my time. I should resist. I know where it’s taking me but its endless paths and possibilities are lighting my way through a dark lockdown. I lose myself to my dream L in my DC worlds. My dream-world has moved so far ahead of reality that the two worlds have started to jar, pushing me further and further down the rabbit hole. I hear L say she wants to spend the rest of her life with me and DC breaks free from his tether. He’s off. He’s flying like never before and he fills DC land with love and hope. Meanwhile counterDC is becoming increasingly uncomfortable. Something is off and it’s dawning on me that L’s affection for me is total and unconditional. She looks at me with pure uncontrolled adoration and I know now that she’s going through her own DC episode. She calls me the man of her dreams and this says it all. She’s lost in her own DC worlds and I’m sensing no grounding, no counterDC. I guess this is her first episode and her family and friends don’t know the warning indicators. They seem oblivious to her behaviour, to the signs that are obvious to me. I should reach out to them but I’m more ill than I’ve ever been before and in the back of my mind I’m aware that during an episode you can invert everything and believe that the person you’re infatuated with is in fact infatuated with you. Knowing this further destabilises my grasp of reality. My DC and counterDC have never been more polarized. They’re fully at war with each other and it’s ripping me apart. My avoidance strategy is no use here. She’s living almost next door to me. I hear her through every window and she always seems to be there when I go out. She tries to connect with me but her spoken messages never fully reach me. I’m left with fragments that are too easily distorted by either side in their war. I start sensing anger and some bitterness towards me. Maybe she expects me to meet her half way but her beautiful face is the face of my next breakdown. I’m in love with by DC L and she’s in love with her DC me and it’s clear to me how impossible this is. I can never compete with a dream. I can see that each failed message she tries to give me is tearing her apart and her pain, in turn, is tearing me apart. I know how hard it is to connect at this stage. You believe that your future and all your incredible dreams depend on this one moment and the pressure is unbearable. It’s taking its toll on L. Soon I hear that she’s moving out and a door in my dreams slams shut. She delays leaving, giving me hope, but eventually she packs up all my hopes and dreams and takes them with her when she leaves. So here I am, broken, full of pain and regret and deClerambault has beaten me again. I don’t know where L is and how her battle with DC is going and letting go of that is going to be the hardest part for me. I hope you’ll excuse such a long post but I felt that I needed to share it somewhere. I’d be grateful for any advice. Thanks TD"

Erotomania isn't unknown in this forum- I'm not much of one to be commenting on it, however- other than I used to be given to enthusiastic infatuation accompanied by a lot of fantasizing.

"Another day, another delusion Hello all: Another stressful day today, irrigating the farm. Up at 3 a.m. my husband did not catch the voice mail from the irrigation manager yesterday, saying we might not get to irrigate today. So he stressed about that and was angry “why didn’t he keep calling until he got a hold of me.” I just say “I don’t know” to most of what he asks. Why didn’t my husband actually check his phone during the day to see if the irrigation manger had any updates. Taking care of details just isn’t his thing. So we do actually have enough water to irrigate, and he gets started. Water going everywhere, and as usual he leaves it on WAY too long so we have a flood. As we were walking through the back cow pens, I point out that the water in the drain ditch looks like it;s going to overflow into the cow pen. I might as well have hit him. He blew up and said I was always criticizing him, etc. etc. the usual yelling and screaming. He left and went into the house and later to check the water. I finished my work outside and then left for town to do some errands. He texts me, saying “I bet I know where you’re going”. Implying I’m running off to have sex with Albert. It’s where his mind always goes. I feel sorry for poor Albert who has no idea my husband has this bizarre idea about him. Can someone please explain why he has a one-way thought process on this???? Frankly I am so turned off about sex because he’s focused on it, and he uses it as a weapon. We haven’t even tried to have sex in months. He does have ED and says he needs to fantasize to “encourage” him. I’ve told him I don’t want to hear all that crazy stuff, but what he does in his own head is his business. So I get home hours later and he acts like nothing’s wrong. I’m so done with this charade. Is this any way to live? I’m not really expecting an answer, just hoping that writing it down makes me feel better."

Writing can be very helpful, if nothing else just to get it out. Perhaps you'd like to start a blog in that case? blog/Aggie78/ Alternatively, we have the Journal Threads: online-journals/ The difference in them is you need to ask a mod first who'll start a journal thread for you, whereas a person can start their blog without prior notice; also in the journals, you can specify whether you want replies, or not. Occasionally someone will want to journal without people replying back to them. However, both the open-forum journals, and the blogs, are always moderated before being published- including replies. So inappropriate replies will always get intercepted in either event. A blog or journal thread gives a person the freedom to talk about whatever they want whether it's on topic or not- and the blogs in particular, I'm the mod who usually approves those posts and I'll cut folks a little slack with content, as long as they're not grossly abusing the forum rules on content. We have a venting forum for people with the serious need to screed, but those are locked by the mod team and don't allow replies whatsoever- they're more of a one-off thing, rather than keeping a running stream of thought like a blog or journal post. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Delusional Disorder and break-ups Hi, I’m new to this forum- my bf of 7 years left our shared home in March after accusing me of some pretty strange things. He didn’t recognize a shirt in his closet and told me that I put it there either because of my infidelity and/or because I might be in a cult (neither is the case). He had a whole elaborate set of stories and connections to explain his paranoia. To note-he had episodes of psychosis and hospitalization in his early 20s, but never a formal SZ diagnosis. We’ve had two other episodes together- always stemming from him thinking I’m trying to give him signals that I am in a cult (a satanic one?). Otherwise the relationship was loving, communicative and strong. He is in his late 40s. He left the day of “the shirt,” saying that he needed to know whether he was going “crazy” again (he has limited insight into his early psychosis), or if being with me is the problem. He did talk about signs from god as well, and is retreating to religion very quickly. He communicates occasionally if I lead, and has so far been willing to deal with the legal/mortgage issues of our shared home, but he says he wants nothing to do with me. He hasn’t really expressed any concern for my well-being. He does not want to pursue therapy individually or together. He is almost unrecognizable when we talk-both in tone and just something different in his face and body language. He is still working, and his friends say he seems sad but ok. He has been vague about his reasons for leaving when they ask. My questions aif he doesn’t want me around, at what point do I just give up and leave him alone? How do I process what happened without a formal diagnosis? Could I be wrong and he is just fine? Does DD really just come out of the blue like that? He seemed fine the day before, we were making plans for a vacation. Is there anything else I can do for him? Will he get worse? Is it ok to be angry? Thanks, this has been a rough 2 months."
"Delusional Disorder and break-ups Hello, and welcome to the forums! I think unless someone wants to get help, it might be some time to see if it settles down? And as for being angry, I think that's only human. You understand it's an illness, but still, it's got to make a person angry. If you need to let some of that out, I'd suggest Significant Others, Family & Friends as a place to vent- and if you really, really need to vent, we have a Venting forum in the Off Topic section, I think it is. You have to also think about your mental well-being through this. As for it coming 'out of the blue', it isn't really. I mean if he's had a history of it. Perhaps you've been lucky that he went as long as he did. But then, things have been kind of rough on everyone for a little over a year, now. I'm OCD- I'm not DD (that I know of)- I know I get mighty close to delusional beliefs on occasion, and stress flares my OCD up sometimes. Has work been extra stressful for him, or anything else- as if 2020 hadn't been enough to drive half the planet mad. I think if I were in your shoes I'd contact him on a limited basis but unless you can involuntarily get him into some help, he's going to have to want it... maybe if you just be like fine we won't talk, he'll remember he had a relationship and start to miss it. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Here we go again; DD husband My husband has Delusional Disorder that comes and goes. If it was present all the time it would be easier to leave him. I guess it’s a little bit present all the time (believing he has an intuitive ability that lets him know what people are thinking, even with zero clues/facts). He quickly interprets the smallest of actions to mean something much greater. His jumps in reasoning don’t make sense. But there it is. Then, there are the really big delusions that pop up every year or so. The last one was a few years ago when he was sure his ex-wife was following him. She’s been dead since 2006 but I had not shared that with him when I learned it. He said she had been following him, and her State Police boyfriend was also following him and he had called the State Police complaining. At that time, I printed out the ex’s obituary, and some articles on Delusional Disorder. I told him his brain was playing tricks on him and recommended he call the Behavior Health clinic for our insurance. He kept insisting the ex was alive and didn’t believe the obit. I told him that his refusal to believe the obit is a classic sign of DD. After that, things calmed down but were very uncomfortable. Over the last year he has become convinced I’m having an affair with the guy that runs the local John Deere dealership! Albert. I don’t even care for the guy. But he’s convinced that every time I leave the house I must be sneaking away to have sex with him. Two days ago this really blew up. I had gone into town to meet my step-sister regarding my step-mom’s probate. He knew I had this meeting set up. When I got back home he started accusing me of seeing Albert again. I had had enough!!! I told him “all you think about is sex and Albert, sex and Albert! Well why don’t you just go have sex with him? You are mentally ill with your Delusions and I’m not going to pussy foot around them anymore. I’m going to call them out and shove them in your face every time you mention them!!! Ugly screaming after that. I went back in the house and again printed out articles on Delusional Disorder and the phone number for behavioral health. We slept in different rooms for a few days. I left those articles on his place at the table. Of course they disappeared, but this is how I’m going to handle this from now on. I’m going to mention his delusions every time he engages in them. I think he likes having delusions. Life is so much more exciting the way his brain interprets it. And if he doesn’t like me confronting him with the truth, oh well. It’s the only way I can stay married to him."
"Here we go again; DD husband Hello, and welcome to the forums! Do you want to stay married to him, if he won't get help? **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"Here we go again; DD husband Yes, I would stay married to him even if he does not get help. We are both in our 60s. I don’t do well living alone, and he would be a wreck. I still care for him. Going through a divorce would be worse than what’s going on right now. I just need a way to effectively cope/handle these occasional bizarre delusions. If he know he’s going to get the “you need help” talk, along with printouts, every time he talks about these delusions, 3 things are likely to happen: 1. He actually goes and gets help (unlikely). 2. He stops telling me about his delusions (likely). 3. Maybe he will come to trust my assessment that his delusions are not real(possible). At least I feel better with this method. I’m being honest, I’m not encouraging his delusions. I think there is a volitional component to these delusions: he gets some kind of rush or thrill thinking about it. He has always wanted to do strange sex stuff with another man in the mix, and I think he gets excited imagining that I am having sex with another man. I don’t get it, it will never happen, and I’ve told him that repeatedly. But he’s stuck on the idea and this delusion feeds this fantasy. I just have to kill that goal of his."
"Here we go again; DD husband Interesting. By 'another man in the mix', are you willing to be slightly more specific? It's not out of salacious curiosity, it's that older men, I have noticed, sometimes want to play with the other team a bit, so to speak. I won't waste time expanding on that if that's not what you mean, but it's something to consider. And it's not... completely uncommon. Sixties is... getting on up there- I'm sliding towards 60 but not there yet. But I can understand now why a divorce would be rough. You don't think this could be something with an early onset, do you? My dad is around 80 and... not sure what he has, but he gets some pretty crazy ideas in his head. At times I've thought maybe Alzheimer's, or even late-onset schizophrenia- which is very uncommon I think, but does occasionally happen. How long has he had these delusions on and off? Just in the sixth decade? Before? The whole time you've been together? I'm OCD- Obsessive Compulsive Disorder- not as bad as some I can think of (on these forums) but has he a history of being prone to fears which lead to compulsive behaviors? OCD isn't all about like, germs or things being neat and orderly, in everyone- or even most- but people with OCD will have unreasonable fears. Which lead to compulsions to 'ward off' the feared thing, so to speak. I ask about a history of OCD style anxiety, because for some people with OCD, it can get uncomfortably close to delusion. I've... kinda flirted with delusion a time or two- it's very hard to unseat some beliefs I will get. Even though intellectually I understand it's irrational. Also sometimes OCD is a precursor to schizophrenia- but as that disorder usually hits in ones' twenties, that seems unlikely, here. Just throwing out ideas. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"Here we go again; DD husband Hi Snaga; Here’s a more complete history. The delusions have been getting worse in the last few years. He also now has some OCD (hand wringing, fretting with no clear purpose or trigger). I have considered early onset dementia or Alzheimer’s due to this worsening in the last few years. In mid 2018 he was DX with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and had to go through chemo and a stem cell transplant. All that chemo did a number on him. He now has benign essential tremor of his hands, which he has never commented on but it’s obvious to me. Last year when he was having bursts of anger I asked him to tell that to his oncologist, and see if there was something going on his brain. The oncologist ordered an MRI. He tried twice to have it, but was unable to because his sinuses made it impossible to lay flat that long. After 2 tries he abandoned it. I do think he has something going on in his brain, which may or may not show up on MRI. I’ve asked him many times to “get this checked out” when he has outrageous anger or a delusion that’s really nuts. He won’t do it. Oh, and the sex thing? He’s always wanted a threesome, for whatever reason. He knows I’m not interested. He says he wants me to have sex with other men and he would watch. Sorry, not interested. Early in our marriage it was just irrational anger that was the problem, but I think it was based on delusions that he wouldn’t mention to me. In the last few years it’s worse. The anger comes and goes, as do the delusions. The delusions are worse, the OCD behaviors are present, he has trouble processing information at times unless he is really concentrating. I do think a mental decline is part of this. So until or unless he decides to get evaluated by a neurologist, get an MRI and have this professional evaluated, I am stuck with coping the best way I can. Thanks for listening."
"Here we go again; DD husband AND we were off and running again today. Very busy day on the farm, irrigating for the first time this year. We irrigate out of canals from the river, and it’s always tough to know when you’ve put enough water on the fields, and to cut it off. Mid-morning, he asks me to get in the truck with him and run down to the ditch. I get in and heat is blasting from the vents. It’s already warm outside, and we should have had AC. I said, is the AC on? (because I had driven the truck last and probably had the heat on). He instantly blew up, saying I was always nagging him and didn’t I think he knew enough to turn on the AC. Screaming and yelling at me, calling me names as always. I opened the door, he stopped the truck and I got out. This must happen once a week. I went in the house and did some work on the computer. He comes stomping in to the office, asking me if I’m done helping him. I said I just had to get out of the truck. He told me he was going to check the water, then come back in the house and take me up to the ditch if we needed to adjust the valves. He left. I finished what I was doing, then walked all the way up to the ditch to be ready when he wanted to switch. After a half hour or so, he drove up on top of the ditch, and said he was turning one valve on all the way “here it comes!” He yelled. Then he drove over to shut the valve on the north 12 acre piece. I took all that to mean that I was to adjust the valve where I was, to route more of the water to the 7 acre piece, and less to the 3. So I did that. It looked like the 3 acre piece was about done, and the water already in the field would get to the end. Then he drove to where I was, screaming “what are you doing, that field isn’t done!!” Turn that water back in the 3 acres. He kept screaming ‘you never listen!” All you think about is having sex with Albert. So we are back to Albert again. I told him why don’t you have sex with Albert, you think about him so much. Then I turned around and walked all the way back to the house. Gathered up a few things, got in the car and went to town to do errands. Before I left, I put a note at his place on the table ‘GET HELP. YOU HAVE DELUSIONAL DISORDER. YOU ARE MENTALLY ILL’ i come back a few hours later and he has completely flooded the cow pens. I mean, the cows are searching for a dry place to stand. What a wreck. So that 3 acre piece wasn’t finished watering, huh? Oh, and the AC is not working in the truck. I don[t even care. He can get it fixed if he wants to. It will be a cold day in hell before I get back in that truck with him. *mod edit* Last edited by Snaga on Fri Apr 02, 2021 4:03 pm, edited 1 time in total.

"Here we go again; DD husband That is good news . I know it's incredibly hard to live with but your husband has little or no control over these thoughts . Does he have non-delusional periods ? Has he ever acknowledged that he doesn't know why these thoughts occur to him ? Have you talked to a professional about his disorder ? You might find some good coping techniques , either from a therapist who specializes in Delusional Disorder or from a support group for families ."
"Here we go again; DD husband Hi NewSunRising; Yes, I have spoken about this to a psychologist friend of mine. She suggested that he have a full neurological work up, and go from there. Great advice, but difficult to accomplish. I tried to get it done within the context of his chemo treatment and aftermath, but he could not complete that MRI. During his delusional episodes, I admit that I get as loud and angry as he is behaving, and that’s not a good context for the “you need help” discussion. The one benefit of my reaction is that it has seriously reduced the frequency of his delusions. Leading me to believe there is at least a small volitional component. Either that, or the new consequence of his delusional behavior (me behaving angry, mean) is so distasteful to him that it modifies his behavior and he doesn’t mention his delusions. Regardless, if I am actually going to get him evaluated, I need to react more lovingly the next time this comes up. As far as my coping mechanisms, I used to just clam up or leave the house, which was effective for me escaping it, but did nothing to stop or reduce the delusions. It was no help to him either. My current method (yelling right back at him, angrily screaming you need help) has reduced the incidents, but still not really effective for an overall solution. Tomorrow we are irrigating the farm again. High stress leads to his delusional outbursts every time, so I need to be prepared. When it happens tomorrow, I will respond in a calm, direct manner, and try to lovingly tell him that he needs help. Wish me luck!"
"Here we go again; DD husband What an awful day. It was so busy. I had several professional appointments (9 a.m. and a:30 pm) that I had to keep no matter what, but they were via zoom so I didn’t have to leave the house. Then, some people who had asked about buying some cows last week called this morning asking if they could arrive at 9:30. I told them this was fine. But no, it wan’t fine with hubby. He got really angry because we had to go out and sort off the two cows they wanted, and that meant he had to get up from the tv. Sorry buddy, but cow sales is part of what we do. So we are going back to the cow pens to get them, and he starts yelling”why did you tell them 9;30 was ok? It’s not!!” Well, they were already in the truck driving from 2 hours away, and I told him that. What was I supposed to do, tell them to go back to the house and wait a few hours?? Sure way to blow up a sale, and we do need sales for income. That answer didn’t sit well with him. We started sorting the cows, and cows will be cows. They don’t go where you want them to, and can be unpredictable. In the middle of this, when I am having trouble getting 2 out of a pen, he starts laughing at me and ridiculing me, not in a nice way. He was very very mean “you are so dumb, you are terrible at this” he says. I told him why can’t you be a partner in this, instead of being an adversary? He continues to laugh and ridicule. Then I told him I wish I had never married him because he had one goal in life: to make me miserable. Well that stopped the ridiculing and all conversation, but it was definitely an escalation of the conflict. So much for responding to him with love today. That was impossible. The buyers arrived, we did what had to be done (branding, etc.) while he continued to mutter at me under his breath when no one else could hear. Finally they were gone and we were back to the Cold War. He went to get the fertilizer to put on the fields while I had to take down some electric fence. He got the truck stuck, and rather than ask me for help, he walked ALL the way back to the yard, and got the tractor to pull his truck out. I asked “do you need any help?” And he did not reply. Fine. We continued the Cold War all afternoon, ate separately, and he has just now come out of the bedroom asking if I want to watch a movie with him. What the hell do I do with all this."
"How can i talk to my parents about my erotomania? I've been dealing with erotomania since I was 8, but never knew why I felt and thought this way, until this year when I learned about erotomania, I finally understood why I was this way. Now, I've never acted on my false beliefs, never stalked anybody or try to reach to the person I'm obsessed with at the moment. But I always end up suffering a lot because of it, I cannot help but think they are watching me, judging me, I feel so vulnerable and ashamed, there's no escape for me, it got to the point of me making a plan on how I was gonna kill myself and when, in order to make this all stop. I need help, I kept this a secret, nobody knows about this. I've thinking about reaching out to my mother, but what if she doesn't react well, I still have to live with her (I'm a teenager). How can I tell her??? I'm not ready to tell my father yet, he's scary (to talk to about this stuff or any where you have a different opinion to his). (My parents are caring, I'm just terrified things will go wrong, example: they don't understand and freak out.) (I forgot to add something about my intrusive thoughts, religious intrusive thoughts, they are horrible, debilitating and make everything ×10 times worse) Thanks in advance to anybody who cares to answer.

"How can i talk to my parents about my erotomania? Hello, and welcome to the forums! Please check your PM inbox. Now then, I have approved this for delusional disorder, as you placed it- but I was interested by this: Hiddenrubbishi wrote: (I forgot to add something about my intrusive thoughts, religious intrusive thoughts, they are horrible, debilitating and make everything ×10 times worse) That sounds rather Obsessive-Compulsive. Not diagnosing you- I can't do that, but as the OCD moderator (and a person with OCD) that... smells like OCD. First off I don't think you really want to, but if you seriously feel as if you'll hurt yourself, tell your parents immediately- get help! That out of the way, when you say you get erotomania- you seem pretty aware of it. How long does it remain aimed at one person? There's a fine line between OCD and delusional thoughts, sometimes- a blurry, fine line. That's sometimes crossed, just a little- I've nearly done it more than once. I'm just wanting a feel for if this is really erotomania, or OCD gone wild. As far as the religious thoughts, that is a... common OCD theme. Fears of things like The Unforgivable Sin and going to Hell, etc. I've.. been there, done that when I was a preteen. Add to that harm-related OCD intrusive thoughts (of doing bad things to others, which I still get, some decades later), and I often thought, as a child, that I was on the cusp of demonic possession, or something. I remember... many evenings of being calm on the outside, my mother none-the-wiser, while inside I felt as if I were going insane, worrying myself to death that I was going to do something horrible to myself, or others, or do something that automatically and irrevocably doomed me to Hell (when in truth, if anything sends me there, it's likely to be my potty-mouth, meh).

"How can i talk to my parents about my erotomania? Also... I would... think about telling my parents I was struggling, and ask if you could possibly see someone. If that's too hard to do, perhaps asking someone at school? A school counselor, perhaps? I wish I'd had help, when I was young- I might have been spared a lot of unnecessary angst and self-torture. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"How can i talk to my parents about my erotomania? I didn't realize it sounded that similar to OCD, it never even crossed my mind. If i tell a teacher, they will absolutely tell my mother (she works with them, not as a teacher though), it's better if I tell her myself. These days I been thinking really hard how will the conversation go, if I should just say I need to see a professional because I could really harm myself or should I say the whole true, including the possible erotomania. Tbh, I really don't want to die, I have the things and time to do it, but it's hard giving up now, I'm too deep into life to quit now. Also the idea of an afterlife terrifies me to no end. When i'm out of it i can tell pretty easily reality from my thoughts, but once it started again, it gets really blurry, I try to remain logical to not embarrass myself. I know it got bad when I can't lay on my stomach because I'm scared somebody will appear and touch me. About the lengths of the obsession, they usually last around a year, I go from enjoying, to obsessed, to avoiding, before finally coming out the other end. I did know intrusive thoughts are common with OCD, and I do fear that my thoughts turn out to be unforgivable, that's the main reason why I wanna disappear. Tysm for answering."
"How can i talk to my parents about my erotomania? I'm glad to see you don't really want to die- I didn't think you did. That is... a very commonly voiced thing in the OCD forum. When anxiety spikes. I think we just want to run from our anxiety, because I don't know of anyone from the OCD forum that's made a serious attempt. I include myself in that- I'm not being flippant about pwOCD, I'm no different. It's a rare week I don't think about suicide at least once, in connection with anxiety. I..... don't worry about it too much, if I was really going to I'd have done it a long time ago, and I'm not young and have had OCD a really long time. Yes there are a lot of OCD feels to this thread, and I think if you could manage to see a professional that would be really good. I know like, the laying on your stomach thing, sometimes pwOCD can have some pretty strange beliefs that border on magical thinking. 'If I think these thoughts something bad will happen to my family', or 'if I don't get rid of these things that give me pleasure (often personal items) then this will happen. For me, often I would have to go to work using the 'right' route, and listen to the 'right' music, in the hopes that it would make the shift go well. Or I'd have to pray, and pray certain things in a certain order, and be very specific- almost like an ersatz rosary. If you lay on your stomach, someone will appear and touch you? Sure why not, I can dig it. We can... create some very interesting scenarios in our head, when we let it run away with us. I'm not saying it's OCD- it might be something delusional- all I know, is that I feel as if I've gotten really, really close to delusion. It used to be said, that pwOCD always know their beliefs/obsessions, are irrational, and they do not actually get delusional. That thinking has.. been modified, to sometimes a person with OCD can get yeah a wee bit delusional- while still only having OCD. From what I've read, anyway. For an anxiety disorder, OCD sure does love to flirt with psychotic disorder symptoms, that's for sure. I have extended family history of some nice little psychotic disorders, so... yeah sometimes I distractedly wonder if I'm going to go off the rails- but I haven't yet. And neither have you- you understand these obsessions for people are just that, and acc'd to you, you don't act on them. I used to be easily infatuated (still am, a little, but tempered by age), and I have OCD. When I would fall 'in love', I mean, really in love- I would be... more than a little crazy in the head. Not like bad stalky or anything but I mean I remember having some really strong obsessions and I would be happy one moment and cry the other. Yes by all means I really think you should see a professional- it seems to me that besides/instead of erotomania, this could be explained by one or more other things. I mean there's OCD elements to your story, there's even maybe some Borderline elements. I... have traits from a little of this and a little of that, and you don't seem so much a stranger to some of the places my own brain has gone. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"How can i talk to my parents about my erotomania? I'll keep this thread in mind when I eventually go see a professional. I really appreciate that you took time of your life to care and answer my post. At first I was just gonna vent, wasn't expecting anyone to look into it. It's nice feeling valid and like somebody cares every now and then."
"How can i talk to my parents about my erotomania? Hello, friend I've been struggling with Erotomania since I was around 9. I still suffer with it and it has been for several years for the same person. I'm a teenager, by the way.. I only found out last year (2020) when I got into some trouble with them, that I have erotomania. But, of course I just see this as a label. It's not an easy thing to grasp that your whole life is a lie. I've lost everything to it. It has ruined my life and ability to live a full and fulfilling life. My advice to you is to not tell your parents, but rather someone else who is close to you. I can't think of any set of parents who would react kindly to that. Mine certainly didn't. But, if you really want to tell your parents, bring it up in a conversation, like ""Have you heard of Erotomania?"" Or ""What do you think of Erotomaniac?"" Their responses will give you a good indication of what to expect. Much love to you. <3"
"How can i talk to my parents about my erotomania? im 22 turning 23 and was suffering with this severely last year so take this with a grain of salt. I swore my neighbors were infatuated with me and would wait for me to leave my house and I thought they'd set up ways so they could watch me and eventually I got into an argument with a dude who lived there, this all sounds weird as ###$ but just hear me out, after this argument my delusions were in full throttle but eventually they ###$ moved....the argument was bad and I kept antagonizing the man. I feel so guilty but my feelings since they left have vanished I don't feel the same with the new people that came. I still think of the people sometimes but I was relieved when they left my symptoms have subsided -- Mon Apr 12, 2021 4:37 pm -- Will your parents understand? If u think they would it's always great to have that support and it's up to you to decide If you cant live without ur parents complete understanding of u and I think u could.

"Letters never sent. Tonight I found myself skipping the inspirational meeting and writing instead. The mic for the event came through my speakers with a repetition, an echo. Instead of bearing with the echo on my monitor, I wrote a letter to the physician instead. I wish we could talk. The nights I don’t have a distraction these past weeks, months, and even years, I lay there and cry. Especially the past two weeks, it lasts for 30 minutes to an hour until I fall asleep. I try working so hard I'm tired, but in some ways it's worse. I wish I had been able to heal my situation with my daughter’s father (my ex) or find another lover who could love me. Cognitively, I understand. I’ve only brought you pain. You’ll never be able to love me. I get it, but my heart doesn’t understand. I’m feeling sad about this. Fifteen years hasn’t made it stop bleeding with tears and heartache. I’ve realized a few things. I’m not exactly a prize, I mean I am amazing, but not traditional. And second, nobody else touches that brokenness the way you did. I don’t know what to do. Abandon it? Give it more time? Keep letting it bleed out tears? I am tired of feeling this way. It’s been too long. Then I imagine your playlist is for me. That helps until reality reminds me there is only silence between us. Reality stings. Playing with the broken bit increases the intense longing. So I try to quit. Writing this, I hear the blood pounds in my ears, and the tears drip on the page. Then the calm self-regulation comes back. I’m okay, but wow. Why does it feel so intense? It’s been almost 16 years. Sometimes when it hits me at work, I wonder if you ever have to close the door and ground. If only they hadn’t made a mistake in the office and scheduled my daughter’s father with you. If only… Wishful thinking isn’t helpful. What helps? 1. My delusional hope – I imagine sitting on a dock with you talking like it’s the 90’s, and nobody is trying to reach us with cell service to redirect this line of thinking. I tear up, and my chin quivers thinking about it. I want to love and feel loved. Yeah, gush, tears, longing. That is my dream that someday, something will let us reconcile that exam, and I can reintegrate that part, and heal whatever I may have hurt in you. 2. My hope based in reality – I believe that with a good moral man in my life, I hope that someday I may heal. The problem is that: a. Good Moral types are usually paired. b. They rarely know what to make of my extremely flawed dramatic story. c. I’m not sure I’m consistent enough for one of them. d. But that is my reality based hope. 3. Other’s hope for me – I believe other’s are correct, that you aren’t the only way forward. 4. But, seriously, I wonder if we both would benefit from a conversation. It’s just that you might be the only way to align that part. Who the heck knows what I broke in you. Maybe I hurt you too. I function; it is just that the hurt part doesn’t stay well. I feel anxious about the spiritual connection I feel. That bit that thinks it bonded to you at that moment and pulls energy from it. I don’t know how else to explain the feeling. I lay there and feel what I wonder you’re feeling. I cry so hard when you feel empty or disconnected. Then I feel foolish for thinking I have any real connection, and it just hurts. Without distractions, I struggle. ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Letters never sent. What helps: I was thinking about what I want to say. When I imagine talking, it is comforting. Things I want to sha• My gratitude for my day. • My latest & greatest update from the week by phone. • About those moments that were hard to endure. The times when I can’t breathe or struggle to lift back to hope, and I sink into despair. If it weren’t for my daughter, I might not keep on keeping on. I’m struggling to imagine my future, especially when she leaves for college. When I feel like giving up, quitting work, and giving in to disability, I envision a part that argues for being persistent. The function tells me, “But, you don’t know how this will end.” It helps pull me back towards hope. I was praying the other night when that broken bit encouraged me to keep waiting. I laughed through tears because I’ve been waiting to experience love for what feels like an eternity. So I asked, what did I do to have to endure this? If I could break free from this mess, I would have eons ago. I can’t help but think there is going to be an exciting and fantastic ending. I’m open to options #1, #2, #3, or #4. Heck, I’m open to anything hopeful if it means I get to feel better. ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"The severity of your Delusional Disorder Hey There, Folks .. I've been rediagnosed with Delusional Disorder, Persecutory type from Schizophrenia. I was wondering about severity and insight with this condition. I see and hear a great many things that all point toward my doom but I have the ability to sit on the fence, so to speak. All these things feel real and I'm sure they're engineered to warn me but the intensity comes and goes. Stress is a huge trigger. I have a good friend that tells me, ""you can't trust what you think"" .. my friends thought I had something slipped into my drink and I've never been the same since. I was wondering if anyone reading this has this condition but is still able to test the veracity of your perceived reality. Feelings overpower logic so I'm lost in the middle somewhere .. Thanks."
"The severity of your Delusional Disorder Hi Riffrob, Welcome to psychforums... Hope you find the support you seek here as I have over the years. My symptoms of psychosis were ""encapsulated"" too for most of the time. It's when my sleep gets disturbed, hormones, stress, isolation, etc builds up that I get sick... Or if I fall off my medicine. I find the medication helps reduce the symptoms for me, but the memory of the false thinking haunts me. Especially memories formed at my most vulnerable states that went untreated in the postpartum for some time. I never was able to have a conversation with the physician whose touch I couldn't make sense of. Anyway, 15 years later I struggle with unrequited love... Call it erotomania, but it's lost it's mania and it isn't erotic, it sucks. It was the most profound attraction of my life. Anyway, this is about you, not me. I hope you are able to talk through the questions you have in safe ways. If you have insight, then you may find ways to reality test. Find and talk with people you can trust. Thankfully for you, the stigma is less than it was 10 or 20 years ago. Trusting my family, friends, and colleagues was always my greatest strength. They mostly wish I wasn't sick, and my family's afraid the physician would sue me if I tried to have a conversation... He's never responded to my emails. So I don't send them anymore. I write here instead... Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"The severity of your Delusional Disorder That was wonderful of you share that, Sunny. I can only imagine what you must be going through. I've read numerous stories about erotomania and it must be incredibly difficult to manage. Mine's been persecutory for maybe 10 years now .. I get all the tell-tale signs, people telling me 'you can't trust what you think' and 'it not out THERE' kind of stuff. He always tells me to have faith so what I've decided to do is to do battle with my waking nightmare. In a way, of sorts, but it's like pushing through a waking dream and building up my confidence and coping skills to manage my emotions so that I don't lose control."
"DDD Hubby Hi everyone, this is Goodwife. Last time I had posted, it was years and years ago. My husband still has delusional disorder persecution type. He has been on and off meds, in and out mental hospitals. I am drained and feel empty. I really don't know what else to write. 17 1/2 years of this $#%^."
"DDD Hubby Sorry to hear about your ongoing woes Goodwife. I'm relatively new to this forum but have been loitering (with an occasional post here and there) as a result of my husband suffering from delusional disorder - jealous type. I have a question for you. After 17 years of this, do you wish you'd left early on?"
"DDD Hubby Yes. I do. I learned that no body gets ""cured"" of DD. It can be suppressed for periods. But it will always come back. And it gets worse with age. In my case, every time it came back, it caused a major change in our lives. In one episode, he stopped going to to his job, and never went back, and I mean never. Didn't even clean up his office. Hasn't worked since. Now he stopped socializing with friends. That's it, one day no more friends. The problem is I became a frog being slowly being heated in a pot. If all of these happened at once, I would have left. But I worked, so no big deal if he stopped working. I drove, so I can drive him around, no problem. I have friends, so what he doesn't come with me anywhere to socialize with them. I am sorry if this is too pessimistic. This is my truth."
"DDD Hubby Hi Goodwife. I’m in the same boat, but it seems to have subsided right now. Hubby has always been a bit suspicious, tended to “over-imagine” and over interpret peoples words and actions. He has always had trouble getting along with people in the workplace, and quit his last job after getting into a fistfight. That’s the 3rd job he lost like that. He hasn’t worked in at least 10 years, but finally hit 62 and got an SS check. Last year at 64 he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Lots of chemo and a stem cell transplant, and he was in remission. He got severely depressed during the treatment, because they stop all the other meds (like bupropion). Very bad idea, but I guess that’s how they do it. Earlier this summer, he told me that his ex-wife was stalking him, and she had a State Police boyfriend who was following him. He said he’d even called the State Police complaining about it. I told him the ex died many years ago, and he disagreed and disputed it. I printed out the obits from two separate papers. I asked him if he still though the ex was alive and following him and he said yes. I printed out some articles on Delusional Disorder and gave them to him, along with the phone number for the mental health clinic approved by our insurance. I said “you need to get this checked out, because your brain is playing tricks on you”. I wondered if the stress or effects from the chemo and the illness had brought this on. Since then, he hasn’t said a word about it, and it’s now been months. I don’t know what he did with the paperwork I gave him (it probably went in the trash). I don’t know if he still has the delusions and just quit talking about it. It’s always in the back of my mind. After 22 years of this difficult marriage, we’ve had a few months of relative peace. I agree with you it’s like a frog being slowly boiled. If all of it had hit us in the beginning, we would have just ended it then. -- Tue Sep 24, 2019 4:50 am -- Hi Goodwife.

"DDD Hubby Hi Goodwife, he still overinterprets people’s comments, but no return of out and out delusions like the ex-wife one. He takes what I consider some inconsequential statement with no deep meaning, and blows it up into something that means far more. I do take the time to debate it and I know it annoys him. I think he wants me to join in his hyper interpretations, but I won’t. So we continue in this vein. Today he’s sick with a cold, which means I’m supposed to stay home to take care of him. He is good about taking the bupropion, and that helps his overall mood tremendously."
"DDD Hubby Hi everyone, well finally it's over. I filed for divorce last December, and got divorced in August 2020. It turns out when he lives elsewhere and I am not intrenched in his delusions, life is good. I have peace finally. No more panic attacks for me. My therapist said I don't need to see her anymore. 17 1/2 years of torture. I wish I left him earlier."

There are other things like she thinks I am constantly cheating on her, She thinks she is an angel, etc. She tries to get back at me and makes me suffer constantly. A few years this has been going on. I have tried everything as I am sure most people have. Does anything work at all. Has anyone been able to find a way out without medication? Is it hopeless? Any success stories that didn’t use medication? How do I handle the daily constant accusations? Over and over, the same repetitive accusations. Thank you, Can’t take much more"
"Is this wrong? OK, so I am dealing with someone who thinks I stole their lottery money and many, many other things that are created in the moment. I cheated, I stole this or that, kidnapped their mom, killed their dogs. Both of them are fine, by the way, etc. I made a post a bit earlier about this asking if anything works and was wondering if my idea was wrong. They need money to visit their mom. I said I would do that for them but now I am thinking that I will do it on condition that they see a doctor and take what the doctor prescribes. Is this wrong? Will they do it? I don't know, I don't think so. Will it burn more bridges? Probably? But if for some strange reason it helps them to see a bit more clearly, then is that the right thing to do? I don't know what else to do."
"Does anything work? Doctor would be first choice. Otherwise, maybe consider your behaviour. She makes an accusation and you spend the next hour defending yourself. To someone who thinks you're guilty, every justification is just an excuse and you're feeding the cycle. Try switching it round. Admit to it. Tell her you did just what she said. Most delusions are resting on each other like a house of cards and confirming her point of view will do one of two things. It will either make her face up to the bollocks she's throwing at you, or it won't and the logical thing for her to do will be to call the police. If her delusion can handle all of that, the police will then be in a position to offer her an objective opinion about what's happening and it might be enough to make her think. Of course, you could always walk away. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"Does anything work? Hi Uriahsky, Welcome to the delusional disorder forum. Hope you find this place as supportive as I have over the past decade. So medication helps most people with delusions. But anosignosia or not knowing one is sick is a symptom of the illness. The longer delusions go untreated the harder they are to treat, in my case I’m still struggling with making sense and healing from a trauma that’s over 15 years in the past at the birth of my daughter that involved an exam. I’d document your issue, and if the individual becomes a threat to self or others get help immediately. When talking with the person - Explain nicely that they need to seek professional care because they aren’t well. There is a great book by dr Amador titled “I’m not sick and I don’t need help”. They key strategy is to listen, empathize, agree with some aspect of their complaint like (I agree you must feel frustrated), and partner to get the person help. Also contact your local NAMI organization. They can help, too. The helpline is always there to listen and support you. Hope that helps.

"Does anything work? Thank you for the responses. I just bought that book but I guess I am a bit impatient, it seems every day gets worse. How do you talk to someone who is accusing you of cheating? They don't stop. It is all day. I think I have said most every response possible. Is there a general method of handling these false accusations. I thought it wasn't a good idea to buy into their world. For example, the main core of their beliefs about me involve the idea that I took her lottery money. She says she gave me a ticket worth 10=50 million and I have the money. It is a long drawn out rambling story that repeats every day many times a day, all out loud with yelling and screaming. I have thought about saying ""Yes I have your money"" But is that a good idea? I have called the police many times and she calls them sometimes once a day or more. I asked what they said and she just rambled on about how I need to go down there and confess that I stole her money. If things don't get better the wheels will fall of this cart soon enough. Thanks so much."
"Does anything work? There’s an old thread on here called avoiding the forbidden confrontation... it had a lot of practical ideas. Some people say to break contact. I don’t think that helps. The LEAP strategy is the most effective one I know. He has youtube videos, too. Hope that helps. Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Does anything work? I hear it is mostly not encouraged to go along with the persons delusion but I am tempted to try. I wanted to get others opinion on this before trying. More then likely it will somehow not change anything but since nothing really works without meds I thought it might be worth a try anyway. Here is their core belief. They think they had given me a mili-million dollar lottery ticket to hold and I cashed and have their money and won’t give it back. It has a bunch of branches that involve me doing other harmful things to her mom, her dogs, and other stuff. But that is the root. I was going to say I have your money but can’t get it back for another five years, hoping maybe meds are started by then. Should I try this?

"Does anything work? Hi Russell I'm in a similar situation less the lottery money accusation. I don't really have lots advice as I'm still trying different things but I've been pleading my innocence for three years. That definitely doesn't work. One piece of advice I will give you though is choose your Dr carefully. My husband has been seeing a psych. He's on antipsychotic medication but it hasn't really helped. I've done a lot of research and I don't believe the meds help without cognitive therapy. My husbands Dr only did the meds and that just isn't enough. Talk to the Dr before you take her. Make sure they are experienced in dealing with these disorders and incorporate cognitive therapy into the treatment. My husband won't go to another Dr now and I can't help but believe, the right Dr would have helped. Good luck and take care of yourself. Over time this will take its toll emotionally. You feel guilt even though you've done nothing wrong. You lose your dignity. You lose your identity and your life becomes all about helping them see. And then, they move on and you fall apart because your life became all about them. Please know when to walk. There comes a time when you have to get back to being you."
"Does anything work? Well I tried it and it didn't work. I said I had the money but they just glossed over it and soon enough she started screaming ""Give Me My Money!"" This is a very bazaar illness. It is like they are possessed by some kind of alien mind invasion, just like in the Sci Fi movies and we are trying to free them but so far we don't know what to do. After reading many stories just like yours and mine it seems 99% of these people never get better. I think that is why there are so few replies to a lot of these posts. I think people just don't have much to say because there just hasn't been much success. If I could get this person to see a doctor I might have a glimmer of hope but they won't even sit through a phone interview with a doctor and I am sure they will never take any medication. What a shame. Almost had an enjoyable life. Thanks for the input. I will keep it in mind if for some reason we do make it to a doctor."
"Does anything work? If it helps at all, the way I finally got my ex to see a psychiatrist was to agree to see one myself for 'my problem' with lying, cheating and denying. In the end, he went but my Dr refused to refer me and his psychiatrist also encouraged me not to see anyone as this would just enable his delusion. I sort of wish I did go though because then he would have to consider that if my MH was OK and his Dr says his isn't, there might be some truth in it. The other thing to not do, is get guilted into doing a polygraph. I thought that was going to be the deciding factor until the anxiety, upset and worry caused the test to come back as deceptive. The annoying thing about that was that I was so anxious and nervous that the test really couldn't get a true result. I 100% told the truth and it still said I may have been deceptive. I have new found empathy with people that are convicted and jailed of crimes that they say they didn't commit. -- Mon Aug 03, 2020 10:10 am -- Oh, and by the way, I think your posts were the reason I had a dream last night that I won $489 million in the lotto. I woke up thinking that for such a random dream, I'll have to go and buy a lotto ticket in one of the big US lotteries until I remembered your story - damn! It would have been nice if my dream was actually some sort of psychic experience. Lol"

"K2 Messed Me Up. Any Solutions Besides Medication? Hello, My name is ""Insaneinthemembranes"" (lol have to use a little humor ). Lets just say thats my name for now. I have lived quite a difficult life getting in quite a bit of legal troubles. I always have been a cautious man because of my unorthodox lifestyle. I have recently been using K2 (synthetic cannabinoid) for about 12 months. It has been about 7 months since I have touched the stuff except a recent relapse about 4 months ago where I smoked it once. That was a little history of what I believe is causing my problems. I typically am a very logical man and I do pride myself on this. I study quite a bit and look into many subjects. Now I thought at first I was being setup by some people to harm me and it really took me quite some time to realize that I am insane. I have been really focusing on what is going on and the delusional thoughts that go through my head. I have not seen a doctor and to be quite frank I will not go see a doctor. I worry about getting on medications that will slow my brain down. I get a strong feeling people are plotting on me. They want to set me up to get me killed, poison me, kidnap me, or beat me down. I look at certain people and thing they are a part of an organization that wishes me harm. I get a sense that my roommates are hiring a hacker to hack my computer. I get a sense that undercover cops are following me when I walk around and that I am being watched for something someone made up on me. I think people around me are undercover federal agents and they are spying on me to get information for something someone is setting me up for. Now at first this did cause me a headache. I am pretty good in remaining calm in violent situations so I don't let things get to me so pretty much no one knows whats going on with me. It's something I can hide quite well and put a smile on my face. I truly thought this was happening because its really hard to know whats happening when you first initially deal with this. Especially with no support from anyone because I really don't have any family or friends in my life. I have come to the understanding that these sinister plots on my life are nothing more then delusional and have self diagnosed myself with persecutory delusions. I know it sounds dumb me self diagnosing but when I researched the different variations of psychosis it seems this is the correct one. My question now is what is a good way to cope with this? Now that I understand this things are different. I have a deep understanding when I hear my roommates plotting on me in the next room or when I think a group of people is part of a gang trying to get me then I just smile and act casual. Understanding this isnt true. That it must be some delusion coming from my ego thinking im better then people or special in some way so I am a target. In the end that is what it happening and thats me giving myself the most unbiasted opinion I can. It's interesting recognizing my insanity and I am trying to out think it. Seems crazy right? lol trust me i get it. Trying to fix a broken tool with a broken tool it seems but I refuse to be heavily sedated. Any ideas on something that can calm me down? Im taking zoloft that isnt prescribed to me at a dose of 100mg. I have about 500 pills left I got from a friend. I take ""Stress Comfort Peace Of Mind by Natures Bounty"" in the morning with my zoloft. At night I take ""Honey Lavender Stress Relief Soothing Serentiy Blend Tea"" with my 30mg of Melatonin for sleep. I try to work out a few times a week and pray on my knees every morning and night. Im not a christian but I am open to any options that might work at this point. Hence the weird herbal concoction I have going on lol. I do not drink any caffeine because I noticed it will put me in a manic state that really intensifies these delusions which I cannot allow. I chew tobacco and I dont drink or use any mind altering substances. If anyone knows of anything else to add to this please let me know. I am winging this right now and I just came up with the medical diagnosis about 2 hours ago lol. It truly does match what is going on with me to the ""T"". Thank you all in advance -InsaneInTheMembranes"
"K2 Messed Me Up. Any Solutions Besides Medication? I would try to dispel the myths about prescribed medications and learn to trust doctors. Remember that following through with any diagnosis is strictly voluntary on your part. Take what is said as only suggestions, but think about what is said. You don't want a med that would 'slow' the brain, but possibly help clear the mind of clutter, noise and paranoia. Once that is begun, then counseling will work much more effectively. It is very difficult, if not impossible to treat someone with active delusions. For a time, I was unreachable until a crisis intervention and personal surrender made me decide to give recovery another chance. ""Surrender to win"" sounds like a paradox, but it saved my life. I would not self-medicate with Zoloft or Melatonin until it is cleared by a physician/pharmacist. These 'natural' drugs aren't always completely safe and can have side-effects. Just my 2¢.

K2 Messed Me Up. Any Solutions Besides Medication? Thank you for your reply. The zoloft is not natural but prescribed to someone else. I figured it would help with the anxiety/depression.

"Husband is having a delusion - please help, anyone My husband of 2 years is delusional - he believes his insides are twisted/not aligned and that he can repair this problem by moving, contorting and breathing. He believes he is the only person in the world that can do this and that he is a medical miracle. He has had x-rays, cat scans, blood tests etc and there isn't anything physically wrong with him. His first episode was in April this year...I let it go for about one week then took him to hospital where he was admitted for 2 nights - he came home on anti-psychotics and anxiety meds. This seemed to stop the problem but over time he has changed his meds and I feel the delusion never really went away. About a week ago it started again, and he was in hospital again this week, against his wishes - the only reason he went is because he had an episode at work and they called an ambulance. Nevertheless, he believes he has achieved something amazing, and claims he is now 'fixed' although he continues to make weird movements. He is now on lithium and a new anti-psychotic drug. He has agreed to stop smoking weed, which I think was a huge part of the problem. We are on Day 2 of the new drugs. He is super sad, feels very alone, and doesn't know if he can continue to be married to me because I don't believe him. I hope his drugs and the removal of weed help. Soon. Has ANYONE ever heard of a delusion like this??"
"Husband is having a delusion - please help, anyone I have not heard of it- but I'm pretty sure that delusions are limited only by the imagination- and some of us are very imaginative. I have OCD, and sometimes Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder will flirt with delusional thinking. pwOCD usually know what they're half-believing is irrational. Usually. Vast majority of the time. Even at our worst, we usually know, on some level, that we're being silly. But that line gets mighty fine at times. I've gotten really close to jumping in those waters- heck I probably have and not realised it, because, delusion. Other than slapping him on some pills, has he had any formal diagnosis? And has anyone said anything about therapy? Maybe therapy in conjunction with meds, could help him to understand when he's getting an irrational thought? And I'm no prohibitionist, but pot never seems to do anyone any good, if PF is any judge. I know in the OCD forum, which I moderate, if I had a dollar for every time someone had a freakout while smoking pot.... I myself know to stay away from the stuff. The idea of it is nice, but the rare times I have tried it, I mostly turned into a mess. I second and third, that he should stay off the pot, and hopefully that'll also help. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Husband is having a delusion - please help, anyone Hi there - thanks for your thoughts. His diagnosis from the hospital came back with 'delusional' and bipolar. His mum is bipolar and her father was diagnosed schizophrenic. He doesn't want to go to talk therapy, which is super frustrating as I know there is ALOT of childhood trauma there. I'm confident that meds with therapy will fix this, I just need to help him get there. At the moment, he is on Day 3 of no pot and and Day 2 of the new meds. He is now physically calm but very angry at me for not believing him. He is now saying that all along he had twisted intestines which he fixed himself with his breath. He wants to speak with an ""internalist"" (??) who he believes will confirm that he is not crazy (his words). I think that he knows somewhere in there that this makes no sense because as angry as he is, he is taking his meds (angrily taking them!) and not smoking pot - though he has no choice on that because i have cleared out the house of everything. I'm just so scared that this will tear us apart as he is saying that he doesn't think our relationship can continue if I don't believe him. I'm devastated. We haven't been married all that long...before this happened I was literally living the dream, living in bliss with the love of my life in Hawaii. I feel that is shattered now .. heart broken."
"Husband is having a delusion - please help, anyone It's tempting to humor him. My father sometimes has delusional thinking- not sure what's going on but he's pretty old, so... I just... go along with it just as much as I need to, and don't directly contradict him. This is by phone- I don't have to live with it, however. If it's affordable (insurance etc) maybe he can see an internist. I'd try to talk to the doctor, ahead of time, though. Don't really want to encourage him in this, though. Just... I don't know- it's a tightrope for you. I sometimes suspect myself of having bipolar traits- I also have some kind of disassociative thing going on. I don't know a whole lot about bipolar, but I know those manic episodes can make you think pretty wild, from what I've seen (and experienced the edges of). I have a family history of schizophrenia. Extended family. As well as delusional thinking on the other side of my extended family, in that case, a direct lineage to me. That was menopause related, and they had to be committed for a while. How much of that kind of stuff can be passed on, I'm not sure. Sometimes I think I'm lucky I'm not more messed up than I am. taking the meds- that's good, on some level he knows he needs help, even if he resents it. hoping you can keep the pot from him! It's a rough burden. Especially only a couple years into a marriage. You can't directly duplicate this thread you have going on here in DD- where you're trying to find advice for handling him- we allow only one topic per forum, and discourage direct duplicates in multiple forums- but if you need to just generally vent from frustration, we do have Significant Others, Family & Friends forum in which you can go scream a little, if you feel the need to. As well as a blog section, and journal threads.

"Husband is having a delusion - please help, anyone A little more clarification- in the actual disorder forums (especially the Personality disorders) we don't allow family members/Nons, to go off on whoever's driving them up the wall, but in SOFF it's more acceptable to vent- just letting you know if you need to let off a little steam, we do have a place for that.

"Husband is having a delusion - please help, anyone I agree that the fact that he's taking the medicine is a great thing. A lot of times, when someone is experiencing this kind of thought pattern and behavior, they absolutely refuse to take the medicine. It's important to remember that this medicine can sometimes take some time before it starts to work properly, usually a week or two. I agree that keeping the pot out of his hands will do him good. People with severe mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia should not be smoking it under any circumstance. It can only make the disorders that much worse. I agree with see a doctor that he wants to see (so long you can afford it) and talking to the doctor ahead of time. It might actually show him that, yes, nothing was ever wrong with him, however it could also make him angrier, so be prepared for that. And yes, don't encourage him in this. Don't give into him, because then you're only adding fuel to the fire. Don't go out of your way to challenge him, because that could, and probably would, make him angrier, but giving into it is letting the delusion win.

"Could it be erotomania? I am deeply concerned that I have erotomania. I have been in love with the same guy since I was 14. He is a professional dj, used to be a dj for a now very famous rapper and is currently touring with another well known rapper. I first saw him in the background of the first rapper's music video when I was 14. I didn't know who he was but for some reason I was extremely drawn to him and to this day I still don't get why. He is a very handsome man but back then when he was only 21 he was cute I guess but not someone that would normally make my shallow, 14 year old self swoon. I started fantasizing about him. I gave him a name. I wrote stories about us falling in love. A couple years after that I bought a documentary dvd the rapper had put out and the dj happened to be on it. So I was able to get his name. I friended him on myspace. He had a girlfriend at the time but I was 14 and he was 21 so there was nothing I could have done anyway. Fast forward to my late teen/early adulthood years, I continued to follow him on social media. I would look at his friend's pages just to see photos and videos of him. Never tried to contact him outside of sending a couple little (very corny)messages to him saying I thought he was very talented. He responded saying thank you and that was that. In 2011 he dated a woman (I was 20 at this time) and I remember feeling devastated and crying about it. I never had any ill feelings toward her, didn't even really feel jealous. I was just very sad he wasn't with me. They've broken up and he appears to be single. There have been brief moments where I haven't really thought about him much. Like if I was involved with someone ""in real life.""I've dated and been involved sexually with plenty of other people but nothing ever got serious. As soon as those situations fizzled out I went right back to dating him in my head. Right now I'm not interested in being with anyone (other than him) seriously so I keep things casual. Sometimes while being intimate with other guys I pretend it's him I'm making love to.The only things about my situation that are different from the typical erotomania symptoms are I do not believe that he is sending me signals, I don't stalk him and have no desire to (well...more on that later).I have never told him how I feel. I have looked him up in a people search just because I was curious and wanted to know more about him. I don't communicate with him. I don't feel violent toward him or anyone in his life. Lastly I don't believe/think he reciprocates my feelings.At least not really. Three years ago, I fell on hard times and found myself in a homeless shelter. My first night there, terrified, hungry and full of anxiety...I remember all I could think about was him. So I prayed. (I grew up Christian. No longer religious but very spiritual with belief in God, the power of prayer, the universe etc.) I prayed that God would tell me why this man has dominated my mind all these years especially now since I should be focusing on getting my life together. My belief is that God told me that man is my soulmate and we're to be married and build a life/family together. I've prayed for signs of this and believe they were confirmed. I've prayed for certain things to happen for him and they have. I waffle back and forth between believing that this is so, which feels amazing, and not believing it, the latter causing me so much anxiety and emotional turmoil. I feel like I'm crazy. Like I'm delusional and hell I just might be. I've prayed that God would remove these feelings from me, make me not find him attractive anymore but to no avail. I live in Michigan. This guy lives in Miami. Many times I think of going to Miami ""on vacation"" with the hopes of running into him or going to one of his shows and him seeing me and falling for me on the spot. I suffer from PTSD and BPD (borderline not bipolar)due to abuse from both parents growing up and going into my early 20s. Feeling unloved most of my life, the idea of having someone God chose that is guaranteed to love me is very comforting. I was also brought up in church and it was drilled in me that God is supposed to choose your spouse for you. Anyway. I know this is very long...but I'd like some insight from anyone struggling with this as well or who has knowledge on the subject. I plan on speaking with my therapist about it this week. I spoke with my last therapist about it as well but she didn't seem to think it was a big deal."
"Could it be erotomania? Hello and im so sorry no has gotten back to you, i relate to you jeavily i have borderline personaloty disorder and im 21 years old im a guy but i have ptsd from my mother abandonment and other issues, i struggled with substance abuse for a bit and have an eating disorder, i believe my neighborhors are somehow infatuated with me, i live in a complex and i have this stupid belief they anticipate me going outside for cigarettes and other bizzare things, ita gotten to the point where i say things outloud to entertain them, but when i catch myself i can be calm. I went throigh a bad break up recently and my bpd has gotten really bad. I feel sometimes i migjt lose it all"
"Could it be erotomania? It's worth observing that these instincts are pretty universal, it's just that you're misdirecting your focus in ways and for reasons that you seem to understand already. That may or may not be on any comfort but you apparently have the capacity to love and that shouldn't be undervalued. I'm not making light of your discomfort but, having been the father of a ""normal"" daughter I can say that normality in real life covers a broad spectrum of experience and the biological dynamics are very powerful. You're not in control of that but you can rationalise it in ways that will be good for you. Probably best not to act on the impulses you know are unreasonable, that would complicate things for others and then for you in turn but you seem to have a handle on this and that's a good place to start."
"Vent--delusional partner First off, let me say that I have suffered from manic and psychotic episodes in the past and I believe that my partner's current delusions were caused by trauma from my psychotic break three months ago. My psychosis originated from traumatic childhood memories and research into ritual abuse. During this break, I believed that I was being manipulated by a universal cult and that my partner was literally God and that they would kill me if I didn't design a better universe for them. That episode ending with me trashing my entire apartment, breaking a window and hurling household objects outside, screaming incessantly, and finally physically hurting my partner when they tried to stop me. My court date for that incident is tomorrow; I am transgender so I am expecting to be confined to solitary without hormones for close to my maximum sentence (3 years). My only hope is my partner's testimony since they witnessed my delusions and they don't blame me for the incident at all as I am normally very peaceful and kind. However, after I was released from the mental health facility, my partner began to echo elements of my delusions. They told me that they had broken their own mental programming and that they understood everything. They believe that they are being constantly stalked by a mysterious ""they"" that includes their actually-loving mother but doesn't involve a cult (I've insisted that the cult isn't real). They believe that colors and words and numbers are all used as a kind of code which can be used to manipulate people psychologically or to communicate with them convertly, and since then they've mostly communicated with me in code that they refuse to explain, which makes it difficult to even understand the nature of their delusions. They think that we're in grave danger and that they have to change and control me to protect me. Since then, my partner has admitted to repeatedly attempting to brainwash me ""for my own good"", which they are ashamed of but can't stop doing. In conversations, they often ignore me completely and ask me questions repeatedly even after I've answered them. In the last week they've started randomly moving objects around the house, including my personal items: so far I've lost my toothbrush (3 times), my makeup (twice), my guitar picks, my only pair of shoes I can use for walking, my inhaler, and my food stamp card. The inhaler, food stamp card, and shoes are still missing; I can't go outside without my shoes and my partner keeps asking me to anyway because I ""need to get out"" (luckily I do have a pair of heels I can wear to court). He's also scribbled messages on my checks (e.g. ""Give me all your $#%^"" or my name over and over). He has also damaged other household objects, including a handbag, his own clothes, and a now-destroyed houseplant that my partner was really fond of (he named it ""Franky""). He fills bags with small objects and hands them to me telling me that they're his ""rights"" and that he's the one going to jail, not me. We're packing (because jail) but all my partner has done is to stuff hundreds of objects into cupboards and claim that they're packed. On that note, my partner has also been committing minor criminal acts. They claim to have stolen from work (I think they took cash?) and last night they came home with three torn-down COVID-19 signs. They keep stuffing their pockets, bags, and once their boot with random small objects that he says he stole from me, even though half the ""stolen"" objects are usually his. The night before that he broke his dad's window for no discernable reason. That night was particularly strenuous: my partner hurt me physically and attempted to terrify me psychologically (it worked). He also spilled hot wax all over me, the floor, the counter, and my laptop while I begged him to stop, then refused to clean the mess afterwards. Then he tried to eat the ruined candles. I can't even get into all the mind games he played with me that night because it was so convoluted and the conversation was so confusing that I can't even remember exactly what happened; I just know that the constant verbal and physical pressures ended with me crying and hyperventilating and begging for him to stop torturing me. He didn't really seem to care except when I started screaming and fainted. The only part of our verbal exchange that I remember was when he was talking to a non-existent bus driver off to my left while still interacting with me physically as if I WAS the bus driver, even though he wouldn't look at me and shushed me every time I tried to speak claiming that he was explaining everything. That part of the conversation lasted for more than half an hour with him repeatedly giving me his bus fare and then taking it away again. I feel hopeless and there's no one to comfort me. My partner will sometimes get angry with me when I try to touch them, and they usually seem to do so when I'm feeling upset; thankfully when they're less delusional they still hug and cuddle me like they used to do. They also refuse to even lie down in the same bed as me because it ""doesn't feel right"", but there's really nowhere else to sleep so now they no longer do. So, every time I sleep and wake up, my partner has had 8-ish hours to run amok without me and I wake to find more of my things missing. My partner may go to jail if they keep this up, and I have literally no friends or family so if they can't take care of my things while I'm gone or give me a place to stay when I get out myself then I'll be leaving jail clothesless (aside from whatever I'm wearing when they take me), homeless, and without a job or my cats or access to medical care. Even if they do take care of my things, when I get out I may only be returning to them for more psychological torture. Thank you to anyone who read everything; I just needed to vent. I am devastated. My partner was nothing but perfect for me until this happened and I've loved them more than I've ever loved anyone else in my life, but now I feel that I've lost them in addition to everything else in my life, and that makes me want to die. I can't take this anymore; I'm just too emotionally fragile and broken to handle this. Thank you for listening."
"Vent--delusional partner My partner got arrested last night. All my worst fears have come true; they're in as much legal trouble as I am now. I don't understand why this is happening to me. I'm going to court; there's like a 5% chance I won't be sent to prison and a 95% chance that I won't be around to respond to this post for a year or three. Thank you for listening, everyone."
"So scared of inheriting Delusional Disorder Hi everyone, I am a first time poster on this forum, and I'm just so glad that there's some kind of outlet for what's been going on in my family life. I have a 57 year old father with Delusional Disorder, who has been consumed by this illness since 2007/2008. I think this illness came about when he essentially lost a personal injury trial a few months prior. He dedicated about 5 years of his life into this case. I guess he tried to make sense of it by (wrongfully) blaming my mother for conspiring with the insurance company against him. At the same time, my little brother was diagnosed with Autism. It was a very stressful transition time in my family. I'm going to spare the details of how his illness manifests, because it is so similar to what everyone has been posting here. This has been a huge strain on my family (my mother, myself, and two siblings). He does better when he is on antipsychotic medications, and for a period of about 3 years, he seemed to be his old self again. He worked, socialized well, and just seemed to be a good guy in general. As far as I could tell, he just had occasional moodiness (who doesnt?). I thought this was a miracle and that this disorder was controlled and a problem of the past. That was the case until he started to become non complaint with his medications (yet again). He is currently ordered by a mental health tribunal to take his antipsychotic medications every month, and he still defies the order. He tries to trick doctors in various ways to say that he is compliant. Essentially, the police have to show up at the home in order for him to go get his shot. When he is well, he is able to work, socialize, and be a productive member of the family. When he is unwell, he mismanages money, does not care to work, and essentially makes accusations against everyone and makes life difficult. My dad needs to be medicated. And once he's medicated, he needs to go to therapy. However, that's not what I am writing about. I am so scared that I will inherit delusional disorder just like my father. It seems that there is mental illness in the family. My father has DD. His brother was an alcoholic (who knows what kind of disorder he was hiding?). My grandfather (dad's side) certainly had some sort of mental health issues later in his life (but he was a WW2 survivor - a lot of this was attributed to his war experiences). My grandmother (dad's side) has a family history of mental illness as well. My mother's side, as far as I know, is clear. I am a 30 year old man. I am currently single, but I have a good job and would like to start a family sometime in the coming years. I've had no real mental health issues other than family and typical life-related stress. I experimented with drugs in my early 20s, but they were never an addiction. Overall, I would say that I've done better in school and work life than my peers. I spoke with a psychologist about my concerns, but I think she just did not understand DD. She seemed to conflate the disorder with schizophrenia. She basically told me that since i've not had any psychotic symptoms up to this point in my life, and that my siblings do not have any psychotic disorders, that it is extremely unlikely that I will ever go on to develop a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia or DD. However, DD can be onset at any time in your life. I am so scared that I will be a burden to my (present and future) family. I am so scared that I will become a shell of myself and create trouble for those I love the most. The problem is that there is no certainty about what my future will hold. Any help and insight would be appreciated."
"So scared of inheriting Delusional Disorder No one has answered, so I'll give it a go... The fact that you're worried about it is a good first step, as it means you're aware that you may entertain unrealistic thoughts. The issue many face is that they refuse to accept that their delusion is what it is and argue beyond reason that it's true. However, there is a danger that your obsession with getting delusions gets to a point where it itself becomes a delusion; that you're so convinced that you'll get it that you'll see it where it doesn't exist. I don't know if you've ever seen a film called A Beautiful Mind, but if not then it tells the story of John Nash who was deluded to the point of vivid, visual hallucinations. Medication etc didn't work as a long-term strategy, but he eventually managed to cope with the delusions by employing a real-world test as to their existence. It's not the same as you, but it might be worth considering some tests that you can deploy to test any beliefs against reality, even posting them here to get an more objective opinion might help to confirm you're living in reality without the need to become obsessed with the idea. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"I Have Magical Powers I am convinced that I have magical powers. I'm not making this post because I believe I'm wrong. I know I have magical powers, if you want to ask me about them feel free. If you also believe you have magical abilities, feel free to comment as well. If you have any opinion about me and my beliefs, or beliefs about people who believe they have magical powers, let's discuss! Thank you."
"I Have Magical Powers I have parts that believe they have magical powers and parts that think they are talking nonsense. This is basically the type of conversation I usually have with myself. What magical powers do you believe you have? Monte Carlo or Bust Rose and Patrick Batcho and Fortune (twins), Paul and Lilly, No-one and Peter, Beth and Karen, Mandy and Mouse plus a seperate system of fragments including: rabit and others."
"I Have Magical Powers I can do things with my mind and meditation, like curse people. There's this really nasty woman at my work and when I figured out how to do it properly I made a jar for her and she tripped over her dog and cracked ribs. But then it happened to two other people at my work as well, the cracked ribs part, and one of them was actually really nice :/ I recently tried using my powers for good too. I made a 'blessing jar' for a suicidal guy and evoked an angel to help me with it. He blocked me when he felt my power but then unblocked me and said things were going better in his life. I've also made 'love jars' and 'obsession jars' for people but they haven't worked so well - or at least obviously in a way I can tell. My targets weren't people I knew in person so I can't confirm they've been treating me differently."
"I Have Magical Powers I get plenty of sleep and don't do drugs. I meditate. Don't really hate humankind either, I'm pretty indifferent to them. The woman I cursed finally got fired after coming into work drunk. Her daughter trashed her place and punched her. As for my other targets I dunno yet."
"I Have Magical Powers She's more than likely not a very nice woman because she has a bad home life and so she drinks heavily. She was probably heading down the path of getting fired well before you made your potion. If you believe you have magical powers, why did you post this in the delusions forum? England's Glory"
I Have Magical Powers While I do believe 100% that I have magical powers. I also feel that I am fully aware of how crazy it sounds to say that. And so that's why I'm having this conversation. If people think that I'm lying or anything you can PM me about them and I'll be interested in whatever personal deduction you make.
Deluded I delude myself quite a lot. This is only an issue for me and not anyone else because I don't let anyone know about these things that I'm thinking. And its only an issue because I'm forever disappointed when my dream of a brighter future turns out to be a delusion. I think it's because I'm childlike in my thinking. Can delusional thinking be because of a childlike approach to the world? England's Glory
"Deluded Years ago when my kids were small I caught them digging a hole in the garden. When I asked them what the ###$ they were doing digging up the grass, they told me, with great enthusiasm, that they were digging to Australia. As is usual with kids, they had a basic notion of how the world was made, but without the experience and understanding to realise at the outset what the logistics entailed. I told them to carry on, but warned them that if they started to see water in the hole, it meant that they'd missed and hit the sea. It was enough for them to stop but with a level of accomplishment. So we made the hole bigger, lined it and turned it into a fish pond. There is a grown up and useful version of these types of delusion, called visualisation. If you can take your delusion and structure it better to be realistic, it can help focus the mind to accomplish something by influencing your sub-conscious behaviour. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right."
"I see a Spider Help! Hey there, iam not sure if this is the right forum but iam currently in a bad place mentaly... And i dont know where to ask this question... Nobody believes me at all. Everytime i wake up there is a spider right next to me on the wall. The first couple of times i was in shock, it looks real but later i figured that its moving weird and its actually not real. It very randomly appears in the middle of the day aswell. When i look at the spider it crawls away, when i dont look she just stares with here 4 eyes at me. IT FREAKS ME OUT. I want it to stop. Help what is this (((( I never have taken drugs other then antidepressants and weed."
"To the shell of the person that I married I've been lurking on these forums for awhile, looking I guess for some kind of advice or outlet. I posted a few months ago on Reddit about my current situation and since deleted it; frankly, most of the advice given was unhelpful, if not unkind. I am convinced my spouse of four years (together for nearly a decade) has a delusional disorder, likely stemming from PTSD. Most of his delusions center on infidelity, but are accompanied by full-blown auditory and visual hallucinations. He claims to have seen me, on multiple occasions, have sex with other men in our apartment. Twice now, he claims to have recorded evidence. Of course, I've asked to see it, and of course, there are plenty of excuses as to why I can't: he deleted it, it's with a lawyer, etc. I'm fairly certain yesterday marked the end of our marriage. The outbursts and name-calling have only gotten worse. His favorite today is ""junkie whore."" Secret drug addiction seems to be his rationale for why I'd sneak men into the apartment for sex. For money. For drugs. I don't know that I'm ready to discuss all the gory details, but today he mentioned my handle. It's a handle I've been using elsewhere, mostly in Discord-based support groups. He thinks I use it to hook up with other men. I have no idea how he knows about it. He's not that technical. Maybe I just left my laptop open at some point. I guess I'm hoping that maybe, one day, perhaps once he's found someone new, he'll find this post. Perhaps when he starts accusing her of the same things, he'll care to look. I suppose I just needed to write something down somewhere. All the things I wish I could say to him. How I wish he had gotten help. How much I want him to find happiness and peace. How fearful I am that he will end up alone. How sorry I am I couldn't help him. How much I hate the cold, distant person I became last couple years of our relationship. I was just trying to protect myself. To anyone else reading this, you're in my thoughts. I wouldn't ever wish this on anyone."
"To the shell of the person that I married I’m so sorry you are experiencing this. This does not get better. It subsides, then comes back. It’s always there. My husband has been doing this for more than 20 years. It got better when he was in chemo; he was too wiped out to be delusional. Just leave. Save yourself. The moment you have a chance to exit, take the exit ramp. If you read about this, you will learn there is no effective treatment."
"DDJ is it worse around the holidays? Having such a rough time right now. My DDJ spouse of 20 years, seems to get so much worse around the holidays. Most of our separations have come around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Is it just that way with us? Anyone else have the same problem? Just reaching out today because I am in hell. I used to love the holidays and now I dread them."
"DDJ is it worse around the holidays? Hi Exhausted. I'm exhausted too. I'm not sure of the answer to your question as my husband and I have only been on this roller coaster of despair for a couple of years but I hope you do get a chance to make some nice memories this year. I read some of your earlier posts and your story is eerily similar to mine - feel free to read my previous posts for context. I spent a long time trying to find others in my situation because I think it helps to not feel so alone. I was going to write a new post but this board doesn't get a lot of traffic so I thought I would just reply to you. I left my DDJ husband in July this year but our separation isn't going very well. We see each other most days for a few hours and usually have dinner at whichever house has the children on the day. When I left, I did so on the basis that my own mental health had taken a beating and I was sick of being told I was a liar, a cheat, narcissistic, schizophrenic and evil. I was an emotional wreck and having always been somewhat of a people pleaser, I spent my every waking minute trying to make my husband believe that I loved him and wasn't cheating. I left without a reconciliation plan and bought a new house to live in. When I was still home with him, he would sometimes sit me down for a serious talk to explain to me that he understood I was in a difficult position. He thought the man I was supposedly having an affair with must have had some sort of hold over me and he wanted to help me. Other times, he would tell me I was schizophrenic and possibly didn't know what I was doing because it was the 'other me' doing it. He was so convincing that at times, I would sit quietly in the bathroom and search deep into my own memories and thoughts to make sure I really wasn't getting up in the middle of the night to have the 'affair' while everyone was asleep. More than once, I had suicidal thoughts because I just couldn't deal with the accusations, the way he looked at me, how when I didn't make eye contact because I felt degraded and humiliated, he thought it was guilt etc etc Biggest problem I have today is this. I've let myself become very emotionally dependant on him and that's really bad. As a person who wears my heart on my sleeve, I struggle to convince myself that it's his illness that made him say such horrible things to me over the last two years. When he was saying disgusting things, I warned him that he wouldn't be able to take them back and warned him that I may never get over them. He wants me to move back in but I've convinced myself that we can never reconcile until I get the following: 1. He has to take responsibility for his mental health being the cause of the problems 2. He needs to apologise (sincerely) and show genuine remorse for what he put me through and the damage his mental health has done to me 3. Ideally he should stop smoking 'funny stuff' to remove the paranoia side of this illness He has been taking Risperidon for about 6 months at 3mg a day and he meets with his psychiatrist once every few weeks. I went to the last meeting and explained to both of them that I can't be in a relationship with someone who believes I have ever cheated on them. My husband stated that he knows I'm not cheating now. The psychiatrist added that while my husband doesn't think I'm cheating now, he will likely never realise that I didn't cheat because it was real to him at the time and he may always believe I cheated and put him through all of that. To me, that basically means that he will never treat me with the respect I deserve because he will always think I'm capable of lying and cheating. I like his psychiatrist but aside from managing his medication, I don't think he's doing any cognitive therapy with him and I have read that for this difficult disorder, both medication and CT has better success. My husband refuses to talk to me about the issues that lead to our separation. He doesn't want to talk about them ever again. If I do ask him anything about the events of past, he says he just wants to live in the now, he's not stupid and he knows the truth. If I ask him what truth he knows, he replies with a cryptic answer. If I try to get a non-cryptic answer, he tells me that I'm the reason for his beliefs because I have always been the person to keep bringing it up. He seems to forget that while I was living there, he treated me with so much disrespect and contempt, it was hard not to bring it up. He always says that he wasn't bringing the topic up but was merely just pointing out oddities he noticed around the house (which were usually indirect attacks at my supposed infidelity). I'm thinking that after Christmas, I'm going to have to go no contact so we can both move ahead but there's something stopping me. I don't know what is blocking me because while I was happy to spend the rest of my life with him, we never really had a great relationship to start with. We had some really happy times but more unhappy times and these days, I don't get a lot of comfort from being around him because the medication makes him lifeless, unmotivated and unresponsive a lot of the time. Hope you don't mind the long post but feel free to share your thoughts - I'd love to lend an ear to someone in the same situation as me. Other people just don't understand what this is like. Family and friends say, ""Just leave the a#$%%e"" as if we're just being idiots and they have zero sympathy for what it must be like for the sufferer. I hope you have a very merry Christmas and hope the new year brings new special memories to hold onto. You are not alone."
"DDJ is it worse around the holidays? Wow! It's amazing how our DDJ husbands have so much in common. I don't think mine is worse during the holidays. He's just worst when one of his many triggers pop up and I know when that happens because he can't stop verbally abusing me and out fly the wild accusations. We have been married almost 40 years and it was pretty good until DDJ started about 6-7 years ago. Although he keeps saying he will leave me, I don't know how that will happen because right now he checks on me so often and follows me if I leave the house. I don 't see him going from that to zero contact. I read that your husband is on risperidone. Didn't it help at all? And how did you get him to seek help? My husband is in total denial. He insists his only problem is having a wife who ""throws herself"" at every man around. I hesitate to kick him out because I think he will go off the deep end. His mother committed suicide plus an uncle and an aunt. I worry about this."
"DDJ is it worse around the holidays? Hi Benditos21. I'm not 100% sure why my husband takes his Risperidon. The only way I was able to get him to go to the psychiatrist was by promising I would go to one as well to help me with my imagined infidelity/lying problems. I never wound up going because two GPs wouldn't give me a referral as they believed this would make my husband's beliefs stronger. The psychiatrist that my husband sees agreed on that point so I never went. Even though he believes he was never the problem, I think his psych explained that the medication would rid him of the physical symptoms of his anxiety and generally make him feel better. In answer to the ""did the meds help"" question - yes and no. Yes, it has calmed him down and there have been no fresh accusations for 4-5 months. No, in that I had hoped his meds would provide him with insight to know that I never cheated on him. I just can't get past it without being released from my imaginary crimes. He is going to ask his dr next week if he can come off the meds or lower the dosage because he doesn't feel the side effects are worth it. Side effects for him a- absolutely no libido - he's never experienced that in his life before - flat emotions/doesn't get joy from anything much - no motivation to get anything done If he does go off them, it will be interesting to see if his delusional beliefs come back in full force. I'll keep you updated."
"DDJ is it worse around the holidays? thanks SShh Bear for your insight. Yes, keep us posted on whether the delusions come back when he is off the meds. My husband seems to have those same side effects without ever taking meds. He is depressed, withdrawn and watches TV 12-14 hours a day. I don't know about the low libido because he hasn't touched me in 2 years. He did have an affair around that time and it still hurts terribly. I was shocked that he would do something like that after 40 years with me (and a good sex life) and I know in his mind, it was revenge for my imaginary cheating. He has no remorse because he said I have being cheating all along even though there is no proof. I wish I could move on from the hurt, but I cannot get those images of him and that slut out of my head. I kicked him out when it happened, but took him back after he promised to get therapy. He went only 3 times and nothing has changed. It just gets worse with him following me when I leave and even checking my bed in the middle of the night to ""catch me"". Despite all this, I feel sorry for him. He is so miserable."
"DDJ is it worse around the holidays? Just a quick update peeps. Hubby (ex) has been on the Risperidone for 10+ months now. No change in his beliefs. I often wonder if his extremely fixed ideas would be different without key 'facts' or would a DDJ sufferer just make other things key 'facts'? For example, my husband's 'absolute proof' moment was initially a lie detector test that gave an incorrect result. Then, it was a video that I apparently put on his phone of me having sex with someone else. The video couldn't be found even with restore deleted images apps. There was however a still frame image of the video and the woman doesn't even look like me. Another piece of undeniable proof, was an audio recording one morning that he set up in secret outside out bedroom. There was a faint noise that could have been a neighbour but more likely, it was our small dog snoring. That was interpreted as me sneaking someone in and having sex with them. Funny thing is that around the time of that recording, you can hear me talking to a man. The man I was talking to was my husband. You can hear his distinctive voice clearly but he still believes that I had someone there. More recently (aka yesterday), he said his definitive proof was a short recording from our security camera several months ago. The early morning recording in question showed a light coloured shadow moving slowly across our front pathway. I watched it. My guess is that it was a headlight from someone's car. At an absolute stretch, I guess it could have been a large white dog but it was so blurry, you really couldn't make anything out. Apparently, that video shows me having sex with someone outside on our front garden path. He does not think any of these 'proof' moments are irrational thinking at all. Very sad!"
"Friend with apparent delusional disorder Hi, Someone whose been a friend for over thirty years appears to have been exhibiting delusional disorder for these past 3 years. She hasn’t been officially diagnosed or seen a doctor about this, but here’s some history: Firstly I have to avoid going into specifics just in case she ever reads this, and shall refer to her as “Mo”, which isn’t her real name. Around a decade ago “Mo” was assaulted by a guy she’d started seeing. While she only confided this part recently I believe it to be 100% genuine because it’s entirely plausible, fits the timeline, everything appears to stem from this event, and it doesn’t have any of the characteristics common to her delusions. Also she’s always been a very forthright, straight up and honest person aside from the delusional behaviour. Seven years later Mo naively confided this in a friend, who knew the guy in question. This person didn’t believe Mo’s story, accused her of making false allegations, and then proceeded to embark on a passive aggressive campaign of slut shaming and gaslighting on social media. It was a few weeks after this (around 2016) that Mo first began exhibiting symptoms of paranoia. Initially she appeared to be manifesting the non-bizarre persecutive variant, but recently it’s expanded to include grandiose delusions and erotomania. Subsequent to the onset of all this she began smoking weed to “calm her nerves”, and this most certainly seems to be exacerbating the problem. Aside from the delusions Mo functions normally, but certain aspects are starting to intrude on her life and career. She’s also started to broadcast these delusions to more and more people. The delusions clearly aren’t true as they stretch plausibility too much. While the story remains mostly consistent it keeps growing arms and legs, and more and more people are now identified as persecuting her. It seems only a matter of time before I am perceived as joining her ranks. The delusion has gradually expanded from just the friend who originally shamed her, to a millionaire sportsman from overseas who is paying a team of hackers to persecute her because she reject him, an Instagram model, hundreds of followers that these people have across social media, to an international web of conspiracy that includes any cameras and microphones she comes into contact with. More recently a second faction of world famous rock stars has begun defending her honour against the evil masses, one of whom is a band member in REDACTED who is now her secret ‘boyfriend’. All this has been communicated subliminally over social media, where the whole drama apparently plays out, and also via the radio etc. It’s literally everywhere, and she is right at the centre of all this action. It is impossible to reason with her, she admits it all ‘sounds crazy’ but is adamant that it can’t be because it’s all true. She’s been regularly expressing suicidal thoughts, although this depends on here mood, which depends of who is ‘winning’ this Instagram war. At the moment I have the impression that she’s too important to humanity to harm herself. I managed to get her mind off it all for a while last year, and she admits now that she was considering that it could all be down to her mental health... but then she spilled part of the tale to some other people who tried their best to politely humour her, and now she ‘realises’ that the notion of her being delusional was ‘nonsense’ because these people immediately brought her plight to the attention of REDACTED, mobilising it against her detractors. As if. She has even gone so far as to report all this to the police, who recommended that she see a doctor, but she won’t. Does anyone have any suggestions as how I can encourage her to see a doctor? She never goes to a doctor with anything, not even when she’s ill. Her parents are completely unaware of all this. She rightly keeps it from then in order to avoid upsetting them as they are old and infirm, so that avenue is out. She has confided heavily in one other friend whom I know of, but don’t actually know personally. I could contact this person but if word ever got back to Mo then that wouldn’t play well. The problem has become apparent to some other people she interacts with, and together we’re trying to manage it all as best we can. It might be possible to arrange for the people who humoured her last year to come back and verbally inform her that they are not actually involved in mounting a campaign in her defence, but I suspect that might go badly, or she’d have some way of explaining/denying it. The story has become so grandiose and complex that the details have begun to get muddled. Is there anyone here who has successfully recovered from this dreadful illness? What would you suggest? We’re in the UK."

"Delusional disorder on Dr. Phil show (Feb 21 2020) On Friday, the show's guest was a woman who accused her father of sexually assaulting her when she was a teen and videotaping the incident. Years later, she was now accusing her brother-in-law (her sister's husband) of selling the video on the dark web. This was a family of attorneys, and they were struggling with the accusations. According to the guest, who is about 50, a few years ago, she suddenly remembered the assault, a memory which she had suppressed. Her niece said that a few years back, the woman appeared normal, and she had good relationships with her family. From listening to the woman, it sounds like her delusion grew to include her brother-in-law as a result of her ""piecing things together"" and ""trying to figure it out"". I gritted my teeth. My DD relative frequently uses those phrases. At the end of the episode, Dr. Phil announced that he believed the woman has a delusional disorder, specifically the persecutory type. (I was surprised, because I had seen two other episodes where a guest appeared to have DD, and he blamed their beliefs on mold in their home.) He offered her help from a company that offers treatment. I didn't catch the name of the company, but one or two reps appeared briefly on the show to say that they thought they could improve her condition with treatment. I understood the family's frustration as they described the woman's behavior. But I felt that Dr. Phil was being exploitative when he yelled at the woman for not bringing evidence of her claims. The audience applauded in response to his yelling, while the camera showed the woman looking sad. He could have edited out those few seconds before the show aired. He should know that shaming someone isn't going to provide the safe environment that the victim needs for trusting people. I hope that the show gives an update on this family in the future. It's so rare that DD is referenced in the media."
"Delusional disorder on Dr. Phil show (Feb 21 2020) I take the good doctor with a grain of salt. The show is all about ratings. The more drama, the better. The applause is canned.

Friend thinks people are constantly following/Gangstalking her, wearing certain colors to harass her, thinks she may be microchipped, thinks her mind can be read 24/7 by certain individuals, no touch torture believer, thinks people constantly breaking into her apartment while she isn't there and rearranging or removing items. Only clear hallucinations I can think of she had was being hypnotized by her TV years ago and once hearing a voice telling her ""they"" could hear her even with her phone shut off. Besides that though, no known hallucinations or voices. Just constant problems in public, thinking that most of it is direct harassment against her, and gangstalkers are paid actors or something. Help please. I am trying my best to help this person seek professional help. Thank you!"
"Delusions symptomatic of underlying major mental illness? hi beartooth. what you describe matches very closely my experience with the DD-P person who used to be in my life, the mother (who passed awhile ago): only a few florid episodes or hallucinations, and those involving the phone; but a constant, even daily litany of conspiracies or attacks by others on her. so, if i'm correct, this would be symptomatic of a thought disorder. also, it was impossible to get my mother to seek help because she never imagined that there was a problem, rather everyone else was stupid or ignorant or whatever and she knew better than them all. you may have to maintain some detachment, for your own sake."
"Imaginary Fleas Hello, I have posted before about my ex, I was with for 28 years and started to accuse me of having affairs with people I didn't even know. We are separated but still in the same house for one week a month until my new house is ready. He now thinks he has fleas and is a ""host"" to them . He blames me of course because the dog got out of the yard when I was home and picked up a couple of fleas from somewhere. I promptly treated the dog with flea powder and rid her of the fleas but it has now been 12 months and he has spent thousands of dollars trying to get rid of non existent fleas from him and the house and his car. I have never seen a flea or never been bitten and neither have my kids. he has put that many chemicals and pestisides into and on his body, Im amazed he is still alive. He soaks and washes his bedding everyday and throws out and buys new clothes every week. I could go on and on about the strange things he has said and done to do with these fleas over the last 12 months I have told him he needs to see a phsycologist but he insists these fleas are real and there is nothing wrong with his mind."
"Imaginary Fleas What a difficult spot to be in (for you). It sounds like a form of aggression towards you. I imagine it feels like that on your end, too. He can keep blaming you for the “fleas” that aren’t really there. The sooner you move out and disconnect from him, the better. Once these guys get something in their heads, it’s impossible to dislodge."
"Imaginary Fleas Agree with Nmkim. For me personally if I'm around someone and I start to feel like I have fleas crawling all over me and I'm itching then it's a sign I really do not want to be around that person. Once I acknowledge that it's actually because I don't want to be around that person the flea feeling stops but if someone is so caught in the delusion and doesn't want to face what's causing it then it's impossible to get through to them.

"Imaginary Fleas This fixation with imaginary fleas, or similar, is happening with my mom, too. Her delusional disorder began 10 years ago, at age 68, and at first she though her then-husband was having multiple affairs, and that he was sanding her furniture. A couple years later, with her poor husband enduring weekly accusations, she thought he was going to kill her and she left, and thankfully her doctor convinced her to admit herself to a geriatric psychiatric unit, where she stayed for 2 weeks. The doctors there referred to her delusions as 'fixed' and tried anti-psychotics, but the medication didn't change her delusions at all. My mom and her husband divorced, which was strongly encouraged by the psychiatric hospital experts, and which my sister and I were relieved about because we could see the stress on her husband, a dear man who was then in his 70s. She moved to an apartment on her own, and became convinced he was still entering all the time, to damage her furniture or move things around, or take things, to then return them later. There are so many other things she was suspicious of, too many to list here. She spent money on cameras and door alarm monitoring. Anyway, a few years ago, she said her apartment has fleas, but get this, her dog did not! She still spent hundreds of dollars on flea treatments. She even took what she thought were flea carcasses to a dermatologist, and was told she has delusions. (She's received that diagnosis from various doctors, to no avail) She started to say her ex-husband is blowing dust and fleas on her through holes in the ceiling, and that he lives in the apartment above her. A few months later, she said she had the fleas under control, but then earlier this year, she started saying she now has mites all over her body. She puts various tree oils and who knows what else all over herself, and does a lot of laundry. She caused a rash on her face, probably from putting various 'treatments' on. And now she also picks at her imaginary mites. A month ago, she suddenly signed a new lease with a new apartment, saying she has to get away from her ex-husband (who, in actuality, is in his 80s now, can't walk well, and lives hours away from her). We worked very hard to help her move, though she didn't consult with me about whether it was convenient, and yet we knew with 100% certainty that moving would not stop her delusions. Sure enough, it's been just 2 weeks since the move and a few days ago she told me her ex-husband lives in the apartment above her. She still thinks she has mites, and she's also developed olfactory and auditory hallucinations. She thinks she hears her ex-husband whistling, and gets angry with us when we say we can't hear anything. And she thinks she smells vapors or fumes that he's blowing on her somehow. We're hopeful that the new place she moved to, which has independent apartments, but also has assisted living services, will place barriers on her behavior, or somehow enforce mental health treatment. We'll see. I'm also 100% certain that even if her ex-husband passes away before she does, she will still think he's tormenting her, or that he's hired people to do it after his death."
"I am the accused - will it go away if he meets someone else? Hello I am new to this forum and am at my wits end with my partner of 10 years. To cut a very long story short I have been accused of having an affair and committing fraud for the past two years. It started suddenly one day and has been relentless ever since. Initially he was manic and psychotic for over two months and he frightened me so much that I got the police involved. He thought he was being chased and filmed on the motorway and followed into work with people breaking into his house and moving things just to unnerve him. He comes and goes as he pleases and at times is quite scary as he is verbally aggressive. He had an affair four years ago which I forgave, he didn’t apologise and I feel he is projecting his guilt into me. I am also accused of staring at men younger than my sons all the time and am told that I’m embarrassing for doing this. The person I’m accused of having the affair with is a random estate agent I met a few times when selling my house and this person is also accused of recruiting me to commit the fraud. I’ve left him so many times but then feel sorry for him as ‘he isn’t well’. I’m told by his family that he had a very similar psychotic episode when he split with his first wife but this only lasted about six months - this was four years before he met me. He told me himself when we met that his wife had an affair but she wouldn’t admit it but if she had then they would have been ok - he’s used the exact same words to me too! I’m told by his sister that he had an affair when he was married - two years before he accused his wife of doing the same. My question is that if I just let him go and he met someone else (which he keeps threatening to do as he constantly tells me that I don’t love him) would he just get better? I’m thinking that this may be the kindest thing to do for him, as much as I love him I am the total focus of his delusion and probably being with me isn’t helping him. I add that he has lost a very good job and a 20 year career six months ago because of this and they paid him off to leave - this is also my fault apparently. He hasn’t accessed any help as he doesn’t see that he has a problem. It is all me and I’m just trying to make him think he’s going mad. Sorry for rambling Jan"
"I am the accused - will it go away if he meets someone else? I could have written a similiar letter. I am being accused daily and it's verbal abuse. I am still with him out of loyalty to a 40 year marriage, but it won't get better. It's just gotten worse since it started 5 years ago. He will not be better off without you, but he may find a new victim to abuse and leave you alone. It's up to you whether you want to stay or leave and preserve your sanity. I keep holding out hope that my husband will accept help, but he refuses and I don't know how much longer I can take this. I can barely leave the house and when I do, he follows me. It's all so sad. I do have a cousin whose husband had this and she left him. He went on to marry and abuse someone else, but at least she got her life back."
"I am the accused - will it go away if he meets someone else? Sounds like a classic narcissist. I married one, and, I eventually just had to take off. I actually did it twice before but came back, but, the third time it was for good. But I needed help, and I thank God for that day."
"I am the accused - will it go away if he meets someone else? Thank you so much for your reply Benditos21. I am at my wits end with it all. The verbal abuse is a constant daily challenge. The worst thing I put up with him is him telling me I smell of sex and accusing me of having sex all day long instead of going to work. This occurs daily. My situation Is just getting worse every day. This is on top of his constant accusations that I’m committing fraud. He tells me they he loves me but he’s not going to beg me to stop this ‘affair’ and that he’ll find someone else who’ll treat him better than I do. It just amazes me that he can firmly believe everything that’s in his head and nothing will sway him at all. In fact the more I protest my innocence, the more I’m Guilty in his eyes."
"I am the accused - will it go away if he meets someone else? Hi, and many sympathies. I’m now in the same boat. If you are not married to that man, leave. I’ve been dealing with this on a mild level for about 20 years. He would at times completely misinterpret very innocent actions and statements on my part. He would believe I was somehow insulting him or attacking him. How he could make that connection was beyond me. I stopped taking him with me to company events, because when we drove home, he said all the people there were looking down their noses at him. Early last year he started saying his exwife was here, following him around with her cop boyfriend. I was stunned, because she’s been dead for 12 years, and he didn’t believe me when I told him that. When I learned of her death many years ago, I did not mention it to him (no point). Last year he was diagnosed with a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. I did everything in my power to help with all his chemo and then a stem cell transplant. The lymphoma is in remission. The whole thing was pretty hard. Then, this morning, he told me his exwife was back to stalking him and that a cop had been following him. He said he called the state police to complain. ENOUGH. I told him his ex had been dead since 2006. He said he didn’t believe that, and I was wrong. I told him his brain was playing tricks on him, and that I was going to find the obituary and bring it home. So I printed it out, along with some other information on delusional disorder. He does not believe the obituary. He thinks its faked. He continues to believe she is alive and stalking him. I told him this is a sign of a mental health issue and he needs to get it checked out. I also printed out the phone number of the behavioral health clinic with our health insurance. I don’t think he believes anything I say. This year we will be married 22 years. We are both in our early 60s. Reading this forum, I can see myself just running away if this continues."
"I am the accused - will it go away if he meets someone else? Hi and thank you for commenting. You also have my sympathies and I hope you can work through things. I have left him but he has not stopped with his accusations, he is now demanding money from me which he says is for lost earnings due to him losing his job - he blames me and my ‘associates’ for this! It is very sad for him but at the same time is really distressing for me. I don’t see him getting any better any time soon. He now has a new partner and I really fear for her. I have spent the last two years treading on eggshells, being accused of things that are completely far fetched and being promiscuous and this has been beyond distressing. I have lost confidence and feel anxious most of the time. I really need to start looking after my own mental health instead of trying to fix him. He just will not accept that there is anything wrong with him."
"I am the accused - will it go away if he meets someone else? No, he will not accept that anything is wrong with him. Never. Eventually, he will leave you alone, and will start accusing the new girlfriend. If you can, stop communicating with him. I am very glad for you that you were able to leave. YOU ARE SO FORTUNATE!!!! I feel trapped. Ever since I left the obtituary of the ex, an article on Delusional Disorder and the phone number to the mental health clinic for him, he’s been on his best behavior. I don’t know what he did with those papers, because they are no where to be seen in the house. I hope he kept them somewhere. I know this isn’t over and it will be back. But at least I had the courage to break the ice, and to give him some truth. Even though he will never believe it, I feel better about myself. I have removed all the guns from the house, just in case."
"I am the accused - will it go away if he meets someone else? It’s September and I’m reading my posts from April. The delusions about the dead ex-wife stalking him (with her state cop boyfriend) have not returned yet. Ever since I gave him the printout of the obituaries, an article on delusional disorder and the phone number of our mental health clinic, it’s been dead silent on that issue. For a month or so it was very uncomfortable here, not knowing if he was quickly slipping over the edge, or getting himself back together. At that time, there don’t appear to be any Delusions, but he has never mentioned the x-wife issues. We are back to the usual status of him over-interpreting peoples’ words and actions. He always goes a conclusion to far. Facts and actions that I believe have no significance, still have some greater significance and interpretation to him, that make no sense. I patiently (sometimes not patiently) analyze and repeat the facts, and point out there is no information that would allow me to reach the same conclusion he has reached. I point out equally plausible conclusions from the same facts. I think I’m ruining his game of “awfulizing” over innocent facts. At the moment we have peace, though."
"Is there hope? I have read most of the posts on this forum and it brings me comfort to know that I am not alone, but at the same time it is so incredibly depressing. My wife has cut everyone out of her life and has now turned her sites on me (and the kids). It’s the usual accusations of infidelity and “abuse”. The kids, in their 20s, are dumfounded by what they are witnessing and have tried to intercede, but she thinks I have converted them to my side with my “silver tongue”. She spends countless hours on the internet researching about ""covert narcissists"" and psychopaths which is her diagnosis for me. When she isn't obsessed on how horrible I am, she is researching conspiracy theories about the ""deep state"" and the end-times. Unfortunately, there are plenty of odd-balls on the internet who feed these ideas. It seems as if no one gets out of this with their relationship intact. Is there any hope that I am going to get my wife back? Does this illness ever go into remission?"

"Is there hope? Hi HoldingTheLine I am in the same situation as you. My husband and I have been together for almost 20 years and have 4 kids - 2 still at home. I am sad to say that in my case, we have separated after 2 years of living hell. He is still adamant that I have been cheating with someone. I stopped leaving the house alone most of the time because I 'knew' he'd see that I never had an opportunity to cheat but his delusions found a way for me to continue cheating - by getting up in the wee hours of the morning,dodging the security cameras and having quickies all around our garden. I only moved 2 days ago but I am a broken woman and although I love this man dearly, despite all the horrid things he has said to me, I wish I'd left before it got to this point. The last few weeks the man that I adore, looked at me with hatred. He didn't believe a word I said about anything. He wanted me to get a psych assessment because he believed I was bi-polar or narcissistic. His psych told him on visit 2 that he was pretty sure hubby had a mental health disorder. Hubby is in complete denial though he is taking Risperidon with no effect at all after 5-6 weeks. He feels that he has 100% proof of my two year affair and can't see that his proof is not proof at all. Some of his proof includes: - Plants out the front dying (lover pees on them) - Outside motion lights have been switched off at least once (lover did it) - Outside motion camera picked up a light shadow early one morning (lover and I doing it on our pathway) - Me being on my mobile phone (I like to research things and keep my phone unlocked all the time - anyone in my house can look at anything on it). He thinks I have a secret way of communicating with my lover. The list just goes on and on. If I cry (I often do), it's because of what I have done to him and being torn between my lover and him. I wish I could give you some reassurance that your wife will come good and maybe she will but it will be at your emotional expense. I know this because I'm a wreck. I wish I'd found this forum sooner because I would have loved (still would) to have someone to talk to who was going through the same thing. If you would like to chat or bounce your frustrations off someone, I'd love to help. Good luck."

We are not together, he's had a new partner for about 3 years now and he says he's better - I don't know first hand because of no longer being with him but according to him the change in medication helped him loads.

"Twillight-zone like life episode. Let me describe a twilight-zone like life episode that a person (myself) experienced. I would like to know what type of clinical diagnosis such an experience may correspond and how a psychological disorder may lead to such an experience ? An afternoon a person wants to make a trip of two subway stations, it enters the metro train at station S , during the trip the person notices that the time to travel the two stations is quite long and that it did not notice that the other times it took this trip. It also notices that this day the lightning is weak and unstable and that are quite few peoples in the carriage. However after the two stations trip the station name is again S . The person doesn't immediately realize the inconsistency, instead it instantly thinks it took the wrong direction, so it goes out, quits the platform and follows the panels to the ""good"" direction, and after a short trip inside the station it is back to the same platform. It finally realizes that it is still at the same station S waiting for the train. Obviously, this life episode should not be possible, but this is what the person experienced from its point of view. So the person concludes that it lives in a simulation and there was a glitch, or that it experienced a delusion. The person never noticed any other inconsistencies in its life, and has no way to know what really happened. The only thing that is sure is that this episode lasted at most a few minutes, it didn't monitor the time precisely as there was no foreseeable reason to do that."
"Twillight-zone like life episode. I have a dissociative disorder and delusional parts (the twins). I have had quite a few experiences like this, always after a trauma, not random, but pretty much as you describe in various situations. This is our theory. We are not professors and do not know what this disorder would be labelled as so we call it delusions: The subconscious brain overlaps the conscious brain. Like a miswire, crossed connection either by chance, an outside occurance or drugs. The subconscious brain then influences and tricks the conscious brain. The lights look dimmer, is the journey time longer than usual? Uncertainty and confusion leaking into the conscious mind... next the person sees train station S twice although in reality they only saw it once. The conscious mind becomes confused and believes what the subconscious made it see. It then gets off the train feeding the delusion. And an overall weird twilight zone effect is experienced. If it's only happened once then that is probably due to tiredness. More than once and perhaps there is an underlying issue. That is my opinion but obviously a professional is needed to decide that properly.

"Wife has dd any help is appreciated In nov 2017 my wife was intently watching Fox News. We live in Seattle and was taking cbd pills for Lyme disease related issues. The treat for Lyme was negative but she firmly believed that was her malady. She suffered physical abuse and multiple rapes during her teenage years. She worked sporadically over the past 10 years and would sleep sometimes 20 hrs per day. She developed a liking for the host tucker and I began to notice an attraction when he came on the screen. While odd we have been married 17 years so I really didn’t note any special significance other than a crush. As the days and weeks passed she eventually started to make gestures to him on the tv and would lookout the window. She had passed from crush to full on in love in a matter of days. I noticed she wanted to talk to Me about her desires towards him and would go into full detail about how he could see Her and she posed nude for him. I was angry and jealous. I thought by listening it was her talking it out and it would Pass. But it got deeper. She would go outside and wait for him. Because of a way he looked at the Screen/her. The more upset I got the more she retreated into her own world with him. She would use ky and go outside for A quickie with him. He never showed up. I tried to Explain how stupid this all was. She then Began to think he was coming in the apt at night and having intercourse with her. I asked how he got in and why I didn’t see him and she replied that he had to drug her so she wouldn’t remember him because of his fame. It was then that I realized that this was more than a fantasy. Suffice to say That she said that I allowed tucker to come in to The room and acted as the pimp for hundreds of other men. I was shocked and either I wanted her to go or she did for a rape analysis. We drove to the hospital where the er team had the svu officer come By to help.her story was odd to them and I told them about the tucker issue. They didn’t do a rape kit and said she was suffering with delusional behavior. We left with a referral to a shrink. She refused to go and the cycle continued with her saying .I was pimping her out to tucker and his friends. I read some on erotomania and shared it with her family. She ran out of the car in early may to find tucker and I called the police and informed them that I was very concerned blah blah. She was put into a mental hospital for two weeks. I had to testify against her to get her help. On the advice of a friend in the hospital they decided a crush is no big deal. She started to refuse my calls. I still went to see her and it was there she Told me that I had her locked up, pimped her out and she wanted a divorce. Upon release she left her wedding ring in the hospital as a sign of her hate and disgust For me. She still lives with me, refuses psychiatric help and is making my life worse than hell. She ridicules and belittles me. Demands money from petty cash. Calls me her driver. She actually kisses her iPad when tucker is on there. Talks to him like he is actually there. She has become arrogant and snobby. To prepare for her life with him. He won’t allow her to dress certain ways in public. She tells the story of her pimp husband to strangers everywhere. The weird thing is she can put together an act that fools people. She’s very pretty and is convinced that I am now Satan’s son. God does not like me. My dead parents are ashamed of me. God has appointed her to rewrite the New Testament. Etc.... every couple of days I try to speak to her. She asks if she’s on a game show or reality tv. She covered the bathroom mirror with my winter jacket for some reason. She talks about divorcing which I am fine with. Her family won’t help. Other than a cursory email. I see no end to this. We are now getting evicted because she smoked in the apt 3 times after warning. Sorry this is so long. But other than me moving and ditching her , I’m at a loss. Today I was supposed to think about what I did to her and be prepared to confess. I stay 3 to 4 he’s over at work every night. Her days are spent watching tucker and preparing for her new life. She is also A Consultant for trump Obama John McCain before and after death. She is friends with the Fox people and actually gets in cat fights over tucker. It is like living in an insane asylum F l"
Wife has dd any help is appreciated Some additional information that may help your opinion. My wife is 46 years old. I’m 50. This was a gut punch from life. The consensus from her brothers and mom is to have her get help or let her be homeless. That’s a lot easier said then done. If I grin and bear it she gets no help and her behavior will level off or sink deeper into into this madness. I can divorce her and walk away but I wouldn’t consider doing that to a dog much less a woman I loved. There is no answer from my view. She hates me so her inability to provide for herself and lack of sanity are impossible to talk about. She thinks she is working. It’s 930 pm and I still don’t want to go inside. I miss her yet the shell is still there. I forget once in awhile at night and yell out her name to tell her it’s time to go to bed and then it all returns like a rush of pure sadness. My eyes can’t yet look at her and see the sick her. They go back and see the old her.
"Wife has dd any help is appreciated update. My wife was assessed and taken into care. She hates me for it and may hate me forever. But I can’t watch her suffer everyday. Fighting against this invisible bully that is crushing her is too much without help. She thought that god empowered her to stop cars while crossing the street. I was horrified When she showed me how it was done, I literally got furious. This song describes the emptiness that I feel each time I have to put her in Hey there, Mr. Tin Man You don't know how lucky you are You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin' For something bound to fall apart Every time you're feeling empty Better thank your lucky stars If you ever felt one breaking You'd never want a heart Hey there, Mr. Tin Man You don't know how lucky you are I've been on the road that you're on It didn't get me very far You ain't missing nothing 'Cause love is so damn hard Take it from me, darling You don't want a heart Hey there, Mr. Tin Man I'm glad we talked this out You can take mine if you want it It's in pieces now By the way there, Mr. Tin Man If you don't mind the scars You give me your armor And you can have my heart"
Wife has dd any help is appreciated I would like to say thank you to the Seattle mental health workers and Police that came by on a Sunday to help my wife. They went out of their way to Make sure my wife’s civil rights and state &federal Laws were followed. Maybe it was polite and grateful privilege. Not here to Make a statement other than they had no idea what they we would find heading up the stairs. Maybe sir and ma’am go along way. I tried to imagine living in another place where the resources were not there. I will never do that again. It sometimes seems like I will never get A break from this dd that is consuming my Wife. It’s like a cancer that paralyzes and slowly destroys their personality. I don’t understand why certain mentally ill people are so scared by their illness and other illnesses make some paranoid and angry. I see why previous generations thought it was evil. Because that’s what it sounds and feels like. I would easily believe it was the devil. Don’t know what our odds are in making it? I would say 10 to 15% but I would rather roll the dice on a woman I love And fight like a junk yard dog. I feel for all of us on this forum. My hope is that we all make it.we all win. But it’s a long road.
"Wife has dd any help is appreciated As a side note: i have been looking into other causes for this dd appearance. My wife had a parathyroid adenoma removed in June 2017. She had elevated calcium, Low vitamin d, low phospurus and high pth levels for an undetermined time frame. I started researching a relationship and came across a few Surprises: this the letter I sent her surgeon Hi dr , you removed an Adenoma for in June 2017. I wanted to ask your opinion or advice on psychiatric issues that have become severe since her surgery. has not had any lab work done since September of last year. Her pth was at 80. started to develop delusions in dec of 2017. She has extreme paranoia , delusions, erotomania. Agitation etc. she was involuntary commuted in May 2018 and was released. She has been recommitted to as of the 9 th of sept. I understand that in the majority of patients the reverse order of symptoms occur. But is there a possibility that hypercalcemia, elevated pth , or low phosphorus could be a neurobiological response or over response to her chronically out of range levels. The reason I am asking you is that I trust you.’and the psychiatric journey is definitely not as precise nor has success rates equal to your expertise. I don’t know the depth of understanding that the psychiatrist at behavioral have of neurobiological endocrine issues. I have to testify tomorrow that I believe is dangerous to her self. I can’t do that except on a short term basis without the opinion and insight of a doctor of you caliber. Sincerely Me I found some interesting articles that show a Link between psychosis ,delusions, and host Of other psychiatric issues and hyperparathyroidism. “It is now recognized that hyperparathyroidism ismore common than was formerly believed; hence a knowledge of its unusual presenting manifesta- tions is important. A review of four large series1-4 revealed that mental symptoms were associated with this disorder in 4.2% of 405 cases.

She showed depressed facies and moderate psychomotor retardation, and expressed suicidal thoughts.

As a result of her behaviour, two daughters stil living at home had moved away. Hf.r symptoms had improved for two months when her husband obtained part-time work, but became even more intolerable when he returned to retirement. Concurrent with her paranoid symptoms were increasing symptoms of depression: feelings of sadness, los of energy and ambition, feelings of help- lessness and hopelessness, weight los, dificulty in sleeping, somatic preoccupation and suicidal rumina- tions.

"Wife has dd any help is appreciated Well it’s day 6 of her stay at the psych ward. I went to visit her the past 3 nights. It is truly sad that there are rules of engagement when going to see a loved one in the hospital, but not a hint of what to say or not say. She hates me for putting her in there. (Don’t blame her) it’s horrid. She wanted to know why and I told the truth which she didn’t want to hear. She had left her wedding ring there in the safe as huge fu to me and it worked. But I explained to her, I don’t want the ring back if it’s not attached to you. I asked if tucker was still in the picture. She looked offended and hurt but her reply was basically that she doesn’t think personal relationships are fair game. She offered me roommate status after stay and I said no. Your my wife or your not. I am so sick of arguing the same crap over and over. The psychiatrist there apparently didn’t read my notes on hyperparathyroidism or doesn’t care. That’s not even an issue. It feels like the whole thing is insane and I just opened the door and walked in the middle of it. I feel that I have to do the leg for her doctors and it’s not enough. I say blessings for anybody that has or had a loved one in a “behavioral center” you deserve medals for tolerating the bs and keep going back. You are hero’s. Well that’s it for tonight. I’m sitting in chipotle because I hate the empty house. My first hour everyday is re-telling my self what happened. For some reason I always want to talk with my wife in the morning. Old habits. I just want to forget. Forget how fu my life has become. Fu because it was the worst birthday I’ve had in 45 years. Fu because our anniversary and her birthday is coming up in a week. I just know it will make me look like a bigger jerk Than she thinks I am. I bought a card for both and they really don’t make so you have dd cards so I went with blank. Anyways thanks and keep on keeping on. (Joe dirt)"
"Wife has dd any help is appreciated Day 7 of psych ward. I watched a beautiful mind last night. I was scrolling through and I saw it and watched it. I felt like it was extremely accurate yet it was missing the parts for me that separate schizophrenia from dd. These are a real treat 1) ungrateful. I don’t see any hope that my wife will ever appreciate anything I do for her. 2) self promoting. I’ve never seen an illness that makes a person this egotistical. 3)my wife is becoming the type of person I’ve always hated. These patients don’t go out and hide. No no no they seek out people to tell about your evilness. 4)have no concern for others. Work etc.. 5) self absorbed/self obsessing assholes disease. That’s what my wife is now. I love her out of commitment. If somebody said yes but why do you love her? Honestly I don’t know anymore. I called her this am on the heels of watching the movie. Her plan was visible to me like a 2nd grader. She wants me to be evaluated for my mental fitness. She is trying to roll the staff onto her side. It’s sad but I don’t want to ever talk to her again. But if she needs something I’m supposed to drop everything and help. Pay for her apt, for her living expenses,. The gall of this is unbelievable. Not to mention I’m exhausted everyday andway I can be."

"Wife has dd any help is appreciated Thank you. It means a lot to me. Most of my family is deceased. My parents died when I was in my 20’s. All of my aunts and uncles are gone. My sister and I try to reconnect. She is in . Pittsburgh. My second cousin that Remaind has bi-polar. But this forum has become the love of my life. Thank you all for reading and understanding. It’s difficult to speak with my in laws, They see Both sides but I can hear the wording of the responses and it’s guarded. But I understand they don’t really want to take this on. My mother in law called my wife at the hospital. Bday wishes. I asked my mil Later how the call went. She said “good” but xxxx feels like your bullying her. I waited for the but we know you wouldn’t do that. It never came. I decided that I would go over and be a dutiful husband and visit. I asked a nurse to monitor is in case my wife is trying to Use me as an excuse. We talked about her life after the hospital and she said” I want to be married.hopefully this person is able to come through. I want to start my humanitarian work with him.” I asked what do you see my role as”? “the driver” she replied. I could only say “interesting”. Her plan is to leave the hospital. Call her driver. I’m supposed to pay her way to SFC and there she will get married and start her humanitarian work. The only issue I can See “ we are still married”. She said she was tired and left the room and returned hugging and whispered your my joe DiMaggio, Marilyn’s first husband. She patted me and said good night."
"Wife has dd any help is appreciated Last night we had a 3 minute conversation on the phone. I don’t know if it was real or temporary. Maybe both. It Doesn’t matter, for three minutes I had my best friend back. I actually made her laugh. If she ever does come out of this I wonder If it she will remember what happended.? If she doesn’t will she just go into full delusion.? We will find out I guess. Good night"
"Erotomania? My husband and I have been together for 31 years. He is Bipolar 1 and has had difficulties with psychosis, mania and depression many times during our life together. He has a tendency to think women are attracted to him, and are coming on to him. The last woman this happened with started in 2010. She attended our church and works at the same place he does, though not in the same department. He started to talk to her before church started. She is in the choir. Then, it moved on to emailing her a lot. He has done this other times. Emailing a few women he thought he was having a relationship with. Some of it was sexual in content. I don't know specifics about the content with this last one. He hasn't given them to me. But, in 2011, she had their employer warn him to stay away from her. The end of 2012, he became manic and phoned her. She had him arrested and ended up getting a restraining order against him. She then got a permanent restraining order against him in 2014. This woman was just one of many women who he was convinced was attracted and coming on to him. Recently, I had a conversation with him about this. He is totally convinced that these women were attracted to him. I know for a fact none of these women ever were interested in him. Obviously, the last woman made it extremely clear. Unfortunately, he thinks her husband made her arrest him and get a restraining order against him. Is this erotomania? Is it possible to talk sense into him? Make him see that none of these so-called attractions were real? He is a professor in a university. Recently, he told me that an attractive, young woman in his class flirted with him. But ""he did not take the bait, and pursue it."" He was quite proud of himself. I am very upset. I am sure that was not at all what happened. 20 year olds do not come on to 58 yr old men who look 75. I am worried that he could lose his job if he did ""act"" on an imagined come on. He almost lost his job twice because of the last woman with the restraining order. Sorry this is so long. Does this sound like Erotomania?"
"Mom has DD - Persecutory type and I am at a loss Hi, New here - quick introduction: my mother, in her 70's, has delusional disorder persecutory subtype. She's always been a little odd - a little paranoid, but about 8 or so years ago my stepfather died and she went totally off the rails. She moved into a townhouse, and then became convinced that the neighbors were out to get her. She thought they poisoned her dog, she thought they had bugged the townhouse, she thought they were pumping poison in through the air conditioner, that they were talking to the property manager to get her evicted, etc. etc.. I lived in a different state at that time and believed that maybe she had some bad neighbors (I mean, I knew they weren't poisoning her, but I could believe that maybe they were unpleasant). So she moved to a house in a different neighborhood, and again the same kind of delusions popped up, except now she was convinced she was hearing them talk about her, and somehow she became convinced that the old neighbors knew the new neighbors. She was overwrought with anxiety a lot of the time. Finally convinced her to see a geriatric psychiatrist, but she bitched about it, because she didn't think that there was anything wrong with her, and she wasn't compliant with med. So...I moved to another part of the country to start a new job, and because I was so stressed out from not being able to help from a distance I moved her up here too. First it took months to get her moved out of my house into her apartment (finally happened with something of a scene - she paid rent for four months without once sleeping in her apartment). Within a month, the paranoia set in again. Took her to a psychiatrist multiple times, but she incorporated the psychiatrist into her delusions. Moved her to a totally secure beautiful condo - doorman building, private garage, etc. - and she is convinced these neighbors are mafia and drug dealers and that they know the old evil neighbors. She thinks they are destroying her hearing, that they're trying to drill through her ceiling to abduct her, and that they are shooting lasers at her to make her blind (through the floor, ceiling, walls) but that aluminum foil can protect her. She also had a delusion involving my aunts, so now isn't speaking to them. This winter I caught her sleeping in her car to avoid the neighbors, took her to the ER, and she was committed for a short stay, but after 3 or 4 days when she wouldn't sign herself in, they let her out. Then a new psychiatrist, drugs that seem to do nothing, and she won't take anything that would make her sleepy because she feels like she needs to be vigilant all night. She spends almost all day everyday at my house, which drives my husband and kids crazy because it is just one thing about the neighbors after another. It stresses me out and depresses me. I have no family to help shoulder the load on this. I hate it because she could be having a nice life, but she's making herself miserable for no reason. I know she's hiding things from me because she knows I don't believe people are out to get her - like she asked a friend to take her to a hotel last night to get away from the neighbors, or that she sleeps in her closet sometimes. If you look at her, she seems put together - nicely dressed, pays her bills, drives, highly articulate and intelligent. She does have some short term memory issues the last year or two leading to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, but it is pretty mild. I feel so hopeless. I can't help her. She doesn't get better. She is petrified of being by herself, but it is impossible to have her move in with us because it is so hard to hear the paranoid ranting all day. She called the police on the neighbors the other day, and I had to go behind her and call them the next day when I found out, to explain her diagnosis and that the people upstairs aren't actually doing anything wrong... Sorry for unloading, it is just so hard right now. Anyone have advice? Or can let me know I'm not alone? Thanks."
"Mom has DD - Persecutory type and I am at a loss Hi TennesseeGal, I'm sorry you're going through this about your mom. I know how it feels to have nearly that exact scenario and it's so unusual and heavy that you can't really talk about it to people because it's too much. My husband and kids are supportive, but I try to shield them from the responsibility and burden. Thankfully, I can call my sister to vent once in a while, but she lives very far away. My mom is also in her 70s, and we've been dealing with her delusions for the past 9 years. She was married to a nice man, they'd been together for about 30 years. But suddenly she began to think he was damaging her furniture or knotting up the fringe on her blanket or scratching her paintings. Really weird stuff. Though, she also thought he was having multiple affairs with neighbors or even acquaintances of mine. Three years into her delusions, during which I'd been conferring with doctors, elder specialists, and talked her into seeing a counselor, there was no change. Then she snapped and thought her husband was going to kill her. She called police and then was willing to go to a geriatric psych unit for two weeks. They, like previous doctors, diagnosed psychosis with delusions. But she refuses that diagnosis and won't take medications. She is now divorced and living in an apartment. She has become more vocal about her suspicions, telling her friends that her ex-husband is stalking her, that he enters her apartment to damage her things all the time. She spends money on surveillance, cameras, and alarm system. She complains to her apartment manager and calls police occasionally about the 'break-ins', and the police have contacted us so we can share information. The police agree that she's got all her abilities - paying bills, keeping her apartment nice, etc. She's super smart, funny, very pretty, and stylish. This brain illness is so tragic. She says she wants to move to get away from her ex-husband (who we still keep in contact with and help take care of, but in secret from her - so complicated). I know I can't stop her from moving to another city if she ends up really planning that, but I also know that wherever she goes, some delusion will be there always. Even if her ex-husband died, I know she'd still believe he's somehow hired someone to break in, or blow dust on her, even beyond his death. The staff at the psychiatric unit where she was in 2012 let us know that we can set limits on what we allow in our house. So if she starts talking about her delusions, I don't engage and I tell her I'll have to take her home if she continues. I've talked recently with county elder specialists, and they, too, told me to guard my own peace of mind. The professionals said I cannot let my mom's upset affect my life, and that I can't ease her discomfort. It's hard for me, because I really wish I could help her. I've tried so many ways, to no avail. So now I see her about once every 10 days, help her get groceries, or sort papers, or take her to lunch. We connect by text or phone every few days and I listen to her current suspicions because I want to keep tabs on her actions. She does keep secrets from me because she knows I don't believe her, but sometimes she lets something slip, like a new suspicion, or that she's filed a new complaint somewhere. I used to think my mom could live with us when she got older, but not now. Her being so upset is unpredictable and troubling, and being with her is full of tension, with us guarding against what topic she's about to bring up. She's not violent, but I don't know what her delusions could bring her to do. When she stayed here for 3 nights recently because of a minor medical procedure, I locked my bedroom door at night (our kids are at college). I feel for you, and it's helpful for me to hear that there are others experiencing this with a parent, too."
"Mom has DD - Persecutory type and I am at a loss When I read parts of your post, it sounded as though I had written it. My Mom has been dealing with DD for 3 years. It can totally stress you. I exercise at least 2 or 3 nights a week. I have found it helps relieve my stress. I have learned not to argue with her but rather try to distract her by going shopping, for a ride, or eating ice cream. I have a schedule. I visit her Wednesday and Friday after work and go to church, when she feels good, and out to eat on Sunday. It is hard on you and your family as well. I have no siblings. I understand exactly what you are dealing with."
"Mom has DD - Persecutory type and I am at a loss I have delusional disorder and every thing you described is exactly what I experienced. My delusions became so bad because I believed people were trying to hurt me like your mother feels and I wound up committing a crime so I could get to a ""safe place"" where they couldn't easily get to me. I was very resistant to taking medication because my delusions were so real to me and know one understood that they were real so I became very secretive about it. I am on a regimen of Loxapine and Klonopin which help with the symptoms. I have been delusional free for two years now and I am trying to reestablish my life. The best advice I could offer is to get her a therapist to work with her. Someone that she can trust and talk to about what is going on. The worst thing is for her to keep it inside because the behaviors will escalate if she is convinced these things are going on. I was fortunate to have a good therapist who went through my delusions one by one and brought me back from over the edge. I was lost for 10 years and destroyed my life but am in the process of rebuilding. Don't give up on her she can be helped. Delusional disorder is hard to treat because generally people deny they are delusional. Everything you described I experienced and it was a living hell to have those feelings. Be persistent about getting her treatment. There are no support groups out there for this disorder so psychotherapy is your best bet. Shop around to find the right fit for her, someone she trusts. That is the key because you are suspicious about everyone. Good Luck Colleen"
"Mom has DD - Persecutory type and I am at a loss Hi there I previously wrote a whole reply and lost it so fingers crossed this time. Sorry to hear you're having such a hard time with your Mum. Unfortunately my situation is quite similar, but without the hubby and kids. My Mum is 72 and the delusional disorder started around 15 years ago. She has also always been a bit paranoid. My Mums delusions are very similar. She thinks one of the neighbours has bugged the house and is harming her through the electrics/wifi (sending shocks etc). My Mum also believes aluminium foil or a baking tray can protect her. My brother lives abroad so it's just me. It's very, very hard. These aren't my words, but they are from another carer for someone with a mental illness and sum things up pretty well. They described the situation as 'heartbreaking, isolating and testing to the soul'. The situation weighs very heavily on you and takes a huge toll. The paranoid ranting is very hard. My Mums issues were always 'episodes', but this current episode has lasted since May and is not going away. To be honest, the fact that her illness was episodic kept me going as I knew that the DD would eventually go away and there would be a period of respite, however brief. Also my Mum has started to get more 'manic' and irrational about normal thing and has a lot of mood swings. She got massively stressed out and irrational about cleaning the living room earlier. You'd think it was a cesspit, it isnt... She's also been quite mean recently....it seems like I do nothing right which is devastating when you're going through hell to support someone you care about. My Mum has tried almost every antipsychotic out there and as soon as she reaches an efficacious dose the side effects (fatigue, sleepiness) become intolerable. I'm sorry I can't be more positive about the situation, but at least we're not entirely alone in this. I'm in the UK and would really like to get in touch with others dealing with this. I'd really like to hear more about your experiences Colleen, but I'll write a separate post before I lose everything I've written. Take care G"
"Mom has DD - Persecutory type and I am at a loss Hello everyone Thank you so much for sharing your stories it greatly helps me to understand what is going on in my world. But it also saddens me that you are unable to find a solution for your mother's condition. Cuz I am in the same boat as you. My story is I am 28 years old I just had surgery which requires to me to be in a wheelchair for extended time so I moved in with my mom while I recover. My mom is married but her husband and her do not live together they still talk and hang out occasionally and they never had the best relationship so fighting was a common thing between them. but after being here a few months I started to notice things were off with my mom, my mom is 55 years old. She is the same as yours well put together very smart outside looking in you won't even notice a problem.then she started talking about how her husband his name is Jason was spying on her bugging the house, writing random letters all over to mess with her, listening to her via the TV or a speaker, saying he learned all this stuff through international website that he translates with apps. At first I thought maybe he was messing with her in a certain degree and she wishes taking it out of context but then I started really digging into what she was saying and I would prove everything wrong and yet it still wouldn't resonate with her. I could tell her and show her what she was experiencing was just a app and that's what it does but she always correlated it to something he was doing against her. And now it is only getting worse she is convinced that he is planning something big in her new delusion is that he is trying to convince me that she is crazy so I can't even discuss that a possibility of her not being okay and needs help because she thinks that he is winning.the other night she knocked on my door at 1 a.m. and was super energized and said look I can show you I found them I got it and she was show me a piece of wood she was saying in that used to be part are they shelf and she was look look. She was showing me a blank piece of wood and she owes look right there look at those letters. But there was no letters there and this really shocked me this is when it really dawned on me this is more serious and I thought that my mom truly needs help. I'm a firefighter paramedic and I see psychiatric patients all the time but my job is to take him to the hospital I don't know what to do after this. I can't talk to my mom about this because she just thinks her husband is winning and that's what he's trying to do she is convinced and there's nothing I can say to help her. it breaks my heart so much that people struggle with this for so long without any answers or solutions. It seems to be like my next step would be tried to convince her to go get help which I do not know if that will be possible. Or even if it is possible for me reading post it seems like sometimes that doesn't even help possible now I am very torn on what do I do once I am able to get out of this wheelchair and go back to work and go back to my place. Do I leave her to deal with this on her own I can't imagine doing that to her but I don't know what else I can do to help her I am so lost right now."
"Mom has DD - Persecutory type and I am at a loss I’m so sorry you are dealing with this. You can either remain silent and let her delusions continue to envelope you, or you can speak up. You can identify one of her delusions that just cannot be proved, discuss it with her, and ask if she thinks her brain is playing tricks on her. You need to decide which route is least painful for you, because that’s what it boils down it. Me, I chose honesty and to discuss it with my DD husband. It’s now subsided at this time, but I suspect he’s hiding his thoughts from me."
"Question for DDJ partners? Safe to holiday? Hi everyone. My DDJ husband and I separated 2 months ago but we are still very much in contact several times a day. He is still in denial though does take his recommended dose of Risperidon every day. We don't really discuss my imaginary 'affair' as he has pretty much closed the dialog on that conversation which is hard for me, because to me it means we can never, ever reconcile. This is probably a good thing I guess but I'm still looking for closure. I know that he will probably never give me the closure (remorse, apology, recognition that his behaviour was really horrible etc) that I need but we have planned a family getaway at the end of next week. We had always talked about taking the kids to a particular destination and this is the trip we are doing. 5 nights away in a remote(ish) but high tourism location. My question is: given that my husband has never been violent - not even a little bit - and he is taking his meds, should I be worried about my safety at all? I know this is difficult to answer. I wouldn't have booked it if I had any concerns but I'm just wondering if anyone has ever had a problem with a placid DDJ sufferer suddenly turning violent?"
"Husband with Delusional Jealousy - no hope? Hi. I have been reading everyone else's posts on this topic and while I've accepted what is happening and why, I wanted to do a mind dump for others to read before they become the same fragile mess I have become. This will be a long post but hoping that it helps others and also hoping that getting it all down will be therapeutic for me as well. Here goes: My husband and I have been together for 17 years, married for 2. We always had a difficult relationship because we are very different people who really just came together accidentally. That is important in our back story but it's the last two years that have nearly killed me emotionally. About 3 years ago, while I was working away from home, the distance did amazing things for our relationship and we fell madly in love with each other for the first time since the early days. When my work wrapped up, things just got better and better - I never thought I could love this man as much as I did. When I was driving across the country on my way home, the kids and he were using my computer to check where I was as it was a two day drive and I always keep my Google location services on. On my second day of travel, my husband rang and said he'd been up all night worrying as apparently Google maps showed that I didn't go home to my apartment on my second last night. I laughed it off because when you look at the 'pings' on google, you could see quite clearly that I did go home even if the main map made it look like I hadn't. My husband mostly accepted what I said but he was actually dwelling on it. No matter how I explained it, he started analyzing other things. Things like: - Why sometimes I was cold on the phone when working away (this was mainly because refused to get a job and I was getting cranky about making the sacrifice of working away from him and the kids and despite the excellent pay, it didn't really get us ahead because he wasn't working and was using marijuana on a daily basis). Also, he has always had a habit of being a bit stalky with repeated phone calls for no particular reason and I had other things to do. I should also mention that my best friend of 30 years was on her death bed with a brain tumor and iI was a bit of mess over this. - Why did it take me so long to clean my 1 bedroom apartment before packing up - I wanted my bond back and knew how particular agents could be with bond cleaning so I cleaned everything meticulously. These discussions were initially very low key events but over time, my husband developed a couple of theories. First theory was that I met someone out and didn't go home one night because I spent the night with the guy. Once that was debunked, the theory was that I met someone in the basement of the apartment complex and then regularly left my unit to go and spend the night with him. That theory fizzled so then he started focusing on cars at the local shopping centers that had number plates from the state my work was based in. The theory was that the guy I was having an affair with moved his entire family up here to be close to me so we could sneak quickies in whenever we wanted. After a while, he found a guy in our area to fixate on. This guy apparently looked weirdly at him and I in the supermarket and someone similar to his description was seen on our street one night. The guy he fixated on was a parent at the kids school and he went around to their house to talk to the wife. He found out that the guy worked as a miner FIFO so whenever he saw the guy was home from work, he started watching me and analyzing every thing I did and every move I made. Some of his evidence an accusations we- The guy is tall and probably well endowed and sex wasn't as good any more because the man had stretched me. - I must have pubic lice because he'd seen me scratching even though this clearly wasn't the case. - Any song I listened to had hidden meaning because the guy had sent it to me. - A guy from my work sent me a message after we got engaged saying 'so, you've been swept off your feet?'. According to my husband, this had nothing to do with him - it must have been the imaginary affair guy. - One morning he found a small puddle of water on our front deck. This could only have been due to me getting up in the middle of the night, having sex with my lover and washing away the evidence. - Another morning, a small piece of timber had fallen off the top of our deck and this can only have been due to my tall lover pulling it off. - Some plants out the front half died. My lover must have peed on them. - I got sick last year with a kidney stone which resulted in a UTI. These two things must have happened because I'm sleeping around. - I am nearing menopause and was using extra large tampons. I discretely bought some personal lube to assist which he found and decided it was for my lover and I. - Hubby has had heart problems and at one stage, he asked the Dr if it could be that he's being poisoned. - When he takes the kids to school (round trip of 6 - 8 minutes), my lover is hiding nearby and we have sex while he's out. That is just some of it. I arranged and payed for a lie detector test and this is something I wish I had never done. I was so upset and stressed that the result came back inconclusive so in his eyes, this is also evidence that I am a lying, cheating #$%^. At one stage I had to take out a DVO because he was making me wear a fitbit to bed and night and he was getting pretty scary for a while. Happy to say that he is not violent and has never gotten physical with me. I'm embarrassed to say that I married him while this was all going on though it wasn't until after we got married that he became 100% convinced that I was cheating on him. Before that it was - 'now that we are engaged, I trust you' & 'once we are married....' etc. In 17 years, I have never even looked at another man and I have extremely high morals and standards. I have never cheated on anyone and never would. My husband used to look at me with love in his eyes and heart but now he just looks at me like I'm his worst enemy. Denials don't work. Arguing doesn't work. At the end of the day, he has a fixed belief that he knows what is going on and no matter what I say, I'm guilty. I have been a prisoner in my own home for over a year. I can go out if I really want but the repercussions aren't really worth it. If I take too long at the grocery shop, it means I've hooked up. If I stop to get fuel on the way back from my parents house, I've hooked up in a car park or somewhere public. If I shave my legs or wax my bikini line, it's obviously for my lover. I barely get any time alone and he has set up hidden recording devices around the house. One day, he listened to an audio recording that I think was the dog snoring, and I was accused of having someone here as the noises can only have been made by someone having sex. Another day, he asked (yelled) me why I had put a video of myself having sex with my lover on his phone. He had deleted the video and couldn't show me but he says it was videoed on his phone from a site like YouPorn. Apparently, I have uploaded these videos of myself to youporn. As I'm writing this, my other half is meeting with a psychiatrist. I don't know how this will play out but he agreed to go on the condition that I also go and get checked our for a personality order like bi-polar or something because he believes I'm a compulsive liar and narcissist because of what he thinks I'm doing to him. He has only really gone to prove that I have a problem so I don't think it's going to help. I will post updates as events unfold. At this stage, I don't believe we have a future and we are planning to separate. Main reason is that I just can't deal with it anymore. I have not done a single thing wrong, yet I feel guilty every time I do something that he may read something into. I feel unloved, disrespected, emotionally drained and my health hasn't been great since this all started. I think we are at the point of having a very toxic relationship and it's not doing either of us any good. I guess the most frustrating thing for me is the no-end arguments where he keeps telling me that 'he knows what's going on' and there is nothing wrong with him at all."
"Husband with Delusional Jealousy - no hope? A week after the psychiatrist appointment and I haven't really gotten much information about how it went though, the psych has scheduled an appointment for me to come in at hubby's next appointment. We both had individual appts with our relationship counsellor yesterday and she advised me (and said she also advised him) that due to the toxic nature of our relationship, if something doesn't give, she is going to have to get Child Protection involved. She is encouraging me to move out or make him move out though this isn't something he would ever do. I sat him down when I got home and we discussed the planned separation. I told him that I'm moving out asap and the kids will have their home base with me but he can see them whenever he wants. Naturally this wasn't taken very well and a huge argument followed. I am extremely confused now. He is now trying to convince me that the affair he has accused me of having has never really been the problem. The problem is that he believes someone is stalking around our house and has been in our house and if I know nothing about it, then it must be someone who means harm. I tried to rationalize with him on this. Nothing has been stolen and no property damage except for a couple of half dead plants outside have happened. Why would someone be stalking us? Why haven't our cameras caught this person? Why haven't our neighbors seen anything? He doesn't have any answers but most of his evidence of this is all a bit fuzzy. Two things of about 20 could mean someone has been hanging around but someone is home here 95% of the time, so it all sounds a bit unlikely. The two things are quite substantial. 1. He has an outdoor camera he had placed around the side of the house. One day he brought it in (only out for a day) and he discovered the memory card was missing. Obviously this is sus but it disappeared when we were home and it's weird that the camera didn't get taken as well as it was just sitting there. There are only 3 possibilities: - Around that day the electric meter checking guy was around. The camera was on the meter box. We have some junk in that part of the yard. Perhaps he was poking around the junk and realised the camera was there and took the card so we didn't see what he was doing. - Hubby forgot to put the card in - they are very tiny and would be easy to misplace - Someone is stalking us 2. Some of our outdoor downlights (solar) have switches on them that have apparently been turned off. No idea about either of these two things but as mentioned, these are the only two substantial things he has seen. The rest are as stated in the first post but include plants that have half died, footsteps around the side (pretty much proved to be our large dog), solar light falling off the gutter, small bit of wood falling off the top of the front deck, puddle on the front deck, side fence has started leaning a bit. He says there's lots of other things but hasn't actually told me them. Anyway, I don't know whether he is just scrambling with this new revelation (about the problem not being me potentially having an affair) to keep me here or whether I'm going mad and I've been dwelling for a long time on the accusations and I'm the one who has kept it going. Logic tells me that I'm not going mad because he often splurts random accusations though often quite cryptic. Eg ""You like your men BIG"" (Hubby is not particularly tall but he is lean and fit) or ""The door handle is warm as if you've been hanging on to it watching for me to come home (sometimes he'll say that I'm being mounted by my other man while hanging onto it). I think I've become a bit acclimatized to the comments now because when I read back that last comment, I realize how disgustingly sick it sounds."
"Husband with Delusional Jealousy - no hope? Thanks for sharing your story, SshhBear; it has common elements with many of the stories that have been posted here over the years. I'm sorry that you're going through this. I think that at this point a divorce--and moving away from your husband--will give you both some peace. From the stories I've read here, it seems that a very tiny few have made recoveries. Usually with a combination of medication and therapy. However, the obstacle to this treatment is ""lack of insight"" which accompanies DD. It's the inability for a DD sufferer to recognize that something's wrong with his or her thinking. Like your husband they think ""there's nothing wrong with me"", and they refuse to accept medication. If he won't accept medication, then there is NOTHING further you can do to help him. You can't fix him. At this point, you can only help yourself. You can do this by minimizing your contact with him; this will reduce your own anxiety that is caused by his behavior."
"Husband with Delusional Jealousy - no hope? Update. I bought another house and moved out of our family home 2 days ago. I cried a lot the last few weeks because I really didn't want to leave him. I had to for my own sake - I was getting more and more depressed and he interpreted my mental state as me having doubts as to whether I was doing the right thing. I know I did the right thing but it doesn't make it any easier. I don't know whether my current emotional state is due to this unresolved thing hanging over my head or because I grieving over my lost love. I am doing most things right though yesterday we sent each other a lot of silly flirty texts. I miss my husband but if I was still in the house, I would still miss him because he doesn't trust me or look at me with love anymore. Good news is that the psychiatrist prescribed Respiridon and while he ignored the prescription for the first couple of weeks, he did fill it and has been taking his tablets and has been to the psychiatrist 3 times with a 4th appt scheduled in 11 days time. I hope he goes. At the second visit, the psych told him that it's a pretty good bet that he has a mental health condition and privately told me that delusional jealousy was the likely culprit. Hubby doesn't believe still. The Risperidon isn't helping unfortunately. He took a low dose for the first couple of weeks (1mg) but now I think he's up to 3 or 4 mg. Hasn't had any impact - his beliefs may have actually become more concrete and he doesn't want me to talk about it to him at all. I understand that not talking about it would be better for him but god help me, I need closure. My moral compass is soooo strong and it makes me crazy knowing that someone in this world, worst still the person who knows me best believes I would do something like this. It's eating me up. I'm going to start daily yoga and meditation as soon as I have my boxes unpacked because I really need to find inner peace with this thing. At several times during my ordeal, I locked myself in our bathroom and curled up on the floor in complete despair. Luckily I never felt suicidal but I did have fleeting thoughts in times when I felt everything was hopeless. So glad I made it out while I still had a shred of sanity. I'll update in another week or so. On a lighter note, after a particularly sad day last week, I was curious just how my body could keep producing tears and nose goop. I collected three of my tissues and weighed them. 400g! Wow! No wonder my skin looks dry at the moment. I must have cried kilos over the last year PS If anyone is going through the same thing, drop me a line for a chat if you need someone to talk to. I am still on my journey despite moving out and I would love to help anyone who wants a mutually beneficial sounding board."
"Husband with Delusional Jealousy - no hope? Having a bad day today. Actually, most days are bad. I am so miserable without him but know we can't be together anymore. I think the thing that is making me so sad is that I honestly thought he would come to his senses at some stage after i moved out, search his soul for the truth, then smother me with apologies for the way he has treated me before begging me to come back. Wow! I was living in a dream world, wasn't I? The reality is that his medication is for 'making him feel better and getting rid of the constant butterflies in his stomach' according to him whereas I was hopeful that it would make him think clearer and see the truth. I suppose he's right but in the meantime, he still thinks there's nothing wrong with him, I'm still a cheating, lying s%$t I have no company at all for 4 days every week and I'm obsessing over the whole thing. Worst of all, after I stood by this behaviour for 2 solid years, he's not here for me when I am literally falling apart. I can't talk to any friends about it because that would be speaking against him to common friends/family, I can't talk to my sister because she's been my sounding board and is sick of hearing about it and if I try to talk to him, he thinks I'm pathetic and tells me he's losing more respect for me each time I bring it up. I know that no one is going to ride up on a while horse and make everything better, but at this stage, I would be happy with a small pony coming to the rescue. I don't know if I'll be ok. I'm seeing a counsellor but she's away until early August. I probably need to go to the drs and discuss depression but that is not my style at all. I had post natal depression with my second child and I managed to pull myself out of it without medication and I'm hoping I can do the same this time. I really don't want any medication to fix me. I just want my husband back. And that puts me between a rock and a hard place because in the .01% chance he comes back from his delusional state and I let him, my family and few friends won't accept my decision due to what they think of him now. I've always made a point of telling them it's not his fault - it's the illness - but he hasn't always been a good partner and they are happy that I've finally left him. I'm just rambling today, sorry. It has just been such a hard thing to deal with."
"Husband with Delusional Jealousy - no hope? Hi SshhBear, I'm sorry you are going through this. But I think you absolutely did the right thing in leaving. From reading about this illness over the last decade since my mom's brain went haywire, very few are able to see that they have the illness. And my mom has gotten much worse. My mom's suspicions are continual, no matter where she is, whether at home or visiting someone, and have gotten even stronger. Her delusions change and morph and she still rewrites conversations and occurrences, even ones she had a previous story for, they are now even more different. She has also now developed auditory and olfactory hallucinations, where she thinks her ex-husband (she hasn't even seen him in 7 years) is blowing a toxic vapor into her apartment, and he's also whistling or singing nearby, just to drive her crazy. In reality, he is now elderly and lives over 2 hours away. I tried telling her that, but now she says he's in her apartment building while using a walker. I dread the days that I visit with her when she says she ""has to tell me what's been going on"". She calls the police occasionally to report the ""break-ins"". The police have spoken with me and they have her on their crisis care list. She totally thinks they believe her. I know they are just trained to not refute a person with delusions. At the beginning, her delusions were jealousy-type. She accused her then-husband of having multiple affairs all over the place, once following him to the gym, and she wanted to confront a lady down the hall. Later, she began thinking he was going through her papers, and then later she began thinking he wanted to harm her. Anyway, I'm telling you this not to alarm anyone, but just to describe the progression this illness can take. We were so hopeful in the beginning when she had a hospital episode and was diagnosed, and was seeing a mental health person for quite a while, but her delusions never went away. It took us a few years to sort of fully realize our mom is permanently ill, and for the angst and stress over it all to dissipate. I saw a counselor for a while, just to come to grips with it, and to help establish my boundaries. I've spoken with a couple attorneys and mental health experts, and all have said there's nothing I can do. I consider my job now just to make sure she's okay, and we see her and try to be nice, but we limit the conversation topics, and limit the time we spend with her. It's all super sad. I hope you find peace, and someone or a mental health group to talk to. It's hard when this illness is so rare, with the seriously mentally ill person able to function otherwise, that others really can't understand what you're going through."
"Husband with Delusional Jealousy - no hope? Hi Sshbear, I just wanted to tell you that you are not alone and you are moving in the right direction. Your story is my story (almost word for word). I too have just made the decision to put myself and my children first and move out. It was too toxic. It never stopped. I am exhausted trying to defend myself and i am now at the point where i just loose my $#%^ at him whenever he brings up an accusation. So it was time to go. I told him I havent given up on him and I'll be here waiting for him when he can see things for what they really are. I know that my never happen. And I know my marriage is most likely over but I realise now after struggling and being tormented for 3 years that nothing i say or do will change my husbands mind about what I havent done. And I am slowly coming to the conclusion that my husband will never forgive me for something I didnt do. Its heartbreaking. I finally made the decision to get professional help for him and as of today it is completely out of my hands. He works away week on week off and last night shift he dudnt sleep for 3 days and completely went off the rails. Told me to ###$ off and get out of the house, that he loved me but I didnt deserve him and he was gone. Hes never said that and a big red flag went off in my head. ""I need to save my husband from himself - this really has nothing to do with me"" so I made the decision to call our local mental health community clinic. I told them my story of secret cameras, tracking my car, cloning my phone, the hours upon hours of studying the recordings, the 2 years of unemployment, the not coping with life, the daily wild accusations and imagined scenarios etc and the newest finding. METH. My husband was a pot smoker too and in searching for answers I tricked him into a urine test. He failed miserably and I was heartbroken. .. but it explained alot of his behaviours. Alot but not all. Here I was being accused of being a liar and a sneak, all the while my husband was sneaking ice into our house .. and I was unknowingly buying it for him. So right now, as we speak a revision board is being assembled to assess my case and within the next 7 days my husband will have his rights taken away from him and he will be taken by ambulance to the hospital to be assessed and treated. I feel sick about it. I want to throw up. I know he will see this as the ultimate betrayal but I know I've exhausted all other options. This man is destroying himself, his family, his marriage and his career and I've been sitting there hopelessly fighting a battle I CAN NOT WIN. I know that things have not gotten better, I have tried being patient, understanding, silent. I have tried reasoning, common sense, begging, threatening and now all I'm left with is the realization that this is beyond his and my control. I love this man with all my heart. I would never dream of cheating on him. Ever. Period. But this is not the man I married and I cant stay with him the way he is as I'm his trigger and he is destroying me. The ironic thing is that although he will see this as the ultimate betrayal it is in actual fact the ultimate act of love. I know I'm sacrificing my marriage to try and save this beautiful man. Hopefully one day he will understand. If there is one piece of advice I can give. Remember that this actually isnt about you. And you will only destroy yourself trying to fix it on your own. If you believe his delusions are plummeting him into a depression, get him help and let them take it out of your hands then be kind to yourself and talk to a professional about the HELL you have been through (because it is a living hell) and no one goes through this unscathed. Xo"
"Husband with Delusional Jealousy - no hope? Thank you beautiful people for your replies. It's so heartbreaking isn't it? I have tried to enlist members of my husband's family to help and they are really supportive when I call them but then I don't hear back from them so I don't know if he convinces them of 'what he knows' and then they don't bother getting back in touch or if it's because they just can't be bothered with it all. I have thought about trying to get myself into a 'rebound' relationship just to distract myself from obsessing over what I haven't tried yet. I have even pulled out an old deck of tarot cards (with no experience or knowledge aside from a quick google) to get answers and they appear to be freakishly right every time though of course, they can be interpretted to whatever fits a person's circumstances. Don't judge me for going spiritual - I will try just about anything at this stage. Faithfullyfedup, did you have any luck with showing him similar stories on forums such as this? I find when reading other people's stories, some delusions seem to be the norm. Eg - The middle of the night meetings with these lovers - The hyper vigilance etc - Limiting their other half's movements - Blaming the other person of having mental health problems etc - Thinking the other person is lying about everything I have also thought about calling the hospital to take him for an assessment but he smokes daily and because of it, he is calm most of the time. If anything it's me who loses the plot when we argue. I never really felt there was a right time. I might make some enquiries about triggers to watch for in terms of getting him help. He's still taking Respiridon (or says he is) but he did tell me that after his last psychiatrist appointment he probably won't go back. Faithfullyfedup, how did you go with him being taken away? Did it happen? Also what about your kids? The best I could convince him of was 50/50 shared care so this is in place now but I do worry a little about the kids. They are 12 and 14 so not silly and they know the basics around what is going on, but really don't want to know anything else which is good. They love their dad and he loves them with all his heart so I believe they are safe. I guess my only concern is knowing how this condition can escalate. Originally I put my foot down and insisted I have them 4 nights but because 'there's nothing wrong with him' he stomped on that after the first week and pressured me into the 50/50. While I do love him, he has always had a knack for being quite intimidating and I'm a people pleaser so that makes it hard to stand my ground with things like this. I had one conversation a month ago when I asked him when the last time he thinks I was with this lover and he said it was two nights ago. I said ""Really? Because I've been on my period for the last 3 days"" and he knows that my first 3-5 days are insanely heavy. His reply was, ""Yeah but that doesn't bother this bloke!"" Never mind that it would bother me. I find that now, when we talk on the phone, he will tell me that I am the only person who can fix the problem (unsaid: by ending the affair and not lying anymore) and if I try to reason with him, he tells me that he is losing more and more respect for me every time we discuss it. He says he just wants me to come clean and stop living my life as a big lie. He sent me a text a couple of days ago telling me that he thinks I'm like a gay person who hasn't come out yet and is struggling with the decisions I've made. Oh my god! It is so, so, so frustrating!!!!"
"Husband with Delusional Jealousy - no hope? So, my husband gave me permission to speak with his psychiatrist. The psychiatrist confirmed that he hasn't given my husband a diagnosis because he didn't want him to leave and not come back. Confirmed psychosis and ddj and told me to not consider reconciling. He said he won't get better without treatment and because my husband has stopped attending appointments, I am welcome to tell him the diagnosis in the hopes that he comes back. Problem is that my husband told me I am never again to bring up the subject of mental health or delusional jealousy. I plan to share the info but just need to find the right time. I spent the night with him last night (just company, nothing else) though I did think for a long time on whether I was putting myself at risk in doing this. I was pretty certain it would be ok except for making the emotional ties more difficult to break. It was nice though and we didn't speak of anything unpleasant. I know it was probably a silly choice but it's done now. I'll keep updating as things go. I know this condition has a small number that make a full recovery but I do still have hope because this very stubborn man has made difficult, positive changes in the past when at crossroads in life."
"Husband with Delusional Jealousy - no hope? Hi Sshbear, sorry for the late response, it's been a hectic week. So from my last post, I managed to hold mental health off from taking him.... he sucks me in every time I see him (I check he is ok constantly- big mistake) he found his own psychologist and did attend his appointment but I went away to visit family with the kids and he couldnt handle it. He called me in hysterics saying he had found a video on my laptop of 5 guys in our room and 2 girls with dildos and d***ks and one guy was holding a shot gun while I was with someone on the bed. Insane. I called mental health that morning and he was picked up the next day. Today was the first day I saw him. Absolutely broke my heart. All he did was plead for me to get him out which I cant do. He has absolutely no idea why he is there.... but in the next breath he was questioning me about why I had 5 guys in our room and how cruel I am. He needs to be there. Its literally like a jail, but it has to be, he was already asking me to lie for him and bring a disguise in for him to sneak out. But it does work. He hates it so much that he is willingly taking all the meds to get out. They believe he will be non compliant when he leaves in a few weeks as he has zero insight so his meds will be administered by needle at the hospital. If he doesn't show up the police bring him in. He will most likely be under the mental health act for years but if this is what it takes to get him better so he isnt living a hell every day it's worth it. Might cost me my marriage but it was doomed anyway. There is absolutely no shot in hell of fixing this yourself. The doctors said that answering or feeding into his delusions is really detrimental as it concrete in their mind that they have reason to be concerned. It's so hard to stop defending but it's getting easier to steer him away from it. It's a massive relief knowing that he is eating, sleeping and safe. Hes on anti psychotic meds and is heavily sedated which makes seeing him alot easier as he is alot calmer to talk too now. Its heart breaking and so so sad seeing him literally drinking out of a paper cup and walking around barefoot in a maximum security section but truly, the only other option is to give up on him because I cant help (and my patience is now zero) and watch him self destruct. I love him way too much to do that. For the first time I have a little bit of hope. I sent him a heap of reading material about delusional jealousy disorder and he literally said these people are crazy, I'm nothing like them stop putting a label on me and refused to talk about it. Our kids are 9 & 13, they both adore him but both understand that he isnt dad at the moment. They wont be seeing him while he is in there but they know he needs meds to get better. I've got everything crossed that this will work. I had my first real glimpse of insight today when I said that he needs to accept the possiblity that he could be hearing and seeing things that arnt there. He said if I'm wrong, and my mind is playing tricks on me I'm truly sorry for everything I've done to you and I'll spend a lifetime making it up to you. I will hold onto that sentence forever."
"husband with delusional jealousy helloo, this is kind of long but i kinda need to vent. first let me start by saying i love my husband more than words can describe. we have been together 12 years and have 6 children. (2 his, 3 mine and 1 ours). my youngest 3 children live with us (ages 12,12 and 9). my husband has always had a bit of a jealous streak and has always cheated on his sognificant others. my husband has cheated on me multiple times and has had various drug addictions, and has been clean for over a year now. may of 2010 my husbands oxy addiction came to a head and i had caught him talking to other women on singles web sites again. i was 5 months pregnant at the time with a high risk pregnancy with twins and had placenta previa.i found his account and his passwords and saw all the conversations. that morning he had been 2 days without opiates and was in withdrawal. when confronted on breaking his promises yet again, he attempted to kill himself with a bottle of 100 doxepin pills. he was rushed to the hospital and kept for observation after his stomach was pumped, he blamed it all on me, i drove him to it. the doctor reccomended inpatient rehab. i agreed. we found a wonderful place that would not only treat the addiction but help with anger management and had daily psych visits to treat the underlying cause of the addiction. being a nurse myself, tyhis was fantastic news. the day of discharge he refused to go. i played the tough love role and told him if he didnt go he couldnt come home. he left the hospital and came home and got his car which i had put his belongings in. he left and went and stayed with one friend, then another friend and his wife. although suspicious of frequent lengthy phone calls between he and his friends wife, i didnt know he actually had something going with his friend (excuse me, his dealers) wife. after being gone for 2 weeks, he agreed to come home and go to rehab. he told the kids, we scheduled the day and time...and....he never showed up. apparently he and his friends wife took off together. needless to say, my children and i were devestated. it was a rough couple of weeks. fast forward 4 weeks, i lost my job due to missed time to file a protective order when he threatened me and latenesses due to child care issues. exactly a week later while packing up my house to move myself and my children in with my parents, i went in to premature labor. my local hospital rushed me to a higher level hospital where my husband rushed to my side. our twin boys were born 2 days later 15 weeks premature. we stayed at the nicu and the ronald mcdonald house with them until at 2 weeks old one passed away and at 3 weeks old the other passed away. this was so devastating to us, our parents, our children, everyone. we then went to stay with my parents with our children. homeless, neither of us working. we got my husband into a suboxone program which he has stuck with ever since. during all this my husband made so many promises and assurances how different things were going to be. 4 months after our boys passed away, we couldnt stay with my parents any longer so i got a good paying job as a nurse manager and went back to work. 4 weeks later we were back in our own hosue with our children. through all my husbands addiction problems and the loss of our boys i realized that i was co dependent and vowed that i would not rely on him or how he treated me for my own emotional well being. after being back in our own house for months, my husband, although faithful, just didnt treat me like he loved me. he wouldnt get a job to relieve any of the financial stress off me, when it came to the kids sports, i did all the scheduling and transporting and he rarely touched me. the final straw was on valentines day when i wanted him and he pushed me away. i made the decision to stop trying so that i wouldnt allow him to hurt me anymore. thats when things got tragically worse..... after that my husband became even more jealous and controlling. swearing i was having affairs, accusing me of any male he saw at my place of unemployment, constantly calling me names. in july of this year it got even worse to where he was staying up all night for days ata time, going through my phone, checking all my emails, my facebook, my call logs, on my cellp[hone account. he calls numbers off my phone in the middle of the night and wakes people up. he finally left and went to his dads. we had tickets to a baseball game that friday so i ended up taking the kids by myself. he swore i was there with my kids and my boyfriend. those 3 days he was at his dads he started to become psychotic to the point of where he told his stepmother that i called him at 3 in the morning and told him i didnt love him and to not call me anymore cause i have company in my bedroom. he showed up at my house the nexct day and started taking some of his tools out of the basement. accusing me, calling me names, broke my phone, told our kids what a whore i was etc. he was so off, he couldnt even walk straight. he then showed me a whole bottle of xanax he had stolen from his dad and told me he was going to kill himself. he left the house drove around the block and came back but i had locked the door. he banged on the door and demanded and begged for me to let him in which i refused. he told me he was going to go kill himself now then walked down the sidewalk and threw his phone at my house breaking both his phone and my window. he then got in his truck, drove around the block and slammed his truck into the passenger side of my car. i called the police and he ended up being taken to the hospital under an emergency petition. once they pumped his stomach and cleared him medically he was placed in a psych holding area and deemed incompetent. while in the emergency room he was so bizarre. saying things to his mother and the doctors that i was in the parking lot in a truck having sex with my boyfriend in the hospital parking lot and that i had moved my boyfriend in to our house. when he was seen the following day by the psychiatrist (which was a sunday) he was diagnosed with paranoid delusional psychosis, bipolar disorder and delusional jealousy. the doctor told me he was being admitted for inpatient psych treatment and would be there about a week. he was going to get antipsychotics and mood stabilizers and wouldnt be discharged until his delusions had resolved. the following morning ,which was monday, i was told he was refusing his meds and they would pursue a court order to have him take his meds. that same afternoon he was discharged. why? we had no insurance. he had a friend pick him up, drove to his dads house stole another bottle of 90 xanax and punched his 70 year old father in the face. he doesnt remeber the next 2 days during which time i picked hinm up from a hotel and brought him back home with the promise that he would get the free outpatient help the hospital reccomended. he never did. so, for the last 3 months, i have been dealing with daily accusations and name calling, extreme fights, checking me on gps, if he comes to pick me up at work and sees a male employee or doctor in my office im sleeping with them. when we are at the childrens sports games, i will be talking to some of the other moms and he swears im talking to the male coaches. he tells me daily that i dont love him and im torturing him. he has had a second hospital visit for threatening to kill himself in august but was released in a few hours. he swears he sees picture messages on the cell phone account that i have sent to other men but when i tell him to show me they arent there and he swears i erased them. he accuses me of leaving work for lunch daily and having an affair at a park. i was counseled this week by my director of nursing that i have 2 weeks to fix this or i will be terminated. he texts and calls multiple times a day when hes in one of his moods and if i am with patients or in a meeting or meeting with families and dont answer or eespond, its proof that i am having this alleged affair. i rush out of work every day after 8 hours on the dot just so he doesnt accuse me. he drives me to work daily and picks me up, but swears i leave. dont get me wrong, there are still days at a time where everything is great and he is like his old self again, but more frequently its pure torture for me and my kids. he swears he doesnt have a problem and doesnt need any psychiatric help that its all me. he swears this is the same reaction any man would have when his wife is cheating, constantly begs me to just tell him ""the truth"". now he has convinced himself that the reason i am in trouble at work is not because of him but because i have missed so much time having my affair. my cell phone was stole from my office last week and he is convinced that i either gave it to my boyfriend or sold it and gave the money to my boyfriend. i am at my wits end. i dont know what else to do. he desperately needs help and me and our children cant go through this anymore. i have offered to take a polygraph, but will this even help? part of me thinks that when i take it and pass he will see that i have been telling the truth but part of me knows that it wont make a difference."

"husband with delusional jealousy Almost 7 years later and it still No better. We have attempted marriage counseling, but he didn't like the marriage counselor. Honestly the council wasn't doing much to help us just kind of sitting there and listening to us argue. I have continued to be faithful I have continued to be a good wife. He just seems to get worse and worse. He twists his memories of things that happened years ago to feed into this delusion. I have been accused of everyone and anyone that is a male that we have been around accept both of our fathers and my brother. I have been accused of my teenage son's friends and my stepson's friends that I have known since they were little children. If a wrong number calls my cell phone, it is very obviously my boyfriend calling meAnd a signal for me to get in touch with him. If I do anything to make myself feel better about myself like dye my hair get my nails done, try to lose weight, or buy new clothes, I'm doing it to make myself more sexually attractive to other men. He can't seem to fathom that after 18 years of being cheated on I have no self esteem left. We are currently separated and he has been living in his father's basement for over a year now. We still talking everyday and see Each Other frequently, He comes home for a couple days and stays here quite often. It's still like a goddam roller coaster. There will be a couple of really really good days where he super attentive, super affectionate, and can't stop telling me how much he loves me and how he knows that I would never cheat on him. Then those couple days are over and there will go days to weeks of daily accusations of ridiculous things. I have been accused of manipulating Facebook, getting on his Facebook to talk to his friends behind his back.I can no longer get on his Facebook to check up on him and make sure hes not talking to other women because if I do he swears I'm doing it to talk to his friends. He is recently told me that I have attempted and Succeeded in seducing all of his friends and that he is now a laughing stock and a joke amongst his friends from the day we met 18 years ago His brother and stepbrother who I never talk to both if he is sleeping at his father's house and I am home alone in bed sleeping, I must actually not be sleeping. In his mind he has become convincedThat I am sneaking his friend in after his friend's wife goes to work. His proof is that he doesn't hear from me after 10:30 at night. This friend of his also happens to be the birth father Of his brother's stepson, our nephew. He hasn't seen this friend often through the years but a couple of years ago they did get back in contact and this friend shot on our pool league team for about 6 months. This friend of his is a recovering heroin addict and has had many remissions. This friend of his also at One time was rumored to have been trading homosexual favors for drugs and/or drug money. It is beyond me why he would think that I would ever want a man like that period. On the rare occasion that this friend does get in touch with him he swears this friend always knows when he and I are having problems And is convinced that it's because I'm telling this friend. So he has decided that he is put 2 and 2 together and come up with 5 and because this friend's wife works night shift apparently, I don't know because I never talk to these people, I must be screwing this guy at night I have been utterly and completely faithful to this man for over 18 years. I love this man with everything in me, I would never even think about cheating on him.I am someone who is always even as a small child try to do the right thing. My mother says I was born with a desire to follow the rules. I was raised in a Christian church with strong morals. And I live by there is Morals. Just the idea of being intimate with another man in any other way is appalling to me. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells. I never know when or where the next accusation is going to come from. Whenever I'm on my phone or the Internet I'm accused of secretly messaging someone. He accuses me of cheating with a neighbor. Although he doesn't live here but is staying with his father, he has decided that I need to move into a newer and better house. I am not ready to move right now. Yes I got a large Raise last year when I got a promotion at work but I have been renting this house for 8 years. It is 2 blocks from my parents and my landlord is very lenient with late rent payments. He has never once filed a late rent notice when my rent is Late. My credit score is currently very low and I need to do some credit repair so I can buy a house. He sees none of this as a reason for me not to move. In his mind I won't move right now because I don't wanna either be away from the next door neighbor that I'm screwing or his friend who apparently lives somewhere within a mile of me. I honestly don't know where his friend lives because I don't talk to this guy After so many years and so many accusations I don't know what to do. The more I deny that I have done any of these things the angrier he seems to get. He swears that I just refuse to admit to all the horrible things I've doneAnd that must mean that it's because I won't stop doing them. In his mind it can't possibly be that I want admit to things because I haven't done them. Previously I was self assured, outgoing, friendly and usually a genuinely happy person. All of this has Caused me to be anxious, depressed, and even sometimes contemplating suicide. My nerves are constantly on edge because I never know what's going to come next. My life is spent walking on eggshells I have panic attacks. I am barrage and verbal I attacked with accusations on a regular basis. I know that this is verbal and emotional abuse. I know that his thought process is it logical And that this is delusions, but I still keep thinking that at some point he will realize how wrong he is. I know it's stupid to think that 1 day he'll magically wake up and realize hes wrong, but I can't help it. If I get angry and argue when I'm being accused, if I raise my voice to him that proof positive that I'm guilty. If I refuse to argue to him that's proof positive that I'm guilty. It's a no win situation About a year ago I finally decided that I would take a lie detector test to prove to him once and for all that I've never cheated on him. I looked online and found a local one that was relatively cheap at $400. I contacted this woman, scheduled and paid for the test myself and went and took the test with him. Unfortunately, I fail to do any research on what a lie detector test really does. Had I done any research I would have never done it. I went into the lie detector test thinking that this magic Box would off automatically prove to my husband once and for all that I was telling him the truth. Little did I know that all the machine does is register your fight or flight response during questioning. This is the reason they don't do lie detector tests when rape or abuse victims. I went into the test confident that this was gonna be the solution to all our problems. The polygraph examiner called me 3 days later to give me the test results.To my shock and surprise she inform me that not only had I failed but that I had failed miserably and that I was a horrible liar.I couldn't understand how this could possibly have happened. I was telling the truth the whole time. After much research and consulting an expert experienced polygraph examiner I discovered that an experience polygraph examiner would have never done the test on me Because of the verbal and emotional abuse that is occurred over this issue. Obviously my husband refuses to believe this. I'm really and truly at a loss. I don't know what to do. I really do love this man. I really have never cheated on him. I want my husband back. I want me back. I want everything to be normal. I just don't understand how he can't see how good we could be together if you would just stop these accusations.When hes not angry at me and accusing me of things other people are actually jealous of the affection and love they can see between us. I just want this all fixed. I feel hopeless and I feel helpless."

"husband with delusional jealousy Shock_the_monkey's advice is tough, but it's correct. The advice from experts is to change the subject when someone brings up their delusions. Never agree or appear to confirm the delusion. Arguing doesn't help either; it only makes the delusional person more anxious...and thus, more delusional. Do NOT let anyone tell you when or where to move. Chances are that if you did move, even into a house your husband chose, his disease would ultimately tell him that your true reason for relocating was to be nearer a lover (who doesn't even exist in reality). I don't think it's a good idea for him to even stay with you for a few days at a time. The good times will give you false hope and break your heart all over again. Also, there's the chance that he's just staying there so that he can uncover more ""evidence"". Never let him look at your phone, email, social media, or GPS again. LMH, you mentioned that your husband is living with his father part of the time. Have you had a chance to talk to his father about him, and if so, has his father let on that he notices something is off? Does he trust his father? Maybe his father can get him to visit a therapist who can convince him to try some meds. Sadly, I think that this will have to end by divorce. You are living in purgatory. He's sick, and he's going to pull you down with him. And it's not really his fault; it's a symptom of the disease. But you cannot let the disease claim BOTH of you. You have kids to raise. -- Wed May 30, 2018 8:56 pm -- Shock_the_monkey's advice is tough, but it's correct. The advice from experts is to change the subject when someone brings up their delusions.

"husband with delusional jealousy It is absolutely hell living like this. He gas twisted so many things. Strangely enough, there is a coworker of his i have never even met or talked to that he has accused me of cheating with for a couple of years now. The strange part is this man sent me a friend request on fb today. As i clearly gave nothing to hide, i notified my husband right away. Why? Because i told him i would always be truthful and not hide things from him. And i anticipated that my husband, ny protector would stand up for me and also see that im not hiding things from him. Well instead, he blamed me. He saw the friend request as proof positive that im having an affair with this man. So instead of getting amgry and feeling betrayed towards his coworker, he decided it was an elaborate ruse set up by me and his coworker to cover up the fact that our fb accounts were connected (not even sure what he means by that). So i instead sent the asshole a message calling him out for randomly sending a friend request to his coworkers wife. He respinded thst he hadnt so then i sent him a picture of the request and again basically told him off. Of course in my husband's eyes, that was wrong as well. I honestly dont know how or why this person sent me a friend request as my husband actually has me blicked from his fb. Again, my husband sees that as even more proof. Theres so many examples i see on other threads of these bizarre paranoid behaviors that my husband exhinits... Call or text from the wrong number? Its obviously my lover. Neighbor mzkes noice next door, the husband is signaling me. I get my nails done, cut my hair, buy new clothes....im obviously trying to either look goid for my boyfriend or its just that i have the insatiable desire to have attention from all men. If i have a sniffle, i now have a cocaine problem too. If i shave my legs...going to see the boyfriend. Didnt really go to the grocery store....went to see my boyfriend Got my promotion last year because....you guessed...sleeping with my boss Car slows down anywhere near our house... my boyfriend is checking up on me or stopping by. I am a sex addict and i need some help. I am so cold and uncaring, why do i torture him so? My 19 year old twins know all about my whoring ways and give him funny looks because they really want to tell him. My sons teenage friends....sleeping with me. Apparently i have successfully seduced 100% of his friends and relatives, and none of them will tell him because they are all afraid of him. That success rate is better than a playboy model so i guess i should be flattered. I use my paycheck to pay bills for men i sleep with. I post ads on craigslist looking for carsex. I bought a locking bracelet and gave him the key, he swears o either bought two or my boyfriend has the real key. If i check his Facebook or phone, im not checking up on him, im talking to his friends If i check his location on gps, its to make sure he isnt sneaking up on me and my boyfriend. The list goes on and on."
"husband with delusional jealousy I really feel your pain as I am in the same boat. 2 years of hell and I am in the process of arranging to move out because he won't. Just some of the issues: I can't go out unaccompanied without causing a major fight Apparently, I scratch my private areas a lot which means I'm having an affair If I go to the shops, I take too long and apparently my make up is rubbed off around my lips Apparently, I'm not as tight as I used to be which is because my imaginary boyfriend is huge When he leaves the house for 7 - 10 mins to drop the kids at school, I sneak my boyfriend in for a quickie I am under constant surveillance - he rarely leaves the house but when he does, he hides his phone and records me or puts a wireless video camera in various places around the house In his mind, everything I say is a lie - I've apparently developed bipolar and I'm narcassistic Apparently I've uploaded videos of myself having sex with my boyfriend on Pornhub The list just goes on and on. I haven't posted here before and I'll probably start a thread so I can get some support (hopefully) but I just wanted to say to you: Do not get a lie detector test! Seriously, don't do it. I did it. It came back inconclusive probably because I was so stressed by what was happening. That was the worst decision I've ever made. Believe me when I say it doesn't matter what the result is. If it says you are truthful, it will be because you knew how to beat it. If it says you aren't truthful, it's only confirming what he 'already knows'. I honestly thought I could fix my husband and I guess I still hold onto that hope but I don't think it is possible unless your other half can admit he needs help. Mine is seeing a psych this coming Monday but it is on the condition that I also get assessed for bipolar/schizophrenia etc."
"husband with delusional jealousy No matter what you will do he wont be happy. if he really has delusional jealousy disorder leave him. my 17 years of marriage came to end, for 17 years I kept giving him evidence that I don't have an affair, we have two beautiful kids, but there was so much violence related to his anger led by delusionals. leave him. Even if god will come and give evidence that you are honest to him he will not believe. you love him I understand because I loved my ex too but he made my life mockery for the world and more so in my own eyes. Such people don't deserve family, they have no feelings all they care is what they think is true and which not true most of the time. leave him."
"My friend is always blaming me when something goes wrong Firstly if this is in the wrong section please remove it too the correct one. Ok so where do I begin? A good friend of mine, who I speak to on a daily basis is always and I mean always blaming me when something goes wrong. He’s consistently points the finger at me when something happens to him. So far he’s blamed me for his cable account being hacked a few times and has on a few occasions blamed me for his credit cards being hacked. Oh when he buys something online and an hour later he’ll text me and blame me for his account or credit cards were being hacked. I’ve tried telling him I had nothing to do with any of it. It’s coming to the point where I’m about to call off this 15 yr friendship it’s almost as if he wants me to admit to something I didn’t do. Am about to just say yup I did those things so he could hear what he wants. But why should I take the blame for something I didn’t do? I’m at me wits end here. What do I do? Do I just end this long friendship or just admit to things I didn’t do? Please help."
"My friend is always blaming me when something goes wrong Hi soconfused. I'm sorry you didn't receive a timely reply. This forum is not as active as it used to be. Currently, the conventional advice for this type of situation is: Do NOT ""confess"" to something you didn't do. Don't reinforce the delusion. An obsession with the enemy's ""confession"" is a common theme in some of the stories in this forum. A lot of times, the victim tells the enemy: ""I'll forgive the affair/lies/stealing/cheating/whatever IF YOU'LL JUST TELL THE TRUTH"". It's tempting to say what they want to hear, in hopes that they will stop talking about it obsessively and compulsively. But it's not likely to work; I think it would just lead to new, bigger, worse accusations. Do NOT deny the accusation. Even if you're telling the truth, denying the accusation will only make the accuser hold onto the accusation even tighter. Even if you have a perfect alibi or undeniable logic that clearly reveals the truth, it's as if the victim's brain will create new pathways to hide the truth from him or her. The accusation/delusion might morph a little bit at this point, but the disease will still likely identify you to the victim as the ""enemy"". Change the topic. This tactic works for family and friends who aren't the ""enemy""; I'm not sure if it will work for the person whom the victim's brain has marked as ""the enemy"". I know it sounds ridiculous, but it works. A relative of mine can talk for hours about all the things her husband has allegedly done to try to ruin her life. A simple question such as ""Oh, look at your garden! What kind of flower is that yellow one?"" can change the topic--and her mood--completely. Do you know any of this person's family? I would talk to a parent or sibling and explain to them what's going on. Maybe this has happened in the past, and they'll recognize a pattern. Or...they might believe the victim. If so, this is likely to happen again in the future. Even it you break off all contact with him, the victim's brain will eventually identify a new ""enemy"". Next time, it might be one of his family members. So if you talk to them, even if they don't believe you now, you've given them the info to recognize a pattern later. I think you have to end the friendship. But let him know that you'll be there for him if you need him in the future. I'm thinking something like: You keep accusing me of things I didn't do. It hurts me that you think I would do those things. I think that we both need time away from each other. I won't call/text/email/visit anymore. I truly wish you the best."
"My friend is always blaming me when something goes wrong Sorry I haven’t been on much. I tried to change the subject when I’m being accused but depending on his mood it will be brought up again a few minutes later. We get along and have things in common its the constant here it comes I gonna get blamed for whatever happened next again. Sometimes I start to believe I really did do something because that’s what my mind keeps telling me. It’s like if someone said to you at a very young age ice cream will cause you to grow a tail even though you know it’s not true because other people eat it, you just can’t get yourself to try it. That’s what I go through when I’m being accused not the tail thing the thing about me being accused of hacking his account/s:"
"Help - this has now gone too far! Hi I have posted here previously about my partner who has DD. He has become very controlling and is blaming me for absolutely everything. To hear him talk I am the worst person in the world. I lie, I cheat, I steal, I collude with people to conspire against him, he comments that everything is a coincidence and can relate anything and everything to random things that happen. The more I defend myself, the more I am guilty in his eyes. I really can’t do or say anything right at all. The worst thing for me is the constant accusations of cheating with a completely random person. He is extremely nasty and derogatory and is doing things to me that amount to sexual assault. When I tell him to stop and point out how disgusting it is he just says that I deserve it. I just don’t know what to do any more. He keeps threatening to meet someone else as he says he can’t trust me. I think I should just let him go and stop trying to fix him - perhaps I would do him a favour, if he starts a new relationship then perhaps he will stop and will get better. I am at my wits end and this is now seriously affecting my own mental health. The jealous delusions are more prevalent than the persecutory ones at the present time."
"Help - this has now gone too far! Get out now. From what you've said, it sounds like he's abusing you in more ways than one. Having DD does not justify or excuse abusive behavior. It's true that DD makes its sufferers obsessed with fixed false beliefs. But it doesn't make people violent. He still has control over his behavior. And he has chosen to assault you. You need to leave. The sooner the better, since abuse can escalate over time."
"Fear of self-enucleation? Hey, I had a ""psychotic"" episode back in 2013 where I was feeling very elated and attempted to castrate myself with a microwave. It obviously didn't work. The next year I got suicidal and angry eventually attacking my mother. I got help with a psychiatrist but it stopped as an adult. Now, I'm having fears of self-enucleation. The psychiatrist did say I mavyhave body dsymorphia along with aspergers/ocd. I know it's probably just my mind ruminating but I fear for that I may end up as the woman who poured drain cleaner in her eyes or the girl who took meth and gouged her eyes out."
"Fear of self-enucleation? CP, have you told your psychiatrist ALL of this? If you feel more stress coming on, arrange for more frequent appointments. Perhaps ask a close friend or family member to help you recognize when you seem to be acting more anxious so that you can request more time with your psychiatrist. Perhaps the psychiatrist has given you medication as a proactive measure?"
"Newly engage - he has delusion jealousy. Hi, We’ve been engaged for only 6 months. I adore him and will never leave him despite his problems. His jealousy stems from an ex who cheated on him while he was away with work. I also lost an ex to cheating so although I am not the type of person who would cheat, I know how it feels and could never put another person through that especially one I love. Because of his job, FIFO, it is difficult to schedule psychologist/counselling appointments. He’s aware of his problem which is wonderful but he still accuses when he’s away. I’m trying to pack up my house and living at my mum's, more to rest his mind but as I don’t drive the commute gets me here late, so not much is getting done. My son offered to stay with me but something happened today that he didn’t. Now I’m getting ‘the treatment’. I’m tired of being accused of doing stuff I’m not and not getting much packing done because I’m stressed and upset. I hope someone here can give me some idea of hope that this can be controlled, he wants to get help. And please some insight as to how you handle this disorder. Let me reinterate, I’m not leaving him. Our life is perfect other than this and our love is strong. It’s when he’s away that it mainly happens. Other than giving up his job or finding a site where I can move to, I don’t know how else to reassure him. Any help would be wonderful."
"Newly engage - he has delusion jealousy. Hi there. I have been where you are, I was in love with someone who suffers from the same, but over the years I have become so drained of it all. Right This very second I am getting abusive texts from her, claiming she has proof that a message I received on Whatsap is not from my friend but from his wife, and that I am in cahoots with her. This is just one of a long list of 'secret' girlfriends (and boyfriends, even though I'm straight) I've had affairs with. I've had enough, I now cannot get out of this nightmare quick enough, it is horrific it never stops. Screaming arguments are 0100 AM, I can't move, I need to get out of this."
"Newly engage - he has delusion jealousy. Hi Ladywytch, Are you saying that you aren't living with him yet? If that's the case, then when you move in with him, it's going to get 1000 times worse. Don't think because he sees your honest behavior 24/7 that the suspicions will suddenly go away. Living together will just give the disease more fodder to pick apart. I'm wondering if his ex even cheated on him at all. He's giving you ""the treatment"" because of something you didn't do. He's trying to control your behavior. No, he can't help being suspicious. But, yes, he can control his reaction. He's punishing you for something you didn't do. To give someone ""the treatment"" is still emotional abuse. Would you marry a guy who slaps you around? Probably not? So why would you marry a guy who's emotionally abusive? Do NOT set a date until you completed a year of counseling together as an engaged couple. You mentioned that it is ""difficult to schedule"" appointments. Well, if the relationship means enough to him, then he will find a way to make the damned appointments. This is not a good foundation for a solid marriage. Think with your head now and not with your heart (or limerence hormones). All the signs are right there. If you ""won't leave him"", then at least don't live with him."

"Am I Delusional?? I just spoke with my eldest daughter on the phone. She is a nurse that works on the psych-med-surg ward at a top hospital. She plans on becoming a psychiatric nurse practioner. I told her that I was speaking with a lawyer about what happened to me during a recent ER visit. This is unlike me, but it bothered me so I had to speak with a lawyer. I had a night where I got drunk. My husband thought my heart had stopped and he called an ambulance. I sobered up in an ER ward. Still being under the influence, I was very nasty to the nurse. I said some awful things to her. I knew I hurt her terribly. (This is also unlike me) I wasn’t physically aggressive. I didn’t try to hurt anyone or myself. I wasn’t wandering around, stumbling. I did ask to go to the bathroom quite a bit. They had to get someone to escort me. I would wait until someone was there that could help me. Otherwise, I waited in my bed. And eventually I sobered up enough to keep control of my nasty mouth. I did find out the ‘nurse’ wasn’t a nurse at all. I could tell she was angry with me, probably tired and hurt by the things I had said. After awhile, they came in my room and made me get into an enclosure bed. Basically it looked like a baby playpen with mesh sides and top. I couldn’t even stretch out in it. It was awful and I wanted to get out of the thing. It was all I could think about. I finally found a zipper beneath the floor of this playpen. I forced my finger through it and unzipped it and slithered out of the playpen. I got back into my normal bed and waited. When the ‘nurse’ came back into the room, she was surprised and nastily called me an escape artist. She didn’t try to restrain me after that. Eventually I was released and went home. I told my daughter all about this. She said she didn’t understand why this would be so traumatic to me. With my history, I would think she would understand, but she didn’t. She just couldn’t understand. And I don’t understand that...except that she is young and can’t fully comprehend what has happened in my life. It’s been a year since all this happened. A lot has happened. I’ve been on a crusade to get off all unnecessary meds, especially the opiates (for cancer) and benzos (for GAD & PTSD). Then the memory of this came to me and I decided to speak to a lawyer about it. I mentioned it to my daughter tonight. She told me that she is scared for me because of this. She said she thinks I’m delusional. Now I’m beginning to question myself. Maybe I am delusional. But I think to myself,’I seem to be getting better. I’m not depressed. I’m getting out more. I’m more and more active. Sure, it’s taking some time but I’m doing it.’ So how am I delusional? Part of me thinks that for most of my life (I’m 55 right now) I’ve had several traumatic events, and I’ve never done anything about it. Now I feel that I have to speak up. To say hey, something wrong happened here. It’s not the money. It’s the principle of it. But now my daughter has me doubting myself. Am I being delusional? If I am, then I need to watch myself. If I’m not, why does my daughter think this? No matter what, what do I do under either circumstance? I am at a loss. I don’t know what to think. So I’d appreciate any feedback from others. Ideally I should be able to figure this out by myself, but obviously I’m ill equipped for that. At least for the moment. So what do you think about this situation. Am I delusional? Is there something wrong with the way I’m thinking? Wither"
"Am I Delusional?? I am not sure I understand what you mean about being delusional or not. Do you mean maybe you never went to the hospital and none of this happened? Or maybe it wasn't so terrible? I don't think we can answer that for you. But it is clear that you are struggling with this. I think maybe more important than contacting a lawyer (at least as a first step) would be to try to work through the trauma of the situation or to get a mental health assessment of some sort. Maybe you are traumatized or maybe you are delusional, but medical help could best solve either of those problems. When you are focused on one traumatic event that sticks with you for a long time, then maybe it is necessary to get outside help in order to heal. Sometimes a little help can make everything become clearer. Try not to let an event from your past ruin your present either. I know it's upsetting but don't forget to enjoy the things you can in life even if it is something small like your favorite TV series, a cup of tea, a walk in the park, etc. I understand you have to set aside some time to deal with difficult things, but it seems like you are not in the specific situation anymore and you have your daughter to provide a fresh perspective so that's a good thing. How are you doing now?"
"Help Needed Hello, I got married to this lovely girl last year in February. We dated for a year before walking up the altar. There were some issues that I just chose to look over and initially even believed 1) she said a group from New Zealand ( where she had been a student from 2003..did not manage to complete despite changing 3 colleges as everywhere people were ‘ out to get her ‘) was hacking her phone and listening to everything we spoke on phone and were watching her change and stuff 2) Everywhere she went she drew in new people like her workplace acquaintances into the whirlpool saying that they too were plotting against her 3) Once she came home and fought with me saying she saw me talking to a girl at her workplace whom she believed was a part of the plot. I never spoke to her nor was I a part of any ‘plot’ 4) just out of the blue she would fight with me saying I called her a bitch. Of course I did not do that. I rubbed it off saying that she’d probably misheard me. She calmed down but the resentment was there Nonetheless we got married, the accusations got wilder.... 1) Jesus came in my dreams and told me you are hiding something and trying to break the marriage 2) she accused me of wanting to indulge in wife swapping with a couple who are good friends 3) she would accuse me of saying weird and random things 4) Once she drove the car so rash after accusing me of saying some weird thing that I thought she’d kill me 5) final straw was after 18 months of marriage she accused me of calling her a C**T and a S**T out of the blue. 6) generally she is a very sweet and a calm personality and goes to church at all times but when this hits her, she starts screaming and becomes evil eyed. There is nothing I can do to argue with her beliefs 7) she felt someone was laughing at her on the phone line. I got her phone checked up but nothing was found She left the house and her parents think I’ve hurt their daughter, when I suggested a psychiatrist visit all hell broke loose. My wife though agreed to the visit with disgust, Her diagnosis came out perfectly okay even though she made some bizarre statements like .. 1)He walks behind me and spies on me. 2) He goes out in the middle of the night to drink tea 3)He laughs at me together with friends and security Her parents lied to the doctor saying that I had apologised to them for my behaviour to her The doctors said she is well behaved and well dressed and did not show any symptoms of a disorder when they kept her under observation for 7 days So now, her paranoia against me is grown more .. she has blocked me off all telephonic ways of contact. Which she refuses to accept.she stays in the US now where she is studying. I am funding her education and paying off her loan, she has got no regard for that. Just for your information she has accused several people in the past who were her friends of wrongdoing. All of them left. She accused them of the same plotting thing. To her, the beliefs are real and no amount of proof or convincing can help Some people don’t even know what my wife thinks of them. To everyone she is a pretty young girl with a perfect life. I love her and want her to get better. But her super overprotective parents and she are the biggest roadblocks. I’ve tried convincing them as well but got bombed. She says I have been an indecent husband and that I have spoilt her life and that she does not have any trust nor faith in me.. I don’t know how to deal with this ... This is sapping me of my life.. Is there anyone who could give any suggestions ? Thanks for reading this long post... Last edited by Snaga on Fri May 03, 2019 2:06 pm, edited 1 time in total.

"My husbands delusions make me the bad guy and I need advice Hi there. So I’m recently married and I believe my husband is suffering from a form of delusional personality disorder. He’s yet to be officially diagnosed but the signs are there and he is going to see a doctor. I never even thought this was a thing and I always assumed his trust issues with me would eventually go away. But they haven’t. I should’ve seen the signs. I mean, I did, but I never thought it would get this serious. Long story short, my husband is convinced numerous friends of his are trying to inform him that I have a shady past or there are things I have done that I don’t want him to know about. This is 100% not true. I’ve lived a life I’m pretty proud of and there’s absolutely nothing I’ve ever done that I wouldn’t want him knowing. These friends of his though, have never actually said to him “Hey man, listen, [insert my name here] has done some shady $#%^ and as your friend I am going to tell you these things”. It’s always his friend speaking in “code” trying to tell him something. Just the other night his friend mentioned turning a new HVAC system that was just installed in to a tin man costume for Halloween. My husband literally just started a HVAC career so the comment wasnt completely off the wall. I obviously laughed at the comment by my husband took it as his friend trying to tell him I had been talking to some musician whose stage name happens to be The Tin Man. He was convinced of this. A bunch of other instances like this have occurred and the advice I need is how am I supposed to cope with this? I’ve read so many articles that tell me how to talk to him but how am I supposed to emotionally handle this?? I am the target of his delusions and it makes me so mad and so angry and sad and I get so mad at him for accusing me. I feel just disrespected. But everything I’ve read tells me I need to basically relax. But how can I? I’m so mad at him I don’t even want to see him right now. I’m so proud he’s actually opening up to this possibility that this $#%^ may be made up in his head and that he is going to get medica help but in the meantime I just want to crawl under a rock. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks."
"My husbands delusions make me the bad guy and I need advice Hi! I don’t have any answers. This whole delusional disorder thing has just landed in my life too. How do we cope while feeling like our marriages just exploded? Your husband is convinced that his interpretation of things people say and do is correct. His brain is playing tricks on him. You are suffering. I wish I knew what to do. My husband refuses to believe his exwife is dead, even though I showed him the obituary from 2006. He still believes she is stalking him with her boyfriend who is a state cop. Yes, she came back to life just to torture him. He doesn’t believe the obituaries are real. All we can do is try to get the man we love some help. I told my husband I think his brain is playing tricks on him, and that he needs to get it checked out. I don’t know what else to do"
"My husbands delusions make me the bad guy and I need advice Hi, from someone in the same boat. I’m sorry I laughed at the Tin Man story. I can so relate. The most innocent of statements and actions are perceived as either an insult or a betrayal. So how the heck do we cope??? Laugh, cry? Hope it doesn’t get worse? Be grateful for the times the delusions aren’t bad or aren’t present? Right now I’m planning my eventual escape. I am working on paying off the house. Yes, I will gladly leave it all in his name and just vanish with my 401k and my social security. I’m 62. I’ve endured this for 25 years but it’s getting worse. He now believes his exwife is driving a FEDEX truck in our area, and is stalking him. However, she died in 2006. I showed him the obituary and he doesn’t believe it. Thinks it’s faked. What the heck do I do with that? I gave him the phone number to the mental health clinic with our insurance. I talked to him about Delusional Disorder and that his brain is playing tricks on him. I can see he doesn’t believe what I’m telling him. So escape is the answer for me."
"My husbands delusions make me the bad guy and I need advice Be thankful he may be willing to get some help. And do your best to try to encourage that without pushing so hard that he changes his mind. My wife refuses to get help and doesn't think she has a problem. It's such an awful thing to have to put up with. And nothing seems to work. If I deny the delusions it sets her off. If I just give in and admit to something I haven't actually done, it sets off a whole different tirade. Without professional help, it seems there just is no answer."
"My husbands delusions make me the bad guy and I need advice Hi. I can unfortunately relate. My partner of several years had an episode just about a month ago and it’s been hell. I’m glad your husband is willing to seek help as that seems to be the main hurdle with this diagnosis. My partner’s symptoms started about two months ago, from fleeting persecutory type beliefs into full blown accusation inferring incestuous relations with a family member of mine. Just weeks later he moved two thousand miles away closer to his family (because of how infuriated he was) and has refused to talk to me on the phone for the past month. We’ve texted but his derogatory and insanely painful messages have been quite distressing. I know it’s the mental illness though and have stopped taking them personally but it sure does hurt knowing they’re not well. I started seeing a therapist right away (within the week of his episode as I knew what was happening after the shock faded) and I suggest you seek professional help as well to help you navigate through this. Mine has been instrumental in helping me cope and educated me on how to best approach him if communication was unavoidable (I.e focusing on his emotion and not the belief, avoiding confirming or denying the belief, etc). I sincerely hope all will be ok as can be (for you both) given the circumstances. I’ve been trying to get my partners family to recognize the urgency in getting him to see a mental health provider ASAP but to my dismay nothing has yet happened. I know it’s only been a month since his full blown episode but can’t but feel demoralized in thinking I may have lost someone I deeply loved and cared about and I couldn’t do anything to help him."
"Need advice and support on how to help my mum So recently my mum has started to have delusions where she believes people are creeping around the house, stalking her, sending her vile texts and voicemails. When my dad or I ask to see the text messages she shuts off and refuses to acknowledge that it is not real. I believe recently she has started to abuse the drug ice, she has battled with addictions before I was born. I am now 17 and worried that this substance abuse has dug up a dormant mental health issue. She has always been a bit funny from her previous drug use but now it has escalated. My dad is worried and doesn’t know what to do especially when she says that he is trying to do her harm. He said she had two episodes in one night where she woke up screaming that people were trying to kill her. I don’t live at home but live in the nearby town to my parents and try to visit at least once a week after school and stay for the night. I am worried as she runs off and no one can get a hold of her until the next day. I don’t know what to do it’s just my dad and I and I can see that it’s exhausting him. He has tried asking her to seek help but she always refuses as she doesn’t acknowledge she has a problem. Please if I could have some advice would be great. I just want my mother to be alright it’s hard to watch someone go through this and feel helpless"
"Really Bad Day...I don't know what's normal I have lived with a DDJ husband, undiagnosed by anyone other than me, of course, because he lies to therapists, for 20 years now. He told one once that I thought he had delusions because he constantly accused me of cheating, and she said that wasn't delusional because that was a real issue. I think that people going through school to be psychologists and psychiatrists should really have to delve into this issue. I believe it is highly missed, misdiagnosed, undiagnosed, etc... I'm just having a really bad day. Things have not been too bad for the past few months, livable, tolerable, but the past few days have dipped back into hell. I'm lost. What is a normal relationship? I am 42 years old, and I have no idea... Is anyone happy in this world? I do not know anyone that is..."
"Really Bad Day...I don't know what's normal I'm sorry you've been having such a bad time. And kudos to you for pushing through for so many years. My wife developed DDPT (or it could be PPD - undiagnosed either way) somewhere around 5 years ago. Totally tore my world in to pieces. Lost sight of myself and what happiness is/was. In the beginning I spent a lot of time focusing on my kids and getting joy from that. As time went on I was slowly able to start spending time on my self and with a couple friends. Now she's filed for divorce so over the next 6 months I get to deal with that. As hard as it will be, I'm kind of looking forward to it. I'm ready to move on with life now. I believe there's happiness for me to be found out there. Sadly it just isn't going to be with my soon to be ex-wife. I hope you are able to do somethings for yourself. And as awful as mental illness is, you don't have to sacrifice yourself. It's ok to know when to say enough is enough. I wish you all the best in your struggle."
"What to Do? My wife is in involuntary care for psychosis with persecutory delusions, audio hallucinations and OCD. It's been 6 days and she is having a probate hearing tomorrow (monday) to determine to extend the hold. Her lawyer said if I testify for her to come home - the judge will most likely release her. However, then I am afraid any chance of her getting better is lost. Or I can testify to the delusion behaviors I've witnessed and they will probably keep her longer. However, she will feel like I've betrayed her and may estrange herself from me. I don't know what to do. Background - It started about 1 1/2 years ago - she will not seek help (believe nothing is wrong with her) - she will not take medicine even in involuntary care. - she is 46 yrs old."
"What to Do? Hi, Welcome, I'm sorry you are having to make such a tough decision. I'd read up on Dr. Armador's youtube or buy his book on amazon titled - ""I'm not sick, and I don't need help."" It's a great resource and may help give you tools you need to help your loved one get the treatment and hopefully be medicated long enough for insight to develop. The lack of awareness of illness anosognosia is tough. Hope that helps. Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
What to Do? My wife has had a delusional disorder for about 5 years. Of course 5 years ago I didn't know what it was or why she was behaving the way she was. She still does not think she needs help and refuses to get any kind of treatment. I guess my point is that your wife needs help any way you can get it for her. This problem absolutely will not go away on it's own. So keeping her there to get help at the risk of becoming estranged is worth it in my opinion.
Help Have been with my partner for 12 years..she is my light switch..she is either on or off..she is diagnosed BPD..I understand splitting..and can love her through..but DD is kicking my butt with her..she is convinced that I have taken over her phone..her Google account..bank account..to the point of she just has a dummy phone so I can control everything..it is so bad that she has locked me out of bank account..and every aspect of her..she is constantly in her phone messing with settings that she knows nothing about..I cannot convince her of my innocence..I contacted TN Cellular Forensics..and she will not even trust them..she is ending our 12 year relationship and I do not know how to stop it..help please
"Help Hi Thief058, Welcome, I'm sorry you are struggling with a loved one with delusional disorder and BPD. The best advice I have is to get support for yourself during this difficult time. NAMI has family to family classes that may help, or talking with a trained mental health professional. I don't have any creative solutions at the moment, but hope that you find what you need during this time. Wishing you all the best, Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"General phychosis thread This is a good idea. Maybe do away with the separation between the psychosis categories.

"New here and support groups Hi everyone, I am new here. My husband is suffering for a DD and we have been dealing with this for almost 3 years now. His latest episode has drawn me into the delusions which it never has before. I am very concerned about that as I feel he doesn't trust me now and I wonder if that can ever be healed. As well, it makes me fearful for my safety. I know he would never harm me, but the delusional side of him may-who truly knows?!?! It is very difficult to hold together a marriage and family when someone is suffering from mental illness. We have been together for over 11 years and married for six. THree years into our marriage, he had a psychotic break and we have been dealing with that for the past 3 years. He went off meds after a year and then had another psychotic episode after 5 months. Again, he made a full recovery and remained compliant with his meds, although he did switch form Risperdal to Abilify due to hormonal side affects. After being on the Abilify for almost 6 months, he had a psychotic episode where he disappeared on me. HE was found within 12 hours, 600 miles away after taking a plane somewhere he had no reason to be. No explanation as to why, other than, he had a feeling he needed to go there. He was in the hospital for 10 days out of state (where the police found him) and then came home. 2 1/2 weeks after being home, he had another psychotic break and thought there was a stranger in the house to kill him and that's where his delusion brings me into it....I am part of the mafiA. WTF? I asked him when he thought I had time to be in the mafia...I am taking care of him, our child, going to school full time, running the household...cooking, cleaning, bills, garbage, etc. He just worked and I took care of everything else...to reduce his stress (and put it all on me!) Anyways, Currently we are living apart, as he is staying at his parents home since he doesn't feel safe in ours due to his delusion that someone was in our house to harm him. Does anyone know of support groups that can be found on the local level? I feel I am in desparate need of support. THere is only so much that friends and family can offer. I really feel like talking to others in similar situations will help me."
New here and support groups Sadwife are you in the US? A quick Google search turned up a page which I hope will at least point you in the right direction for local support: http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/go/f ... port_group If you're in a different country let us know and maybe someone else will be able to help.
"New here and support groups Sadwife, Please don't try to ""reason"" with or explain anything to him. Acknowlege his suspicions and try not to get engaged. I made a huge mistake trying to ""persuade"" my husband that I am ""good,"" which turned out to be the worst thing I could do. Here is the description of how my husband's mind workes, from a Doc who just diagnosed him with DDJ: ""..his (my husband) characteristic way of handling his suspicious about her and the process whereby he gradually finds flaws in evidence that contadicts his suspicions. Appeals to rationality are apt to further entrench his beliefs and he will counter with rational arguments that, while possilbe, are improbable. In this way, he becomes impervious to external influence about these beliefs..."" I think this describes how a DD mind works perfectly. Good luck."
"New here and support groups Hi - thanks for responding to my post. I am in the US, so I will check out that website you gave me. I was also referred to NAMI.org and will be checking them out as I hear they offer a lot of regional support groups. Leavingthedarkness, what is DDJ? I know what DD is, but wasn't sure what the J stood for."
"New here and support groups It is a subtype in DD, J stands for Jealousy. My husband's delusions are very encapsulated. I am the ONLY target of his delusions. His cognitive distortion has gone beyond infidelity accusations. He now thinks I am basically the ""force of evil."" This is absolutly the saddest thing that could happen to love. My husband went from someone who was crazy about me to hates me."
"New here and support groups Sadwife wrote: ... Leavingthedarkness, what is DDJ? I know what DD is, but wasn't sure what the J stood for. A lot of us use informal abbreviations for some of the subtypes of DD, as leavingthedarkness said DDJ is Jealous subtype, DDP would be Persecutory subtype and DDG is Grandiose subtype."
"New here and support groups oh, I see. Thanks for the clarification. My husband...I don't know what type he has...looking back before we knew he was ill, he was always talking about how someone at work was out to get him, so I guess that is persecutory. Then in his other psychotic episodes, he experienced some grandiose thinkng that he has information for our government that AL Quaeda would not want him to pass on. He also feared being watched and followed by the FBI. And this episode involves the Mafia after him and he thought I was involved. And then he also mentioned in passing to his dad that he thinks I had an affair. He seems to be all over the board wal thoughts. I am hoping the therapy and meds will get him under control, as he has been before, and then we really need to keep his stress level to a minimum. He has been fine before....recovered from this but then under a tremendous amount of stress from work. I was asking him to leave his job and look for a new one, but in this economy he was afraid to make that move. Now, he has landed himself in another hospitalization."

"Desperately need advice about husband with DDJ I have been dealing with a husband with what I believe is DDJ for over a decade. We almost divorced over the summer but he decided to come home and asked me to withdraw the divorce, so I did. I love him. I have tried to get him help for years. He has seen a few therapists but will not be honest with them. He believes that I cheat on him constantly or that's what he says anyway. I have taken two polygraph tests and passed them both, but his accusations continue and he finds fault in the tests. We are separated again. He left a few days ago. What I really need is some advice here. I have disagnosed himm with DDJ but there are other illnesses he also has the symptoms of. Paranoid personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, etc... He is abusive, verbally every day, mentally, and sometimes physically. He projects things that he does onto me, i.e. secret social media accounts, connecting with ex-lovers, interest in younger partners, secret cell phones, lying about where he has been, etc... He manipulates me, isolates me from friends and family, I have no friends. I can't visit my adult daughter without him with me or without our youngest son with me. I only get to visit family once or twice per year. I am not allowed to work outside the home. I am not allowed to do much of anything really. I have given into this for years because I thought it would help him to trust me. He believesthat people talk about him behind his back. He believes that compete strangers in public places are laughing at him and talking about him. He believes that I or my family have tried to poison him. He believes that myself or others are out to hurt him or take things from him. He believes that his mother tried to harm him when he was young. He believes that my mother put a Witch curse on him. And he believes that he has connections with certain younger women and when one of them rebuffed him and told my sister what that he had contacted her , he was convinced that she would not have turned him b down or.contacted my sister. He believes it must be a fake account set up by my sister or mother because he could not believe that she would have told on him. He also believed that a young woman that we have a ride once had secretly whispered to him that she wanted him. She didn't. I was in the car and she said nothing to him like that. And she also rebuffed him when he contacted her. Pretty sure I am codependent, I have been trying to fix him for years. I am struggling here. I love him. I knsow he sounds pretty bad this all laid out and this is really only a portion of our issues. Is this really DDJ, is it something else, or is it just an abusive husband? I agave him an ultimatum to get help first or no coming back this time because he has promised so many times and has never followedthrough. Please help me."
"Desperately need advice about husband with DDJ A good place to start is the book I’m not sick and don’t need help. Also, your state NAMI affiliate can help you find support locally. Your hubby needs a psychiatrist and therapist. In my experience the delusional thoughts that go untreated the longest are the hardest to deal with. Good luck. Most people recommend leaving if you can. Best, Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Desperately need advice about husband with DDJ Hi I am going through basically the same things as you.Over the past 5 years accused of cheating, many times. I coped with it keeping it to myself for years, until he told my kids that he believed I had a boyfriend and we were going to separate because of it. At the time i couldnt even defend myself as I was working away and had no idea all this was happening. When I returned I was devastated that he had said these things to my kids. He came up with ridiculous ""evidence"" that I proved time and time again was wrong. and I knew he had no proof of anything because I had done nothing. I know there is no hope for us which is sad as we have been together 27 years and I thought we would grow old together. I loved him. I am really confused and I wonder if it is just me that he hates and why. He has to come back to our home soon to sort everything and prepare our property for sale and I am really nervous about that as we havent spoken for months. He is a great dad and I listen while he talks to my daughter as if nothing ever happened, but calls me a liar and a cheat in messages Does anyone know if this gets better by itself or will get worse and other people will see this side of him. another thing he says is that if I just ""admit "" to what I have done, he will forgive me. what a joke. How do you admit to doing something that you didnt do?"
Desperately need advice about husband with DDJ Hello I am at my wits end with my partner and can totally relate to this post. I just don’t know where to turn and have been putting up with his erratic behaviour and accusations for two years. He also says that if I admit to the affair that we can move on and he will forgive me. I have walked away so many times but then feel sorry for him as I think he’s unwell and I’m not being fair on him. I am also being accused if committing fraud and have been recruited by ‘people’ to do so. He is verbally aggressive and then turns up wanting to be loving which I just can’t do. There is no swaying from his beliefs and the more I defend myself the more I am guilty in his eyes. We have been together for ten years and prior to this he was lovely. I haven’t felt safe at times. He has recently told me that he’s met someone else as he can’t trust me. He says he loves me but he doesn’t believe anything I say - he tells me that I’m lying when I tell him that I love him and miss him. I think that if I just let him go and be with this new woman and stop responding to his emails that his delusional paranoia will go away as he perhaps won’t do this with someone new meaning that he will suddenly get better overnight. Is this the way to help him get better or wound he just continue with someone else? He has lost his job because of erratic behaviour at work (he thought he was being followed and was going to be blamed for the company’s IT systems worldwide being hacked - they eventually paid him off to leave). When he’s around other people he can appear perfectly ok.
"Desperately need advice about husband with DDJ Hi there, I'm sorry you're going through this. I think you'd benefit from an in person group that understands as well as this online community. I'd recommend calling NAMI (the National Allience on Mental Illness) 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) ask them the number for your state and / or local component if you are in the US. Sign up and go to a family to family course, or just start by talking to the Help line and asking questions about how to get someone help who doesn't want it, and where as a person with a loved one with mental illness, where you can get support. My aunt is a board member in her state (my cousin was diagnosed about 20 years ago), and my mom is a local component board member (she said she feels like she found her people, after I encouraged her to get involved), It's people like them who teach the classes for family-to-family, and offer real support. I also want to encourage you to listen to Dr. Amador on youtube, or read ""I'm not sick and I don't need help"", it's a great organization with a lot of people with experience personally navigating through really hard times. Again, I'm sorry you have to go through this, but there are a lot of great people struggling with this sort of thing too. All the best, Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Need help with DD wife. What happens to the kids? I am new here, I read many posts in this forum, and found a ton of useful information. My wife of 18 years is delusional, and our story is no different to many I read here. It has been 3 years since the first episode, when she was sure there were cameras at home looking at everything she did, and I was with our neighbors watching her (This happened after watching the Truman Show...) Everyone in the streets mock her and talked about her. These things went on during all this time, she never accepted that she is ill, no matter how much evidence I show her. About a year ago, she started focusing her delusions on me. She accuses me of lying pretty much every time I open my mouth, the members of my whole family are pathological liars. I mock her and copy all her gestures to the point that she starts crying when she is with me. I hide things to make her crazy, and I conspire with other people to steal from her. She also thinks that I have another woman, and sometimes that I have a male lover as well. I could go on and on, but I don't want to make this too long. Seeing that she is not willing to get help, I am thinking of divorce before I start getting sick. Reading the posts here, I didn't find any case in which the ill spouse gets good treatment, takes his/her medicine, and the marriage goes on without interruption and live together happily for a long time. It seems that divorce is the only way out. At this point I am totally convinced that our marriage is over. What I don't read much is about what is the effect of this problem on the kids. We have 14 and 16 year old boys. Their mother has been good to them, and although they are aware of her problems, and many times they witness her treatment to me, they are not too upset. Whenever she talks unreasonable things to them, they just laugh it out or ignore her, and she doesn't seem to mind. My main worry is that, once we divorce and I am out of the picture, would she start focusing her delusions on them? Has anyone experienced that situation. I am very worried about something like it happening. At the end of the day the most important is the well being of the kids. I'll appreciate any comment, suggestion or ideas about this. Thanks for reading"
"Need help with DD wife. What happens to the kids? Hi VeryConcernedHusband, Undone has gotten care,and is married. I divorced because my ex stigmatized mental illness and didn't love me through it all. As for those of us who live with treatment in recovery, there are some of us on this site. The most important factor is insight, and accepting care. It is possible to recover. Many who recover move on with life and may not need this site when they take their medication and move on. For me, my emotional response to my experience has been slow to heal. My mental health is solid. My story just makes me sad. As for the kids, if she hasn't shown any symptoms towards them, it probably isn't an issue. As long as she is in care and addressing her mental health, she has rights as a mother. The one good thing about my ex, he used my love of my daughter to force me into care. Read ""I'm not sick and I don't need help"". You can find it on Amazon, and sign up for a NAMI family to family course to get an in person support network to help you make these touch choices, and to hopefully get your wife the care she needs. Wishing you the best, Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Need help with DD wife. What happens to the kids? Without treatment, my ex got worse. Her delusions grew. It was initially just me, but after a few years, it was everyone she had contact with. That included our kids, her family, her friends, and even my friends. Eventually, she thought everything arounded her was fake, like The Truman Show. She thought she was in a sound stage somewhere in China. Her surroundings were green-screened and the people were actors. Everything on her computer and phone were fed to her. She would examine our kids' faces regularly, and say they're not our kids, and ask me when she'll get to see our ""real kids."" It's tough. You have to use whatever leverage you have to get her into treatment. Even then, it's a challenge to get her to stick with it."
"Does My Wife Have DDJ Our marriage has had good years and bad years, but over the last 29 years the good has certainly outweighed the bad. Things were going great, we were eagerly making plans for retirement in the future, until recently when things have rapidly turned dark when the endless accusations began. The first major accusation was that I was having an affair with the girl that cut my hair. Then the laser beam focus shifted to my work. She began to incessantly drill me about who I had lunch with in the cafeteria, etc. Then I was accused of having an afffair with one of my female co-workers, and then another. She then started checking my home email, computer usage, text messages, and cell phone calls... demanding that I identify each number and the conversations that took place from 3 months prior. The accusations continued to grow. She ""knew"" I was getting up in the middle of the night and spending hours on the computer. Her health began to fail, she now needed Ambien to sleep and doctors prescribed anxiety and blood pressure medications. Because of her health, she asked if I was trying to poision her. She asked if I was secretly taking pictures of her, and asked if I had video tape equipment hidden in our bedroom. My beloved wife then began hiding tape recorders in my home office and car in hopes of ""catching me in the act"". The clincher came when I received what I thought were a couple of innocuous wrong number texts. One was about the individual going out to eat after church and the other was pertaining to someone's family reunion. I texted back they had the wrong number. My wife didn't think they were so innocent. Unbeknownst to me, she hired a private investigator. Together they tracked down who had the phone number and did research, background checks, etc. Apparently this individual was a known homosexual. So now the accusations came flying that I was having a homosexual relationship. That is when she moved out and filed for divorce. After 29 years I am left devasted, hurt beyond words, and left searching for answers. The woman I knew for all of those years bears no resembalance to the woman who she is now. Could this be DDJ, or some type of side-affect from the medications? Or could this be a sign of some other underlying mental health issue?"
"Does My Wife Have DDJ I know exactly what you feel like. I've gone through a similar experience with my beloved ex husband, who started accusing me of having affairs, poisoning him, need I go on? He ended up divorcing me after a 35 year relationship. No matter what I did or said, I couldn't get through to him. When the children tried to rationalize with him, he said they were working in concert with me and that they were taking up for me because I'm their mother. He refused to seek help. The children even offered to go with him since he no longer trusted me, but he wouldn't. Like you said, he's turned into a completely different person. The man I love no longer exists. I think it's genetic. His mom has paranoid schizophrenia, and it manifested itself in her around the same age as him. I wish I could encourage you and tell you that she'll be her old self again. From my experience, as well as others whose stories are posted, all I can suggest is to seek help for yourself. This nearly destroyed me emotionally, I'm still trying to heal. My heart is still broken, but through prayer and my faith in God, He is seeing me through. Holidays are the most difficult. We did everything together. He and our children were my whole life. Seek counseling. It's a bitter pill to swallow. Our home is set to be auctioned off in December, everything we struggled for is gone. He seems to have gone on with his life. I wonder if he's truly as happy as he tells everyone he is. God Bless you."
"Does My Wife Have DDJ Hi Sandollar. I've been lurking on this board for over a year. But your post is the one that brought me into the light. If it makes you feel a little better, I will tell you that I've experienced almost EXACTLY everything you have experienced. I would regularly read other posts and nothing quite matched my situation. But your situation matched mine almost verbatim. It started 4 years ago with accusations that my personality had changed. That maybe I was having a mid life crisis. It then changed to me having an affair with someone. Then she figured out who the affair was with so I was then having an affair with a specific person. She made up stories about seeing this woman with us in restaurants when we went out. But never did she see us together. I worked with this woman at a previous job but had very little to do with her. Then 2 years ago, I think she had nervous breakdown. Her story changed to me surveilling her in our home with recording devices and cameras. This is so I could keep tabs on her thus allowing me to do all sorts of nefarious activities such as operating a porn site, having an affair, maybe even doing drugs. She claims that I took pictures of her and our daughter at night and posted them on the internet. But no pictures have ever been produced (because they don't exist). I was then accused of getting up at night to do all sorts of things. Funny thing is, I sleep very soundly and rarely wake up at all. I've been accused of giving cues in restaurants to people that are watching us. I've been accused of tricking her sister into taking my side in all this. I've been accused of gaslighting her (trying to make her think she is crazy) so that I can have her locked up and then taking our family assets for myself. So I've been living with this now for 4 years. I'm about at the end of my rope. I asked her why she still lives with someone that would do all these things to her. She says that she is keeping her commitment to God and our family. Death do us part. Needless to say, we both have a strong faith. I'm willing to work with her and help her but I cannot take the continued scrutiny and accusations that come out of the blue. I've tried to lay down boundaries but they do no good. She's just not dealing with reality. So she uses her ""faith"" to give her the right to abuse me at every turn by staying in our marriage and keeping her commitment to God. After reading all the posts on this site, I've pretty much given up hope for her to ever get better. I can't get her into counseling because that's part of my ""plan"". So I'm just trying to get along as best I can. There's much more to this story but that's enough for now. Good luck!!"
"Does My Wife Have DDJ I read your heart-breaking post, along with the equally troubling stories of others submitted as follow-ups. If there is any comfort in this, let me say I have experienced almost everything each of you describe over the past few years. My wife has accused me of almost everything one can be accused of, the most reoccurring accusation centering around her clothes which constantly disappear, thrown her in a panic - followed by a host of strange reasons all centered around my stealing her clothes for various reasons. I too have been accused of affairs more times than I can recall, for reasons varying from a cord on a light in the wrong position, to a fast-food receipt that had a small change in what i normally order. This constant barrage has taken a heavy toll on my mental and emotional health, and I rely heavily on a counselor to help me keep myself together for the sake of 2 children, as well as continuing to try and help my wife. She has gone to the lengths of daily checks of my cell phone, mileage, pockets for receipts, and most expensive, a secret video camera system installed on our home she used to monitor my every movement for over 6 months before I discovered it accidentally. Now, the encouraging news, and hopefully helpful for others. Since she has always insisted I am the reason for all these events due to my many mental problems she constantly diagnoses, I was able to convince her to come to therapy with me in order to help ME. She is willing to do this as she feels sorry for me having so many mental problems. My therapist has worked with me in this, trying out each new technique on me first, before asking her to try it in order to help me feel more comfortable. I do not know if this will work for others, but at least i have her voluntary going to therapy twice a week in order to help her poor husband. I wish you all the best of luck and God bless."
"Does My Wife Have DDJ It has now been a couple of months since my original post, I wish I could say things have improved but they have degraded to a point that I could never have imagined. My beloved wife of almost 30 years and I had what I considered to be a very loving, satisfying marriage. Now, as we're approaching the holidays, she is accusing me of being a male prostitute. She is saying I have sneaked males into the house at night to have sex while she was in bed sleeping. She is accusing me of meeting men in parking lots, country roads and gas stations in order to be paid to have sex with them. She is worried that I will not account for these finances in the pending divorce. This is an insidious disease, robbing my loved one of rational thoughts and thinking. I keep thinking it can't get any worse, I've now come the the realization that... yes it can."

My own ex-wife had at times accused me of having affairs (I wasn't). Oddly she did nothing with her accusations during the divorce process. If there was any truth to any of it it would have been easy enough to prove, and she could have used it against me to get a settlement that was more favorable to her. The fact that she didn't even try tells me that on some level she knew it was all BS and it wasn't going to stand up for a minute to any rational scrutiny."
"Does My Wife Have DDJ Sandolllar wrote: I keep thinking it can't get any worse, I've now come the the realization that... yes it can. I thought the same thing, that it couldn't get any worse, when my now ex-husband began with his accusations back in 2000. But as time went on they did, it began with the accusation that I was having one lesbian affair, then spread to my co-workers, friends, and then to almost every female I came in contact with. I kept patiently asking for his reasoning saying, ""please help me to understand why you're thinking these things?""... His response was, ""I can tell by the way you look at them""... I asked for an example of ""the look"" and what I got was the most rediculous example, it was a look you'd see an actor having in a movie where they come upon a beautiful oasis after spending a week in the middle of an Arabian dessert. Get the picture? The sad part is that this IS WHAT HE SAW IN HIS MIND. He even accused me of possibly having our new born artifically inseminated by the brother of one of my alleged lesbian mates in order to have a child close to her DNA. Yes, I just had just given birth to our 4th child 3 months before when this was dumped on me. Over time I became somewhat callous, and perhaps a little cynical, it was my only defense mechanism for the emotional pain I was feeling. I was beyond pissed, I was bitter, just plain bitter. Why did my loving husband become a monster? I didn't know anyone who had this sort of situation to talk to, I only wish I had come upon this site back then. At the time I felt so ALONE. When I felt an episode coming, and believe me it got to a point when I could clearly see one coming, I would stop him in his tracks and say, ""look, at this point, nothing you can say would surprise me, even if you accused me of having an affair with your own mother!"" ... and then I would turn around and leave the room or house if necessary. In reality, what hurt the most was that HE BELIEVED ALL HIS ACCUSATIONS BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT. I remember telling my counselor how I'd like to trade places with him so that he could feel the pain he was causing me... He quickly interrupted my thoughts and said, ""don't ever say that again, there is no greater pain than what he's feeling as a prisoner of DDJ."" So unfortunately, if your wife truly does have a delusional disorder, it does get worse... which is why I am now divorced and raising four children practically on my own. I sincerely hope your situation is an exception to the rule. God bless. ~ Beautiful Mind"
"Does My Wife Have DDJ sorry to read that things have gotten worse. my wife of 16 years has left and tells me she is going to file for divorce.(my post is delusional wife...or am i crazy) my question for you is who is instigating the divorce you or your wife. i am trying to find similarities for my own situation. i thought my story was bizzare, but your last post is almost unfathomable."
"Does My Wife Have DDJ Wow, there seems to many of us that have the same situation. I've also cruised the Mid Life crisis boards and the Menopause boards and many stories are similar. Something comes over people and they go off the deep end. They destroy everything they have loved and worked for and blame someone else (or everyone else) for the results. It's very sad. In this thread alone there are 4 men that have almost the exact situations. It must be diagnosable and treatable. You just have to trick the person into getting help. I had one chance with a marriage counselor and he didn't work out. I've read other threads on this board where people successfully get the person to go to a Dr only to have the Dr wimp out which then throws the other person under a bus. You have to play that psychiatrist card carefully. You may only get 1 shot. As for instigating a divorce, I find that my wife will make many threats and they all come up empty. Those were the mistakes I made at first: I would react to her threats. Now I just brush them off. She never follows through on anything. So if my wife threatened a divorce, I would challenge her to go ahead knowing that she would never pull it off. Nearly all of her threats are idle and are just attempts to hurt me to get some type of reaction I believe. And I do say it works most times. Because once she has broken me down, then she seems to become calm and we have a good spell for a while. I also read in one of our threads that someone can ""see the episode coming"". I'm with you there. I can always see them coming which helps me not to react. I just ride them out. But eventually, she has to hurt me to gain some inner peace for herself. Hard to understand."
"Feeling like I was just born and in the wrong body I was wondering if anyone experienced blank mind to the extent that it was like tabula rasa and the world was completely brand new and ideas had to be formed by reading other people’s ideas, novels, works, media. It’s like my memories flooded into me but they didn’t feel like mine because I was this new being.....overtime I’ve clutched tightly onto the memories because without them I was nothing, no self at all, no originality. I woke up as a baby in a 16 year old body with memories of being that infant. I’ve found no one else who’s experienced this particular event and I still hope that there’s someone out there who has, because my existence feels very very isolating and miserable."
"Help with DDJ wife Hi to all of you. My wife and I have been married for over 5 years. For the last 2 years she started accusing me of having an affair and these accusations have got to a point where she has moved out of the house and is ready to file for divorce. She does not listen to reason and no matter who talks to her she will not believe that there is no affair. She also believes that my family has been doing witchcraft for her and after she moved out of the house these delusions have only gotten stronger. She refuses to go for counseling and thinks I am a psychopath and have bipolar disorder and that I am trying to make her look crazy. The thing is I understand her illness as she was always possessive over me. She didn't like me being on Facebook, so to make her happy I deleted my facebook all social media, she did not want me on Whatsapp so I did not bother to upgrade my phone. She always accused me of looking at other women, but I am not the type of person to even approach someone, I am a very introverted person. I used to be questioned every day about what I did for the day, and if I needed to work overtime I used to pick my wife up and she kept me company at work. The whole time we where married I never spent a night apart from her except when I was in hospital. I do not understand where her delusions come from and when I ask her to go for therapy she refuses. I want to help her but it seems like my marriage is over and she refuses to even talk to me. I have lost my job, my family, my health and my reputation trying to prove my innocence. All this stress of being constantly accused put me in hospital and now she does not even feel an ounce of guilt as she thinks it is punishment from god. I changed my religion and relocated to another town to prove my love for her and she still does not want to be with me. Recently I went through her old phone and noticed messages from her mum saying that she must not trust me and my family. This from a mother who abandoned her when she was 4 years old, and the only reason she is close to her mum was because I helped restore that relationship. Please help me in resolving this situation, should I give my wife time and space and hope she comes back to me, or is she going to be happier without me in her life. At the moment her mother says she is happier away from me but I don't know what to do because I love her so much and I cannot give up on her. Is there any possibility for reconciliation in our marriage?"
"Help with DDJ wife Hello, I am currently going through the same thing. I fear I created this monster because I had a porn addiction and I lied to her, denying her reality. I was so involved with work, that I’m afraid I broke her. Over the past 3 years, I was accused of being attracted to teenagers, meeting people for sex in the woods, and sneaking people in our house. She accused me of taking drugs and paying for prostitutes. She started drinking again after being sober for 10 years. I’m the beginning , I did everything wrong. Now , I have tried to tell her that she is delusional but she says that I am saying that to cover for my sex addiction. I’ve taken drug tests, psychosexual evaluations, and have tried to get her family and friends to help me. She is very convincing and because I reacted so poorly in the beginning, I’m basically alone in this struggle. I’m trying to get her to a psychiatrist but I’m not sure if it would help. We have two children and if I leave, I’m afraid things will get bad for them. I am at a loss here and getting desperate. This just sucks."
"Help with DDJ wife I just wanted to chime in about causality. I don't think anything that anyone does or says causes delusion disorder. I think it's just a brain gone wrong. I'm not an expert, but I've read many accounts of people who have loved ones with this disorder and their backgrounds and life situations are all varied. With my mom, she will tell everyone that her ex-husband abused her, and she's very believable until she starts to mention the part about him scratching her cooking pots, or sanding the picture frame. But all the stories have changed a lot over the past 9 years that we've known she's had delusions. They divorced over 6 years ago, after he lived with constant accusations for 3+ years. We were worried about his stress. She accused him of multiple affairs, of stealing her things, etc. Now she thinks he is still entering her apartment to damage her things. Believe me, he did not abuse her, he did not steal or damage her things. They were together 30 years before she got delusions. Their relationship wasn't perfect, but it was nothing anyone did that resulted in her having delusions. I am relieved they are no longer together because of the terrible stress for him. I wish so much their being apart could have also relieved her stress that her brain is causing herself, but that can't be helped. She refuses all the delusion diagnoses she's received, from multiple doctors. Over the years, not only do her details of the delusions change but the types of delusions change, too. In the past year, she has acquired the type where she thinks she has tiny bugs on herself, like fleas or mites. I just don't want loved ones to think they could or should have done something different, or blame themselves. I've tried so hard to ease my mom's mind, but nothing works and I've learned to let it go and distance myself. It's very sad because in some ways, she is still 'there' and there are times when she seems fine. It's a tragic illness."
Help with DDJ wife I feel the horror. I am so sorry. I too have been accused of a lot. The worst things are the sexual deviant things. I finally moved out. I hate what I say sometimes but they make you insane. Only if somebody has walked in your shoes and experienced what it’s like to be called a rapist a pedophile a demon gods mistake queer cheater. It’s embarassing and humiliating especially when it’s done in front ont of people/ strangers. They don’t know that ur wife has dd. They know that you were called a rapist by a lady who looks like your wife. You can’t say oh she’s nuts and it go away. I understand. It’s awful. They tell everybody like an evil kid. I think when all is said and done this is one of the most horrible psychiatric illnesses and causes the most collateral damage to luv ones. Good luck.
"Help with DDJ wife I so relate to your statement 'by a lady who looks like your wife'. When my mom was still married, and then going through a divorce, I let both attorneys know that there was no abuse, no affairs, etc. I've also phoned her doctors without her knowing, just so they can understand her illness. And thankfully, the police and medical professionals that she's reporting her ex-husband to have all been able to fairly quickly see that she has delusions, and no one has actually investigated or questioned her now-ex-husband. She thinks I'm close-minded and can't see the 'truth' and she tells me that the police know what she says is true, and that her friends believe her. I've so far successfully not revealed to her that the police have phoned me to discuss her delusions. Sometimes I feel like I have to follow her all around town and tell everyone she's talked to that all her stories never happened. I just hate that she's saying terrible things about her ex-husband, because she STILL thinks he comes in and hacks her computer, poisons her, etc. So awful."
"Should I be afraid of my roommate? This is my first post here. I’m not even sure if this is the right forum, but I meed some advice. Sorry in advance, this will be a bit long. I’m an American student studying in China. I live on campus with a roommate, another American, who is also in most of the same classes as me. From the beginning (2 months ago) she was very quiet and somewhat lethargic, but neither of these things bothered me and we’ve had a pretty peaceful cohabitation so far. In the past week, things have changed drastically. I noticed she began doing little inexplicable things; keeping the window shut constantly, tossing my things onto my side of the room if I accidentally left them laying around. Then, 2 days ago as I was preparing to head out for class, she asked me suddenly if I had a “problem” with her. I confusedly said no, and when I asked her why she thought that, she responded that she kept “hearing my name everywhere”. This made as little sense in context as it does here, but she somewhat coldly dropped the subject when I assured her I had nothing against her. When I returned from class, she briefly stepped out almost immediately; when she returned, her mood had gone from her usual stoic silence to genuine anger. She accused me of insulting her on very petty points (her weight, skin color, etc) to other students around campus, and further stated that my comments, and comparisons between her and myself, were now being widely discussed. I obviously denied everything and, thinking there was some misunderstanding, asked her who had been saying these things. This is where things became odd: despite my asking multiple times, she would not name names, or even describe the people supposedly badmouthing her, but kept insisting that “everyone” was talking about her. She said she had been hearing my name “40 times a day” over the past few days, and that she had also heard my voice yelling “I hate her” repeatedly outside, while gesturing towards the sole window in our dorm room. At this point I remembered her sudden habit of keeping the window closed at all times; the window looks out over a large courtyard, one can only hear what people outside are saying if they’re shouting. I eventually got her to specify that she overheard our classmate outside, saying “she ought to tell her” in Chinese, to a male voice who replied “She won’t/didn’t tell her”. I don’t know how this dialouge was supposed to relate to the issue at hand. Please note that the accused classmate is extremely uncomfortable speaking Chinese in any context, let alone gossiping loudly outdoors. Still thinking that there was some misunderstanding, I became upset and teary. Besides denying any wrongdoing I asked her to tell me immediately the next time she heard any such comments, so that I could confront the people in question. By this time I was suspicious that these things could not be happening in reality, but I didn’t try to argue with her on that point. She calmed down, though I’m not sure what exactly made her suddenly passive. When I asked if anything else had made her think I hated her, she made vague comments about how we needed to mutually help keep our room clean, and pointed out that i often left the toilet cover down, as though doing so was a clear sign of ill will towards her. When she eventually apologized if she had falsely accused me, she offered me some tea in an abruptly cheerful way. For the rest of that day she was her usual (stoic, untalkative) self. The next day at 6 am, when I hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet, she repeated the same charges against me, only this time with certainty that was genuinely disturbing. She claimed to be hearing my name constantly, and at that moment gestured to the men outside chatting in what might have been Urdu, saying incredulously “You don’t hear it?” She refused to hear anything I had to say and produced a list of other dorm rooms that had vacancies, which i now realize she must have gotten the day she first confronted me, saying that if I had a problem with her then I should move out. When it became clear we were at an impasse I silently prepared to head out for the day, while she sat on her bed staring into space for what must have been 15 minutes. Since that discussion, which was yesterday morning, I have been avoiding her entirely; I went by the room briefly to get items I absolutely needed, with classmates watching over me, and am now sleeping on the floor of someone else’s room. I obviously can’t know exactly what she’s experiencing, but the thigs she’s saying have led me to believe she’s hearing things that are not really there, at the very least, and that it’s not safe for me to be around her. Today is Sunday; tomorrow morning, I plan to go to the dorm manager’s office as soon as it opens, and ask for a new dorm assignment far away from her. So here is my question (finally): besides moving out of the room, is there anything else I can do to improve this situation? We have the same curriculum, so I will still have to see her in class (although her attendance is very poor), and the thought of that fills me with dread. On the other hand, she has never threatened me in any way, and the Chinese government is extremely unsympathetic towards the mentally ill (to the point that she could be deported or even imprisoned if evidence of her illness was sufficient) so I’m hesitant to report her delusions to anyone. She probably needs help but we are in a country that is notoriously poor at providing it. Another problem is the language barrier; my Chinese is decent, but I am not at all fluent enough to descibe this situation accurately to anyone beyond “I don’t feel safe around my roommate, I must move as soon as possible”. I don’t have any way to contact her family or friends. I don’t know what else to do. Any advice would be appreciated."
"Should I be afraid of my roommate? Just move out. Probably she is not fit to share a room with anyone. Chances are good her voices will change focus. Sadly the only helpful message would be „it is just your voices, this happens inside your head only“ (I have to tell my co-workers frequently) but I am afraid she has no insight in her illness, so this would not work. All the other problems are beyond your responsibility. Seem you can do nothing but leave and let things happen according to chinese standards... sorry"
"Feeling depressed with DDJ wife Me (32M) and my wife (30F) will be married for 2 years come this Friday and I am feeling miserable thinking of the options I have in front of me. I did not know that a di sease such as Delusional Disorder Jealous Type even existed till I first found this forum when googling desperately about what could be causing my wife to be so paranoid about me.And I think maybe she is suffering from it. She thinks 1. I have cameras set up around the house to spy on her and do what I need to do. She has removed smoke alarms and CO sensors in our bedroom since she feels there is a camera in it that I have planted. I have asked her to have it checked by someone if she wants but no go. 2. I write on her with my finger the initials of the person I am supposedly cheating her with when I hug her while sleeping. 3. She is suffering from an as of yet undiagnosed condition which causes her severe uncontrollable itching in the genital and anal regions. She thinks this is because of STDs I have passed on to her. I have taken STD tests 3 times in the last two years and still she doesn't believe the results. 4. She checks my pockets, my underwear, and everywhere to find the ""device I have hidden"". When she doesn't find anything she says maybe I have it implanted in me and use it to communicate with another woman when in the restroom. 5. I have given her my phone and she has set the passcode for it. I only use it when I get calls or when I call my family in front of her. And still she feels somehow I have hacked it to be able to communicate with others. She has accused me of hacking her phone, her mom's phone and everything possible. 6. She finds her own hair in our car, wrappers she put sometime back, her hair clips and she says they belong to some other girl. 7. She keeps hearing imaginary conversations I have with supposedly other women discussing how I am going to get out of this marriage. I have taken to recording my laptop screen (with audio) when I am working and even when I show her the recording which clearly has no conversations she says the video is rubbish and is manipulated. 8. She used to say she can smell perfume on my shirt after coming back from work. (I do not use any perfume at all). 8. She has accused me of flirting and showing interests in all sorts of women. Women who were old enough to be my mother and my own cousin. 9. She bought a bunch of spy cams and tried to keep them all around the home but I found out since I saw the email confirming her order. She used them only once and has not used it since. 10. If she is ever out traveling alone or visiting her family she will video call me up at the middle of the night and ask me to walk around the home to show that there was no woman in our home. She has now gone to her Grandfather's funeral and has set up some security cameras all over the house. But still she accuses me of turning them off whenever I want to. 11. I work from home nowadays because I find it hard to take the accusations that accompany me actually going to my office and even then she accuses me of communication with some woman through some means. Does this sound like DDJ? All these accusation have taken their toll on me. I get very agitated and start yelling when she makes these accusations or as she says it asks me questions. We have had very bad fights. We have gone to couple's marriage counseling and they don't really help as it mostly ends up in her accusing me and me defending and the resentment over the accusations. I always used to wonder why she is so desperately making up stuff to make me seem a bad person. It even seemed like she would actually like me to be the bad person just so that her thoughts of me are proved to be right. When I ask her she says no, she only want to ""correct"" me and get me back on the ""good"" path. I find that line very very insulting as I have not been unfaithful at all and I have done everything possible to help her trust me but she just ignores all my efforts and says I just find loopholes and cheat her and am controlled by the person I cheat her with. I want to reiterate I have never even been unfaithful and my wife is actually my one and only relationship ever. Reading up on this disorder makes me think she is most probably suffering from it. I have called her paranoid and imagining thing during our fights and she says I am gaslighting her and that she is totally normal. I am not able to live in such a marriage anymore and I am going to give her an ultimatum of going for therapy and stop accusing me here onwards or I am going to go for a divorce. The saddest thing here is I actually love her and she loves me too. When she is not having one of these suspicions she is so loving to me it breaks my heart even thinking of leaving her. I am just breaking down crying every few hours when I think of what I should do and all the happy moments we have had. I look at our photographs and it kills me to even think of giving up on our marriage. But she thinks of me as a cheater and a liar who is putting up an act for every other person in this world. I have been completely open with her. She knows the password to every account of mine. She has my phone 99% of the time. But still there is only distrust. I know I cannot continue in this marriage if I am going to be accused like this every now and then. This has affected me mentally. I have stopped socializing at work and have cut down on most friendships because of all the accusations. I know I cannot bring a child in to this world with her if we are going to be like this always. I am distraught and am depressed. Any words will help. Please help me through this horrible time. Why did my wife have to get this horrid horrid disease. We both love each other and we are not able to live happily as we deserve to."
"Feeling depressed with DDJ wife I'm really sorry you're going through this with your wife. I can tell you that for us, it seems to get worse and professionals have told me that I need to maintain boundaries, because I can't help her, I can't solve her delusions, and I need to protect my well-being. In our case, my mom has been divorced from her husband for 6 years and her delusions about him keep changing and increasing. She has also developed another kind of delusion, in addition to the paranoia and jealousy kind. She now thinks she has little bugs on herself, she said it was fleas at first, then she said they went away, and now she thinks she has mites. She still spends money on a door alarm system to keep her now-ex-husband out, and calls police occasionally because of the break-ins. Of course, there is no one coming in and stealing her stuff (and sometimes she says he returns and puts the item back), or hacking her computer, or causing her water pipes to make a noise... on and on. She recently told me she's hired a private investigator, and joined an domestic abuse support group. I only wonder how many weeks it will take for these people to realize that the stories she tells never happened. They'll probably start to question when she talks about her ex putting dust on her through holes in her ceiling. She has had doctors tell her she's got delusions, but she won't believe that, and then won't see those doctors. She was on an anti-psychotic medication for a couple weeks, but it didn't help. I've tried and tried to comfort her and calm her fear by letting her know there isn't anyone after her, but she gets angry and accuses me of being naive and stupid. When it started, she thought her husband was having multiple affairs, even with some of my acquaintances, and that he molested my son, and had her car tracked, was damaging her furniture, and on and on. We were so worried about his stress level dealing with the constant accusations. He loved her and endured for 3 years, and finally she pursued a divorce. He's not my dad, but we are still connected with him and make sure he's okay. He's still like a step-dad to me, and he's a wonderful man. We are so glad they are no longer together because of the stress on him. Please don't feel guilty or blame yourself for needing to be away from the delusional person. Sometimes it's necessary. This illness is truly horrible. I will always make sure my mom has a roof over her head, but I need to minimize contact, and minimize my family's contact with her. It's very sad, because in some ways she's still smart, funny, cute, but in other ways, my mom is gone."
"Feeling depressed with DDJ wife Thank you very much Sanmom for your response. Just having someone respond helps me so much. We are living separately for the last month now and it is such a relief I am actually able to go to a store by myself and not worry if the line at the counter is too long. I gave my wife an ultimatum that she needs to accept that I have never cheated and to never again accuse me and that she needs to go and talk to a doctor. It went as well as I should have expected she said I am the one suffering from Bipolar disorder and I am the one that needs to go to the doctor. She completely ignores any questions that I ask about her obviously false accusations and only focusses on things which I cannot disprove. I have told her I need a divorce and now she says she loves me and we can start afresh and she will not accuse me if I do not do anything wrong. How can I accept that? I have never done anything wrong and have been called a thief, a cheat and a liar for no fault of mine. How can I accept that she would not repeat this. Even now she says she saw what she saw and heard what she heard and that I have done bad things to her. And she alleges the only reason I am asking for a divorce is to get married to the person she says I am ""having an affair"" with. Makes me want to cry. I am trying to hold strong to my demand for divorce but the time away some how makes me remember only the good times, look at our pictures and cry. I cannot let myself be treated that way again. I think back on all the accusations she made and try to strengthen myself. Still I feel so guilty and sad about leaving her when she says she loves me. Why am I facing all this?"
"Feeling depressed with DDJ wife Without medication and therapy, it won't get better. You have to be firm about that. If she agrees, make her take shots so it's trackable. Make her sign a power-of-attorney agreement that allows you to make her get treatment. Otherwise, you're in a long, frustrating, losing battle. Of course, that's easier said than done."
"Day vs. night I haven’t been the best over the last couple of years. Dealt with very significant medication reductions and changes. I went manic, I did odd things on social media. in the daytime I usually feel ok during the day but at night I feel like s($t. So I come on sites like this desperate for something that isn’t there. It’s not that things are all so bad or anything. I’m trying right now to keep the good things for myself. But at night I’m miserable and feel alone and attitude sadness very strong emotion tied to past memories ranging from childhood until today. It’s upsetting to have those thoughts and not know if I lshould be proud of myself or deeply ashamed. I want to be proud of myself I’m just not sure if I can give into things that make me happy or feel like myself somehow because I might be manic and won’t realize I was manic unti later. I have an inadequacy complex that’s doing more harm than good. Long story Short, this has got to end. I don’t want to be dealing with these issues throughout my child’s life. I feel it would be irresponsible to a degree and very immature to set a good example and do for my family. The more things change the less I want it to stay the same."
"A delusional person is fixated on me Hi everyone, I am new to psychforums and hope that I am posting this in the right place. I need advice from people who understand how to interact with (or whether or not to try to interact with) people with certain delusions. My situation is as follows: I am a young female trauma survivor who posts online content for other trauma survivors. I have a bit of a following, not that big but pretty big for the type of content I make. About a month ago, I got an email from a guy who I thought might be delusional and beyond my help, but something he said indicated that he might be a survivor of the type of trauma I am, so I responded once, being supportive and casually opening the door for further conversation. His response was really nonsensical and included mention of something sexually inappropriate, so I chose not to respond further. Since then, I have received dozens of emails from him, none of which I have responded to. At first, I hoped it would stop and mostly didn't read what he sent. But it's been over a month now with no sign of ceasing, so I started reading his most recent ones. It appears that he thinks I am speaking to him in some kind of code through my online content and he has become increasingly angry that I am not replying to his emails directly. He has become demanding that I respond to him directly, believes that he deserves a response. He has told me he has a history of extreme violence (I presume from the context it was in his childhood, but that naturally frightens me). And has continued to send weird, sexual stuff. No pictures or pornography that I have seen, but keeps bringing up an erotic story site. He has also become verbally abusive, criticizing me for things I said on my website and calling me some not-so-nice adjectives. He uses lots of expletives in his emails and frequently goes off about psychotic and hypocritical people who he thinks are problematic (seems very angry towards society in general, which I relate to, but I digress). I'm currently at a point where I feel like I need to do something about this, but don't know what. I am unwilling to stop my online work over this or stop making my email available to people who need help. And I would allow this person to go on emailing me indefinitely with no response - I'm already doing that with someone else who I do not feel poses any physical threat - but I now feel like, given the level of anger this person is directing toward me and how delusional they appear, that I may not be safe and may need to take some action. The problem is, I don't know what. I grew up with people who were sicker than him, but learned that there was no effective way to communicate with them and went no contact. I don't know how to deal with this person effectively if it's possible to do so at all. If anyone has any suggestions, that'd be greatly appreciated. I do not want to make this worse."
"A delusional person is fixated on me Does this person have any personal information such as address/ phone number or just your full name. If he does, ask the police to come out and at least fill out an incident report. Just what you said here is Fine. Don’t panic but slowly start moving your info to a new site. Under a pen name. You have to remember I see the other side of this day after day. It’s a weirdness you wouldn’t believe. My wife has been through 2 stays at psych ward and still is not budging. When I left a few minutes ago, her eyes were fixated on tucker. Like a trance. Talking to him and even kissed him on the I pad. I can’t tell you what men are like when they have it. I do know John Hinkley had it. Shot Reagan for her adoration. It’s an illness and you do need to address this with an Leo. It’s not being mean or cold , it’s protecting yourself and getting him help. Personally I would not mention your thoughts on dd or about this site. Please do call the police and start the process of driving a wedge between his delusions and you."
What would you do? Wife has dd My wife called from the psych ward. She has dd and is in love with tucker Carlson. She said that she loves me but is only in love with tucker. I am the driver and when she gets out she wants me to pick her up and she will go to San Francisco when ready. Of two Choices what would you do: 1) pick her up/allow her to stay even though She doesn’t love me (erotomania) And possibly never will remember. ( only 7% of marriages survive this) and yes I’d love her. But it’s killing me inside. 2) say no. You come here as my wife Or live with your family. There is no more of us until tucker is not a part of you. She very rarely Calls me and thinks my visits And calls are done as friends. Please Give me your honest opinion. I want all angles That I Have not thought of.
"What would you do? Wife has dd Please Notice - Lyrics And baby when you sleep, do you dream of me? And when you're awake, do you think of me? I need to know, how do you feel? Cause baby when I sleep, I dream of you And when I'm awake, that's all I do Think about every detail you have Do you notice when I get mad, I clench my jaw? Do you notice when I get sad, I tend to fall? Look at my words I say to you Cause I notice when you get mad You close your eyes And I notice when you are sad you let out sighs I need to know are those sighs ever over me? Do you know how in love with you I am Do you see how in love with you I am? Every thing that you do, it makes my heart stop Oh, it stops And baby when you sleep, do you dream of me? Christian abridge"
"What would you do? Wife has dd Thank you for your reply. I think your correct the best thing to do is not give an answer. Yet. She has a family with resources that are supposed to step in. I haven’t gone to see her in two days/ our anniversary is Sunday. 16 years. Again today on the phone she said happy anniversary to my #3 husband. I know who 1 of the two other is but not both. I asked and she said she pleads the fifth. Inside, I was thinking is this funny to you. How much antipsychotic does it take. Anyways thanks again"
Are co incidences a part of delusional disorder? I suspect my boyfriend has delusional disorder. The doctors havent confirmed it yet because he doesnt agree to go for treatment. But they are going in the direction of paranoid psychosis . Which is just another name for DD as far as i know . There are a lot of co incidences happening that are confirming his delusions . His delusion is that I along with his friends are family are talking behind his back and giving him hints about it to mess with his head . None of us talk to each other. The co incidences usually go like this . We have a conversation and a few days later or sometimes later whenever he talks to his friends they say a word or something similar to what we have spoken about. Sometimes he knows that he could be just over thinking but still doesnt fail to accuse me of lying to him. He also thinks God is talking to him and going out of his way to be a part for my boyfriends life . He also thinks that when he is high with consumption of weed he becomes more spiritually receptive . He asks god a question and the next word he sees or picture he looks at or something he hears is the answer . Talking about the co incidences with friends. An example of it when he told about his chat with God . He gave me a reference of his friend Gordon because it sounds like God . Later when he met his friend and spoke to him about God and his chat that friend took Gordons name. Gordon is a mutual friend of both my bf and his friend. They talk about him quite frequently . Now he thinks i told his friend all about what i spoke to my bf and he took gordons name to mess with his head . And many such incidences. I did not talk to any of his friends . Im not friends with any of them . He keeps accusing me of talking to them . He also accused me of having an affair with them . I cant take all this anymore. These coincidences or his over consciousness because of his disorder are giving his thoughts more and more validity . How do i prove my innocence like this . I'm not even sure if what he says they said is actually what they said. What do I do ? They are making my life hell . Did any of you face something like this ? Or know some way you'll can help me ? How to convince him ? I'm trying to arrange a polygraph test but its very difficult to find one where i live . And I'm just 19 so i cant travel far away for it neither do i have the required amount. And i dont want to involve my parents . I need help to deal with this .
"Are co incidences a part of delusional disorder? The short answer for me is yes. My wife also has a major problem with coincidences, but they don't result in her blaming me for something. It results in her thinking she has ""proof"" that the other people in this town and at her work are plotting against her. Her delusion is that she thinks that these people wanted her to leave me for other single men that they know. And when she didn't leave me, they decided that to make their ""man friends"" feel better about themselves, they had to make her look really bad and break her down. So every coincidence that happens is proof to her that they are doing this to her. The problem for me is that they thought to fix her up with their friends because they found out that I was such an awful husband, and if I hadn't been so bad, they never would have thought to fix her up with their friends. So in the end, it's all my fault, but I'm not blamed directly for each of these coincidences. I was not a bad husband, not that I was perfect. So I end up apologizing for things from the past that I did not do. That seems to diffuse the situation, and prevent a nasty argument. I'm not sure what to tell you about your situation. He's specifically blaming you directly for these coincidences. I will tell you that simply saying ""I didn't do it"" probably will never work. I'm really grasping at straws for a suggestion, but how about this...... With this friend Gordon, there are sort of 2 parts to it. 1-that his friend new about his chat with God and 2-that you were the one to tell him. Is it possible to deflect this, sort of, and just say something like - ""I have no idea how your friend found out. I didn't tell him, but somebody must have. Are you sure you didn't talk about this with anybody else? Or did someone over hear something?"" You may have to defend yourself and prove that you couldn't have said anything. Like maybe you've been so busy that you haven't even had time to call your mother etc. I guess what I'm getting at is I think you might have more luck arguing how the coincidence happened as opposed to trying to convince him that nothing really happened. I have had absolutely no success trying to convince my wife that these coincidences are nothing. Absolutely no luck at all. So here's a recent example. She went for a 30 minute jog yesterday. While out jogging one of ""them"" passed by on a motorcycle. She was convinced that this was intentional and they knew she was going out for a jog and they are checking on her and plotting the next thing they're going to do to her. What I can't say is ""gosh I'm sure it's just a coinicidence. Why would they be out checking on you?"". Instead what I said was ""that's awful. Don't they have better things to do with their time. What is their problem? What kind of nut-case does something like that?"" I'm not sure if that's helpful or not. I wish I had better advice to give."
Are co incidences a part of delusional disorder? Thank you so much for giving me assurance its not only happening to us . I know its very sad of me to say this . But your'e in a better position than me I guess . You can stay next to the person you love and give her assurance that its going to be fine. I am the root cause of all his problems . I want to help him so bad . But I can't because I am the ultimate villan. I wish it was something else. I wish it didnt play with the trust between us. I'd do anything to make him feel better if it was us against the world . But now its him vs me. And that really sucks. I hate it. I hate God for doing this to us. I just got an internship somewhere. Now he thinks thats going to be my new place to talk to people. I dont know how Im going to manage these two months with this internship. I see a million problems coming my way in the next two months . I hope i survive through it.
"Are co incidences a part of delusional disorder? It's not necessarily bad of you to say. Maybe my position is a little better. Who knows. At least my wife is not accusing me for coincidences happening today. She blames others for these coincidences, but tells me their actions are my fault Anyway. I'm not really sure I would know what to do if she was accusing me of these things. Truthfully, because of how quick she is to blame others for coincidences, I worry that it's only a matter of time before she starts blaming me. She's losing friends and eventually there will be nobody to blame but me. If I think of anything I'll let you know. I may have to ask my counselor about this kind of situation just to try to get prepared in case I am in that position. So far my wife does not think she needs any help and unless she does, she'll probably get worse."
"Are co incidences a part of delusional disorder? Well, I talked to my counselor. I mentioned that a lot of people who post here who have loved ones with a delusional disorder talk about how their loved ones direct all their blame and anger towards them. So I asked if this was something that one day my wife might start doing to me - even though she's not doing it yet. And how would I handle something like that as I don't know if I could. She said the reality is that people with delusional disorders don't typically get better on their own. They need therapy and maybe medication. What's more, without help, they typically get worse, so yes it's possible that one day she may start doing that to me. She didn't have any magic answers for how to handle it. She basically said that if it happens, I'll have to figure out how much I can handle and when it gets to be too much I'll have to look out for my own health and well being. If that means leaving or divorce then that may be what I have to do. I wish had better news to give. It's not exactly a very pleasant thing to think about. For now I'll be doing a lot of praying......."
"Are co incidences a part of delusional disorder? Hello sir , I Know its been quite a few months now. We were broken up for a few and have been back since a month or so. These co incidences were a little less but now something similar happened again. I have zero contact with any of the people who tell him the things that we spoke about which is only and only between us . Its not his fault either. Since he only speaks about these things to me and someone else brought up something from that conversation anyone in his place would think the same if they were in his place. But I don't talk to anyone about those thing absolutely no one."
"media trigger? Sometimes I’ll say something and later be met with the exact same bizzare statement on television or satellite radio or whatever. I’ll look up production dates to see who predated under the suspicion that maybe I’d been ripped off or something. It’s odd and I’m trying, really trying to understand this sort of thinking or intentions if true. They say with delusions the delusional can’t be swayed but I’m on the fence due to the grandiose nature of something like this. I tell myself this doesn’t happen to people but I was legitimately triggered earlier over a commercial. Not any real emotion but it’s stuck in my mind it’s grandoise which doesn’t seem like a good way to think when you’re possibly delusional and already live with mental illness. So I said that’s crazy that’s not how the world works then I ask myself, what if it is? There’s powers above powers that could make that all work. But what if it is? Well then I guess it is. It doesn’t really feel like anything. It could all be true, I wouldn’t feel any different about myself. I would probably feel the need to use the influence for good since I appear to be stuck with it. Or do good and it end up being false. Idk, do good."
"media trigger? I went through that. Still happens... I've accepted it and when I did, a lot of things seemed different. I didnt dislike it, I got curious and embraced it. Now theres no way anyone could EVER convince me that things are ""off"" and most people just dont see it or choose to ignore subconsciously. What can I say? I enjoy now that I've embraced it. I'm just lonely and wish I didnt have to be here alone. Like we all can at some level know everything, we mess up and know that hes gonna say those things, you had the ideas in the past and at the same time was able to turn that TV on and see them come out if someone else's mouth. Consider knowing uou were gonna watch that, then knowing the things said, so it's like you got a taste of it in the past and carried those ideas to that exact moment the reporter on TV said what he said. As if you had already seen it, knowing you were going to live in that moment. Saw your own future? Something like that. But more like theres a point where we exist in every piece of time and we subconsciously choose to NOT reach into that part of us because it makes life hard tmto enjoy as of rigjt now because it's out of sync with the rest of the world which would make you an outcast who cant function. Dont ask ""why"" unless you want your whole perception of life, the world, people, existence etc completely flipped upsidedown. You just peeked into the rabbit hole, choose to explore it and things will get weird. Brush it off snd try to function if that's what youd rather do?"
"media trigger? I believe the world DOES work differently. Hell, I know it for a fact. Promise you your messages are heard it you write them out on the internet in any way. It's not something people should want and its something held back until were ready. But if you're curious. Talk like you're asking something that exists in a way that we subconsciously choose to not be aware as it would take away the things we find pleasure in. Dowsnt have to be religious. Pretend the heaven Angel's snd God exist in isnt made for us (using religion as as an easy exampls( and we choose to not see it because to us until we grow up a little, it would be hellish. I could tell you things and have you look st thinga that would ruin your world. Dont explore it. No one is ready for it."
"media trigger? I’m confused your first statement you mentioned exploring as an option and then strongly advised against doing so in your 2nd. I liked your first statement to a degree. I find it funny we both have the same coping method of brushing it off I laugh sometimes and Flip a bird at the tv but I could have this all wrong. I feel like I want to make my mark on the world and the only thing that can validate doing so I need to know what I’m dealing with. If you could tell me things that would ruin my world then why didn’t it ruin your life upon your discovery? I don’t want to go into the rabbit hole, more like throw some dynamite down there and see what happens. Idk man I’m too perplexed by it but I’m going to hang it up for a while. Weird we lean towards believing these things more from the same objective viewpoint of being true."
"I feel like I've seen too much to accept I'm delusional? Does anyone feel like there is other layers or something sort of ""behind"" what we know and accept as reality? Things that interact with us but on a level were not aware of? I've been slightly paranoid my whole life. Had ideas but never really embraced it? Didnt know if it was abnormal but just ignored it and tried to function. Right now. Big breakup, traumatizing situation might have made it worse.. bur I've seen things and thought things that I can NEVER accept as delusional. It would take me forever to explain all of it. You see answers in music and music videos, small hints and tips. I feel like certain people can almost touch this seperate part but no one has full understanding. Like they just *know* and are a little curious but dont dig too deep. I dug... deep.. and I'm really lonely, in wish I could discuss this stuff with someone. I basically moved out and decided I would explore these thoughts in a safe place by myself to see where they go. And I definitely went too far, though I could NEVER go back and I dont regret it. I sometimes feel like I have a sixth sense. I sometimes know things i shouldn't, theres a part of me.. not voices but thoughts? Almost machine like? And insert of turn them into words. So i have a voice or two inside of me but the identity doesnt come at me as ""voices"" unless I make it that way. Hard to explain, but it's there 24/7 and constant at the same rate like someone firing a machine gun into my mind. I dont hate it. I've seen a LOT that I cant explain and csnt accept as not real. I want to be able to discuss these things with someone, were suppose to forget if we see anything and I cant and wont and dont want to. Has anyone else get a little too high (not drugs, mental state) and not able to come down or forget and now sees the world in a whole different light? Even outright seeing parts of things in behavior of people or even slight ""hallucinations"" but ones cant accept as not real? I use to have images and videos but realized sharing them would just mess up someone else's life as were not capable of truly functioning being aware of the different mental levels. See, I could go on for ever. I love it, but it I'm lonely in thatsense. I have to keep it to myself, cant discuss, cant share it. I dont want to do this alone. Is anyone out there that is in my position? Decided to, lol, ""stare into the abyss"" giving no shits about what happens next? It's like my mind has gone too far and cant accept anything in this entire world as everyone else does. Feeling more like children at school.. or animals in a zoo not realizing they're in one? This world, the way it works in ny mind is something I'll never doubt again...it's good."
"I'm a DDJ Man, I'll talk with anyone who wants more insight Okay, I'll bite. Just surfed into this section and know nothing about DDJ (had to google what that means and saw the J was for jealous). Are DD people also jealous or some just delusional and not jealous?"
"I'm a DDJ Man, I'll talk with anyone who wants more insight Please help. I believe that my husband has delusional jealousy. It has not been diagnosed because he has not discussed this with a dr. We are going tomorrow for me to take a polygraph examination. My hopes were that this might prove my innocence. He has been accusing me of sleeping with our best friends - first it was both of them (male/female couple) and now he thinks I've been having an affair with just the male. He has been placing audio recorders in our bedroom, in my car and then he listens to these recordings and says its proof that I am having sex when in fact I am not. I don't hear hardly any of the things that he hears and the parts that I do hear are nothing but normal noises - but he turns them into something sexual. He also has a very strong jeoulousy fetish and has even asked me to be sexual with this same couple. I have always refused as I want nothing to do with that and I'm certain that they would not either. Several months ago it did come to a blow up where this couple was informed of what he thought was going on. Of course they denied it because it has never happened and we all chalked it up to him having side effects from taking Adderall. He apologized to them and said he was just going crazy but then it has continued with me. He constantly still accuses me of sex with this male friend. HE is certain that the recording that he has from last Saturday proves that this man was at our house and that we had sex. That Saturday I was home alone, no ne ever came here but in his mind there is absolutely no disputing it. He keeps telling me that it is OK if I have sex with him that he just wants me to tell him detailed stories about it because it turns him on. Again I want nothing to do with that. I feel that his DDJ is somehow tied into his overpowering sexual fantasies. I'm all alone. I have been keeping this to myself because our friends think this was just a bizaare mental breakdown due to his Adderall and that everything has been fine since; but this has been going on for almost 8 months. I love my husband and I want our relationship to get back to normal. The only way that can happen is if he realizes that he has a problem and gets help with it. My questions for you are - How can I get him to realize that these thoughts he has are not real and what kind of help do we seek? Thank you"
"I'm a DDJ Man, I'll talk with anyone who wants more insight Hi gatorgirl1002 I have not checked the forum for a little while. It sounds like he is projecting his fantasies on you in a very strong way. DDJ people have very strong feelings that cheating is going on no matter what the evidence is or what the spouse says/does. Has he turned normal everyday things into “evidence” and refuses to believe anything otherwise? What about your male friends (if you have them), is he very jealous and suspicions of them? My advice is that if you plan to stay with him then do not give him any reason to doubt you on even the simplest things, be very open and transparent. Any hint that you are not being truthful or honest could be blown way out of proportion against you and he’ll think you’re lying to him about everything. A good relationship counselor should be able to help. His sexual desires make this a little more complicated at least from my point of view because they sound very strong. Keep in touch and good luck."
"I'm a DDJ Man, I'll talk with anyone who wants more insight Thanks for your response. I am an open book. I let him track my every move with find my i-phone, he reads all my texts, checks my phone continuously for incoming/outgoing calls and texts, has all my passwords for any social media... I tell him every where that I go. This week I had to go to a meeting at another work building just 5 minutes from where I work. I made sure to tell him that I was going and I called him when I was done. Yet in that 5 minute drive between buildings he thinks that I texted my best friends husband and said ""come n get it"" this is because he had another recorder in my car and thinks that is what he heard. Of course he can't see that text because it does not exist but he now thinks i have some other way of texting that does not show up on my phone. I left the meeting at 4:00 and was on the phone talking to him at 4:05 based on phone records. I recall being on the phone with him when I returned to my work after the meeting. These accusations never even make any rational sense. How could I possibly have some type of affair in that 5 minutes. This is the same with all of his accusations. Nothing is ever rational. On 4/2/18 I took a polygraph test. He had promised me that if I took the test and passed that he would get counseling. Well I passed and it did no good. All it did was waste a bunch of money because he does not believe the polygraph now. He had an appointment with a counselor and he cancelled it. He previously paid a company to evaluate part of a recording and they came back saying there was absolutely no sexual activity heard on the recording - he did not believe them either. When things are good I am so happy. He truly is the love of my life and I want to spend the rest of my life with him but when he is like this which is now about 70% of the time - my life is miserable. I feel so weak for staying and putting up with all of this #######4 but at the same time I don't want to end this marriage - I just need him to realize that all of these thoughts are ridiculous and untrue and to go back to the way he used to be. He is Jeckyl and Hyde. Last night we went out , we had a great time. This morning I wake up to him telling me he knows I did something and that he WILL catch me. You asked about guy friends - well that is who he believes I am having this dillusional affair with, a mutual guy friend. When he is with this friend he acts like everything is fine and doesn't ever say anything to him about it. He has questioned me about other men in the past but for this past year he is fixated on this one person. How did you come to realize that you had DDJ? I've brought this up to him but he refuses to consider it and just tells me to stop trying to diagnose him. Thanks! I hope to hear from you soon."
"I'm a DDJ Man, I'll talk with anyone who wants more insight Do you ever feel remorse for the things you did while in an episode? Have you ever ruined a relationship because of your dd? Also, Gator girl, your story is as heartbreaking as mine! I'm so sorry."
"I'm a DDJ Man, I'll talk with anyone who wants more insight Gator girl. I am going through the same thing. My ex-boyfriend accuses me in sleeping with his 60 year old friend and he listens to audio recording constantly and hears staff that’s not true and n vet happened."
"I'm a DDJ Man, I'll talk with anyone who wants more insight I realized I was delusional but I’m not out of the woods 100% (I’ll explain below). I’ve always struggled with a girlfriend’s past, whether it was an innocent one or a more sexually active one. I would analyze over and over and over making them out to be “bad” no matter the past. I would ask questions about their past and then not believe what they told me and then obsess about it. After doing that for too many relationships I realized it must be me, there was no way all these women were that “bad”. Up to this point cheating was not really a worry for me (a little but not too much). I definitely had a trust issue though. I then dated two consecutive woman (not at the same time, lol) who both cheated on me and I stayed with each of them too long after finding out they cheated which only added to my analyzing and anxiety if they were cheating or not (I should have left them immediately but I stayed). This added to my struggle with trust. I finally left and I then met my future wife and I went through the same struggles about analyzing here past. Her past was conservative but I still analyzed it and made it “bad” in my head. This slowly lead me to think she cheating on me, it didn’t help that she lived an hour away when we were dating. She is not a big phone person so I would get very uncomfortable when she did not answer. My thinking went on and one but I hid it well and always seem happy on the surface. Eventually it would surface and I would ask if she was cheating. I’d analyze her answers, body language, etc. She had a coworker that turned into what she called a “good friend”. She hid their friendship from me, I eventually found out and confronted her, she knew him for two years, they texted/talked 4 times/week at least. I fell into another dark place convinced she cheated. She says I’m over analyzing and that she hid it because she was afraid I’d over react. That was six months ago and I still struggle daily. The DDJ mind is loves to analyze to the point that it seems like paranoia. Has he been deeply hurt in the past? If you plan to be with him, 100% openness is ideal and it sounds like you have been. The DDJ mind will find a reason to no believe almost anything, just like the lie detector test you took (I’m not surprised he doesn’t believe the results). My wife agreed to take one but I know it will only help me for a short amount of time. It’s like the DDJ mind likes to focus on the slightest chance of something bad happening (i.e. cheating) instead of facts or evidence to the contrary. Please don’t feel weak, you are very strong for dealing with this. One thing to consider is your own mental health. I’m sure you don’t want to look back and regret staying. He does need serious help/or medication. If you plan to stay know it will be a roller-coaster ride (as you already know). How does he react to misunderstandings? Does he turn them into “you cheated”? I wish this sight was more active. Google Othello Syndrome. There is a FB group for it. I hope this helps and that you’re doing better. I’ll check back soon."
"I'm a DDJ Man, I'll talk with anyone who wants more insight New here. Here's an insight I'm curious about. In your delusional state, how would you respond to other peoples' delusions? My friend developed a belief about nine months ago that a mysterious international crime syndicate has targeted her. She insists that certain of her friends and relatives could obtain help for her from law enforcement agencies or other means but we simply refuse to because either we've been brainwashed by the syndicate or we're just being stubborn and stupid. I'm being VERY brief here -- her foaming-at-the-mouth episodes, emails, police reports, etc are a thing to behold. So are her mad rants at everyone who refuses to get her into Federal Witness Protection or summon the National Security Advisor himself to take her case. She thinks because of our flimsy connections to a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knew a guy that we could make the US government beat a path to her door if we'd just pick up the phone. In your delusions, what would you have thought if my friend went at you with hers? Would you think she was crazy? How would you react if you read some of the stories on this forum? Thanks for any insight you can provide."
"what will happen to the sufferer long time suffering DDJ Hi, I am new one and please forgive my English, I am Chinese. I live with my husband of 12 years with DDJ, I believed my husband started his delusion only 1 years ago. And he is ready to file a divorce, I will accept that. We have a lovely 9-year-old son I read the posts in this forum, and I have the same experience like other victims. I think I still love my husband and I do care about him, although he is not that man I married with anymore. I real wonder what will happen to the sufferer long time suffering DDJ without treatment. Start the hallucination? Get other subtype delusional disorder? Can they have a live like normal? Yes, I am caring my husband’s future, I don’t want him fall in the darkness."
"what will happen to the sufferer long time suffering DDJ Hello there. My mother has suffered from delusional disorder for about 20 years now, starting around age 45. The delusions have grown over time. It started as somatic type (resembling hypochondria). Then, after ten years, she revealed that she also believes my father (her husband) was trying to poison/harm/kill her (persecutory DD). It's pretty much torn apart the family. She's kicked my dad out of the family home. He's stuck in limbo with a temporary housing arrangement for a few years now. In spite of his wondering, I don't think he'll ever be able to go back. My mother would be in constant fear, and my dad would have to live with constant accusations. They're both better off apart. Note: she did have some improvement with medication (Abilify), about ten years ago, but she stopped taking it after a couple of months. She won't even consider taking medication now. There are some periods, when if she's distracted from her delusions, she can seem normal and happy. But when I'm with her, I have to stay on my toes the entire time, constantly steering the conversation over to neutral topics like politics and weather."
"Concerned she's delusional Example: Had trouble starting my car before going shopping. She had told me to call if it wouldn't start after shopping and she would come get me. She needed to be at work and I was to babysit. It wouldn't start, but couldn't see the point in calling her, that wouldn't fix my car. Called the tire store, had them come give me a jump start, went to the tire store and paid for that service, then ran home to pick up the kid so I could go back and get a new battery put in. Tire store said they would credit me for paying for the jump start when I bought the new battery. Done. Later, when she gets home, we had a conversation about it: Me: Thought of calling you when my car wouldn't start, but that didn't make any sense, because you wouldn't be able to fix my car, so I called the tire store and had them come give me a jump. They wanted me to go pay for it right away so I had to do that before coming to pick up little one. That's why I couldn't turn the car off. I had to go right back and get a new battery, and they gave me credit for what I had already paid. Her: They gave you credit for the tow truck? Me: What tow truck? Her: The one that towed you back. Me: I didn't get towed, they gave me a jump start. Her: Oh, and now you have to go back and get a battery? Me: No, I already got a battery after I picked up little one. Her: So now you have to install it? Me: No, they installed it there. Her: And they're going to pay you back? Me: They already gave me credit when I paid for the battery. Her: But are they going to pay you back for the battery? Me: Who? Her: The insurance company from the accident. Me: That was 2 months ago and the lady just backed into my driver's side door. It had nothing to do with a cell going out in the battery. Her: Oh, I thought it did. They should pay you back. I'm at a loss for words. Is she delusional (not being sarcastic). I'm really concerned about her thought process. This is only one example of many, many. Is there anything I can do or suggest??"
"Concerned she's delusional I don't know if this is delusional behavior. Maybe she was distracted the previous time(s) you talked about your car issues, and therefore she doesn't remember the details. Now, if next week, out of the blue, she asks you, ""why didn't you call me last week when the car didn't start?"" with follow-up questions for more details, then she could be trying to get you to recount the events to see if ""your story has changed"". If she determines that ""your story has changed"", maybe just because you've added new details or omitted details, and she suggests that the discrepancies in ""your story"" are proof that you're lying, then she might have DD."
"Concerned she's delusional Thank you for relieving my worries on that regard. This was all one conversation with her though. There were no previous times. It was literally a back and forth conversation with her looking me in the eyes. She is my granddaughter and we've had many problems like this since she was little. Like make your bed, I did, then why isn't it made, I don't know what happened to it but I made it so stop picking on me, etc. Now that she's an adult with the problem still there, I was looking to see if it was something that could be improved upon, but maybe I just need to accept that her way of thinking and seeing the world is just different from mine."
"Is my partner suffering with delusional jealousy? Dear All, I need help with my partner..... is he suffering with delusional jealousy? Here's my story!! Background--- Me and my partner have been together nearly 29 years. I was 14!! He was 15. We have two wonderful boys that are now young men. He didn't have the greatest childhood, he wasn't nurtured at all by his parents and his mum had 7 children by 4 different men. His mum cheated on his dad too. Over the years he has always had jealous tendencies, I have lots count of the amount of times he has accused me of liking different men, including friends and family. He cheated on me when we were about 17, it was a difficult time but we managed to move on. He got into taking amphetamine for a couples of years when we were in our 20s but he hasn't touched it for about 19 years. He has suffered with depression for many years and takes anti depressants, about 10 or so years ago he was told he had bipolar and has been medicated every since. About 2 years ago, I suffered a devastating blow when I found out he had cheated again on me and had a son with another women!! The boy had contacted my oldest son to tell him that his dad was his dad too. I was totally heartbroken by this but I decided that I wanted to stay with him. I loved him and believed that he was a different person when he was taking drugs. 7 weeks after finding that out, I then found out that he was messaging a women who he was working with. I couldn't believe that he was hurting me again. He said it was because he needed attention and she had shown him it as I didn't want nothing to do with him as I had been shattered. What a selfish bastard!! But again I decided to stay with him. I ended up on anti depressants myself and had to have professional counselling. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with but I am a survivor. I love this man to bits and never want to be without him, I don't know what it is as you wouldn't think I could love someone who has hurt me so bad. When he is my normal happy go lucky hubby, I couldn't ask to be treated better. He is good looking, sexy, funny, kind and much much more. Present-- The last 18 months or so have been an absolute nightmare. I feel I am constantly watched, questioned, under investigation and he thinks he knows how I think. I am now at the point where I am ready to walk away from him. I have to put up with the following : - Every time we go out, he accuses me at looking at men, he tells me I look at nice cars as there are men in them. - I wear my sunglasses in the car as he says he feels better as he can't see where I'm looking. - I look out of my passenger window so I don't get accused of looking at the drivers coming towards us. - He asked me why I don't use my sun visor, I told him I don't ever think of using it as I have my sunglasses on, he says it's because I want to be on show. - it is very hot at the moment so I have had my shoulders out, he says I am parading myself as I want attention. - he says that men smirk at him which he believes it's because I must of smiled at them. He thinks men do this to to say 'your woman has just looked at me' mugging him off. - I started a new job, he questioned me about the men that worked there? I took pictures of the four men that are there to ease his mind. - I had a training course, I ended up taking pictures of the people in the course. He didn't ask me to do so but I knew he would feel insecure. He even took the day off of work to take me and collect me. - if I don't call him within a certain time in my lunch break because i am busy and haven't started my lunch, I will be presented with messages asking me if I am ignoring him? - when he has jealous thoughts he is nasty with his words. - I text him when I am back in the village where I live everyday. - i get a lift down a big hill from a couple of different ladies at work. I have took pictures of them to show him they are women as he says I wouldn't tell him if I got a lift off of a man. I would never accept a lift from a man!! - he has accused me of pleasuring myself!! Which I have never done. - I had a fete at work, I work in a school. When I got home, I was telling him about it and then he went quiet. He said he had forgotten about the dads of the kids at school. He said I might fancy them. - I had to go to an appointment with a policeman, my son came with me as he couldn't make it. When I got home, he asked if the policeman was good looking? I said he was an average looking man, he said that because I fancied him. When the policeman visited our home, I went in the bedroom and let him deal with it, I just couldn't face another load of accusations. I'm sure there are more i could list but I think you got the general idea...... life for me is draining, I feel so exhausted and stressed living day in and out with this. I am genuine, loyal and committed to this man. I have never cheated on him ever!! I have treated him with respect all throughout our relationship. I just want a normal happy life with him and to make happy memories but for whatever reason he just won't let us be. I am not interested in looking, smiling or getting attention from any man, I just want him to believe in me and trust me, but he doesn't believe any of it. He says everyone likes to looked at as it makes you feel good. I can assure you I don't want any of it!! I have done lots of research on delusional jealousy and I really believe he suffers with it. It is so painful to be viewed as a person I am not!! I'm just me!! Don't want much out of life other than a happy home. It also hurts to see him when he is behaving like this as I know I am not doing anything wrong and he really doesn't need to be suffering. I have tried to help him but currently I feel like I have lost him. I feel empty and numb and at breaking point. I love him to pieces but I can no longer live with this constant strain. I deserve so much more. I keep telling him I am his wife and should be treated like it but instead, I am treated like a suspect and his enemy. I would be grateful for any replies to help me decide what to do. I want a life with him but not this life. Thank you for reading my story...."
Is my partner suffering with delusional jealousy? I am going though a similar situation. It’s really unbelievable. It’s hard to get them help because they think it’s you. I have two young daughters and have been through hell. I don’t want to leave her. I love her. I just wanted to say you are not alone.
Brother Diagnosed with Delusional & Paranoid Disorder Started about a year ago my brother (17 years of age) was showing signs and saying things that wasnt making sense. Recently about 2 months we brought him to hospital and was diagnosed with Delusional & Paranoid disorder. He is in a state that in any cost he must not take medication. We are currently giving him Risperidone/Risperdal oral 3mg in secret by putting in his juice or water. I believe this medication is working well for him the delusional thoughts are less than before.. Is this the right medication for him? How long should he continue to give him that? Will it be better if we increase the dose? Any help would be appreciated
"Brother Diagnosed with Delusional & Paranoid Disorder My feeling is that any medication given without patient consent or doctor approval is dangerous and wrong, even if you believe that he is improving. What treatment or therapy is he undergoing otherwise? I would continue with that route. Where are you getting this Risperdal from? Has he been considered for inpatient treatment? We do NOT delete posts Read the forum rules before posting here. If you are having any doubts about what you are posting, if you are thinking in the back of your mind, ""I am going to want to delete this, or these details, later"", remove those details, or step back and don't post until you are sure."

The risperdal was prescribed by his Psyciatrist. He stays home all day and sometimes go for a walk to the park. He does not go to school or work. I stay also home to look after him He refuse to go see any doctor or getting therapy as he says ""im fine i dont need anything""."
Brother Diagnosed with Delusional & Paranoid Disorder Look I'm not a doctor but I have bipolar one. I've had it for 20 years plus. I am extremely delusional and psychotic a lot. For me I have to permanently be on a antipsychotic. Seroquel should mellow him out. Mood stabilizers don't do $#%^ for me. You should really see a doctor. But for my delusions antipsychotics work. Delusions are part of psychosis. Risperdal is okay. But in my experience Seroquel has been the best for me. When I'm delusional I don't seek help either. The reason it is called being delusional is he believes in his mind everything is real. That's why when you're delusional nobody seaks out treatment. they think they're fine. they believe everything they're saying or thinking. Once he stabilizes he will realize how he was delusional trust me. Happens to me all the time. Give it a little bit of time and when he comes to he will realize how messed up his thinking really was. Being that you guys caught it young at his age he might fully recover with medication. And never have another episode. I knew a guy like this. It happened one time. Never happened to him again. But I have bipolar so it never goes away.

Delusions are part of psychosis. Risperdal is okay. But in my experience Seroquel has been the best for me. When I'm delusional I don't seek help either.

Brother Diagnosed with Delusional & Paranoid Disorder The psychiatrist prescribed today Rivotril 0.5mg for 5 days to take with Risperidone and and stop Risperidone. He will do a injection Invega Sustena once a month he is currently calm he does a few activity sometimes Is this a good idea to stop Risperidone and start new medication? I was thinking to taper Risperidone off him slowly and see if he can go on life without medication
Brother Diagnosed with Delusional & Paranoid Disorder I have dd and I was on Risperdal and it did help. I now take Loxapine and Klonopin and I am delusion free. Therapy helps a lot too because he needs to talk about what is going on in his head. If he finds out you are spiking him he may become mistrustful of you be careful. He needs to come to the realization that there is a problem and that is not easy for people with this disorder. Keep him on whatever is working but try and get him into therapy too! Good luck
Brother Diagnosed with Delusional & Paranoid Disorder These past weeks i have noticed his right leg shaking nonstop and hand fingers moving. I took him to see another psychiatrist and he said to stop Risperidone and start Olanzapine. What is the best way to do this switch? His currently taking 2mg risperidone oral and they prescribed him 10mg zyprexa tablet to start
"Spouse Newly Diagnosed. Sad and Confused...Help Hi, thank you all for sharing your journey's! My husband was recently diagnosed with paranoid delusional disorder Persecutory type. This has rocked our entire world. We have had so many ups and downs due to his illness. I didn't know that many of the issues we faced in the past were due to his illness. There was a time where he ""knew I was cheating on him"" by the way I scrolled on my phone. Has shown up to work functions unannounced. Made a huge scenes about me going out with friends so I stopped wanting to go etc. Now, we are dealing with police following him, phone tapped, house bugged, etc. This has been going on for about a year so he says. He told me about 6 months ago and he finally agreed to see a doctor and they prescribed 25mg of seroquel to start. I have a couple of questions if you all would be so kind to answer. 1. He keeps a lot of things from me, so I feel very unsure about what is really going on in his head. Is this normal? I think he thinks Im part of the ""network"", but he wont say. 2. Are people with DD dangerous? He hasn't been violent with me recently but we have had some very terrible arguments in the past that got physical. 3. Will he ever be free of the delusions? He believes them so strongly and I believe, from what family members say, he has been experiencing them for over 20 years. I don't feel like I can take this, but I want to try and be the wife Im supposed to be. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, LadyQ"
"Is this considered delusional? So to start I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, but I have a very intense fear of psychosis & schizophrenia. My father had major depressive disorder with psychotic features, but never schizophrenia or anything. With him things would get out of hand if his depression went unchecked. I don't really get much depression like my father did (just little minor episodes). But I do fear that I have delusional thoughts. To add to this its because of my past drug use (mainly pot, and psychedelics). I tend to get extremely deep thoughts. My thought process gets really deep. Like for some reason I have the feeling of the universe just making sense. I'm not saying I believe I ""understand"" how everything works, but I get the feeling that things just click in a very un-logical way. Like if us humans stopped thinking logically then we could begin to understand the point of life without the black and white filter of our own logic. Before I touched drugs I was very over analytical. I'm a computer software engineer so its in my personality to think things are either ones or zeros. But after I tripped for the first time I saw things were not so black and white. Things had color, and I felt kind of ""enlightened"" and felt there was something else to this life. This feeling of ""enlightened"" isn't always good either. I get really deep into thought and how the universe works that I feel it could be signs of delusions of grandeur which is a sign of psychosis. So I ask am I just a really deep thinker, or could this be signs of psychosis?"
"Is this considered delusional? Tanoujin wrote: Seems to be an enjoyable state of mind... I would not worry too much if it does not affect your everyday functioning. I see a possibility Zen practices could help you to get some feedback and confidence. Have you ever tried? I've tried various meditation practices, but I don't do it on a daily basis. I understand that most of this is just anxiety. I do feel like I'm the only person that has these thoughts. To be honest sometimes I'm jealous of other people because they don't get too caught up in thinking like I do. That is why I fear its something only in my head."
"My delusional disorder, cured rather instantly? I'm not sure if anyone can relate to this experience or help me understand what happened to me. It seems I suffered from some kind of delusional disorder for about a year from Feb 2007 to Feb 2008 before being cured by an anti-psychotic, Risperdal. Looking back now, I had no idea I was delusional (none of my family even suspected anything was wrong with me for an entire year) -- for many months I firmly believed that professors, co-workers, and friends were either secretly in love with me or were somehow plotting my demise. For a long time I had difficulty leaving the house because I thought that complete strangers were staring at me, trying to communicate with me through secret body language signals. I thought the footsteps of the people living above me were in fact coded messages directed at me, and I responded by knocking on the walls (in code) and hanging written responses outside my door that I believed they would understand. It became a full-blown psychosis by the time I got to the hospital -- I believed I had powers to move objects with my mind and that I could telepathically communicate with anyone in the world. The Risperdal almost immediately ended all these bizarre thoughts and sensations, and that was the end of that strange, year-long experience. Right now I'm on no medication. It's been like this since the end of Feb. I'm wondering if it's possible to have had DD for only a short period of time in your life? Like, I was completely normal before 2007, then came that tumultuous delusional year, and now it's back again to normal. I feel like this DD/psychosis bit me in the butt of nowhere -- I wasn't using drugs and I wasn't under any stress. I don't have schizophrenia and I don't believe I'm bipolar. Is this possible?"
"xiexieniii your situation sounds very similar to my wife's, at least so far. It hit her out of the blue for about 6 months, then went away for about 9 months, then came back again for 3 months and so far hasn't returned. While the second episode was shorter than the first it seemed to have stretches where the delusions were much more intense than the first time. Unfortunately I understand a common pattern is for people to have one or two early episodes before the DD comes back as a more or less full time thing. As you have discovered however medication can apparently help. I think it is great you have such insight into what you experienced, and I hope things continue to go well for you."
"xiexieniii, from what you wrote I made an educated guess that you are rather young, maybe in your twenties, right? Based on that and the content of your delusions (ideas of reference, thought insertion and other rather bizzare delusions towards the end) this doesn't sound like classic delusional disorder to me (this is not professional opinion, obviously). Note that that's not necessarily bad - from what I have seen/read, even people with schizophrenia which is responsive to medication and well controlled are often better off than those with supposedly milder diagnosis of delusional disorder who are left untreated. I found literature references to psychotic episodes that were ""one time only"" and even to spontaneous recovery so I guess there is still much we don't know about how psychosis actually gets triggered. Are you still seeing psychiatrist? IMO it would be good idea to have some continued contact with psychiatrist while you are off the medication so that any signs of reccurence can be caught early. Another thing you might want to investigate now when you feel well is whether your state has concept of psychiatric advance directive document - that could help ensure that you can get treatment if you get into another psychotic episode even if you lose insight. Best wishes to you and feel free to post here as often as you like.I am always happy to hear from someone who came out of the tunnel, so to speak..."
"Sunny, I'm glad to know I'm not the only one haunted by the memories of my delusions. Throughout the year I absolutely believed (at least) nine different people were in love with me or wanted to sleep with me, and I thought they were constantly conveying secret ""hints"" of their love -- by raising a coffee cup a certain way, by wearing a certain color shirt, or even by looking at me when passing by. What is devastating about this is that I actually started to develop feelings in return for some of these people. (It's a damn good thing I did not actually act upon my feelings, even though I was CERTAIN they wanted me and CERTAIN it was a match.) So when the Risperdal hit me, and when I realized that not a single one of them was actually communicating any secret messages of love to me, I was heartbroken! The sense of knowing what they were trying to do to me was so incredibly real... Now that I am sobered up, I hang out with some of these people (to this day they have no idea what I was interpreting from their benign actions) and sometimes, all I can wish is that the delusions had been real. It was a very foul trick my mind had played on me. I really thought they liked me back. I also had a delusion that a friend was trying to sexually harass me. Even though I'm ""sober"" now, and the action of him looking at his watch means absolutely nothing to me (when I was delusional it meant he wanted to kiss me), I can still recall the feeling of being uncomfortable quite clearly. For me, I don't think these delusions will ever return so I've actually stopped seeing my doctor altogether. If I do relapse in the future, that's fine by me -- at least then I might be able to get a solid diagnosis. But for now, it's just a mystery."
"peytonmanning18, Thank you, and I hope things go well for your wife as well. What kinds of delusions was she having, if I may ask? Did the doctors first diagnose her with schizophrenia? That's what they did with me in Feb of this year, but now it has become apparent that I am not schizophrenic as I am not on medication and have no symptoms at all."
"Tara, Thanks. I'm glad to have found a place where others can relate to what I experienced. I am 24 and the delusions began in the middle of my senior year in college. I was so out of touch with reality (I harassed some professors and claimed to other students that one was making sexual advances towards me) that I ended up dropping out, leaving my family, and flying around the country in a delusional haze. I still haven't managed to get myself back in school since this all started. It does seem there is so much about the nature of psychosis that we haven't figured out yet. I've found many cases and explanations for schizophrenia and ongoing psychosis without medications, but I'm still trying to find more people who share this ""one time only"" deal, non drug- or stress-induced."
"xiexieniii wrote: peytonmanning18, Thank you, and I hope things go well for your wife as well. What kinds of delusions was she having, if I may ask? Did the doctors first diagnose her with schizophrenia? That's what they did with me in Feb of this year, but now it has become apparent that I am not schizophrenic as I am not on medication and have no symptoms at all. My wife was having delusions that were mostly a combination of persecutory and grandiose. She was convinced there was a vast conspiracy (she called it The Intervention) that was monitoring us, and had been for years. On her good days she saw The Intervention as something that was trying to help us; all our friends and relatives (not to mention an army of total strangers) trying to help our marriage. We were going to get a new house from a reality TV show, I was going to be given a new car, they were going to send us and all our neighbors on a free cruise. On her bad days she saw The Intervention as a malignant, potentially dangerous attempt to invade and even control our lives, recording our every conversation and action and putting it all on the Internet for people to watch, for profit. She also had maybe a smattering of Jealous subtype (early on she accused me of having an affair) and even Somatic (she mentioned that she thought some kind of microchip had been implanted in her toe on which she had had surgery several months previously). Unfortunately we never got a diagnosis, when my wife was having symptoms she refused to see anyone, and she was never quite sick enough that I had to have her commited against her will. Now that she is (mostly) asymptomatic she still refuses to see anyone, on the grounds there is nothing wrong with her. She has started seeing a psychiatrist for ADHD, which she has just recently been able to accept that she probably has (I agree that she has it but I don't think the delusions had anything to do with the ADHD). She has convinced herself that I can't handle her ADHD and that is why I keep trying to convince her and other people (MDs and close family) that she was genuinely exhibiting psychotic symptoms. Unlike you my wife was in her mid-forties when this started, my understanding is this is quite a typical age for onset of DD, you seem to be younger than the average victim. Prior to this she had never had any mental problems, at least not anything a layperson would really pick up on."
"peytonmanning18, Good to know that your wife is no longer having delusions. The symptoms sound like schizophrenia, but schizophrenia usually manifests in the 20s and do not go away without daily medication. So the fact that her delusions seem to be gone without treatment is interesting. She no longer feels people are monitoring her -- but when she talks about the past, does she talk about it as if it actually happened? Or does she realize those were delusions? As long as she is seeing a psychiatrist for *something* it's a good idea, just in case the delusions come back. Good luck."
"my sister has severe bulimia, help Hi, Since the beggining of the Year (like, january 2018), but it may have started before, idk, My little sister of 17 yo, has Bulimia. She binges like 3 times a day, maybe more, and throw up an hour later. Then I can hear her washing her mouth in the bathroom, and taking anti-acid. (I saw some boxes of it in her room). And I'm just so worried for her health. SHe's so young, I fear that she'll die from a cancer or whatever. I know we have a very difficult life, and she had a lot of problems but she's brillant and I don't want her to die, or to lost her teeth. She does this every single days, and I fear the worst for her life. She is very thin, well my mom gives her dietary supplement that she takes. But even with this, even if she doesen't die from an heart attack she'll probably from a stomach cancer with all this acid... I know all the consequences bulimia can have on people, but I think that her illness is worst than bulimia. How can a human throw up everyday? I cry because I'm so worry for her, i don't want to loose my sister I tried to talk about it with her, but it's hard, she really doesn't want to admit it, and then she cries a lot. It's like, if I talk to her she wants to suicide because she feels bad about it, and if I don't, she'll also die from her illness. Our mom knows about it, but since she also suffered from ED in her youth, she thinks it's ""normal""......... I can't sleep, I'm so affraid, please do you guys have advices? (sorry for my bad english It's not my language ....) Please, help us, I don't want to lose my sister, I have lost so many people in my life, It's so hard to see this....I feel so bad about it....."
"help for a friend so, for a while now, a very closed friend whom i've know for 10 years has been experiencing what i believe to be psychotic episodes. she is female, early to mid twenties. for a fairly long time she had reported believing people plot against her, but now she's has a very complex explanation of motives and honestly bizarre events surrounding one specific person she has a working relationship with. her speech has been confused and hard to comprehend, she's been wearing strange clothes and not taking enough care of how she looks - i'm talking about basic human care, not anything stereotypic of women. she has admitted to two friends she's afraid of being called schizophrenic and sent to a mental hospital, which is why she doesn't communicate a lot about all that's been going on. her family is not supportive and they have more than once invalidated her requests to see a doctor or a therapist (she is still dependant upon her parents). of course i'm not giving her a diagnosis myself, but i believe she has DD and think it's really important that she goes to a psychiatrist who can properly evaluate it and give her medication. she doesn't recognize her experiences as delusions (me and other friends have talked about it and it's clear that she really has nothing real to support her beliefs). what could be made to help her find medical care and how could it be made? i really AM afraid her family might put her in a bad mental hospital and leave her there forever... you see me trying to climb on this pole, but i'm just hiding the pain that's deep in my soul."
help for a friend She'll have to be hospitalized involuntarily if you cannot get her to go. No they won't leave her in there forever . She'll probably only be in tlhere 3 or 4 days until she's stabilized and then let out. This ain't the 70s . This is the best thing for her. I have a schizophrenic friend and uncle. If that's what she has she could potentially hurt you or others. They are very unpredictable. If you can get her to go to a clinic on her own they'll give her medication that day and you can help her get stable at home . If you have to take the medication with her so she feels comfortable do it. It won't do anything to normal people . You're going to have to make her feel comfortable . It's not a big deal. Nobody really understands this stuff so it's difficult for people to comprehend. Schizophrenia very possible. Bipolar disorder very possible. Delusional disorder possible. She needs a antipsychotic . Something like Seroquel . Or Risperdal . It works for all three of the conditions she could have . Or she could just be taking drugs and in psychosis. I had a buddy like this and it was schizophrenia. After he was treated never came back.. I have bipolar disorder so I have a lot of these symptoms. What ended up happening to him was he resisted arrest and ended up in jail and then the mental ward. He was dressing weird. From what I know about schizophrenia. I also have a uncle that has it. The disorganized speech is a dead giveaway. I'm not an expert but his speech was extremely disorganized before he was hospitalized. Believe schizophrenia shows up around that age. My buddy was 25. A my uncle was 23 when he got it.
"Bipolar and struggling with psychosis? I only recently admitted to having bipolar, I've been diagnosed for 4 years now. Whenever I'm manic, I get extremely paranoid and I get convinced that my boyfriend, who has always been there for me and never hurt me, is doing something awful. Sometimes I even get scared that when I'm talking to him, it's not really him, it's a replacement. It feels so real in the moment so I lash out at him and tell him to just leave me, to stop lying to me, etc. I'll say ###$ you and that he's horrible for doing this to me. After the mania stops, I feel so guilty. It makes me feel like an awful person, I start questioning if I'm abusive. I'm so sick of going through this over and over, it's so exhausting, it makes me feel like I'm crazy because I accuse everyone of things that seem so real in the moment and then later, I come to my senses and feel like a huge jerk. I don't want to hurt the one person who is really there for me. professional dx: dissociative identity disorder, PTSD, aspergers self dx: ASPD !! damian types in red !!"
Bipolar and struggling with psychosis? Take a mood stabilizer and a antipsychotic. . Paranoia should stop. I get delusional and psychotic on medication all the time. Explain to him that you are bipolar and he will accept it or should. My family friends and loved ones all except my condition. Sometimes we say and do $#%^ we don't mean. It's no big deal. I used to feel guilty all the time because of all the destruction I caused. As I've gotten older though you have to accept it. Seroquel works pretty good with me. Levels me out.
"Successful resolution of psychotic symptoms after my wife quit drinking, which was a mild alcohol use disorder, she started experiencing a number of paranoid delusions, including a pedophile ring closing in on our kids, the community hacking her account to paint her as a racist and run her out of town, and me taking our kids and flying away. there were no hallucinations or bizarre delusions, just believing a bunch of things that there was no factual basis of. Initially the doctor put her on lithium, which did no good. Further discussions with the therapist resulted in treating her illness as primarily anxiety-driven with obsessive traits. I had no idea that delusions could be anxiety driven, but they can be. They switched her to a low dose of olanzapine and Prozac. She's 45 and perimenopausal, so she needed also a supplement of progesterone. She also takes Xanax as needed during the day, which is usually a couple of times. I don't think we're done fine-tuning the medication, but it is made an unbelievable difference in our lives. She has also done an amazing job with her therapy and dealing with Her childhood emotional issues that have been unresolved for so long. She still has work to do on that, but is making great progress. I just wanted to pass along this success story in hopes that it might help someone else."
"Successful resolution of psychotic symptoms This sounds promising. I was just diagnosed with delusional disorder. Was put on sodium valproate for bipolar because I had mania once and an acute psychotic episode that required hospitalization. So yeah now I'm on Latuda and feel good so far. I hope that my paranoid delusions dissipate completely. I'm not sure if my diagnosis would be changed at a later point to schizoaffective or just bipolar. But I think finding the right medication can be very helpful. I was on some bad ones like invega and abilify. But anyhow, thanks for sharing your story.."
"Advice needed on delusional husband I just recently figured out that delusional disorder has been the cause of our suffering the last 6 years and is currently devastating this family. Reading the descriptions it is SHOCKING how it was like reading a detailed description exactly of my life the last 6 years. I never realized it was a mental illness until October when he had a breakdown. I thought “he’s paranoid” “why would you think that???” Trying to reason with him or help him understand the truth about whatever circumstance but it never works. Anyway so now on to describing the current situation and asking for advice. My husband has been convinced I cheated on him for years, he had specific people he thinks I cheated with, he thinks none of our children are his, he has particular people he thinks each kid belongs to, he’s had multiple paternity tests done and when they came back showing the kids are his he was convinced someone hacked the system and results. So we’ve lived like this for 6 years and it’s gotten very ugly. This past fall he got a gun out he was threatening to kill himself if I didn’t confess to cheating on him (I never did obviously or it wouldnt be a delusion). I’ve never been so scared. It’s not only that, he doesn’t trust anyone. He in the end cut himself off from every community or church group we’ve ever been in because he becomes convinced they don’t like him, he’s not welcome; he comes up with ideas about people like everyone is cheating on their spouses and everyone is horrible and doesn’t want to associate with all these horrible, immoral people who hate him and are out to get him. It’s like the whole world is a constant threat. He’s always on edge, like a constant fight or flight mode. When he had a psychotic break in October he became convinced that I was into witchcraft that I was cursing him at night and my lips were moving while I was sleeping and I was preventing him from sleeping and he would drive around all night not even staying in one spot because he was convinced people would find him and he wouldn’t sleep for over a week and then he called or texted like 40 or more people that I am currently or have been friends with in the past telling them that I was involved in witchcraft and please pray for me and don’t tell her I told you. When I found out about this and I was very very upset and I had to message everyone again and tell them the situation and after that he did actually realize he needed help and he went and got prayed for for deliverance which made a DRAMATIC CHANGE and after that one day that he had freedom as a result of being prayed for but soon it was back to his same issues. Anyways some really weird incident happened where he took off while I was at women’s retreat and drove three states away to see someone he hasn’t talked to in 20 years and when he got there he thought someone was trying to steal his stuff and he took off and said they were chasing him and he drove right back and I ended up filing a missing persons report and I was freaked out and thought he was in an accident and he finally showed up again at his aunt’s house... But he seems so normal so much of the time and when he sees a doctor or explains his issues nobody ever recognizes this because these are a lot of the time plausible things or he doesn’t even talk about his ideas about this crazy stuff. Now the current situation is that he thinks that me and his parents and basically everybody else in his life is trying to kill him and wants him dead because we are trying to steal his stuff or maybe have a life insurance policy you were trying to cash out on. So he left the state 4 months ago That’s also a long story it was supposedly temporary but he just told me three weeks ago that he is filing for a divorce and he’s not coming back to Michigan at all and we have four little boys their age is 3, 4, 9 and 10. He has been extremely resistant to any other possible interpretations of his beliefs like he thinks I poisoned him two times at least he says he has proof for all these things that he thinks and he is basically abandoning us based on false ideas and refuses to recognize has any kind of problem. His parents and myself and many many people are beside ourselves just not knowing what to do about this or how to get him to see he has a problem. I don’t want a divorce; I want to help him, I want him to get back to being the man I knew and married, I want my kids to have their dad whom they love and miss terribly...but I don’t know how to get him to recognize this problem or seek help. I wondered if anyone has advice!"
"Advice needed on delusional husband i don't know anything about US laws, but isn't there a way for you to oblige him legally to get treatment? does he have a living family other than his aunt? you see me trying to climb on this pole, but i'm just hiding the pain that's deep in my soul."
Advice needed on delusional husband I have considered that multiple times in the past but never quite seemed like the right thing to do and now I don’t have any proof that he would be a danger to himself or others not since the fall has he done anything that would indicate that and since he’s in another state and I hardly talk to him I would have no way to know. I don’t know any of his friends who could help me or anyone that would have a close relationship with him in Wisconsin and even if I did find proof enough to go through the process it would probably have to be in Wisconsin and I am six hours away with four kids and don’t know how the process would work there or if it’s possible . Has anyone else actually had someone committed that they love that has this condition and had anything good or bad happen from that ?
"Advice needed on delusional husband It's very difficult to get someone committed. Most of the time, it's because they're so sick that they did something that gets them arrested; or they tell their therapist/psychiatrist/doctor that they're gonna hurt themselves or someone else. My ex-wife was finally committed by her psychiatrist, and had to take medication. It was great at first, but after she left, she slowly stopped taking her medication. And now the whole cycle begans anew."
"Need an Opinion Writing on this forum seems a bit strange to me, but at this point I feel that I might need an opinion on what to do. My boyfriend and I have been dating on and off for a little over a year. When we first started dating, I wasn't aware of any ""delusional"" thoughts he might be having. But as time when on he told me that he thought I might have spies that follow him, his friends were drugging his cigarettes, that am cheating on him, and other things. The good news is, he never seems out of control. He never accuses anyone of anything, but these thoughts still affect his mental state. The thought of me cheating on him with several people seems to be the most problematic. He has said he can't take it anymore, it's like he had a dream that I am cheating on him and knows it's a dream, but still feels depressed and angry about it. I don't know what to do to help him, and it's and to imagine what he feels like. I'm not cheating on him, and I've told him that many times, but the conversation comes up often. I think that he should see a doctor and get diagnosed with something. He's been to a doctor before but they did not diagnose him with anything other than substance abuse (marijuana) and anxiety/depression. I'm confused to as why they didn't think it was anything else. It might be because he is good at controlling his outward emotions, but I'm not sure. We are both in college though, so I'm not sure how realistic it is for him to be able to see a doctor. I just want to help him, because I love him very much and I hate to see him in having to deal with these thoughts, because I know it is hard on him. If anyone has any advice, I'd appreciate it very much."
"Need an Opinion Hi, I suffer from delusions as well of being watched (home, away, monitored at all moments). When I accepted this delusion as some form of truth I questioned if I should care about walking naked through my home to the laundry room for clothes lol. I like going out in public, getting ready to go out the door seems more fun than actually going out to a store or something out of exhaustion of looking over my shoulder. It has increased with a passing manic episode that lasted for quite a while. While I accept these as delusions I also accept these as possibilities. About a month ago I was standing in my driveway by the garage where a couple floodlights were mounted. It started humorously like hah maybe theirs a camera there that would explain a lot (probably not) so I'd shoot it the bird every time I was alone near it entering the house because of this hidden camera garage door conspiracy so it was in the afternoon and I just looked at it and said to myself well if it's in your head...so I ripped it off the fixture. The light never worked to begin with. Turned out to be a sensor but it almost doesn't matter made me feel so stupid and relieved by the halarity of you just ripped down a bunch of wires because you think ""they"" are watching you. It somehow helped and put things into perspective and make me feel kind of me again. Now i haven't ripped the dish off the house smashed the smoke detector and crawling above the ceiling for monitoring devices. But the delusion is still there. But like your boyfriend I've kept enough of a composure to not be worse off and it's good your concerned. These thoughts are intrusive and obsessive but like your boyfriend it hasn't gone away for me either. Honestly I'm just waiting patiently for it to end (the delusions). I'd like to think it says a lot about someone's strength to walk through life for an extended amount of time without winding up hospitalized or in crises but to push through such misery is something to be proud of and remaining strong."
"Need an Opinion Well one advice I have is definitely don’t marry him. Delusional disorder is a lifelong condition and it can be managed with a variety of possibly drugs and psychotherapy but I’m telling you living with somebody like that is hell and my husband didn’t have delusional disorder when we got married. But I’m very glad that you want to help him that you care enough to do that. Does he recognize that these are delusions and if he’s been to the Dr. it sounds like he might know he needs help? Substance-abuse can cause delusions and paranoia - I know that I was never more full of conspiracy theories and paranoia than when I was smoking pot. But I don’t even normally have any such tendencies so if someone did that could be part of the cause of his paranoia. So for one, stopping any substance abuse would be a good start. But a family doctor would not have experience with something like DD he would have to see a psychologist trained in that to be properly diagnosed. DD is very rare. I would recommend you research and find a therapist/psychologist who specifically has experience in DD and suggest to him to see that person for an assessment. But be careful."
"Need an Opinion It's been a while and a lot has happened. We broke up last month. There seemed to be many reasons but one of them was that he could never trust someone ""like me"". I don't exactly know what to make of the break up. I found myself questioning who I am as a person a lot. And I've gotten progressively more angry at him. I think that's the only way I can get over him; just reminding myself that he's not innocent of every little thing just because he has a disorder. That I shouldn't be a victim to manipulation just because he feels manipulated at every moment. It was for the best. And I wish I didn't have to say that because he had this problem it was for the best. I wish he would have called his therapist. I wish he would have gotten help. It seems like a lot of the posts on these forums end up like this unfortunately."
"Delusional Jealousy? I have been married to my husband for 10 years and lived with him for almost 4 years prior to marriage. He alternates between being caring and loving to being cold hearted and mean to me. I love him. He doesn't believe me. He completely convinces himself that I cheat on him every chance I get. He sees little nonsensical things as ""proof"" and says horrible things to me. I adopted the ""stare at the ground"" defense years ago due to accusations of looking at men, which really does not work well when dealing with the public. And he has turned that around on me by saying that I can't look at him and that I stare at the ground due to my guilt. He used to be able to be okay as long as I took the kids with me when I went somewhere, but now he sees my two oldest (from previous relationship) as accomplices. Although he raised them, since they were babies, as his own. We also have two children together. I have been a completely faithful wife to him. There were some issues in the first few months of our relationship, where I was unfaithful, and he is aware of that. I wonder if that is the reason for his issues. If he were with someone else, would he be normal and happy? I really just feel like he has been constantly looking for some kind of evidence to just be rid of me. I have taken a lie detector test once before, and he seemed disappointed that I passed. And quickly found reasons to dismiss the results. He finds ""clues"" and ""evidence"" that make no sense to anyone but him. I am constantly walking on eggshells. Is this really delusional jealousy or is he just desperate to get rid of me?"
"Delusional Jealousy? While there is treatment for delusional disorder, it is Very difficult to forget a delusion that has taken root in one's mind for a length of time. I'd say delusional jealousy is a tough condition to deal with. There may be hope that he could be happy with someone someday, but he needs treatment and support to get there. Read more on this forum if you can. I think you will hear many people reach the same conclusion. They decide to get out of the relationship and save themselves from a life of struggling with untreated delusions. It is your life. You are the only person who knows what is right for you. If you are happy with your husband, then you have that. If you can live with the accusations and feel happy, that is ok. It isn't your fault that he is delusional. No matter what he says, it isn't your fault. Take care of yourself. See a therapist, and figure out what is right for you and your children. If he is a threat to you or others involve the police and keep detailed records. All the best, Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Delusional Jealousy? Firstly, it is not your fault. My wife had to put up with me doing similar things when I was acutely ill. So the next thing is to see it for what it is - an illness. It does not matter whether or not you are faithful - the issue is what his mind does with the possibility that you are that exists in every relationship. So, once again, it is not your fault at any level. It is very hard on the sufferer of the disorder, but also on their loved ones as you are finding out the hard way. Firstly, get him to see a good clinical psychologist who can try some cognitive behavioural therapy. The advice I received was that the spouse's reassurance never works, but makes matters worse: if there was reassurance then it meant the spouse took the allegation seriously. Other things that worked for me were that the 'checking' behaviour had to stop. There was a seemingly irrisistable urge to 'check' in many different ways, but if I resisted, then the urge passes. Get help for yourself too. from your doctor and a clinical psychologist, who should be able to help you through this to wherever it leads you. Get him to see a psychiatrist, too. I recovered from the jealousy, mostly. But then the illness found other outlets - such as persecutory beliefs. So therapy is unlikely to be the answer on its own. I took anti-psychotics for a while, but they did not really work. For me, this only resolved once when I took B-group supplements - Blackmore's executive stress. I suspect the supplements work in me because I have a metabolic disorder that responds to the way the supplements inhibit ornithine degarboxylase and get rid of excess ammonia. But severe vitamin deficiency alone can cause these type of symptoms e.g. pellagric psychosis. If you intend to try any form of supplement treatment, discuss it first with his doctor to ensure it is safe for him. Supplements are drugs like any other and have side effects and risks, and they are less well researched than many drugs. Also, ensure his doctors investigates the possible causes of the disorder by carrying out appropriate tests which should be performed, subject to the doctor's advice, before he trys any supplements or drugs. To my mind, these tests should include but not be limited to in order of importance to my mind: 1. Serum amino acids; 2. B vitamins, but particularly vitamins B6 and B3 and B12; 3. Urine amino acids; 4. Metabolic screen; 5. Heavy metals screen; 6. FBC. Your doctor may say that the serum amino acids are not likely to establish a treatable cause of the disorder. However, there is a lot of evidence that abnormal amino acid biomarkers may turn out to be crucial biomarkers of underlying metabolic disorders that cause psychiatric and neuro-degenerative disorders. There is a lot of good quality research that says that these disorders often present with patterns of serum amino acid abnormalities. When doctors understand what the abnormal patterns mean, the disorders become metabolic and are no longer regarded as psychiatric. There are likely to be multiple different metabolic disorder that cause psychiatric conditions. My abnormalities were repeat low serum amino acid ornithine and low serum amino acid serine, with high B3 intermediary and high B6. My doctors regarded these as being in effect meaningless results because they did not understand them, but after researching my abnormal results and my disorder (I do not recommend patients do this and do say that if they do this they should do so under the direct supervision of their doctor and only if their doctor does not advise against it), I established that my disorder may find expression in up-regulation of a cortisol up-regulated pathway that probably leads from proline to ornithine decarboxylase to polyamines. This up-regulation explains these and other abnormal results that I have and is currently being investigated by my doctors, so I could yet be wrong about this. Your partner probably does not have my disorder, but his disorder may be caused by a metabolic derangement and he may or may not have different abnormal biomarkers. If he does have abnormal biomarkers such as amino acids then they are probably not currently understood, but it is better to know what they are so that when they are understood by doctors better targetted treatment can be provided. If drugs or supplements work, they are more likely to be targetting ameliorating symptoms than the cause, until the underlying cause of the disorder is better understood, so treatment can be targetted at the cause. I am mostly hapilly married with a young son, so whilst I am looking at life differently these days, there is hope it can turn out well. Best wishes"
Delusional Jealousy? This sounds more pathologically manipulative than him being genuinely delusion. I would definitely get rid of him. Your good intentions seem to be holding you back but there is probably nothing you can do for this guy and he doesn't even deserve your kindness after all the other crap he's put you through. Dx: Psychosis
Delusional Jealousy? Look up DSMIV delusional disorder on the internet for the 4 main types of delusions. There is a good chance he has more than one type that you may recognise. Making you do a lie detector test is an extreme type of checking behaviour. Don't take this to mean he has delusional disorder.
"Delusional Jealousy? For those of you who have sought treatment for delusional jealousy, or are living with someone who has, what made you/your loved one finally seek professional help? In the past eleven months my husband, whom I have never cheated on, has been in complete denial about clear symptoms of delusional jealousy and has utterly refused treatment. He has gone so far to try and get me to ""confess"" that it has essentially ruined what was a happy home. Multiple friends have tried to broach the subject of therapy with him, but he staunchly states that he does not need psychiatric help and cannot be compelled legally to seek it at this time. Something has to give. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated"
"Delusional Jealousy? My partner is delusional just like yours, he doesn't trust me, he ""knows"" I cheat on him with every man and woman possible etc etc etc I could go on forever. I told my partner i'm leaving him if he doesn't get help. He agreed to get help. So I setup a doctors appointment for us both at same time (to explain to doc whats going on) we both went. Doc referred him to psychiatrist appointment. He had first appointment last week, he went alone as he did not want me there(cos I would've told the psych what he's REALLY like) (symptoms, behaviours etc), result of his appointment is that we both need relationship counselling (he told psych that its all becos of me, being upset about this and that, basically explaining some problems in our relationship rather than what really goes on). I am yet to take this further either with counsellor or going to the psych he saw and telling my story. My advice to you is maybe try tell your hubby that you feel that you both need relationship counselling since things aren't good at the mo. This might help him to not feel victimized about going to see a professional, rather the two of you going for help so he doesn't feel like the only one with the problem. This helped my partner go along with it and make the first steps. If this doesn't work and you come to your last resorts, threaten to leave maybe...as I did. I know it doesn't sound like good advice but from what I've read about this illness is that it wont get better it'll only get worse and its the spouse/partner that gets the worst treatment from the sufferer of this illness. You have been living like this for 11 months, I have been living like this for 5 years and I am not happy. I doubt theres other spouses out there that are, living with a delusional partner who wont trust their spouse and wont get treatment. If he doesn't wanna get help to please you( and he'll probably never recognise that there's anything wrong with his mental state) then he ain't worth wasting your life and your goodwill over and over again. Goodluck tho and I wish you all the best..."
"Delusional Jealousy? My husband and I have been to several counselors. He quits every time it is suggested he goes for a psychiatric evaluation. I have personally found couples therapy with him traumatic. I have had to listen to him make cruel accusations against me over and over. And with each new professional we saw, he learns more about the structure of a session and the type of diagnostic criteria professionals use to asses different issues clients may have. For example, he is real big on accusing me of substance abuse (I do not abuse substances). The first two counselors we saw told him quite plainly that I was not an addict. By the third counselor my husband had started describing me to the counselor in a very different (and inaccurate) manner, to pursuade the counselor that I was an addict. For the record, no one has ever beleived him. He refuses to see a psychiatrist. In the past two weeks, he has flat out refused to see anyone, and is attempting to divorce me, which I honestly believe is not a decision he is in the right frame of mind to make. Several close, long term friends have talked with him about seeing a psychiatrist. He continues to refuse. I suppose I am just wondering what it was that got through t the individuals on this board who DID seek psychiatric help. I cannot believe the lengths to which my husband has gone, continues to go, to support his delusional thinking about me."
Delusional Jealousy? I got my wife to get the diagnosis. She believes that I am mentally ill. so I told her I would get evaluated if she would and she said she would see a psychiatrist if I would both diagnosed her with delusional disorder. both told her that she needs to be on medication but she lackes the insight to see that is true. Dr. Xavier amador says this is anosognosia or lack of insight there are several videos of him giving speaches on the topic on utube. the long and the short of it is there is a small chance they will ever understand they are sick.

"Anyone on here right now dealing with DDJ partner? I can't sleep. Divorcing my DDJ husband and it is so hard. I feel devastated. I know this will sound awful, but after all he has put me through, one of my concerns is a very selfish one...what if he isn't like this with someone else? What if it is just me? What if some wonderful woman falls for him and he treats her like a queen? I know that shouldn't be what I am thinking, but I am. Am I an awful person for being upset by that thought?"
"Anyone on here right now dealing with DDJ partner? My husband is also DDJ and it is the hardest thing ever to deal with. I too have wondered if it is just with me, or would he be different with someone else. But the one thing I have read about is that this syndrome does not go away on its own and that he will always have it, no matter who he is with. My cousin's husband had it and they divorced. He remarried and he is doing to his second wife the same things he did with my cousin. The new wife doesn't have any independence. She barely opens her mouth when they are out she is afraid to look at anyone directly. My husband is the one who has filed for divorce twice already and then canceled it. He is always asking why we can't move far away. ""Things would be better is only we moved away"". But I know he would just start up again wherever we go. The triggers for his jealousy are all in our area, but he would develop new ones if we move away. Rest assured it is not YOU that created his sickness."
"Anyone on here right now dealing with DDJ partner? Agree with what she said. My husband also has DD, multiple subtypes, and he has put me through hell - yet I don’t want a divorce, I want him to get help; but he won’t instead he abandoned me and our 4 boys and said he’s filing for divorce. Because he thinks I’m trying to kill him. But he has always blamed his problems on external circumstances and thought if he just escaped those people/places/circumstances then his problems would go away. Now the problem is me, his parents, our town, the people here so he’s left. But I know it’s not going to be any different. It’s been years he has been like this but I didn’t know what it was. I also struggle with the same thoughts, questions; especially since he developed this like 6 years into into our marriage (we will be married 13 years in a week). Like, would this have happened if he was married to someone else? I guess that’s a question I’ll never know the answer to but as far as will he be magically all better with some future partner? No way."
"The nature of delusion Notes. All delusions are objective and formulated through subjective reasoning. Consensual validatable reality should be valued more than a projected subjective reality that can not be persuaded false to the delusional. Delusional reality or manifestation would be projecting a subjective meaning and believing it to be the factual (objective)reality of what’s happening. A Dual-subjective reality arises when an individual's mind interprets information and, instead of creating only one interpretation that the conscious mind can make sense of, creates several. These differing ""realities"" then cause conflict within that individual who may confuse what is actually happening around them with alternative realities formulated in their mind based on their own subjective experiences. The psyche, in some, resorts to a psychotic episode when it feels it is powerless and this is the only way to gain anything and triggers an episode that destabilizes the brain. This can be contributed to a variety of factors leading to the onset of psychosis, brain damage medication changes in those who are already diagnosed with mental illness. During this time the mind enters a psychotic process of disintegration down to its basic fundamental functions. However dangerous psychosis is, it can however lead into a much more renewed and refined reintegration of self that can promote growth ."
"Is it possible to break from delusions naturally? Also how does one break from delusion? Is it an induced process from other people (doctors, family etc..), or do these beliefs fade away on their own? Or does it disappear after a careful questioning of reality from the person who suffers from it? Does it slowly lose it's hold on the person who suffers from the delusion or does said delusion disappear suddenly (as if the person has an epiphany)?"
"Is it possible to break from delusions naturally? It slowly loses its hold, I’m still gripping with it myself. But what I mean by losing its hold is breaking with it. If your like me and you can’t relax find a place that makes you feel peaceful for me it’s a beach. I sometimes just think of that feeling from laying in the sand or playing a guitar alone on the beach or imagine looking into the mirror at the old rv my family had and going out to catch a hockey game it’s ironic but I wouldn’t have it any other way. I find a feeling like that can serve well. As far as breaking it is concerned, you ever have a repeating dream? Something stupid like something you always wanted just there for sale but you go over to that area of the store and it’s gone so you spend an aimless amount of time trying to find it so you can buy it and that’s the dream. Eventually, your mind no longer cares of wanting to possess and has different dreams. Alter it. This dream has altered your reality and I say I don’t want your dream you created for me I’ll turn on it by (filling the blank) This is my dream! This is my ride! Alright? You are wasting your time! I do this mostly by focusing on my family and career future endeavors projects etc. how I want to handle things: better said than done but it’s slowly being practiced some days harder than others but better days are seemingly coming my way and I’d like to believe it’s related to dreaming of something new. New dream is to leave for one I can control. I may be far off from any real point but thank you for one of the most engaging questions I’ve ever heard."
"Giving up on delusion I’ve been dealing with conditional circumstances that had been staring me in the face and have hid under the comfort of telling myself that I’m delusional so as not to believe my delusions tell myself “hey that’s crazy” but I’m running out of ways to explain to myself “and here’s how that’s crazy” . If I wanted I could show people connections to many things through evidence. But I don’t want to do that, alarm or serve detrimental to the other parties involved. I’m just at my whits end of even trying comprehending how I should realistically handle this and not wanting to hurt something I love. Mostly, I want someone to explain the full extent of what we’re dealing with."
"Need quick advice for my newly delusional wife to get thru.. The weekend. She is completely off the rails this weekend. She thinks every comment, tv show, song, book, billboard, etc. is directed specifically at her, demeaning her and telling her how I'm about to take the girls and leave her. The doctor put her on olanzapine 12 days ago (5mg in morning, 5mg at night) and can take up to 4mg of Xanax per day. About 2 per day had been sufficient until my parents came to visit, but I made her take 4 today and I wished it had been 5 or 6. Before bedtime she started getting angry and wanting a divorce because I ""ruined her life"". I've always been her advocate, and this sucks in so many ways. But in a practical sense, it sucks right now because she is literally misinterpreting every single thing that I say (and everyone else, for that matter). In the last week, there have been some times that she was admitting that she was having delusions, but the pressure of having my parents visit has clearly pushed her too far. And they have done NOTHING but be supportive and kind. Right now she's sleeping in our closet, which she barely fits in. That has been her safe space the last couple of days. I was going to set her up in a nearby hotel room, but there is no way she'd last 30 minutes without an eye on her girls. Plus, I think she needs some supervision, anyway. She's clearly confused and says so often. How can I nurse her through the weekend? We have a therapist visit on Monday and psych 2 week follow up on Wed."
"Need quick advice for my newly delusional wife to get thru.. BlackCat5, I'm sorry you didn't get an answer sooner. I think people hold back because they've been in similar situations, and they feel helpless and don't know what to do. In my experience with my relative, stress seems to be a huge trigger, as it boosts anxiety. Any change is stressful, even a temporary one, like family coming to visit, or a spouse leaving for a few days of travel. It's good that your wife is open to medication. Hopefully on Monday, her medical team listened to your description about the weekend and adjusted her therapy and medicines accordingly."
"Need quick advice for my newly delusional wife to get thru.. It is always helpful to identify with the feeling behind the delusions and not the delusion itself. ""I can see how nervous this is making you and that must be hard."" I am sorry you are going through this. I posted about my experience and I know how hard it is. Feel free to pm me."
"Need quick advice for my newly delusional wife to get thru.. Usually the meds start to sedate then reality starts to come back in bits and pieces. Hope that helps. My sister likes to go to a nice spa or hotel and practice self care when she struggles. I prefer to just stay home, and chill out. If you can promote self care, and comfort - that is best, and keep the kids preoccupied. Hope that helps.

"Jealous Delusions I recently got out of a relationship with my partner who I think might suffer from Delusional Disorder (jealous type). Before we started dating he had on several occasions made false accusations towards me. We met each other through a mutual friend whilst we were at university, he picked interest me in me and we talked for a while and lost contact. When he resurfaced back into my life shortly before I finished my course at university, he asked to take me out for dinner. I agreed to meet up with him, on the day we were to meet up, he called me and at the time I was in the library when the call came in. Although I picked the call I had to whisper. Fast forward to the date and he told me that when he called me and heard me whispering he thought I was with another man (hence me whispering to him on the phone). At the time I laughed it off and did not read too much meaning to it. On several occasions he would make reference to me being with another man for example, one night he rang me, and as we were speaking his tone changed and he said he heard voices in the background and again asked if I was with another man (I had to explain to him that the phone was on speaker and the noise he heard in the background was from my housemates who were in the living room (my room at the time was on the ground floor next to the living room) even with this explanation he was sure there was a man in my room causing the noise he heard in the background. He also went on my social media and saved images of me with comments from a guy he was convinced that I had had sexual/emotional relations with (he based his claims on the names the guy referred to me as e.g sweetheart, dear). Bearing in mind this guy was in a different country and continent, we became friends via social media. When I told him I had to travel to go and see family, on my arrival he requested that I take a picture to prove that I was really with them. Anyways fast forward to when I went to visit him at his place, this is where things took a turn for the worse and the false accusations tripled. Firstly, it started off as him saying he saw how I looked at his housemate and he was convinced that I sexually desired his housemate. He would say things like ""I saw the way you rolled your eyes at him"", ""I saw the way you walked past him, flaunting your bum so he could have a look"". Then one morning I woke up to a letter requesting that I get out of his house. The days and weeks that followed were filled with more accusations, apparently he said I woke up in the middle of the night and snuck to his flatmate's room and had sex with him, he even added that his flatmate confirmed that he had sex with me. When I requested that we confront his housemate to confirm these claims, he refused and made excuses saying that it was not necessary. He would send me messages asking me why I betrayed him by sleeping with his housemate, he said that I nearly drove him to suicide. For a while we had no contact and we later started talking again, but nothing had changed even as friends, he would bring up his claims of my infidelity when we talked and texted and even try to make me admit to his claims. He tried so hard to get me to agree to his version of events and would get angry and call me a lair when I refuted his claims and disagreed with him. He would say things like I cannot be wrong and I have facts that you cheated and when I would ask for proof, he would say the same things he always says ""I saw the way you looked at him, I am sure you slept with him"" I remember one night he woke up and woke me up and told me that I had been on the phone to his housemate. Some of his other claims involved him accusing me of sleeping with my ex housemate who he was friends with, apparently he had spoken to my ex housemate and when he mentioned my name to him, he had a look on his face which was similar to how I look when I have orgasms. With this he concluded that I had intercourse with my ex housemate. At the early stages he had mentioned that he was a really jealous and paranoid person, again I did not read too much meaning to this until he started to exhibit behaviors that clearly confirmed his claims. Fast forward to a few days ago he still messaged me trying to get me to admit that I cheated as well as laying other accusatory claims and insisting that I had a problem and needed to change my ways to avoid ending up in trouble and lonely. I am glad the relationship ended because the accusations were constant and he would find reason to question my intentions and motives towards him under the disguise of his claims that I gave him reasons to doubt my intents."
"What treatmant has been successful? Our mother suffers from delusional disorder. It has manifested itself over a period of 5 or 6 years. She is pretty much normal in every other way. We finally convinced her to see a psychiatrist in January. We were able to do this by convincing her that at least the doctor could give her something to manage the stress she was experiencing from her tormenters. Her delusions are persecutory. The doctor started her on a low dose of Abilify but then her delusional characters took her medicine. When she was able to get it refilled, she started taking it again but then she said it started making her sick. I am wondering if any of the members of this forum have had success with any particular medication. I am also curious if psychotherapy has produced any noticeable improvement. I know her doctor at this time is just trying to achieve trust with her. We as family just try to get her mind off of the delusions. Another doctor advised me not to reinforce her delusions by adding more locks to her home etc. How has this worked for other family members with delusional disorder?"
"What treatmant has been successful? My father never responded to drugs, which i think is pretty typical for DD unfortunatly. BUT I was taught during my psych degree that there is actually an OCD drug that is showing some promise. This may have to do with the fact that some professionals speculate delusions are on the obsessive spectrum. I cannot remember the name of the drug right now but will try to find it."
"What treatmant has been successful? Hi, I have some strategies that work for me. 1. reality checking. I use my relationships with the people around me to confirm if what I think is happening is in fact real. I only tell my most trusted friends and family things. 2. I try to take my medication every day. I always relapse when I forget for more than a week. 3. I managed to form a language of my own to interpret ""messages"" that I get. It is a language of love and that has limited characteristics in it. It works for me, but I'm an erotomaniac, so it kinda turns me on and may in some ways make me more vibrant. 4. build your support network of people you can call and talk to. Having social bonds makes it so much better when you need to figure out what is going on. Even if you don't want to share about your symptoms, just talking with someone else can be theraputic. 5. do something you enjoy doing. it will help you stay positive, and it will take you outside of your internal battle. Sometimes distraction is a good medicine (if you have gotten to the point where you can master the ""messages"" coming at you). 6. Did I mention to set reminders to take the medication? I'm never sick when I remember the medication regularly. 7. It took me several medications before I found one that fit my chemistry. Good luck. Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"What treatmant has been successful? Compute, if I rememer correctly the name of the OCD drug is clomipramine. There isn't much information about it on google - only a few case studies. Something to ask a doctor about. I wish it was something I could have my father try."
"What treatmant has been successful? Also look into the company TrueHope http://www.truehope.com/ . They manufacture supplements that have been proven in many studies (the studies are available on their website) to cure bipolar in some cases. It is extremely well studied. There have been reports of people with schizophrenia being ""cured"" (tricky word to use) by using their supplements. The products are expensive and patient would have to stay on them for a long time. But it's worth looking into. They have a number to call. I have called them before and they are very helpful. This type of treatment might go over better with your DD if he/she knows the are only being given supplements, not drugs (especially for persecutory types who have had their delusions reinforced by hospitalization)."
"What treatmant has been successful? Hello All, I have been living with this problem since I was 17 I am now 45. When I had my first outbreak I did not beleive anyone who told me, my thoughts were not true. But after a few years I started to learn how to deal with this problem. I thought my friends mother was out to kill me and I was sure of it. There are little things I see that put 2 + 2 together for my delusions to get bigger. I realize I even make up things so everything makes sense in my head. What I try to do is pick out the things that dont fit. That makes me calm down. For example someone rang my door bell and I was in the height of an episode, I thought he was there to kill me and my family. He said he was a salesman. So I thought to myself If he really is a sales man he will be going to other doors too. So I followed him to make sure he was going door to door. Once I saw that I calmed down a bit. It seems the older I get the more frequent I get these episodes. Sometimes it goes for a year sometimes a month without fear. When I do get them they seem to last for at least 2 months. I think that is because nothing I think is actually happening so I give up on the theory. But they never entirely go away. I started to take the drug fluanxol it is an injection that I get every 2 weeks. I have not taken the drug for about 4 months now and I am again in the hight of an episode. I did not want to take the drug because it makes me feel like jumping out of my skin. They give me side effect medication but It makes me into a zombie(Cant think straght). I will have to endure the side effects because I realize I must take this drug. I am also an alcoholic I drink at least 8 beer a day. This is to stop the feelings and thoughts I have. I still have the thoughts when drinking but I am much calmer and I start not to care what will happen. Well thats my situation. If any one has any questions post them here I will come back to see.

"I think my wife has dd pls help A month and a half ago my wife said she wanted a divorce. She didn't give much explanation just that she didn't love me anymore. We have been together since high school for sixteen years and married for ten. I was/am crushed but there was nothing I could do. we have a loving relationship, great sex life, spend time together etc... We have two kids under 9. She is a stay at home mom, doesn't drive or have any friends. A week before she broke up with me she started acting strange... She became withdrawn and sad the week before she broke up with me. She was talking to herself and laughing at nothing. I agreed to sleep in the basement and delay the divorce until she got a job and on her feet. A couple days passed and that's when the delusions started. She told me one day she could read minds and give people visions. She said our son had this ability too. She also said my aunt tried to poison her and was a witch. Two days of this passed and she was in full blown panic. I took her to the hospital and they released her saying it was a panic attack even though she said she was suicidal and having delusions. We went home and a few days later the delusions were worse. She was taking all the light fixtures off the ceiling saying my brother put cameras in them so he could watch us. She said my brother also is trying to poison me so he could have her all to himself. Every gesture and thing I said ""meant something"" and she became very suspicious of me. Two weeks ago she accused me of molesting my kids and raping her repeatedly over the last sixteen years. She left with the kids to go to her moms house and refused contact with me or the children. She then took an order of protection out against me. While she was at her parents she accused her brother of molesting the kids as well but her family refuses to get her help and think I'm a terrible person. She painted this abusive and controlling picture of me which is completely unfounded. I took her to court to fight the order of protection and filed for a separation to force the custody issue. It didn't go well. I got supervised custody on the weekends and the judge bought her every word. I pulled my petition and am now filing for a divorce. A divorce I don't want but feel I have no choice bc I need to fight for my kids and this defamation. I pulled my petition and filed for divorce to get a new judge who will hopefully see she has mental health issues. I'm beyond heartbroken. Do people snap out of this and realize what they've done? What should I do? I love her with all my heart but she is ruining my life. I'm scared for my kids. I can't just roll over. She screamed I'm a child molesting pig in front of my nine year old and I could lose my job over this order of protection."
"I think my wife has dd pls help this isn't the woman that you married. and she may never be that woman again. if you're pulling your punches here, don't. she isn't. you need to protect yourself and your children. you can't be responsible for her too, especially whilst she's attacking you. something knocked me out' the trees now i'm on my knees ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey there is one thing you must be sure of i can't take any more ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey don't like it but i guess i'm learning ... shock the monkey to life"
"I think my wife has dd pls help For sure I know. It just hurts. I'm putting a provision in the divorce that if she chooses to get help, I will delay or withdraw my petition and wait until she is ready for the divorce or wants to reconcile. I'm not to hopeful though."
"I think my wife has dd pls help sadly, people that are delusional tend to loose all grasp of reality, including considering that it might actually be them. unless something happens that really stop them dead in their tracks, they just keep doing this. and your wife is being supported against you by her family. so, they're effectively reinforcing her delusionality. as such, i honestly don't hold out much hope of this turning around. of the divorce, i'd have to say don't withdraw it unless she actually recovers from this delusionality. all you'll do by withdrawing it prematurely is weaken your own position. you need to be pushing back as hard as possible. i'm not saying that will get her to see things for what they really are but any signs of weakness on your behalf will only serve to justify her delusions in her eyes. something knocked me out' the trees now i'm on my knees ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey there is one thing you must be sure of i can't take any more ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey don't like it but i guess i'm learning ... shock the monkey to life"

I think my wife has dd pls help Thanks for all the responses! I was told her parents are starting to see it too now. She told them a lot of lies about me and I can't fault them for believing her. I'm just so worried about her. I'm not mad at her either even after she ruined my life. I know it's not really her. I still love her deeply and know this isn't the same woman I used to adore.

"delusion or not A week ago I developed a strange feeling. I have strange thoughts since then. I'm absolutely sure, that my government is tracking my facebook page. I think they read my messages and follow me on facebook. In the past weeks I shared and liked facebook pages that are against my government. Later I realized it was a dumb thing to do. Now I'm really afraid that I'm being tracked. I live in Hungary, which is a slightly anti-democratical country. We just had elections and the majority of people voted for the same party which was the government in the past 8 years. I'm afraid that I'm on the government's list of people who are against them. I can't get rid of these thoughts. It's overwhelming, I can't think about anything else besides this, I can't sleep or do work properly. I'm currently on antipsychotic drugs, because I had psychotic episodes in the past. I didn't have thoughts like this before. Can I be delusional? Does others feel the same way sometimes? Is it possible that I have delusions and I'm afraid at the same time? Is it possible that I realize I might be delusional and have delsions at the same time? Thanks for your answer! and sorry about my English"
"delusion or not From Theodor W. Adorno, Minima Moralia 103 Boy from the heath. – What one most fears for no real reason, apparently obsessed by a fixed idea, has the unnerving habit of occurring. The question which one would at no price like to hear, is asked by an assistant in a perfidiously friendly manner; the person, who one most wishes to keep distant from one’s beloved, will end inviting the latter, even if the former is three thousand miles away, thanks to a well-meaning recommendation, leading to precisely the circle of acquaintances, from which the danger threatens. It is an open question as to what extent one invites such terrors oneself; if one perhaps elicits that question from the malicious one by an all too eager silence; if one provokes the fatal contact, by requesting the mediator, out of a foolishly destructive trust, not to mediate. Psychology knows, that whoever envisions the calamity, also somehow wishes for it. But why does the latter seem to eager to meet them? Something appeals, in the reality, to the paranoid fantasy which distorts such. The latent sadism of all unerringly guesses the latent weakness of all. And the persecution fantasy is infectious: whoever encounters it as a spectator is irresistibly driven to imitate it. This succeeds most easily, when one gives it justifiable grounds, by doing what the other fears. “One fool makes many” – the abyssal loneliness of delusion has a tendency towards collectivization, which cites the picture of delusion into life. This pathic mechanism harmonizes with the socially determining one of today, wherein those who are socialized into desperate isolation hunger for togetherness and band together in cold clumps. Thus folly becomes epidemic: vagrant sects grow with the same rhythm as large organizations. It is that of total destruction. The fulfillment of persecution manias stems from its affinity to bloody being [Wesen: nature, essence, character]. Violence, on which civilization is based, means the persecution of all by all, and those with persecution manias miss the boat solely, by displacing what is wrought by the whole onto their neighbors, in the helpless attempt to make incommensurability commensurable. They burn, because they wish to immediately grasp, with their bare hands, as it were, the objective illusion which they resemble, while the absurdity consists precisely of the perfected mediacy [Mittelbarkeit]. They fall as victims to the perpetuation of the context of delusion. Even the worst and most senseless conception of events, the wildest projections, contain the unconscious effort of consciousness, to recognize the fatal law, by virtue of which society perpetuates its life. The aberration is actually only the short-circuit of adaptation: the open foolishness of the one mistakenly calls, in others, the foolishness of the whole by its correct name, and the paranoid are the mocking image of the right life, by choosing on their own initiative to make it similar to the wrong one. Just as sparks fly in a short-circuit, so too does delusion communicate with delusion truly like lightning. Points of communication are the overpowering confirmations of persecution manias, which mock the one who is ill for being right, and thereby only push them in deeper. The surface of existence immediately closes up again and proves to them, that things are not that bad and that they must be mad. They anticipate subjectively the condition, in which objective madness and the powerlessness of the individual pass, unmediated, into each other, as in Fascism, where the dictatorship of those who are persecution maniacs realizes the fears of persecution of its victims. The question of whether an exaggerated suspicion is paranoid or realistic, the faint private echo of the tumult of history, can thus be solely determined retrospectively. Psychology does not reach into horror."
"My wife punched me in the face twice tonight.... I've documented everything and am thinking about blackmailing her into not drinking (which is really the only time this kind of thing happens). She's not been diagnosed delusional, but that's what she's become since she quit drinking every night. She quit for a month, and since has done it irregularly with disastrous results. She's been diagnosed depression/anxiety but not bipolar 2 this latest time (she had been diagnosed BP2 a number of times previously). She's taking meds and going to therapy, but her paranoia has gone off the charts and it's starting to affect our girls. Does anybody here think threatening (I'm guessing the best threat is to call Child Protective Services?) her into not drinking will work? She's got a good heart, but her head is all screwed up right now."
"My wife punched me in the face twice tonight.... Sort of. She knows when she's ""interrogating"" the girls way after bedtime that it's wrong. She knows that being violent is wrong, but said I ""poked the bear"". which, hey, she's right. I know how she is. But these delusions are something else. Unless I go all in with her, we don't have a relationship. Logic has no bearing on her at all. She knows she's sick. She knows she see a 99% empty glass and checks off the full list of signs of a negative perspective. But she can't add it up. But the drinking has to stop completely."
"My wife punched me in the face twice tonight.... I really feel for you. My wife is having some pretty big delusions too. She hasn't resorted to drinking or violence........yet. In my opinion, I don't think threatening your wife will work. From what I've seen from my wife,she doesn't react in a very rational, logical manner. And I'm guessing your wife won't either. The rational response for her, if you threatened her, would be to stop doing these destructive, hurtful things. Somehow I doubt that you'll get that response. If she's getting physically violent with you then I'm afraid it might be time to go to the police. It's great that you're documenting things, but a police record will likely carry much more weight."
"Does My Friend Have DD? Greetings, I am new to the forum and would appreciate your suggestions/advice. I have a friend I see infrequently (she lives 30 miles away) but we communicate fairly frequently via text and Facebook. For the past year or so she has been sharing with me her concerns about her being stalked by next-door neighbors (married M/F couple) who have allegedly hacked into her computer, phone, Wi-Fi and Facebook account. Her garage door opener has been messed with, her electricity has gone off at inopportune moments, strange cars have sat parked in her driveway, and her cable TV has done odd things from time to time. They have allegedly managed to get into her house. She changed her locks but reports that the key maker made extra keys and accidentally left them somewhere that her stalker could have easily gotten to when she wasn't around. She sent me a list of phone numbers she wanted me to call to see who answered. They were calls she had gotten and when she answered, no one was there. When she called the numbers back to see who had called she'd get a variety of responses (if any). I researched a few and called a handful. I didn't find out much. One call I made produced a recording that said the number wasn't in service. The red flag came when I told her my result and she later reported that she called the number again to see what would happen. A man answered so she blocked him. I called the same number again and got the recording. I said nothing to her about it but kind of dropped all my research once I realized it was probably a ""wild goose chase."" I had pretty much believed her stories (though I often wondered about mental health issues) until this experience because I really had no proof of any of it one way or another. She has security cameras on all four corners of her house but has never been able to produce any evidence of any strange activity via cameras because ""they know how to avoid detection."" (She claims they - or someone - has vandalized her decorations and plants outdoors.) She has spent, I would imagine, hundreds if not thousands of dollars on this equipment. Recently she alleges that they have caused the camera on the side of her house that is directed at their house to malfunction. There are times when I have thought that she actually enjoys this drama because when I have made suggestions that I think are solid ways to stop the stalking, she will have a reason to not carry them out, or says she has but they didn't work. There is so much more that has happened to her according to her report. All strange and mysterious. Yet I haven't been able to SEE any evidence of strange activity. All I have seen are photos of these neighbors on their deck barbecuing, smoking or just sitting, or standing by the glass doors leading to the deck. And she has shown me a couple photos of vehicles sitting in her driveway with license plates that can't be deciphered. But to her they are all suspicious. I would like to know if you think she is dealing with delusions, and if so, what suggestions you have as to what I should do, if anything. I don't know any of her family members or friends. Most of her information on Facebook is private. Feel free to ask questions if you need more info. Thanks for your help!"
"Does My Friend Have DD? Well that's the thing- you never know.... I'm a pretty paranoid person, and I've thought some pretty wild things, at times. Any logical argument against a paranoid, fantastic belief I find myself thinking, and I can immediately come up with logical arguments to bolster my belief. But unless you can arrange to visit and stay with them for a long enough period of time, how can you tell if someone's actually messing with her, or not? Have you asked (and gotten) reasonable explanations WHY the neighbours would want to do these things? What motive? Just curious... I know when something gets in my head, the possibility of it is reason enough, who needs motives.... **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

"Does My Friend Have DD? Thanks, Snaga, for your perspective! I am not sure what she thinks is the motive. I know that there has been some dispute at least on her part as to the trimming and care of the neighbors' bushes that border her property. All I know is that she has been trimming them herself because she doesn't like the way they look. She complained once that they sit on their patio and watch and don't offer any payment for her work. I told her that they really don't owe her anything because they didn't ask her to do it - it was her choice. I am sure there are other things but I will have to ask her. I have actually thought about spending the night with her (longer would be better) and even checking for bugs (surveillance) but I also don't want to play into the delusion if there is one (which I suspect there is of sorts). I can see how paranoia could lead to this. I haven't heard from her for a while so my paranoia leads me to think she knows somehow that I am suspicious. It sounds like a circle, doesn't it? Lol!"
"Does My Friend Have DD? Hum. I bought a cheap bug detector one time, was kinda paranoid myself about being watched... ofc, if you really have been watched (and I have- though realistically, I was probably not the target of the surveillance) then it's not being too paranoid to wonder what they up to. It's your call whether you think it would play into it, or maybe provide reassurance. Ofc, if they're really obsessing over it, reassurance may not last. I'm OCD and mod over in the OCD forum, and I can tell you, for some folks, reassurance can get to be like a drug habit. But if nothing else, you might get a better feel for what's real and what's not. Hum. I'd be more like, why you cutting my bushes? Unless it's sticking out into her property. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"Does My Friend Have DD? TBH, I probably won't spend the night at her place. Not sure if she would actually want that. Much of our communication is about her issues with electronics and computer stuff. I got acquainted with her through my cleaning business. Did work for her for a year or so. No stalking issues at that time (now around nine years ago). I want to ask her for more info on why she thinks neighbors have it in for her. Her current problem is that someone appears to be changing her Facebook password so she can't log in. I've sure learned a lot about security stuff these days! She says she also has new security cameras so we'll see what they pick up, if anything. Thanks. I'll keep you posted."
"Does My Friend Have DD? Huh. I know a lot of people who have had their FB hacked. I do a very simple thing: leave platform apps OFF. Don't play Farmville, don't look to see what I'd look like as the opposite gender, don't do any of those cutesy things that try to suck you into signing up via platform apps. Never been hacked. Easy peasy. If she does a lot of stuff like that from FB, she could very well be having problems. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts. Please do read the Forum Rules"
"Does My Friend Have DD? I am going to offer a guess before I say something to her. She will probably say she doesn't do those things. Doesnt fit her personality, IMO. She keeps her page/profile locked up pretty tight and never shares results of games and quizzes. I don't do games but I do quizzes and do them one or twice a week, maybe. She is an avid participant in a forum/page for people who grew up in our state in the U.S. She posts in there many times a day and I think she may be the administrator of another special (private) forum. Sbe worries when she thinks a post has not appeared there or has been deleted and will have me check to see if I can find it. She does really try to keep her life and activity locked up so the troubles she's having are mysterious and I can see how she could conclude that someone is cyber-harassing her. The question might be, ""Is it her neighbors?"" Me, I kind of love a mystery and this is somewhat to her advantage though I lack the savvy to understand how all this cyber-stuff works."
"When the body attacks the mind - Autoimmunity in Psychiatry I have not visited the forum for a while, so am not sure if this topic has been discussed. I'd like to raise the awareness of all who suffered from the effects of DD to the latest studies regarding autoimmune disease masquerading as a psychiatric disorder. My ex-husband suffered autoimmune disease which caused him to have diabetes and grave disease at a very young age. Prior to his first delusional episode, he had a very serious virus infection which hospitalized him for a short period of time. After suffering from DD for 10 years, he eventually ended his own life. One of the studies estimated that 1/3 of the psychiatric disorder cases might be related to autoimmune disease and could be greatly improved after treating the patient's autoimmune system. I wish these studies were found 10 years earlier, but maybe they could help many of others on this forum.

"Is it possible to 'wake up' from delusions? My mom has delusional disorder. It started in her late 30's. She believes there are spies everywhere. She has absolutely no insight and has been living in this delusion for the past 25 years. She thinks she's right and everyone else is delusional. I've now reached the age she started getting delusions and I'm starting to get them too. Different type though. Another difference is they only last a few days or weeks and then I 'wake up' from them, realizing it was just a delusion. Every time I'm in the delusion, I 100% believe it and not thinking I'm entering another delusion again. So it's like a vicious cycle. I enter the delusion, wake up from and realize it's not true, just to enter the delusion again a few days later. Rinse, wash, repeat. So my questions are, do these really count as delusions if I stop believing in them after awhile? And is there a term to describe this condition? Something like, 'recurring delusions' or 'delusional remission'?"
"Friends Erotomania..think its ruining our friendship Ive had a friend for seven years that i believe has Erotomania to the extreme. I don't want to lose a friend but this is taking its toll on our friendship. I need help in dealing with him. This friend Ill call ""Tim"" not his real name has this over the top obession with these two girls, one of which has filed a restraining order against him because of his particular delusion. The first one is the most dominant of the two. He believes his soulmate is a girl he was friends with in elementary school until she moved away for sake of explaining ill call her ""Jill"". He believes shes going to return to him one day, claims hes seen her in public, that she wants him still and going to find him. All he sees is her, Jill has caused him to become depressed before now is doing so again. I hate to sound jealous but its gotten to the point he doesn't even talk or focus on anything else. Shes so great, shes saved him. She visits his dreams at night. How he feels her nearby. The second girl its the same scenario just more downgraded. It feels im like literally nothing to him ill never be her not even after all ive done. Jills a saint. He has a lot of supposed psychological problems but i cant take it. Jills not real that i know of. Hes obessed with finding her, so he can make things right. I lost my temper yesterday. I have OCD plus anxiety however i don't understand what to do. How can i cope with this? At least get him over this? Its been on and off for years. He won't date me because of her not that i want him too. He likes being miserable odviously since he cant get over it. Im tired of seeing him suffering over something so ridiculous. Please help.."
"Friends Erotomania..think its ruining our friendship Your friend is certainly dealing with some sort of suppressed realizations about people and the world. In fact this may be less to do with her than the values he's attributed to a time in life or something or maybe better off he just seeks closure. Chemical imbalance is tricky, you try to define or express your emotion and then you look for an explan to yourself later on thinking behind saying doing thinking believing expressing behaving and you can easily come up empty handed. Some born with can have trouble coping. When a person is conflicted these things are very guilty things to have to live down. Your friend may never find closure but he may be able to build his own life maybe with you maybe with someone else but he may need support to get there and maybe in a few years he can look back and laugh at his old problem and laugh."
"Friends Erotomania..think its ruining our friendship How come you cannot or will not stand up for your own heart's desire? Why not tell him you wish he would stop obsessing about these two fantasy girls and notice the real girl right in front of him, who wants him. That's you, isn't it? As for the fantasy relationships; typically a fantasy like this is a defense. It helps to keep depression at a distance. If you take the fantasy away, the depression can be overwhelming. He probably needs psychotherapy and maybe also medication. Dx DID older woman married w kids. 0 Una, host + 3, 1, 5. 1 animal. 2 older man. 3 teen girl. 4 girl behind amnesia wall. 5 girl in love. Our thread."
"Friends Erotomania..think its ruining our friendship Yes your friend needs therapy along with someone there for him so it's good he has you but I'd be weary of dating him with these types of delusions because even though these people are a fantasy and they're not real in the sense he thinks they are as if they're his soulmate, you'd still most likely be seen as a fallback for him in his mind he's ready to leave you in a drop of the hat. Although that won't happen or at least very slim to none chance that he should give up on and respect that this person is living their own life he's still clinging to something he probably can't explain to himself let alone make sense to someone else about why he has these feelings wherever they may derive from. It sounds like he needs professional help in a judgement free environment where he won't be frowned upon for having such a delusion stemming from childhood but with someone who understands psychology enough to work through his issue of erotomania. I think if he can give up on this through the help he needs then he may be able to open his eyes enough to understand not only the flaws of his logic but to be open to a new appropriate healthy and honest love for someone like you who clearly cares as an adult. He's far from actual fulfillment for these things he feels he's lacking like finding an actual soulmate and not living in a childlike delusion that for whatever reason he's clung to into such a later stage of life. He needs help to understand the root cause of why he feels that way and why he's attached so many things to a person of make believe. I'm sure it's incredibly hard to understand why he's carried childhood desires into adulthood and something like this I'm sure makes others uneasy especially for the people he people he's placed such importance upon and he needs help."
"Friends Erotomania..think its ruining our friendship years ago i told him my feelings when i still felt them. He said we weren't compatible among other excuses. Glitched i agree exactly with you on him needing help. He doesn't see that he has an illness so he wont get help. Hes always going to be obessed with people, hes like that. I want him to get help.. because honestly he could be amazing as a boyfriend. We fight all the time now about it. I told him id rather not talk about it. I just get so frustrated by it. I had a bad break up, it took me three years to grieve but ive decided to move on. I knew it wasnt healthy. In a way that could have been me if i didn't talk to someone about it. Thats why he can never be fulfilled, because eventually he starts talking about Jill this n that until the girls break up with him. Its so frustrating."
"Wife with extreme paranoia... My wife was previously diagnosed with depression/anxiety (also a few bi-polar 2 diagnoses) and recently quit drinking a couple of months ago. She also stopped taking Trileptal (without asking the doctor). She hasn't been diagnosed with DD, but she seems to fit the persecutorial profile. While she has always ""felt"" that people were talking about her (and I believed that was true, to a lesser degree than she thought), I attributed it to her low self-esteem. But now, she has developed full-blown paranoia. I have ""entertained"" some of her concerns and searched for cameras/bugs/hacked accounts/devices, etc. She has absolutely no evidence for her allegations, except the way people ""look"" at her and many other irrational assumptions. She's desperate to move, but doing so will be very detrimental to the kids and will be financially next-to-impossible. On top of that, I have little doubt that wherever we land, the same things will happen again. To make matters worse, she's subconsciously torpedoed her work opportunities. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where her predisposition to ""constructing"" her reality forces her to quit. I really don't know what to do with her. On the plus side, she still takes her Wellbutrin (and has started Trileptal again) and sees her therapist weekly. But I'm afraid that changing will be too difficult for her and we'll be stuck with this. How am I supposed to handle her? Do I just indulge her paranoid fantasies? If I don't she gets extremely upset and says, ""They all want you to believe I'm crazy. They're counting on it."" If I do, then I'm just pushing her further away from reality. Please help."
"Wife with extreme paranoia... You need to contact her psychiatrist immediately. Even if you do not have consent from her for you and her doctor to discuss her.....YOU can tell her doctor. He can’t respond but he will listen, I bet. See if he has a direct email address or direct voicemail. Explain everything here you’ve written and you don’t know where to turn. I don’t know what else to suggest....you’d benefit from therapy yourself and the therapist may be able to direct you to local resources to help her. Also, if she has psychosis that is bipolar 1, not bipolar 2....I’m not a doctor just speaking from informal personal experience. -- 15 Mar 2018, 13:31 -- PS: The office won’t be able to acknowledge her as a patient. That’s why I suggest direct contact with the psychiatrist....a letter in the mail marked “confidential” addressed directly to the psychiatrist could likely work...if you can’t get voice or email. Go see another psychiatrist if the above doesn’t go anywhere and a therapist can’t help you. Antipsychotics can work well and some can be administered via month long injection. My partner and I have bipolar 1 with psychosis and I’ve been on both sides of the coin, but we accompany each other to our appts, take meds, etc. I wish you the best. 103 =)"
"I'm new, trying to figure out my next move Been seeing a man 1-1/2 year. Suddenly two weeks ago he shared something with me and it's bothersome. The basic gist is the clouds in the sky are not really clouds, they are fallen angels making shapes, such as symbols found in Egypt, as well as pagan symbols. He believes the clouds are empty, like a portal, and the angels are related to Satan. He says his eyes get blurry suddenly, he snaps a picture of the clouds, then when looking at the picture he sees all the symbols. He states the trails left by airplanes in the sky are the creation of these fallen angels. He said it all makes sense to him now, he is part of the chosen people, and when the angels come to fight us, he is ready. I'm trying to look back on this 1-1/2 year to correlate other things, but this is just so sudden. He got really angry with me one time because I said his name to the neighbors, instead of using the term my boyfriend. He said he didn't want to have to fight anyone, as these are kind of crummy neighbors, but it made no sense to me and he was really mad an aggressive. He also has strange thoughts on events, everything is a planned conspiracy. He even believes he was meant to meet me because of my blood type, and that my parents moved states when I was a child so the government would want me somehow. I looked at his cloud pictures, I see clouds, no shapes. What now, I feel lost and I'm wondering about my safety with him. Just trying to figure out if u should just end this. He is not the type to listen to me, he spoke about these clouds for almost 3 hours without a breath."
"DDJ Husband asking for divorce I am feeling so sad and down today. My DDJ husband has been having an episode since Father's Day weekend, actually maybe longer, its hard to tell anymore as the episodes come closer together and last and last. We have been together 18 years, married 14 years, and I believe this disorder has affected him for at least the last 12-13 years. He was always very jealous and controlling, but I attributed that to issues we had before the marriage. He has been tossing around the idea of divorce off and on for a week or more now, not the first time for that. But it is only the second time that I have been so worn down by this, that I have not been broken down by the threat. I love him, we have 4 children, well two of them are from a previous relationship of mine, they are 19 and 18, and he has raised them since they were 2 and 1. Our two children together are 12 and 4. I have tried and fought all these years to keep our family together. I have taken a lie detector test, offered to take more, dealt with emotional, verbal, and sometimes physical abuse, etc... I have prayed, begged, bargained with God to fix him and us. I feel like he has an illness which is not his fault, and if he had cancer, I would not leave him for that, just because of the stress it put on me. So, I have always felt guilty even considering leaving our marriage when he is obviously sick. He will not go get help. He has promised to in the past and has said he would a few times the past week, but I doubt he will stick with that. He had secret social media accounts where he talked to women behind my back. I am not allowed to even look at another man. These came to light last year after he contacted a close relative's ex girlfriend with the secret account and she immediately told on him. He was convinced that my family had a hand in that because in his mind there was no way she would have done that. I found a message that he sent to a young woman telling her that he ""would give anything for all of her love"". It was soul crushing. I screamed and yelled and told him to leave that I wanted him out but he would not. He blamed me for all of it, saying that I was a cheat and he deserved better. He ended up moving out a couple of weeks later, after discovering I had set up a new bank account and paypal account for myself and had applied for some credit cards in my name, in order to set up some type of financial security for myself (I only had $100 in the bank account and $7 in paypal.) But he accused me of stealing from him and decided that he needed to leave me and start a new life. So he was gone for a couple of weeks but came back home, made me quit my job that I had just started, because he will not let me keep a job, and made promises to seek counseling. He saw a therapist twice, and claimed the therapist told him he couldn't see a marriage counselor and him because insurance wouldn't cover both. But he claimed the therapist had agreed to see us together. I went to his third and last appointment with him. It became pretty obvious that he had been lying to me and the therapist and the therapist immediately came to my defense. That was the end of our counseling. I feel cheated. I have loved him all these years, sacrificed for him by having no friends, no outlets, and controlled and limited time with my family. I have given him 18 years of my life. I have not been allowed to dress nice or keep up my appearance. I have gained weight and not been allowed to diet without accusations and threats. He has worn down my self image and confidence by his many put downs over the years. Everything we own is in his name. He controls everything. He has told me that he will leave me the house so that our kids will have a home, but that's it. he said he will make sure the kids are taken care of. He bought a very lovely piece of land right by a river, that was basically both of our dreams to have one day. He is going to move a trailer to it and live in that paradise while I am stuck in a neighborhood that I hate and have been begging for him to move us out of for years. We have another piece of land out in the country that we could have put a house on for years, but he would never do it. He says that will remain his as well. He has made statements to me before that he didn't want me to have anything nice. I don't even have a car. If I say anything, I am called a greedy, selfish, gold digger, plus many other expletives. I have never had anything nice that I could call my own, because I have not been allowed it by him. Maybe its petty of me to complain about material things, but it is part of life and it is hard to function without a vehicle in a small rural community with no mass transit. I only complain about these things, because I could have had things on my own by now, had I been allowed to work and buy things for myself. I know that he did not allow me to do that as a control thing, but I didn't raise too much hell about it because I didn't expect to be 40 years old and having to start over. I really wish there was some way to get him to seek help. I have personally diagnosed him but he has never been diagnosed by a professional. He told me today that I just wanted to dope him up so that it would be easier for me to cheat on him. I am sad because I truly see no hope at this point. He refuses treatment, so what can I do? I know everyone will say, let him leave, good riddance, etc... But this man has been my world for 18 years and it is hard to just walk away from that. I feel broken."
"DDJ Husband asking for divorce Hi feelinglost123, I had a DDJ fiance. It was so soul-crushing to go through his ""episodes"" with him....I can only imagine how much harder it is when you've been married for many years and have children together. I think that feeling broken and crushed and terrible is completely normal in a situation like this, and there is not really any way to avoid it. You're gonna have really bad days. But I do think it is super important for you right now to get some space apart from him. I totally understand not wanting to ""punish"" him for his illness....but staying around isn't helping him anyway. And it's really harming you. If anything, maybe there is a way to get a friend of his, or a family member, to check in on him once you've gone. He might respond better to the caring expression of someone he is NOT deluded about. I understand how emotionally wrenching this is for you, not to mention how much it sucks to be unfairly accused of so many things, not to mention the prospect of having to start over from scratch with no closure and no advantage. It's $#%^ luck, but the sooner you take a step toward YOUR future, the better. How are the kids about this? Have they seen your husband's jealousy or does he hide it from everyone except you? Sending love to you."
"DDJ Husband asking for divorce BadDream - did you break it off with him? Feelinglost123 - I am going through a similar situation right now with my husband of 4 1/2 years and 7 years together. We have a 3 year old son. My husband thinks I am having an affair with my boss. So not only does it affect my home life but job too. Also we live where we work so it is all connected. I have been reading various stories on these pages searching and searching for people that might understand the heartache I am going through. It is hard when it is your love and where you planned to spend your whole life. But at what cost? Right now I feel like I am barely holding it together. Do I leave now or struggle for years with it? We are in the process of getting help. He sees it some days others he doesn't. Also I want him to be happy. When we are not at our home (where the boss is too), we are pretty much good. He returns to his normal self the man I married. I would quit and move but he had a couple episodes with other people before we started this job. So I am assuming the DDJ would manifest itself in the future with someone else. I am not willing to chance what might happen in the future and how it will affect our son. The other thing is I have talked about him leaving but then he talks about suicide. I don't have answers probably more questions but it has helped me to know others are dealing with similar struggles. Take care of you and your babies! That is what I am trying to focus on right now."
"DDJ Husband asking for divorce feelinglost123, your husband needs psychotherapy, and so do you. You have proof that he is cheating on you, and it is very normal, even stereotypical, for married cheaters to project their cheating onto their spouse. They gaslight and bully you and make you think you are the problem. That way they transfer all their shame and guilt onto you and wash themselves ""clean"" of their own sin. It's that sick! You might not be able to get your husband into psychotherapy but you can help yourself and your children greatly by finding a therapist for you.

"DDJ Husband asking for divorce I too am married to someone with delusional jealousy syndrome. We have been together almost 40 years. The delusions started about 5 years ago. It's so sad. We had such a great marriage and so many good times together. Now my days are full of accusations and verbal abuse. My friends and family tell me to leave him, but like you, I feel that I must get help for him before I let it all go. I wouldn't abandon him if he had cancer and this is just another type of illness. My question is how do I get him into therapy? He is in total denial and gets angry anytime anyone suggests it. I cannot have him committed because he is so good at hiding his episodes around others. What worked for those of you who actually got your spouse into therapy? And my other question is : Did therapy and/or medication help at all?"

"What if it's not all delusional I feel like their's a plot thickening around me that I sometimes act on in a very vague manner that sort of eludes that's very vague and quite frankly creepy to those I'm eluding towards if not true that I'm involved in this sort of plot. I often feel watched and monitored that connects on a grander scale than it should which leads me to believe It's psychosis given a history of psychosis. I said some things in a group chat amongst friends which I believe to have been forwarded to others which is actually very plausible on at the very least a small scale when someone is mentally unwell. I referred to myself as a baby being put to sleep (not in a homicidal manner like actual sleep) to describe something when I was manic which I still am to a very small degree. I work in a busy outlet mall at a kiosk and I was busy with a line of customers and I guy walked by and said ""hey baby"" like mocking me. I just focused on work and didn't let it phase me because I can't afford to collapse but I could see it when he looked over he said it with that sort of purposeful intent. I've had a lot of anomalies happen a lot of suspicions. I looked up different techniques of investigating and stalking and a lot added up but I just tried to brush it aside and make sense of it by saying well I am in a battle with my insurance company over a major automobile accident. A lot of suspicious things, some supportive evidence that legitimizes my claims but everyone I talk to has said well maybe they weren't looking at you or I didn't see them and likewise. A lot of guys in veterans caps (one pictured looking directly at me with a grin with no child in a kid's Muesam in a very small town. A purposeful photo bomb while I took a picture of my wife. I'll go into a store and the same people will be there shopping with little or no items. Like picking up random toys and putting them back on the shelf at the dollar store while I'm with my wife and son. One guy also in a veterans cap looked suspicious in the motor oil aisle at Walmart so I went down the aisle and pretended to be looking for motor oil and then said ""eh I don't want to get the wrong one"" as if I were talking to myself out loud. Then I went and met my wife and child in the toy aisle where we were letting him pick out a toy and then he walks down there no item or cart in Walmart. I go to the grocery store and the manager is pretending to straighten up a bread display so I move over towards the bread and he moves to the other side where I was originally standing now he's pretending to do another task, this continues and so forth. My wife and I were hovered over by a very large thuggish looking man picking out grapes so I turn around and he shoulder bumps me then maintains a clear visual of us throughout our shopping with 0 items in hand. Manager races by frantically. (Should have called 911 and pulled up surveillance but I didn't) wife of course doesn't notice these anomalies. The other night I pull up to a convience store and and old black sedan with a completely black tint (illegal outside law enforcement) and a barcode on the window pulls up and parks Cady cornered at an odd angle. So before entering the store I pop out and pretend to check the air pressure in my tires while glancing intently in their direction I couldn't see in past the blacked out tint and then they took off like go, go! I don't know man a lot of anomalies but maybe I'm unwell."
"What if it's not all delusional Hi. I sent you a PM but noticed your post here. I had the same thoughts for a long time. I had trouble 'sorting out' what was real and what was not. That is part of the illness, your mind cannot tell the difference. Now I am ok, and I do not have these discrepancies anymore. I know what you mean by anomalies, strange coincidences that don't seem to be coincidences, they seem to be intentional placement of words, actions, e.t.c. I feel for you, I truly do. I have been through that for sure. Read my PM, maybe it will help shed some light on your situation. I'm here for you, even if I might not check up that often. Delusional thinking is serious and if left unchecked, extremely detrimental to ones' life and perhaps those close to them as well. We need to band together and help each other out."
"I know I suffer from DDJ but now there a few Red Flags Hi, I suffer from DDJ and have for a long time in various relationships. My DDJ was/is very strong but every now and then I’d usually have an idea deep inside that it was my imagination and my jealousy that made me so suspicions. I was always looking for evidence of some kind. Unfortunately that changed recently when I found some text messages on my wife’s phone from a former co-worker. I could tell the previous message threads them between had been deleted. Needless to say I concluded she was sleeping with him. I did not confront her though. All of the messages I saw where innocent type conversation, nothing sexual, although he offered her a massage on message and added a LOL to it at the end, she did not reply. A few weeks later I eventually confronted her about the situation to which she said answered a few questions correctly but lied about his name. I told her I knew she was lying, etc and told her I was going to divorce her (did I over react?). After 5 days of no speaking to each other we eventually sat down and talked. She said she knows she was wrong and that she knows she hurt me (she knows I struggle to trust, I’ve been cheated on before by 2 other woman but also had DDJ before that….ironic) but she was scared because she thought I’d have a jealous reaction and that is why she lied about his name and never told me about him. I told her I needed transparency and open communication and for us to get on the same phone plan, etc. She agreed and she told me that since the day we met she have never been with anyone else but me. However after our talk I noticed she google searched how to not have contacts show up on an I-pad and she did delete him from our I-pad contacts and it was not because she didn’t plan to talk to him again. I just recently started using the I-pad a few weeks ago, she’s used it for a year. So to my point, I read a post a few years ago about a guy who suffered from DDJ. He said all the signs of a cheating spouse were there and he was convinced his SO was cheating on him. Then for some reason he realized it was him and he explained it in great detail. I keep looking for the post but can’t find it. Also, I’d really like to hear from anyone who had a situation like mine above where something similar happened and the results turned out innocent. I know I suffer from DDJ but I can’t over look this. Thanks"

"Delusions of the Past Hi all, I'm new here but wanted to share some of my story perhaps with individuals of a similar thread. I haven't been ""officially diagnosed"" with delusional disorder but I believe strongly that I have it. My official Dx is mood disorder but I don't think that sums up what I went through at all, even if there were some aspects of a bipolar nature there. Summary of my issues: Symptoms: 1) Delusions of reference - everybody was talking at or to me in indirect ways for purposes unkown 2) Delusions of Surveillance - Specific people are watching me from a distance, using satellite technology and infrared imaging devices from afar. Along with complete audio recording of my every move. 3) Erotomanic delusion - 'deeply in love' with a girl I barely knew, and she was secretly in love with me 4)Suspicion of almost every person - that they were involved in a conspiracy to get me to act a certain way 5) Erratic mood swings - deep depression to hypermanic states, laughing for no good reason 6) Extreme loss of self constitution - I felt I was a broken personality and had to rebuild and reshape myself every day. 7) Hyper-sexuality Extreme anxiety due to paranoia 9) Talking to self whenever alone, thinking that I was talking also to the people that were recording me These all lasted in one way or another for approximately 4 years. It was not until my Psychiatrist prescribed the right medication and I found a new therapist that these started to wane and now they are all but eradicated. However, I still find myself looking back and obsessing over things. After all, if I don't know myself truly what good is anything -Grandcyan"

"Delusions of the Past Hi Grandcyan11, Welcome to psychforums, I hope you find this place as supportive and helpful as I have over the years. Diagnosis in mental health are less important than you'd think, as long as you find an effective medication that reduces or resolves symptoms, therapy, support, and positive coping strategies... I think that is the part that is important. At this point in my history being ""diagnosed"" with mental illness, they have changed the diagnosis to include every diagnosis in the family. Bottom line___ These doctors are using symptoms to define the illness rather than finding the REAL cause and DIAGNOSING the way medicine should work. *Even the NIH has realized their use of the DSM in mental health research is wasteful... Basically, for decades physicians have labeled symptoms - for billing purposes, and then treating mental illness using broad categories rather than finding the biological, social history, or environmental source of the illness. I understand mental illness is complicated, but generations of people have been labeled and basically dismissed by this. Society gave up on trying to understand what was happening biologically because of this society's acceptance of the APA's flawed labeling system that doesn't have a valid scientific meaning based in biology. Think of Susannah Cahalan in her book Brain on Fire where her parents didn't give up on finding a reason for her illness - her disease was cured. For the rest of us, as we fumble through the mental health system, the doctors use diagnosis to experiment on us with categories of drug classes until they hopefully find a medication that works. I mean, I guess the mood stabilizers are important for mood elements, and the anti-psychotics for psychosis, the anti-depressants for depression, etc... you get my point. Honestly, I'm glad my diagnosis of severe mental illness was delayed with less severe sounding illnesses like you describe being used in my early days... like postpartum depression, delusional disorder, or psychosis with possible mood elements. I know it's hard to feel the weight of stigma from a mood illness when you feel more affinity to the delusional portions. I totally understand. I will say, on the positive side, the mood disorder support groups I've attended are more fun. Thankfully with medication, therapy, and a wonderful network of supportive individuals in my life, I do well. I've been in recovery for over a decade.

"Delusions of the Past Hi , i read your posts and they have given me real hopes . My boyfriend is going through exactly what you went through. Its a nightmare . Its been just 4 months . You took 4 years . Some take forever . I have realized by now its a long long way to go . Unless my boyfriend makes up his mind to never talk to me like hes been doing almost everyday for the last 4 months and actually does it . So heres my story , we're 19 and have known each other for more than 6 years now and have been in a relationship for almost 3 years . It started with him accusing me of having an affair with all his friends . He accused me with them one at a time . And then when he couldn't find any proof he jumped to the conclusion that i along with his family and all his close friends are talking behind his back and are planning something for him or against him . Its a nightmare of constant accusations and questioning. There are days where i feel like lying to him and telling yes there is something and make up a fake story and end this! But i know thats not the right thing to do and will just worsen things. The main problem in my situation is ... His friends talking about things to him which sometime coincide with something he has told me in private . For example , he told me about a weird dream he had with me and person . A in it around 2 months ago .. a few days ago his friend told him about him having a weird dream about person A .. person A and my boyfriends friend are friends . The blame is all on me now. I told his friend about the dream and now his friend is trying to tease him . There have been quite a few instances like these which can be mere coincidences which have completely strengthened his belief that weve been conspiring against him . I really love him and i know he loves me equally . All the important people in his life are the villans right now and since im the most important person to him . Im his main target to get to know the ""truth"" . He thinks breaking up with me will be the best way out since hell have the toxic person out of his life and him not being with me will be punishment enough for me. He breaks up and then comes back asking the same question to tell me the truth . And when i tell him what bes thinking is wrong he gets aggressive and leaves again . I dont know what to do ! I dont understand what im being punished for . Its very difficult to see him like that. He says im the only one who can calm him down and make him happy . I go to him everytime he needs me because i love him and that is why i cant leave him in this difficult time of his life . But again he thinks im taking all of the suffering because im guilty . He has been to several psychologists and psychiatrists but there has been no change in his thinking. He thought they were involved in the conspiracy too . He saw one recently on his own so that he could make sure hes legit. He doesnt want to tell me about how it went. But since his thinking hasnt changed im sure it was ineffective . I dont want to involve my parents in this situation and from whatever little they know they want me to stay away from him . It gets really difficult at home too . Im swinging between my mother and boyfriend. I just need an answer to the question ' what do i do now'? He's been on some medication which calms him a little and helps him sleep . But the delusions are still strong as ever . Could you please tell me from the point of view of the person with the delusions what would you have liked to hear and treated when you were ill. What medication helped you ? And do the delusions really go away? For does medication and treatment just stop it from happening further . Please help."
"Paranoid about Encryption to the point of suicide *TW* Hello all..... I am a fan of encryption tools that are apparently monitored by various government agencies. I am very very very very worried I am going to be labeled as a terrorist and killed due to this. I have never ever done anything remotely illegal and I love this country very much and am a proud American, and I use these tools for safety and security and privacy while online. When I say ""encryption tools"", I am talking about more ""extreme"" measures such as using tor and tails and truecrypt and pgp, all of which there are rumors going around that the government thinks anyone who uses these is a terrorist. I am not, and as I said, I am a very very proud American and I despise terrorism! Now onto how this affects me. A few weeks ago, I almost *mod edit* due to psychotic episodes I have been having. One was so real, I heard someone talking (while awake) about me and how I should be hunted down and killed for using these tools. It has only gotten worse, to the point that I am convinced random people in the store are FBI agents coming after me and I see people where there are none. And the worst part is, they seem so real. I cannot function properly in my daily life because I experience these psychotic episodes and spend nearly every waking moment freaking out about being interrogated at airports and being stalked. I am in circumstances where it would not be favorable for me to go to a psychiatrist and talk about this, because I would be viewed as insane and off my rocker. As a note, I am not interested in stopping the use of the tools, as they make me feel like i have privacy online. I want to live in peace and in harmony with nature, my community, my country, and my government. As of right now, I am not using any drugs that would cause this kind of paranoia. Please, I need help. I want to be a happy American. I am loyal to my country and want to be treated as such. Last edited by seabreezeblue on Fri Jan 19, 2018 11:41 pm, edited 2 times in total.

"Destiny Let me give you a little backstory before I start this. Destiny is one of my friends on a website called *mod edit*. She attempted to kill herself while I was on break from school and she's back now, but I started hearing her as one of the voices in my head. This isn't the first voice I've ever heard, I've heard several with the main two being Reaper (my very first voice) and Annie. She says things like ""please let me kill myself"" and tries to comfort me when I'm hurting. Honestly, I'm scared. I'm currently on a medication for hearing voices, but I'm not sure what my disorder is (currently considering shared psychosis) and it's not helping at all. Does anyone know what I should do or anything that could help me? Last edited by lilyfairy on Sun Jan 07, 2018 11:14 am, edited 1 time in total. Reason: Name removed for privacy"
"unsure if i'm hearing voices etc i'm not sure where to post this so i'm sorry if it's misplaced- but my issue is that i think i'm hearing voices, and my symptoms of paranoia have been increasing. i also think i see weird things out of the corner of my eyes like small hallucinations... for example i'll see smoke or think something is melting/dripping briefly. anyways. i find when i'm working at my job or focused on drawing it's like i'm hearing other people have a conversation in my head? i don't really hear what they're saying because i'm not paying attention. i don't remember if this was last night or the night before, but i was laying in bed trying to go to sleep when those background conversations started up, but this time i could hear a bit better and i got a little freaked out and then it sounded more like they were talking to me, and saying ""you can hear us now"" over and over and it got a bit louder as it went on, until it just stopped or i fell asleep. but i'm not sure if i was imaging it or something? it's like my brain is messing with me. plus! i completely forgot about that happening until now because i don't regularly hear voices and haven't had anything happen since that. it's starting to sound really crazy now that i wrote it down and i'm a lot more freaked out than when it happened. wow. ok some advice would be great! i'm going to call my psychiatrist but i'm really scared to tell him this. i have major problems actually talking to him because he's a ""here's your meds your brain is fixed now bye!"" kind of guy even when i bring up other concerns like having confusing disturbing nightmares that i can't determine if they're real memories or not after. if that makes sense ugh i've had a long day, i'm sorry this is a mess. thank you for reading"
"unsure if i'm hearing voices etc can anyone relate to this experience or confirm if i am really hearing voices? my psych is out all month i'm getting desperate sludge • 21 • male • queer • autistic Dx: major depressive disorder, anxiety, OCD, [???] Rx: 150mg venlafaxine; 50mg quetiapine"
"unsure if i'm hearing voices etc Is this a regular occurance or isolated to only several incidents? This happened to me once several months ago but I was incredibly sleeped deprived and felt conscious in this sort of trance. While I'm sure I falsely labeled it a trance, the hallucinatory experiences never occurred again. I saw you mentioned about falling asleep so it seems fair to ask if you're getting enough sleep?"
"unsure if i'm hearing voices etc i take a small dose of quetiapine every night to ensure i sleep at least 6 hours because without it i'm basically an insomniac. my hallucinations happen during the day too i also hear music playing in the distance, people calling my name from far away... those are external while the stuff i posted about first has been internal. i also seem to be talking to myself internally and referring to myself as ""we"" like ""we'll do this"", kind of like i'm being instructed. sometimes it just feels like me doing it and sometimes i'm not so sure EDIT: sorry forgot to answer the other part, what happened in my first post is new but i have these sorrys of hallucinations and stuff regularly for a while now but it didn't use to be this bad sludge • 21 • male • queer • autistic Dx: major depressive disorder, anxiety, OCD, [???] Rx: 150mg venlafaxine; 50mg quetiapine"
"unsure if i'm hearing voices etc I have voices in my head as well and it's sort of coming to a realisation that I might have a form of dissociative identity disorder...theres another one which is osdd-1. (yes multiple personality disorder, renamed.) maybe look into that. back when I started having mini hallucinations (shadows out the corner of my eye sort of thing) my therapist had me start on vitamins (I am against medication) she had me take b complex and amino 3-6-9s. I stopped hallucinating but the voices are still there. the biggest question with the voices is, do you hear them inside your head, (if this, DID symptoms may be something to look into) or do you hear them outside your ears (this is more characteristic of psychosis. I think. I'm no expert though)"
"unsure if i'm hearing voices etc Sorry to hear you're going through this. I also go through periods of where I hear voices, but they sound like whisper and most of the time it's kind of hard to tell what they're saying. The reason I know they are just voices in my head is because they say really strange things like, ""We're gonna kill them"", and they keep saying things like ""He's nervous"", all the time. It made me even believe I was under some sort of investigation and someone was watching me. I have done a lot of Crystal Meth in my past, and I have a friend who also experiences meth psychosis, which can last for some time. So after much hardship, and feeling nervous and paranoid, I finally came to the conclusion that I'm suffering from meth psychosis. It's such a difficult thing to deal with, because you start believing some of what you hear. I just know that it's in my head because I'm not a criminal nor have I ever done anything where I would need to be under an investigation. Suffering from psychosis is a very scary thing and very complex, like sometimes I don't hear them everywhere, but after hearing it so much at my house, I started hearing it elsewhere. But I recently changed my meds around (Risperdal > Trilafon, Klonopin, Lexapro & Hydroxyzine), and that is helping me deal with all the symptoms of anxiety, depression, meth psychosis and stuff... Just hang in there, and try different meds and see what works for you, 1 med doesn't work all across teh board, remember that. Find what works for you."
"Husband with Persecutory Delusional Disorder, can you help? Hello all, I was wondering if any of you can help me out. my husband is NOT diagnosed and won't entertain the idea of going to a doctor either. His symptoms are similar to rest of Persecutory DD but it seems it comes and goes and it is not that extreme as other described. Basically main things are he believes THEY are after him and there are cameras with audio everywhere in our apartment, cars, phones, etc. He thinks THEY are at his job and he is being taunted everyday by everyone. He believes there are live streams of our lives and we are filmed being intimate, taking showers, etc. He can go weeks without even mentioning it and then all of the sudden he will talk about this for few days. It really gets him depressed and causes anxiety. At one point he was questioning me thinking I am part of this but that passed. As of right now he only trusts me. He thinks his parents and my parents are part of this surveillance and he is stuck. He believes he can't get a better job because new job will know immediately that he is being filmed etc. Recently he is focused on how this is unfair to me and that I shouldn't be married to him anymore and his best bet is to move out and live in his car to ""protect me"". At first I believed him (it started mild, about 2 years ago) and tried to find solutions with him. Scanned and upgraded our phones, scanned laptop, etc. Then we looked for cameras everywhere but he thinks they are some military cameras so they are tiny and we won't find them anyway. I brought up a topic of Delusional Disorder and seeing a doctor. He got really angry at me and said that he is very disappointed that I don't trust him. He is 100% sure this is real and he said that THEY want him to go to doctor so he can be labeled as ""crazy"". He used to go to therapist for his depression and anxiety (that is gone.. I think) but he wouldn't ever open up about this spying issue because he was convinced that THEY are also at his therapist and he did not feel safe. We are young, he just turned 30 and I am few years younger. We don't have lots of money to keep going to different doctors. I am devastated because I keep hoping it will go away but it didn't and I don't think I will. I have been looking at this forum for months now but today on the phone he said something new. He said that this will blow up once THEY are done with him and something horrible will happen. I am worried what he means by it and that he will talk himself into doing something stupid. Please help me, any advice?"
"Husband with Persecutory Delusional Disorder, can you help? I'm experiencing something very similar to this with my husband. Sometimes he doesn't seem so bad but then I think it's just because he doesn't want to tell me what he's thinking, other times he's very vocal and occasionally accuses me of being in on it.Something's aren't as bad as I read on this forum, but I still find it all quite overwhelming and am now reading as much as I can to try and understand what's going on and the best ways I can respond that will actually help him. It's tough going though eh?"

"Reoccurring jealous delusions held So I am a new member here, I came after searching ""my girlfriend is delusional"", and a thread here came up. I am just looking for any possible insight to what I am dealing with, and though this forum doesn't seem very active I think worst case I get to unload a little bit. It's not something I am really able to talk to anyone in my life about. So I have been in a long distance relationship with a girl I met online for about a year now, and she has told me that this Christmas will be our last time seeing eachother. The main delusion she seems to have is that I am stalking one of her former friends on instagram. This one was probably the first red flag that came up, and has continued to be the most persistent and damaging idea that she holds regarding me. There is some girl who was at one point her friend on instagram, who for some reason I don't understand my girlfriend despises now. My gf believes that I am obsessed with this girl and thinks that I am spending all day looking at this girl's pictures. The truth is I never have looked once, not out of respect for my gf even, I honestly don't care about social media at all. It isn't really my thing. I'm not going to become infatuated with anyone on social media as far as I'm concerned, for it even to be possible I would have to know them. So I will spend hours arguing in my own defense over this, asking why she thinks this, and she will say that the things that me and this random girl tend to talk about and specific words we use are too similar to be coincidence. Like I have had her turn on me for using the word ""good"". My gf says she knows when someone is lying to her, and that she ""knows what I'm up to"". Sometimes she will just say that, that she knows what I'm doing, and refuse to elaborate. There are other times where she will be insecure and weirdly jealous, like when we are out she will get upset any time I appear to look at a woman, assume the worst, and think I only look at other women because I am not into her. To me that seems like normal jealousy though, because there is at least a grain of truth there in that I do look at other women. The main thing that seems to prevent her from trusting me though, and the thing that she has broken up with me several times over, is this delusion where I am stalking this random girl on instagram. Like at best I will be able to get her to table it, and admit that she feasibly could be wrong only because there is no evidence, but that never lasts and that partial admission never makes me feel any better. Before long she is 100% certain of it again and expects a confession, insists that I am a liar, and says that if I would confess we could work it out. I was planning to move to another country to be with this girl, and honestly nobody has ever made me feel happy and satisfied in my life like she does. After reading some accounts here I am really starting to believe that things are extremely unlikely to work, and it would be better if I cut ties. I think that some of this is relatively moderate, and we often just write it off to stress from being apart so often, but more and more I think that things will only get worse for us. I just wish I could help and am extremely frustrated, but it doesn't seem like there is anything I can do, and I can never realistically expect her to have trust in me. I feel like I am abandoning her, even though she is the one who keeps breaking up with me, but I don't know what else to do."
"Reoccurring jealous delusions held I hope you both go to counseling before you move in together. These things tend to just get worse over time. My husband is delusional and I can barely leave the house. If I had known before, I would have insisted on him getting treatment before we married."
"Painful delusional thoughts I dont really know where to put this post but for the past 4 months I've been suffering from delusional/irrational thoughts and feelings. IN SHORT: I FEEL LIKE WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE IN AUGUST AND FEEL LIKE JUST A MINOR PART OF MYSELF STILL LIVES. LONG VERSION: r/SuicideWatch Finally lost my ability to think rationally u/Nadosa Hi, so basically what I was going through this year was just insane. First half Derealization/Depersonalization, second half Depression/OCD but feels like psychotic, because everything seems so surreal. I was diagnosed with OCD and adjustment disorder btw. OCD and not psychosis because I know those feelings and thoughts are somewhat strange. So basically I recovered from Depersonalization this year...but as the symptoms slowly vanished, I still battled irrational thoughts from day to day when suddenly my mind switched to: ur life is over. I was overwhelmed, suddenly paranoid of time/the date, feeling like I shouldnt be here anymore as the time went on and feeling like trapped in this concept of time. This feeling...it feels like I shouldnt be alive anymore since August, like I shouldnt have lived past August and should be dead until August. It just feels like it is wrong to be alive, when I go to the hairdresser for example, my mind goes like this: You are dead inside, you died, you dont need to do this, you are trapped in hell, you shouldve killed yourself as I told you! When I look in the mirror: ""Why are u still alive?"" It just cant make sense why I am still alive, and I am super overwhelmed, feeling insane, because I know something IS TERRIBLY WRONG IN MY ORGANISM. You may ask yourself why ""August""? I dont know, I somehow wanted to be recovered and fine from mental health issues until August, I didnt know what would happen if I didnt recover until then, but my mind has adapted to my expectations and as the time went on without me recovering, my mind realized that and switched to this surreal psychotic limbo mode, so basically I guess false expectations triggered this mess in my mind. I remembered when these thoughts sneaked in in the last week of July, I felt like after this week I would pass like a strange ""threshold"", like my old self had to die (idk it felt so strange, I just got very depressed, nervous and obsessed with the future and thought if I couldnt cope I may commit suicide, but I wasnt suicidal) It felt like life after July was just black, I didnt want the future to come and felt like I was involuntarily pushed to experience this future pain, but then there was the 1st of August where I had these painful thoughts that I cant live anymore and got anxious. And this whole ""anticipation"" made me BELIEVE that this is destiny and I cant recover from it! Furthermore I told my psychiatrist that I feared that I'll lose myself in time, which I know sounds strange but I definitely felt like there would be no future for me and honestly I keep questioning how I survived the last months, making me feel like I shouldnt be alive because the feelings were so surreal. I cant stop thinking that this $#%^ is something supernatural and keep questioning if people had already commited suicide if they would have been in my shoes, what freaks me even more out. But I have no clue how to get out of that hole at all. I am depressed and scared to death. I dont know, this is just a nightmare and I am 19. Everytime I think about me as a person, I get a feeling of doom: who is ""I', why am I still alive? Etc. It is terrifying. Unknown mental illness?!"
"Old delusions surfacing Anyone ever had the experience of being recovered from psychosis but the delusions can randomly pop up again? I was in the store, and all of a sudden it hit me: We're in the matrix. I started analyzing people's movements, gatheting data from it and classifying it as ""controlled"", they'd either walk in. curves or walk straight as if it's been coded into their brains to do so. Everyone I looked at looked as if they were being controlled, even the facial expressions. Eventually I was walking around, succumbing to the thought of ""I'm currently being controlled"". I knew something was off and my brain kept going in circles, total derailment of my train of thought. I eventually quit thinking and at that point I was just ""letting my controller control me"". Weird thing was, I wasn't having a panic attack. I have MDD with delusions and paranoia. Anyone else able to relate?"
"Over and out. If you're going to disregard the eye then know what you're saying. Don't assume nobody is watching just live honestly watching yourself through your own-self. You need to know yourself and open your own eyes to what your looking into others for. If your going to have faith then know where it lies and the direction to which you're hoping it will take you. If you're going to speak up know what you're saying and watch your words and understand why you're saying it.

"Emotional ""crossing?"" Though, admittedly, I am not sure if this subject belongs in this forum but it seems to fit better than any other that I can find. The word ""Delusional"" seems appropriate. I'd like to start by saying 'thank you,' for taking the time to read this. It is something that I find particularly bothersome and, as best I can tell, has be present for most of my life. The ""mixing"" came as a sudden realization, a few days ago, after getting off work. I have been following an exercise, in which, I contemplate my life as if writing an autobiography in my head. Though, I cannot say exactly what I am looking for, it does often bring to light both positive and negative aspects of my life that I may have forgotten. One such aspect stuck out to me this time. The emotions that I associate with love are identical to those I associate with death. It's a strong feeling, hard to exactly put into words honestly. In dreams, fantasies, and past romantic experiences I have felt a warm peace. A strong vulnerability tied with acceptance and bliss. For me, this is happiness, near euphoria. But, while I've known this feeling for quite some time it has only recently occurred to me that fantasies and dreams of myself dying bring about the exact same response. The feelings couldn't possible be more similar. I feel it necessary to say that I do not believe that I am depressed, in any way. Though I have ups and downs in life, like most do, I am a relatively content person. I have decent goals and ensure that I further myself towards them. The concept fascinates me, and I would very much like to learn more about the phenomenon. The ""mixing"" occurs with several other emotions, that I feel that I should feel in certain circumstances, but non as prevalent as this. I have read about emotional confusion, though it seems hard to find any legitimate literature on this in particular. If anyone has any light to shed on this situation, or has any information that might help me further understand it please share. I am more than happy to answer any questions that may help as well."
"Invisibility?? I'm pretty certain that I don't exist, even though I know that physically I'm here, because I can break a bone and it will hurt, but people don't see me sometimes. And i start freaking out in my head. And I don't know if this counts as psychosis or dissociation or whatever but all I know is that as soon as I realize people don't see me, I start to exist even less and I forget if I exist or not. And more than anything this makes me paralyzed with fear and uncertainty. I have felt this for since I was about 15 and started dealing with depression, anxiety, ADD, and whatever other labels they put on me. I am now 19. Does anyone feel literally invisible? Is this normal?I don't even know if I should post this because I don't want no one to answer and then I find out I'm not real, but I also don't want scary answers. I don't know. I'm just so afraid. -Mo"
"Invisibility?? That's definitely not normal. You're not invisible, and you do exist. Think about all the memories you have had with people who know you exist. If you are seeing a therapist or a med management doctor, if would be best to mention this to them. If not, then you should start seeing one. It's not worth it."
"???? I don't think this counts as delusional, but... So. Sometimes I feel like there's a giant word written across my head with a sharpie or that my jacket collar hangs too low, or something stupid like that. I constantly ask to go to the bathroom because my hair feels messed up or my nose feels runny. I feel really self-conscious all the time. Is there an identification/syndrome name for this? Edit: I looked it up and I found Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) and social anxiety, both of which I am sure that I have, but is there a more specified syndrome?"
"I imagine people and talk to them continuously I don't know when it first started but for as long as I can remember I have talked to people ""inside my head"", so to speak. When I was in elementary school I would often imagine people I liked, maybe boys I had crushes on etc. Whenever I was alone home or just wherever I would imagine them being with me and had conversations with them. As I grew older the people I would imagine often changed, and so did the circumstances. I would talk out loud, maybe a loud whisper when I talked to Them. When I was in middle school I started imagining idols and people I looked up to or just thought that had really fun personalities. The people I talked with didn't even know I existed but in the situations I created we were often best friends or living together etc. I'm now 17 and I still do this, but lately I have been more and more aware of it. Another thing that worries me is that my thoughts tend to get mixed with reality and well - Them. They are with me constantly, even when I talk out loud to communicate with them or not. Even when I'm watching netflix or youtube or whatever and not really focusing on anything else - for me they're still there, reading a book or maybe watching with me. If I'm having a conversation with someone (that actually exist) I sometimes blurt out something weird that has nothing to do with the context of the conversation we're having at all. For example - some time ago I was on a cabin trip with my (now ex) boyfriend, and we were under the covers of a bed talking about how hot the room was. And as he commented the heat I simply answered ""But shouldn't it be cold in LA by now?"". I live in Norway and have never had anything to do with LA whatsoever. I said this without even thinking cause in my mind I was currently on a trip to LA with the people I usually tend to imagine - this was how I imagined the whole cabin trip. Normally people just brush it off and laugh or give me weird grimaces whenever this happens, cause I'm known to be quite the clumsy, outgoing person. When this first happened I didn't give it much thought, but now it kind of worries me. The situations I imagine now are often played out in the future, or at least a different now. I'm good friends with this group of idols I keep imagining since April now, and since I'm known to a certain degree, I'm often at interviews making people laugh etc. It sounds really weird and I tend not to think too much about the situations when I'm aware. Personally I don't think it's unhealthy or whatever, I love communicating with them and being with them makes me happy. If anything, I'm quite happy about it, considering I'm always looking forward to being with them and so on. I'm not antisocial or anything, and have too many friends for my own good, so it's not influencing my social life. If I'm invited to a party or a cabin trip or whatever, I always imagine it being them who invited me and that's what I'll be looking forward to too. I don't really consult anyone at all about my personal issues or well, anything. In all my (soon) 17 years of life I have only opened up this last month. I talked to two of my friends about two different issues. One being my childhood and the other one this issue about the people in my head. The friend I consulted about the people and the situations I imagine said I should go see someone just in case this was something unhealthy which should be dealt with. She knows about my childhood, and said that it might have something to do with that. I am unsure if this has anything to do with my ""issue"" or not, but I'll explain it just in case. When I was younger I used to get beaten and scolded a lot by my parents. As i grew older the abuse would decrease. Recently my parents divorced and now I only live with my mother. We have a really good relationship and I'm happy. I'm often left alone a lot at home, though. My mom is often at work or with her boyfriend, and my older sister usually stays at her boyfriend's apartment. When it comes to my mental health I'm usually happy but have periods where I'm seriously depressed. I've been diagnosed with winter depression so it's often that time of the year its worst. So I guess that was the most of it. I could consult a psychiatrist in my city but I'm just so unsure if I need to or not. So if you have any knowledge or experience about this or something similar, maybe even just some advice - please help me!"
"I imagine people and talk to them continuously No reason to be ashamed I've been there. mostly people I know. In their voice obviously. Got so bad I was not exactly being myself at times. I guess just ask why we need to talk to them in our head. These days I've sort of tuned that out, I still have persecutory delusions however but as far as voices go I don't imagine what could be said from myself or others in some given setting. You kind of have to laugh and ask yourself ""how does any of this add up to a plausible scenario lol"". As far as the persecutory delusions that are more plausible, people may genuinely unlike me for reasons I can't even blame them for but let's not strike up a conversation of how a conversation could go down. Now as far as the wanting them to be the one to invite you to a cabin trip I think you mentioned. I think their's something to be read into about that as well that I can't really pinpoint. Maybe you feel that's how you'd feel a sense of inclusion that you feels is lacking. To a good degree that could be part of the issue why you're carrying on these sorts of conversations with others in your head."
"I imagine people and talk to them continuously I also have these same exact things that you described, esp finally in my car when I’m all alone is when it heightens, I did not know this was a disorder , wow. I honestly feel a little scared with everything, PCs, depression, anxiety, and now this... I dunno what to do ."
"I imagine people and talk to them continuously Don't worry I do this too, it's normal (i.e. not it's not a sign of any illness), although it's a bit quirky and will likely seem a bit odd to casual bystanders so it's probably best to just do it when you're alone for the most part. Dunno about you, but if you are anywhere on the autism spectrum this is even more normal; not saying you are, but I am (mild/high-functioning case), and I've always done this. Two terms that come to mind athe ""fantasy"" defense mechanism, and maladaptive daydreaming, but basically, all you're doing is using your imagination as a substitute for human interactions . Do you have many friends in real life? If you don't it would explain this even more, I mean if you're alone most of the time and rarely talk to people it's pretty much a given that you'll eventually have to figure out a way to starve off loneliness and boredom. Honestly nobody talks about this but I'm sure most people do this to a degree, show me a person who hasn't ever dreamt about an ideal relationship or friendship and I'll show you a dozen more who have. You likely just do it more than others, you know, living in your head and all that. It's not delusional disorder, it's just living in a fantasy world, nothing wrong with that unless it impacts your life severely. If you mean you sort of recall a memory, and then sort of talk to it though your internal monologue, then yep I do the same.

(possible psychotic traits/undiagnosed, or trauma/anxiety(?)"
"I imagine people and talk to them continuously This sounds like maladaptive daydreaming to me, which is something I do frequently, and I've done it since I can remember, I'm now 26. I have a history of abuse and neglect in childhood, and abuse in adulthood as well. Like Ubinix800 said, for me personally, loneliness and detachment are major influences for how often and how intensely I engage in this. I've heard it's a form of dissociation. When I was younger, in my teenage years, I had such a rich imaginary life, that I would list important dates of my imagined friends I had relationships with and I would also draw the house I imagined I lived in, places I went, etc. On a couple of occasions, I contacted the actual real people (like celebrities) I had imaginary friendships with, imagining that we had such a bond that they would contact me back and this would begin the real friendship and save me from my current situation. Recently, I had to make a point of being more mindful throughout the day, because I had been escaping my entire life through this daydreaming. I was irritated when anyone interrupted my time with my imagined world and could not accomplish anything. I think if it gets to that point, it can be unhealthy. But, if you're functioning well, still care for your other relationships, self care, and any responsibilities that you may have, then I think it's completely ok. Maybe explore if you believe it is an escape for you. If it is, then what are you escaping from? “The best way to escape reality without running, is smiling even though, it is obviously fake.” Devil’s Little Sister"
"Why am I so tired? It was already very crippling when I couldn't sleep before 2 to 5 am a few years ago, but now I'm sleeping 12 to 14 hours a day. I wanted to look for jobs (more work than I'm doing already) but now it's like I'm hardly alive. At first medicine made me less tired. Now I don't know what it is. I have tried taking less pills but it's still a high dosis. Does anyone recognise sleeping this much? Dx: schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, dependent personality disorder"
"I have something I need to get out!!! Hi, I am an 18 yr old man, I have been diagnosed w/ a mild case of psychosis, although I really think I just need to adjust my thinking in order to resolve it... That said I have become convinced that I am affecting the world's population with my actions, and I feel a very strong need to say something about it...I feel like saying this to everyone. If you care, if you want to help in any way, then please read all of it... Everyone in this world, on this planet earth, especially in America, please listen to my words... I have, truthfully, become very, very, VERY stressed over all of this in the past few months. And I can tell other people felt that way, too... It isn't what I want. I'm gonna say exactly what I WANT, not what im feeling, not the anger or sadness that that I feel, not something crazy. I want people to disregard my past words and actions. I don't like vulgar, greedy, or arrogant people, as a matter of fact, those traits are without a doubt, 3 of the most disgusting traits on the Earth. The opposite are some of the best... empathetic, not greedy, clean in their actions and their hearts, open to others' perspectives. People with those traits are already pretty good, worth while, model people. In addition, people who do hard work, solve problems instead of creating problems, and don't cause trouble for other people, are very deserving of respect; I will always value those traits in others, appreciate them, and feel respect for the people with those characteristics. People who make trouble for no reason are always sad, weak people, who can't achieve much in life. This world NEEDS more of the good traits. On that same point, if anybody feels hatred, sadness, even happiness or anything else towards me because of my actions ""influencing your lives"" emotionally or psychologically, then STOP. just STOP, really. Just stop-- don't feel this way. You shouldn't be concerned with me, or any of this, really; Focus on useful information in life, critical thinking, working hard towards achieving your goals, and being happy. Everybody has a right to happiness--especially the good people in the world. And the evil people--- the ones who are detrimental to society, who care only about themselves, who don't care about the suffering of others, who hold bad traits such as vulgarity, arrogance, greed, who hold hatred, anger, or violence--- people like that will be incredibly unhappy. People even SIMILAR to that will find only depression, and ultimate failure. The one's who act deceptive, use others, try to make the world worse, those people are the most worthless, and they will definitely falter, fall, fail, until they change. People who worsen other's lives, will suffer from sadness. And the ones who know they are bad people, but choose not to change, or are proud---they will never find happiness or satisfaction, or true success. They will suffer and fall even harder. The good people-- who desire to solve our problems, help others, love peace, the people that, really want to do what's right, they will be the most motivated, the most passionate, the most successful, and the happiest. And that's because they deserve success. That's what I want, that's what I believe! Racism is evil, and I believe black people and those who receive prejudice should portray themselves in a better way and convey themselves in a positive way. That's very important in my belief, and there are singers these days that flaunt their vulgarity, their wannabe ""toughness"", their gross lifestyles and basically spread their unlikable personalities. People who represent themselves in a bad way have affected views towards their entire ethnic group, and those people need to stop. Show you're good qualities, your human qualities, your kind qualities. And people will respect those things. The weird things that people show interest in today are truly sad... People talking about porn and drugs as if they are normal things just disturbs me...I find it disgusting. How can some people be so gross? Pot, is not too terrible; It helps some people, and relaxes. But drug use overall is bad and so is marijuana. The media today would be much, much more entertaining if they didn't display those things and almost flaunt them as often as they do. I think it's sad, and those kinds of things are detrimental to society. People please respect the taboo things in our society, some things are not meant to change. I want the good people in the world to succeed -- I always have. DON'T misconstrue my feelings. For the past month I've tried ""following my heart"" but it's turned out to be somewhat similar to just doing what I feel. I feel anger and frustation at times, but I don't wish for others to actually hurt. Please, don't misunderstand my feelings, instead, LISTEN TO MY WORDS!!! I have said many things this past year, but 99% have just been emotions that I feel, meaning little and not conveying my thoughts at all. Emotions are fleeting but beliefs are more permanent. I believe those who want goodness to win, people who don't hold anger or violence in their hearts, who respect hard work and always consider the lives and emotions of other people, who try to do what's best in any situation, the people who hold any one or more of these traits; I want to see more people like that in the media, I want to see those kinds of values succeeding in the world. I want the people who have standards like those to value them, and find motivation, find happiness, find strength, and success, so they can rise higher in the world. THAT'S something I want---for the people who WANT to the do the right thing, to SUCCEED! To get what they need. To solve their problems, and win at life. I desire that more than almost everything else in life--- for those people to succeed greatly in the world. And it makes me depressed to see the opposite---to see good-for-nothing, problem causing, conflict creating trashy people winning; it's one of the worst things to see, truthfully. Motivation and happiness--- if the good individuals in the world have more it makes me feel a lot better. I love to see those people succeed. Thanks for listening. I see people today, and in the past I've thought that the people today don't feel as much, or are more cold hearted than before, or don't feel as much happiness or depth in their feelings. But I know now that that isn't true. I know there is just as much depth to the hearts of good people as there is in mine. There is great happiness in their hearts, with real meaning and persistence. There's a ton of fight left in good people's hearts, I know. And I know that people feel the same emotions that they always have, and just as strongly---happiness, peace, relaxation, satisfaction, and all the rest. That's the way it should always be; I would not have it any other way. The depth in their hearts is immense. And with that, I'm done. I felt the need to say these things to, well, everyone--- and there's more I want to say but it's too much for just this forum. Some things I say, they appear to go against the things that I stood for in the past. People misconstrued my messages in the past, while I did not speak in a clear way. These words are crystal clear; they are my true beliefs, the standards that I hold, the same beliefs I held a year ago, years ago, possibly my entire life. I have always felt the same but haven't been able to communicate it as well in the past... Now, please, listen to the words I said here. It's the truth."
"I have something I need to get out!!! Very well said! How refreshing to hear such positive and uplifting words, words that I truly needed to hear, especially now. You see, I'm currently a victim of a bad person who has no conscience, no empathy, no remorse for all the pain he causes me and others he manipulates in order to exploit their kindness. I've been trying to break free from this individual for several years now, with no success. But when I read your words when you say ""I want the people who have standards like those to value them, and find motivation, find happiness, find strength, and success, so they can rise higher in the world"" it gives me strength and hope to go on, and to persevere against the evil that has been slowly killing me day by day. Your words are healing and empowering, and I appreciate you for sharing your positive message here. I could not agree with you more about the state of the world. You are so right about what will happen to those who cause pain and suffering, they will never be happy and are only hurting themselves as well. I thought if I were loving, caring, empathetic, and accepting of this person that they would learn to appreciate those things and would start to change...but it was only wishful thinking on my part. They cannot feel what I feel. They cannot see what I see. They accuse me of having an 'agenda' and twist my words around to mean something bad when I am truly wanting only the best for them and everyone. I found out it is called ""projecting"" in that he is projecting his negative traits onto me. In reality, he schemes against everyone and always has a hidden agenda to take what he wants from them when he wants it with no regard for anyone else. It's really sad. I feel bad for him. All the same, I cannot allow him to use me anymore. I can't heal him, so I must leave him before he succeeds in killing my soul. You are very insightful and are a good person! Don't worry that they say you have some kind of psychosis, you are not bad, and you have helped me tonight and many others who read your thoughtful words! Thank you so very much, I wish you all the love, success, peace and happiness that you deserve! p.s. I think you should write books, then you can share your message with a much wider audience!"
"I have something I need to get out!!! I just wanted to post an update: I DID finally get FREE of my abuser and am now happier than ever! I never thought I could get over him, it was so painful at first! How I succeeded in getting over him was to block him from all possible contact; moved to another state; gave myself plenty of time to rest, exercise, sleep, meditate, etc.; read all kinds of self help books; took lots of nature walks; and started to hang out with good people who were positive and helpful. Such a huge difference! Now I could not care less about him! (I used to feel like I'd die without him) I am sharing this so that anyone who is still stuck and wondering how it feels to be free....IT FEELS AMAZING!!! It's true what they say about starting over: colors seem brighter, food tastes better, life seems rich and full of possibilities! Don't waste one more precious moment on abusive people. They are their own worst enemy and yours. You don't need them in your life at all . Do whatever it takes, and do it NOW! Hang in there, I PROMISE it will get better! I am living proof!"
"LIVING IN MIND Hello, Did u ever had this thought that you are a star,or a rich handsome guy, maybe living a luxurious life, helping people or you exist like justin bieber, at the same time in reality you just a guy living a normal life, most of this thoughts comes when i listen to music, music gives soo much thoughts ,my head turn into a world, feeling like am living a certain life . When i talk to people or drive cars thoughts comes in a glitch i tend to forget what i was talking about something, also when i drive thought randomly comes and i tend to forget that i drive, sometime when am doing something at the same times i get caught up having random thought, also when i do something i tend to overthink it that how will i do it... It's like my body tries to live inside my head, the reality of my life it is in my head... About music, i figured out that i am a normal guy am not that poor but its like i don't accept the life that am living and so music connects me to a certain life that i want to live, really its feels soo nice doing things that i want, sometimes i tend to cry for the happiness i encounter in my own thought world..hahahaa... PLEASE HELP ME....i neeed to focus in my life, i need to stay totally 100% in mind fulllllllness!!"
"LIVING IN MIND Hello, Im sorry to hear that you have this problem. At one point in my life I had the same issue that you have at this very point. Now im not about to say this as a joke or the solution to all your problems, but this did help me immensely. I have major ADHD, so my mind moved a million miles a minute, though you may not have this problem, I had the same problems happen to be as they are happening to you Sir (or ma'am). So what I did (please try not to laugh) is I started meditating and organizing all my thoughts. I spent hours doing this each night for weeks strait. My problems have become so much less now. I dont have to constantly get side tracked and have to be told to get back on track. I mean yes sometimes it does happen because nothing is a hundred percent. But remember its your mind, your body, your soul. You are the only one who can control you."
"LIVING IN MIND I know how you feel and I don't know how it got this far. I have delusions in this vein. Started to believe myself to be an influencer of some sort of lofty extent to the world. It's so painful and your right about music. I think my confusion,attitude, and the hell Im hung up on just met my comfort and I consume like a drug. I'm at a very mute point in my life and this issue is getting worse with almost nothing left to try to explain. I need help for this issue but their's really no where I can think of that can help for something like this. I've started laying off the particular album that elated me for a while, but that's a drop in a bucket I still watch tv's commercials,tv, #######4, see something to read into. Quite frankly It's misery and i want to not wake up."
LIVING IN MIND I unfortunately feel this way and it's painful and I think people like us who deal with these unfortunate things of having so much doubt need help. I'd check myself in to the right hospital and find the right therapist if either one existed. Everyday this plot thickens and its hell. i need help for this.
"LIVING IN MIND I thought about how to develop a sort of coping mechanism today. Let's say this false dimension to our being that we devote our unbalanced energy towards into trying to untangle like a net in front of us and something that sways around us, let's say this fantasy world exists simply because it feels alarmingly real to us. Then we have to think about what exists in our physical reality. Our family, friends, our job, who we mingle with, OUR dreams, WHO we are. These are in essense the reality of our lives. if their existed a realm in which we occupied that sort of position of influence but we lead normal lives then the question over these things being true or false are immediately irrelevant because this realm doesn't exist in OUR realm. We're not always around when we are discussed so we don't know what's said or was withheld at any level of communication but in our daily reality we exist with a purpose that doesn't call for rockstar. We can still understand ourselves as not being rock stars because we admit to having a PROBLEM, so we might as well ask ourselves the question of whether or not we even Want to be a rockstar. My issue with this whole thing derives from a psychotic episode with many unanswered questions to which I began believing to have some sort of recognition. It's a paranoia of being leeched or monitored or something of that nature. It's psychotic and sick but it's not real. I didn't write commercials or come up with blue wildnerness's slogan, I just happened to say the exact same stupid thing about my cat having the soul of a panther. But the realm in which it exists is wherever the advertisement was created thousands of miles away. In my reality I'm just watching a hockey movie that is also NOT about me just appeals to my humor and tastes also with expressions and situations I can relate to but are in NO way brought on by ME. You get the just of where I'm trying to go."
"LIVING IN MIND I do want to say to the op since we appear to have much in common with this issue that, it's ok to believe yourself to be handsome. Many of my mistakes believing I was ugly mostly due to body hair and being sort of joked around with growing up with a negative self image in regards to my appearance played a factor in those mistakes. I didn't consider myself desireable because I didn't think anyone could find me physically appealing. I now do not believe this to be true. Course I'm not lusted after by 5million people like could be built up in a head but it is ok to consider yourself handsome as long as we don't think ourselves to be rich and universally attractive or could just settle with anyone because we elated ourselves to believing we are just that much of a catch. Believe in your qualities, try to be a little more present and take care of your priorities and value what you have. You have to be humble and believe in YOURSELF. Without our rockstar delusions are we nothing? No we're whole. But like I said, positive self image."
"People don't talk to me For years now I've heard voices of people who don't want to talk to me. I don't know how to deal with this anymore. It's extremely threatening. Do you still talk to the persons you hear voices of? Does it help? Dx: schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, dependent personality disorder"
"People don't talk to me I used to hear all the voices of the people who abused me, by talked to them and telling them off( which I don't recommend because I had to beat one up), I learned to control them and have the power. Remember you control you."
"Breaking the cycle (or trying to) Sometimes I think I have psychic abilities to beat Roulette/casino gambling. Also, I think the casino may have some type of psychic team that may be ruining my life. I get some method that I think will win, I try it. Sometimes it 'works,' sometimes it doesn't. I always loses way more in the long run. Then, I get over it. I come up with or get thoughts implanted telepathically of some great new method. The method seems so great that I become convinced that it must win/work. I try it out and end up losing in the long run. This is a vicious cycle that goes on and on. Also, I am followed by aircraft everywhere I go which may or may not make this condition worse. I am not crazy; most are just ignorant of the astral/psychic world."
"Breaking the cycle (or trying to) Hello, welcome to the forums. What you're experiencing isn't real. The ""psychic power"" you have is just plain old luck, a chance of winning, a chance of losing. They do not have a psychic team that is working against you and everyone else. It's all odds and probability. What you're experiencing is called a delusion. I go through them, too. I sometimes believe my boyfriend is going to murder me in my sleep, or that they have invisible camera planted across my area at work, and are spying on me 24/7. As for the aircraft, that probably has nothing to do with you. I used to follow a car that would drive down the road I live on and park at the end of the street. I live on a dead end road, and thought they had no real reason to be parking down there, other than to spy on me. I actually confronted the man that drove the vehicle, and he told me he was just visiting his mother. Do you see a psychiatrist at all? I'd recommend one, in all honesty, or even maybe a therapist. They can help with the gambling issues and talk to you about these psychic powers that you think you have. Have a nice day.

"Not sure what to make of this... Well, I've had some traumatic (on some level) events occur the past few years and they have been really difficult to deal with. Around 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with depression and was put on an anti-depressant and saw a therapist regularly. After a year I was able to taper off my anti-depressant with the help of the dr until i wasn't on it anymore. When I first went on it, I felt like for the first time in my life I had clarity. My daily life wasn't as painful as it normally was. The thing is though, before seeing the dr for the first time my mother was the one who insisted that I see him because I was saying things that didn't make sense. At the time I believed that: -Because I cried in front of my kids, my husband will divorce me and take our kids away -That my husband wanted to divorce me so he could marry someone -I believed that I should leave him first so that he wouldn't take the kids I believed those things 100% and didn't want him to know if I had cried earlier in the day. Recently, I brought this topic up to him and he was shocked as he had never thought any of that. More recently, I had a small problem with a close family member. It was nothing. A silly squabble. But I had extreme and inappropriate anger about it. I apologized and the other person still responded with anger. Instead of just letting it go, I would get angry about it every once in a while. Among the things I said/thought about the situation: -My family sees me as a bully that must be stopped -My family doesn't defend me because I would never be right -My family constantly defends the other person because they feel that I am a bully to that person -My family constantly makes excuses for the other person's behavior because they care about the other person more than me -My family never makes excuses for me- they always make me out to be evil I even called my mother crying to ""confront"" her about theses things. She hadn't even heard about the fight and started telling me that I'm imagining this perception of things and that no one sees me as a bully. I could hear her not even knowing what to say and feeling as at loss as she was when I used to tell her my husband was leaving me/hates me. A therapist I was seeing for the past few months wondered if my belief that my husband was going to leave me was psychosis of some form. It was really hard to say. At the time I was hardly ever sleeping and would take a long time to leave the bed so it was possible that if I did suffer psychosis it was a side-effect of the depression. After that ""confrontation"" with my mother, things appeared to calm down and I was able to be somewhat normal and saw the other person that I had the fight with and talked normally. Then a week or so passed and we all gathered at a mutual acquaintance's house. That person and another person brought up a topic similar to the one we fought about. I immediately felt defensive and even started getting visibly upset. Later that night, when I was at home, I started breaking down again. Those thoughts started coming and I started feeling out of control. I kept crying and shaking and feeling like a worthless waste of a human. The next day, I felt blank. Almost normal. As if I had a cup that at times gets full of all these negative emotions that overflow until it empties out and then there is nothing. I feel normal, but I have not felt ""joy"" in a long time. Another thing to add is that this person I fought with, I am constantly paranoid of them. Whenever they bring up a situation I feel like they are talking about me. I often feel like they purposely exclude me of things along with a few other people. I get very suspicious that they lock down on me and make comments that outline my weaknesses. Even though ""logically"", that would be very weird and when right now I try to think back to what they actually said to make me feel that way, I just can't remember. So here's what I'm wondering. This internal monologue that occurs when I am in my ""bad days"", could it possibly be a delusion or hallucination of some form? I just can't tell anymore. And I don't feel like I can silently wait for another ""break-down"" but I feel like I know that it's coming. I know no one here is able to really tell me what's happening, but could someone maybe relate? Does any of this sound familiar to anyone?"
"New Member, Delusion qualification Hi, first post so I guess I need to wait for Mod. to approve it before it goes up, that's okay, and thanks. I have a question about P.D. I know and have been diagnosed as mildly paranoid and delusional. I'm okay with that, and most of the time I have a decent grasp of what is and what is not ""real"". I'm 40, I am a sober Alcoholic, I recently moved in with my Mother and her Husband of 25-ish years, they got married when I was about 12-14?? I don't want to give too much history that it skews the question, so here goes; When I was younger I thought my Step Dad hated me to the point of Intentional Emotional abuse, but when I talked about it or accused him he played dumb, and was very careful about not doing or saying anything that would incriminate him. Often I was told I was acting out against him because he was a new Step Dad and that was normal. I sort of accepted that, and moved away very young. years years I had a psychotic break in January 2017, got treatment-help-therapy, felt pretty good. Was diagnosed as Paranoid, and self diagnosed as delusional. Moved in with Moms and SD, now I have this feeling again, that he is trying to hurt me, trying to make me question my morals and what I do. I'm 40 and physically uhhhh not intimidated nor mentally either. There are some scenarios that are definitely not Delusion, but again not enough to seem malicious to anyone EXCEPT TO ME, OF COURSE!! And it is only him, other people do not get to me, my normal delusions are Spiritual in nature and/or Apocalyptic. So the question is due, how do I know if this is my PD or if this is really happening? Can I test it somehow? Thanks, R"
"New Member, Delusion qualification It can be confusing when a person has a diagnosis of something like Persecutory Delusion, Paranoid Delusion, Schizophrenia. It can also amplify the problem if not dealt with correctly. I had a breakthrough on this topic. One thing we the sick need to know is that we are not the only ones out there who are sick. And as most of us know or should know; Hurt people, hurt people. With that said, what I realized was, that it wasn't a Delusion, but it wasn't as personal as I had suspected. I thought it was all well thought out attack against my self. (So a contribution to my already existing condition) What it is, is that this person is severely Passive/Aggresive, and is unaware of it. It comes across as personalized because I live in self pity right? But in actuality it isn't meant that way at all, it is as a result of someone else not dealing with their issues, and inability to communicate. He is sick and that is okay, we all are right.

"Delusional Husband? Any professionals on here? I am not trying to diagnose my husband, but reading this forum has been the closest I can see to what I believe he's experiencing. This is an email I have just sent to a private psychiatrist as I appear to be running out of options. I wondered if anyone on here had any luck getting professional help or had any advice for me? Dear Sir/Madam I need some urgent advice and I do not know where to turn. My husband is becoming increasingly paranoid and I believe he is experiencing delusions of persecution. Six months ago it started with him believing cars were following him and watching our house, since then it has spiralled and has included but is not limited to him believing the following: 1. 'They' have been planning this revenge on him for at least 20 years 2. He is the victim of community mobbing, gang stalking and work place gas lighting 3. Everyone is 'in on it' and let him know this by coercive conversations 4. I have been recruited 5. He has been poisoned with arsenic 6. It is linked to the Freemasons 7. I am emotionally abusive... or he is possibly 8. 'They' have plotted to let us build up our lives and then every 4 years they destroy it 9. 'They' are responsible for my brothers and mums deaths 10. We have been bugged and they are most likely monitoring our internet usage and emails 11. He has been to the police 12. The doctors can't be trusted 13. They are either going to come and hurt him or they are going to make him look like he's gone mad or they are going to set him up for something bad There are many more, this has resulted in obvious problems within our relationship and he has threatened to leave several times now. It has also resulted in him not working properly (he is self employed) and we are now really behind with all bills and have serious financial issues. He is also now suffering with physical symptoms due to anxiety and stress. He will not listen to reason. It is not him, he is not ill, it is everyone else and he simply does not trust anyone. I have been to my doctor, I have called the doctor, I have called my local crisis team, I have called and emailed MIND. I emailed a local private psychiatrist. I have spoken with his family. I have looked online for advice. The only information I have is that I should neither agree or disagree with his delusions. I shouldn't argue and I should get him to a GP. How do you get him to a GP? He did go last week, because he had headaches, high blood pressure and liver pain. Despite me telling the doctor in advance and him telling me to get him to go there urgently, the doctor just dismissed it when he said he thought he'd come in to contact with arsenic!!!!! So what do I do now? I am very scared and could really do with some advice from a psychiatrist who has had experience with this. If I can't get him to get help how can I talk to him? How do I get financial help for my family if he won't get signed off? If I talk to other people I feel like I'm betraying him. If I just sit and wait I panic that it's going to get worse. What's the prognosis with this kind of thing? I just feel so stuck and overwhelmed and really would like someone to tell me something other than I need to get him to GP.... which is obviously not working for me. Are you able to assist or point me in the direction of someone who can? PS. There is no history of mental illness in him or his family. We have been together since he was 16 (25 years) and there has never been any indication of this happening before. He is now 42. Thank you in advance"
"Delusional Husband? Any professionals on here? These kind of conversations can be hard because trying to figure out what to say is hard, knowing he's only going to dismiss any 'logic' and twist it around. As someone who has been delusional, and someone who lives with her father who believes the neighbors are listening to us through the vents, are moving things around in our house, are stomping upstairs just to mess with us, I know this isn't always rooted in just ""oh, he's sick"". For me, isolation is a huge one. I'll start of semi-isolated, get deeper in my thoughts, and isolate completely, at which point I'm stuck until some miracle happens or something yanks me from it all. Trust is also huge. Not being comfortable in myself, around others, having constant feelings of being threatened as a result of trauma, it fostered ill trust in people. That ill trust, over years and years, developed into ideas people were controlling me, telepathically, just so they could ruin my school career and my work as a counselor. I thought jobs/bosses were framing me, were creating clones in the basement of the amusement park I worked for, and setting me up to get arrested and fired. I quit a lot of jobs because of that. So there is a lot involved here. Trust, you mentioned, and that could be a huge one. In fact, it could be a root in all this. When I speak with people with these kinds of beliefs at work . . . well, I'll just give an example. If someone walks up to me and says ""you know what, my roommate keeps stealing my thoughts and he keeps poisoning my food"" I say ""you really don't feel safe right now, you feel targeted"" they would continue on, and I would continue to reflect back the FEELINGS I'm hearing, not exactly the thoughts. So the fear, the lack of trust, the anxiety, the pain. That's the only way you can get to a place where you can say, well, what would be helpful for you, or maybe we can do this, e.t.c. In your case, going to your husband and saying you're not thinking straight, you need to see a doctor or trying to deny his thoughts as real and logical . . . well . . . it's more of an attack and that can only worsen the trust. Obviously that's not how YOU mean it, but because he is where he is, he will only see it as a force against him. You could work the conversation to a point where you can ask him what he thinks you two can do to help this situation, and ask him if he would feel comfortable talking to someone about trust issues or his fear or his anxiety. Sometimes a change in environment and a change of the people around us can make a huge difference, with or without doctor involvement. I know it's a lot and it takes time and patience. I'm not saying be his new counselor, I'm just saying try and see past the ""unreal"" side of what he says, and see the real feelings behind it. Whether or not the feelings come from something that exists or doesn't, they're still there and they're very real, so they need to be attended to and treated just like anyone else's feelings. I hope things go well for you two, it's a long road. I like living in the world in my head because I'm in charge half the time."
"Delusional Husband? Any professionals on here? Thank you Alucard for your open and honest reply, I really appreciate it. I was obviously having a bad day yesterday and felt completely overwhelmed by all of this. I'm really trying hard to understand him at the moment, and sometimes I just can't control my frustration and end up having the 'why me' feelings and 'this is so unfair'. I think I find it harder when he voices suspicions about me, ones that are hurtful and completely untrue. That's when I really don't know how to respond. Some days I am more tolerant than others where I think I can just ride out the storm and hope something makes him realise he needs help, but some days I feel like I need to push him to see someone as I don't know if the longer this goes on the worse it will get. Does that make sense? In the mean time our finances are worsening and our children are noticing and I don't seem to be able to get any professional advice. i am lucky though, because at the moment we still have good days. I cherish these moments because from what I've read there's a good chance there could be less of those"
My friend is delusional what should I say I have a friend who has bipolar with psychosis. She believes that a celebrity is in love with her and when she is released from the psych ward (I personally don't think they will let her out) that she will message him and ask about his love for her. She thinks that he wishes to propose to her and is sending encoded messages via the TV and through presents that she has received. The first time she told me about this she messaged me via voice mail and left a message (I ignored it because I felt if I agree with her I might strengthen the delusion and if I disagreed that she'd not listen to me anyway). I went to visit her recently and she told me the same story again about the hidden messages etc. I said to her 'what do the staff say' as I didn't want to encourage her delusion. She said 'they believe me.' I've no idea if they are playing along or she actually believes that they believe her even though they've not said so. I've talked to some people who said they'd play along and other felt that it wouldn't be wise to encourage it. Does anyone here have any advice I am planning to go see her once and week and I just want to know what to say next time.
"My friend is delusional what should I say I know someone in a similar situation. And her delusion has been steady for years. So. Yes, that's only one data point. But if your friend is the same. You won't make the delusion worse. If you aren't sure. Then asking if you can check with a member of staff might be helpful. However, I think you're right to be cautious. As you don't want to be giving her ideas or encouragement about stalking / harrassment. Would it be possible to take a neutral position? To neither aggressively disbelieve nor play along. But listen and acknowledge. That this is how she's seeing reality at the moment? For example. I think if I was asked about messages being sent via the TV. That I could honestly reply that I've never experienced it myself. And that it seems quite an unusual thing to happen. Which honours your reality. While not dismissing hers outright. “ We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. ” Charlie Chaplain in The Great Dictator"
"My boyfriend had a brief delusion last night? Advice? To preface, this has never happened before, and he has never been diagnosed with anything (though he is somewhat severely depressed). I don't know if this is relevant, but he hit his head pretty hard a couple days ago, and was feeling dizzy and had fuzzy vision earlier in the evening. Last night, over text, he confessed to me that two years ago he had accidentally killed my boyfriend John, who had attacked him because he liked me. Except, I didn't have a boyfriend two years ago, and I've never even been friends with anyone called John. He fell asleep shortly afterwards, and when he woke up he no longer believed that, and said he didn't know what had happened that caused him to. Any advice? Is this likely to happen again, and if so, how can I help him deal with it?"
"Fear That I'm Becoming Delusional Maybe this sounds odd. But here's the story. My best friend is someone I met online. We've been friends for 7 years. But sometimes, when I get in a fight with my mom, and the fight gets really bad...Well, if I text/message my friend and she doesn't reply soon or quickly enough, I start thinking she hates me. I never told her about my worries...until last week. My mom had been really difficult. I got in the car and started driving just to get away. So then I started texting my best friend and it was fine at first. But then I'd look at my phone and see a hurtful text from my mom. I would ignore the text and then another buzz would come. It'd be my mom again. Every time I saw a text from my mom, I started believing my best friend didn't want to talk to me. I don't know why. But by the time I drove back home (4 hours later), I sent my friend a text. Then I went inside and my mom yelled at me. I went back to the car and my friend still hadn't responded. I really didn't know what to do, because my car is super old and is NOT designed to drive around for that long. It was started to overheat and I was freaking out pretty badly. But eventually I went back inside again and went to my room. After some heated exchanges, my mom finally stopped yelling for a bit. I was so angry and convinced that my best friend didn't give a crap about me. Then she texted me back. I have since deleted our conversation, but I responded with something like, ""Nevermind. I know you don't care anyway. You don't have to pretend anymore."" She was extremely surprised by that. I said, ""I know you hate talking to me. I know that you sigh whenever you see a text from me. You're always hoping the next text will be the last. I just wish you would stop pretending. I wish you would stop lying to me."" I truly didn't mean to hurt her feelings when I was texting these awful things. At the time, I really believed what I was saying was true. I was mad because I was convinced she hated talking to me and stopped wanting to be my friend years ago. I then went to bad and texted her the next day that my sanity was getting lower and I would try to explain what happened later, but for now I'm sorry. We have since worked it out. I'm now able to look back on the situation and I believe her. I believe that she cares for me. And I'm disappointed in myself for doubting her. And I'm Extremely grateful for how understanding she has been. I don't deserve a friend like her, and I hate that I took my frustrations out on her. But I am now worried that these times where I convince myself she hates me will become more and more frequent. I almost ended our friendship that night. I'm a lucky son of a gun to have a friend who doesn't even get mad at me for behaving like that. But how could I prevent it from happening again? Why did this happen? - - - - - Here are some ""highlights"" of the conversation that happened the day after the texts: Friend: If I didn't enjoy your company anymore I wouldn't tell you you're one of the most important people in my life & regularly try to reaffirm how much I care about you. Why do you call me a liar? Why do you accuse me of pretending? What would I gain from this? What incentive do I have for what I say or do, other tha, sincerity? Is that really what you think of me? A liar & pretender who is a fake friend & only sticks around because- what? The views? The lols? I'm sorry I haven't been able to convey my appreciation for you. I'm sorry I'm so bad at words & feelings & at getting up in the morning & holding conversations. But I can't think of anything I've done that has earned the accusations you launched at me yesterday/today. Me: Part of what drove me to write such extreme texts is because I couldn't stand it anymore. I couldn't stand not knowing and I still can't stand not knowing. I can't stand being unsure of what relationships are real and which are fake. I can't believe that anyone cares, not even you. And it's nothing you did. I just hate this hope that feels so false. I hate the feeling. When I originally read this message, I was happy. I was happy that you said ""I can't think of anything I've done that has earned the accusations you launched at me yesterday/today."" Because that means I really am being unreasonable and that means that my insecurities are not justified. That there really isn't any reason for me to feel the way that I do, and that maybe my worries really are for nothing. If I made a false accusation, that means maybe you don't hate me. Or at least you haven't done anything that should make me think you do. It's not worth it."
"Practical Advice Erotomanic Delusion Disorder I was hoping that someone who has a DD can provide advice on whether counseling or cognitive therapy without medicine can successfully treat a delusion disorder. My wife is erotomanic with grandiose elements. She believes she has a rich, powerful boyfriend that loves her dearly who sends her messages through songs, television, movies and other mass media. This condition has persisted chronically for nearly four years. I believe that this condition arose due to a psychotic break on what I believe to be a massive bipolar episode. Consistent with a delusion disorder, she believes her version of reality and resists all logic and evidence to the contrary. She believes she is sane and thus will not take medication. She is completely in love with her delusion, and thus has only brotherly love for me. She will occasionally run off in search of her illusory paramour based on hidden messages in songs on the radio, only to return crestfallen. I have four options: Just accept it, involuntarily commit her to force medication, divorce her, or try to get her to try psychotherapy (to which she is not opposed). Does anyone have success with treating severe delusion disorder without antipsychotics ?"
"Practical Advice Erotomanic Delusion Disorder I don't have DD, but from everything I've read, the answer is no. One book on delusional disorder said if you think this illness can be managed without medication and only using psychotherapy like CBT, then you've way underestimated this illness. First, antipsychotics, then psychotherapy as a supplement. Getting them there is the hard part. Read ""I'm Not Sick, I Don't Need Help"" (if you haven't already) to learn how to get her to see a psychiatrist without telling her that she has an illness (or that she's crazy). You can always try to get them to see a therapist, using whatever reason you think would get them there. Then preempt the appointment by letting the therapist know what's going on, so he/she can figure how to get your wife to see a psychiatrist. You have a tough road ahead of you. I couldn't get my now ex-wife to seek treatment."
"Practical Advice Erotomanic Delusion Disorder Hi Sister's Keeper, I agree with herculeanhercules, medication is essential, and for me the longer my delusions went untreated the harder they are to rebound and recover from. It is impossible to forget the memories of the delusions that set in when I got sick after the birth of my daughter in 2005, that were treated long enough to clear a break, but then slowly crept into my memory bank. For me, medication is essential. The only type of therapy that I believe in other than taking an antipsychotic is love based community oriented therapy where people who love you share their truth. This is extremely hard to overcome - erotomania. Sometimes even 11 years later I still have emotional feelings in response to the deeply seated memories I developed in my postpartum - I believed my physician loved me an was sending me secret messages in the form of wrong number phone calls. It took writing my truth in the form of a book that is ""fiction based on a true story"" I mean, how can you write a delusional memoir without calling it fiction? It also took releasing it into the world, years of continuous and rational choice to take medication and live in the reality people say is true, and the love and support of my friends and family to share their perception regarding my story. They couldn't understand my story when I tried to explain it in conversation, it was too challenging. So I learned to write. I spent 10 years crafting my story. I still take medication every day, and will probably need it for the rest of my life. Today, I understand that the physician will never love me, and that my experience was a natural response to the trauma of an exam during childbirth, and the isolation I felt in a rural community. For me, learning to accept my illness was heart breaking, realizing you are delusional is very upsetting. The disillusionment of it is devastating, but I lived through it to live in recovery which for me is the desire to stay in reality with the people around me. The people who love me read ""I'm not sick and I don't need help"". They joined the National Alliance of Mental Illness, and took the Family to Family course (which helped them learn how to help themselves and me). As for how you decide to live your life, that is a decision only you can make, because you have to be able to live with whatever you decide is best.

"Practical Advice Erotomanic Delusion Disorder Sunnyg, what do you mean by ""...love based community oriented therapy where people who love you share their truth."" Is there a name for this kind of therapy? Have you tried CBT? Also, did you have insight? What eventually convinced you to take medication? Thanks!"
"Practical Advice Erotomanic Delusion Disorder Hi, My daughter's father read the book ""I'm not sick and I don't need help."" He threatened to take my daughter away if I didn't comply with medication. Once I took the medication for a month I started to get my insight back, and through trusting relationships with friends and family where they helped me understand the difference between their reality and my perception. What I mean by ""...love based community oriented therapy where people who love you share their truth."" is that I have friends and family who I trust who share feedback with me to help me function. These people are my support system. They are better than therapy. I found therapy helpful for dealing with the readjustment to life in treatment, but beyond that writing and having friends was the most important part of getting better for me, once I learned that I would lose my daughter and my job if I didn't stay medication compliant. For me the medication is effective. Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Practical Advice Erotomanic Delusion Disorder Hello! For me the medication was essential for my recovery. Not only does it help with the delusions it helps with the anxiety and depression. Even at my worst, I had a little bit of insight thank God, so I was willing to take the medication. Has anyone in her family been ill? Knowing my father had been sick helped me to realize I too was ill. Recovery is possible."
"Practical Advice Erotomanic Delusion Disorder Thank you all for your responses. She has another sister who is bipolar and delusional. This sister self medicated with every illegal drug possible. My wife is unwilling to accept that her sister's delusions are mental illness as opposed to drug affects because, in my view, that would mean accepting the possibility she might be bipolar and delusional as well. Based on your story, Sunny, I have handled this entirely wrong. I guess I should have essentially forced her to take medication. I instead believed that taking stress off of her might help her let her delusion go. But she has never improved, and is currently as bad as I have seen her. She resists any effort to see a psychiatrist or psychologist. So, I think we will start with marital counseling, with a hope that will lead to individual counseling, and then a psychologist, and then a psychiatrist. Wow, that sounds daunting even just typing it out! Thank you for sharing your experience, Sunny. It is nice to see someone use her experiences to help others."
"Practical Advice Erotomanic Delusion Disorder As hard and painful as it is to admit I have this syndrome and I did get out of this without any medication and outher help. It wasn't easy. It was a very slow process of disillusionment ( still is).But it just took one firm evidence that ""my victim"" didn't loved and cared for me to destroy whole the batshit crazy soulmate story around which I have build my madness.I only regret 7 wasted years. And this is with what I am dealing right now : the regret for the lost past. I have accepted that I was mad so I do not hate myself for stupidity mostly because I undestand why it happened to me or rather why I did it to myself: I was living with undiagnozed depression during very stressfull period in my life plus unhealed childhood wound ( I am Adult Child of Alcoholic rejective father who traumatized me strongly with his violence and so on) ad to this unfullfilled mariage ( as I was perceiving it at that moment of my life) and prolonged material problems, all of this togheter pushed me to escape into ""fairytale"" as the ""only"" salvation. I'm moving on with my life, with this uneasy truth about myself. That sucks but what to do...Hopefully my mariage and family aren't destroyed but oh it was so close."
"This Disorder has destroyed my life *may trigger* Hello, This disorder has destroyed my life. I was brought up in a single parent family and my parent has it. I first noticed the symptoms when I was in early primary school, only then I didn't know that this was a delusion. So I believed everything that was said. The disorder has resulted in the death of my only sibling, the loss of my physical and mental health, a life time of loneliness and isolation, the loss of my chance to have children or a healthy normal relationship. I am almost 40 years old and the trauma of all the abuses - physical, sexual, emotional - perpetrated against me in the name of getting back at the imagined people that my parent claimed was stalking us, leaves me with one thought permanently etched in the back of my mind - I want to die. I cannot begin to express how much grief and anger i have about what was done to myself and my sibling because of this illness. no child should have to grow up in the environment i grew up in.

"Would he still be this way with someone else? I am certain that my husband has a delusional disorder. He has all the symptoms of delusional jealousy and I have suffered through this for many years with him. I love him. We have children. We are a family. We have separated a few times, but never for more than a couple of weeks. He initiates it based on ""my infidelity"". There are times when he seems to recognize he has something mentally wrong or at least pretends to, and he will tell me that I cause this in him. That he was not this way before me and would not be this way with someone else. I want to know if that is true, in your experiences, do those suffering from delusional jealousy get better and go on to have normal happy relationships if their marriage ends."
"Would he still be this way with someone else? When we were in the first few months of our relationship, long before we married, I did have relations with someone else, but came clean with him about it. We were having issues and I had moved out, but it really hurt him. If I could take that back, I would. But we married 3 years later and have a family. He has always been suspicious of me, but the true delusions, I believe, started a few years after we married."
"Would he still be this way with someone else? Well, I don't know this person nor do we get to hear his side of the story. In my experience if people feel something is wrong in their gut, there likely is. That said I don't believe people are the same way with every individual. For example I wouldn't behave the same in every Intimate relationship, my thoughts and feelings + actions would be based on my partner and how we connected as one. I mimic my partners a lot, especially in the emotional realm. Bc I'm never exactly sure how to express myself that makes sense to anyone but me heh I watch and listen to how they act and react. I focus on what they need or want and try to give them this effortlessly. When I am comfortable emotionally only then can I be emotionally expressive without any walls up. To answer your question there is no way of knowing how he would behave with another. First you need to find out why he doesn't trust you. It could be something you are doing you are not aware of. Maybe your actions don't match your words etc. We won't always behave the same way with different people. If he is telling you he wasn't this way before you, that should be enough. Without sounding cruel you already have your answer."
Is my wife having delusions? Been married for 15 yrs and have 3 kids. A week ago she told me she's in love with someone else. This someone else turns out to be an individual who is famous and located across the world. She is into Wiccan type practices and says they communicate spiritually. He doesn't have any social media but she swears he has Twitter and FB. She says he leaves messages for her through Twitter and FB. She has already packed her bags and says he is coming to get her and our kids. All of this was out of nowhere​. I'm really at a lost for words and would love any type of advice.
"Is my wife having delusions? I am in a very similar situation. Been married for 15 years, 2 kids. My wife believes she is in love with someone else (not a famous person, but a person with higher socio-economic status). There is no social media contact - their only contact is telepathic. They have astral sex together and can project thoughts and feelings at each other throughout the day, Oh, and she originally made this contact because a supernatural entity told her that I was a bad husband and she needed to find True Love with this guy. Now, I'm no psychologist, but I'm leaning towards my personal opinion of delusional disorder... Last edited by mark1958 on Mon Jun 05, 2017 7:57 pm, edited 1 time in total.

"Is my wife having delusions? One thing I am trying to find out is whether there is any effective treatment. My understanding of it so far is that delusional disorder can be mitigated by medication but cannot be ""cured"". In other words, the problem is never going to go away."
"Is my wife having delusions? Dexter84 wrote: One thing I am trying to find out is whether there is any effective treatment. My understanding of it so far is that delusional disorder can be mitigated by medication but cannot be ""cured"". In other words, the problem is never going to go away. That is very disturbing to hear. My wife literally has nothing to do with me anymore. All she does is ""telepathically"" talk to this actor, she now says they are married spiritually. She will not go to treatment, not even when I told her it was for me and I only needed support. I pay for everything, which I don't mind, but it's hard when the woman you so deeply love spends your money while delusionally loving an actor. She actually took the kids out today and has been gone for 4 hrs so far, first time in a month. This is truly like living in hell."
"Is my wife having delusions? This is the approach I took. My ex-wife's family and I contacted the CPS and reported her delusional thoughts and behavior. All of us gave them written statements. CPS did a psychological evaluation of her... She fought against this... After a rollercoaster, she eventually ended up in a psych ward and got the help she needed. She's taking her medication and is functional now."
"Needing answers about pdd, please Hi new to this forum. I don't know. it's happening again but... lately my thinking process is becoming distorted again. Where do I begin? All my life I've had a suspicious nature.. not trusting too much because I'd always lose friends in the end. I learned to read people and quickly became intuitive to their body languages and inuendos. As life progressed suspicions became all encompassing at times to the point of isolation. The. In my thirties I learned of friendships that were pure and honest. (These few friends I still have 20-some years later) however there is a great distance of country between us so contact is minimal. I've been in a couple long term live in relationships in the past decade and both have ended miserably. Mine is the part of what has become full blown pdd with psychosis breaks. I've been medicated on every bloody aap that is or was available over the last 15 years and to no avail. I've had some contact with pdocs, gps and councillors however in my line of work I'm not always able to set a regimented course of therapy. My question is simple. Is stress and depression a common trigger for delusions? I'm not new to delusions as I said, but I'm at a loss with even a lifetime of expiriences what the triggers are tommy psychosis"
"Needing answers about pdd, please I am not even close to being a Dr but I have been recently studying delusions due to my wife. There are a lot of delusional individuals that are linked to depression before their delusional onset. Stress has also been linked to causing delusions. Having a delusional disorder is a very complicated and destructive thing, especially if family is involved. For example, my wife is delusional about being in love with an actor. They talk telepathically and he sends ""signs"" and ""messages"" through social media. She says they are soulmates and are married spiritually. She will not receive help because she doesn't believe anything is wrong with her. It's been very destructive for my 3 kids and myself. I hope this helps"
"Newb ex husband....Bewildred and relieved Hi, I'm new to the realisation that my ex has PDD or something similar. Trying to cope with the recent police apprehensions of my children's Mom, and the revelations of the extent of her delusions. Oddly, or not, I'm the only one left she trusts. I read that there is a section for family, but haven't found it yet...I don't know.....I'd welcome any comments and or suggestions"
"Please! I need advice. I posted about this before with no response. 2 weeks ago my wife said she is in love with an actor and not me. She said he is coming to get her and our 3 kids to live with him in South Korea. She says he sends her messages through social media, he doesn't have any social media accounts, they are only fan based. She says they are connected spiritually and talk to each other telapathically. I tried talking to her to rationalize the situation but she only states she isn't crazy, never came close to calling her that. My oldest child is thinking she is really leaving. I don't know what to tell her. I can't talk bad about her mother, she's a great mom. A psychiatrist I spoke to stated she has to be willing to want treatment, I'm lost. My wife really thinks this is real. I sleep on the couch but continue my everyday life with my kids. It's hard seeing my wife like this. Please, any advice would be very helpful. I feel alone on this. Thank everyone so much."
"Please! I need advice. If I were you, I would very definitely talk to a lawyer about preventing your children from leaving the country. Confiscate the children's passports, if they have them, and put them in a safe deposit box. You will also want to talk to a family lawyer about divorce, and in particular, how you could obtain full custody. If your wife decamps for Korea, hopefully without the kids, that will constitute abandonment."
"Help! How do extract myself from a 2 month delusion? I have had to get a restraining order on my ex because of his constant delusions and paranoia. He is not diagnosed, but since these 'episodes' are all completely untrue and he 100% believes them no matter how irrational or even when show hard proof that its not true, I dont know what else it can be? I also believe he has a personality disorder in concert (attachment/abandonment issues that trigger the delusions). I the past these delusions lasted for a day or two but this latest one is well over 2 months. I have disconnected with him completely (obviously, RO) but he is continuing to pursue this ridiculous delusion to the point that he testified about it in the RO hearing yesterday, under oath! I know he believes it so it not quite lying, but Im quite frightened by his entrenchment in this and he is promising (and appears to be following thru) on legal action stating he has all kinds of ""evidence"" which is actually impossible since none of it happened. Of course, over the 2 months the story have evolved and changed to fill in the 'holes' ive pointed out or proof that its false that ive shown him. He is spending money on forensics and lawyers and filings that have no merit or basis whatsoever. Ive told him so many times its wrong but he continues to persist and its terrifying. I think he is also creating fake 'evidence'. He tried to blackmail me into signing an affidavit admitting to the things he believes Ive done (that are all false) so that he can sue his someone (he ""knows"" im involved!"", Im not, I dont even know this person!) I know Ive done as much as I can but Im really freaked out that its going on this long and hes actually wasting his time and money on it. He hates me because of it, lies and bad mouths me to everyone and its not even remotely true! I have no way to tell anyone that he need serious help or to get him to stop. I just want this to end!"
"Help! How do extract myself from a 2 month delusion? I have only just joined this forum and Im wondering how you got on with your husband? I have been through a similar experience with my adult son who has made all sorts of accusations about his family abusing him in all sorts of ways. He has made numerous complaints to the police but thankfully, because we had managed to get him to seek help they didn't pursue it because they realised, after speaking to various people he had mentioned, that there was no truth in it. How did you get on? Its been 15 months now and my son is still delusional and the situation for us, his family,is very difficult indeed."
"Please help me Hello, I am a 18yrs old living in *mod edit* and I need help. I have a 17 yrs old girlfriend who has been diagnosed last yyear with severe anxiety and depression. She was prescribed medication but quit the therapy and the medication because her parents kept stressint her about it saying that she is crazy and all that. She comes from a horrible past (extremely abusive parents, with whom she still lives). She was always scared of public speaking (she fainted when she had to do a presentation in front of her class) but she was determined to get rid of, so last weekend she participated in a debate competition. Her team actually won the competition, but it was an extremely traumatising experience, with her anxiety, and she was extremely stressed out. She keeps believeng that she performed horribly. On monday we met and she had a psychotic episode, she kept twitching and trying to remove stains from her face that weren t there, then she would laugh maniacally then cry uncontrolably and say that everyone is dissapointed in her and everyone hates her. She calmed down eventually, after about 20 minutes, and she had no recollection of what she did, she just remembered that she was sad. Later throughout the day she had mild, one second hallucinations, but she was generally ok. I didn't worry about it too much, as she had these types of episodes before when she was extremely angry. She would be extremely violent and delusional for about 20 mins and then not remember anything about it. The problem is, because she won, she qualified for the national phase of the competition, and everyone (parents, teachers, friends) are stressing her about it, saying that she should go and not dissappoint everyone. This was so stressing for her that when we met again yesterday she had another psychotic episode, more violent and being generally more stressed and repeating that no one loves her, no one appreciates her, everyone is dissapointed in her and being distrustful of me and asking me to leave her alone and all that. After that she calmed down, again not remembering anything, and then she had another episode, much more mild, (it might have just been a panick attack), in which she was scared that she was going crazy. But all throughout the day she just seemed out of it and she was distrustful of me and everyone else, talking gibberish and losing focus oftenly. As I hear, she had another episode in class, where she was much more violent and actually hit someone (i think it helps her a lot when I am next to her during an episode as she is less violent and calms down more easily when I tell her reassuring stuff). When evening came I just couldn't let myself send her home and we went to a hotel. As soon as she realized she wasn't going home her state improved visibly. She had mild hallucinations that she doesn't remember, but no episode and she seemed much better. Today she was in almost normal state, though she had nightmares abour the competition, and she said that she feels normal again (she doesn't remember her episodes but she is aware of her horrible mood). While she was calm I tried convincing her of seeing a therapist together, but she panicked and refused vehemently saying that she can solve her problems on her own and that she did that before. She s at home now and she says she feels ok. I don't know if that will last, so that's why I wrote this. I am begging you help me. Do you know what this is? How can I convince her to go to therapy?

"Please help me Hi, I'm sorry your friend isn't doing well. There is a great book called ""I'm not sick, and I don't need help"" By Amador. I recommend this book for anyone dealing with a someone experiencing anosognosia or the lack of insight into their illness. The book provides strategies for helping people help themselves. Insight is challenging without medication. Getting treatment (medication that works) may help. I've found my experience improved with medication. Therapy helps now that I'm in recovery, but I doubt therapy alone is enough for psychosis. If she is a threat to herself or others, you want to reach out and get help. Some places have a crisis intervention team - Usually made up of a mental health professional, police officer, and medical support person. Hope that helps. Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Please help me Update: I convinced her to see a psychotherapist specialized in CBT, and we will go there tomorrow. Today when we met she was ok most of the time, but went into a panick attack when she remembered the therapy she undertook last year and after that she went in and out of panick attacks, most of which she doesn't remember, but all were mild, short and non violent. About that crisis intervention team, calling one of those automatically means institutionalization? Because I believe that right now, that would only do her more harm. She is extremely scared of being institutionalized, so scared that I believe her state would worsen, and her feelings toward me go to hatred. Anyway, overall, her state was clearly improved. I just wrote this because honestly, it has been very traumatizing for me as well, and I need to express this somewhere. It's horrible seeing your partner like that, especially when there is nothing you can do to calm them down."
"Erotomania with a twist... In 2015, I overdosed on an antipsychotic prescribed to me to augment my antidepressant. At the time, I was with my girlfriend of 6 years. I became psychotic. I started believing I was going to save the world, and I was psychic and this friend of mine was going to fall in love with me. I was convinced she was my soulmate. Arrogant, no? Problem. Two weeks earlier she proposed to her fiancee. I felt like I kept seeing signs that she was in love with me. She clipped her toenails because I complained they were long and I was convinced that really meant something. Giving me special looks, hinting she was going to fall for me. I had serious erotomanic delusions. I told a mutual friend all of the signs I was seeing. So I was convinced I was seeing all these signs and broke up with my girlfriend. I had liked this friend for probably 7 years. The night I broke up with my girlfriend, I went to her house. I was delusional and thought if I was there when my girlfriend got home from work, I was going to literally die. Anyways, that night an affair started. I was convinced it was destined to be. I told her I knew she was in love with me and she was my soulmate etc etc. I told her I was a psychic and it was our destiny to be together. At first, I believe it was just an ego boost for her. She was telling everyone the affair was in my head as a cover up for having an affair with me... It wasn't until someone caught us kissing that she fessed up. She eventually fell really hard for me. My own erotomania somehow presented the conditions for her her actually fall for me. I just find that hilarious and such a great self fulfilling prophecy. Anyway, since I thought I was psychic and she was my soulmate it presented pretty poor conditions for realizing I was delusional. I even spoke to a psychiatrist and he said I was fine. Since I thought I was psychic, predicted her falling for me I thought my other delusions were also real. I eventually ended things when I realized what I was doing was wrong. I told her fiancee about the affair for the third time. A month or two ago, I dropped off a letter to my ""soulmate"" apologizing for exposing the affair. After I dropped off the letter, I checked her instagram and she put a bunch of ""inside jokes"" in the comments and even uploaded a video of our song. I thought maybe she wanted to tell me she forgave me. The unfortunate part was that I asked her why she did this and did not respond. She blocked me and I'm sure she's telling her fiancee that I'm seeing ""signs"" again. Hurts to have my credibility insulted like that. It seems vindictive of her. Not only did she cover the affair for a while telling everyone it's all in my head, now she's putting in legitimate messages that only I would understand. It's frustrating, but I wanted to share my story. Briefly psychotic women whose delusions became self-fulfilling. This was what I told my ""soulmate's"" fiancee before she fell for me. Understandably, when she started falling for me it cemented my delusions pretty securely: rachel, it's ashley. i need to talk to you. this is very important, i know you must have so much hurt inside i need to talk to you and explain and i am unfortunately going to cause a car crash in your relationship i'm talking to you as a soul that sees you have a kind soul you are going to go through some very hard times ahead and i'm sorry to do this to you both i never wanted to hurt your relationship because i know how sweet you are when i look in your eyes i see myself i have ripped her walls right open at the most important part of your relationship everything has to be this way and everything had to be this way i was meant to be the test in your relationship i will bring a lot of pain into your life and you may never understand why but it's my destiny and yours and hers goodbye and i hope you stay strong , okay? but you need to be prepared for what is coming and you will grow"
"Are these DD symptoms... I've been accused of cheating since marriage and at first, I chalked it up as normal jealousy like all of my buddies talked about but they are all divorced now and ironically, I'm still the one married that never cheated and puts up with all of the accusations still because I love my wife for better or worse. I've thought about leaving and I decided to move out for a few months to see if a break would wake her back up to reality but that just led her into depression until I returned. Since then, she promised to get help and do whatever it takes and acknowledged she has a problem. I never knew to how pervasive her thoughts were because she acts so normal until we go out and have drinks. She can't go out without drinking or she is anxious and bored and if she has one too many, the night goes from fun to accusations and conspiracy theories over anything I do! Then I find out all about the thoughts she has been having all month that make her believe I'm cheating. Anything can trigger these accusations and her logic behind everything never makes any sense and the next day she breaks down and cries and apologizes and realizes her story is so far fetched! Then I forgive her..we make up and go on with our life until the next time we go out. The problem is, she can't stop these thoughts from entering her mind throughout the day but she doesn't react to them until we go out to a bar, club, party or even on vacation where we are around other people. It doesn't matter where we go, it could be all the way to Cancun and if we meet some random nice couple and start to socialize, out of no where, I'm accused of personally knowing them and setting up this whole trip in order to meet them and make her look stupid. I've had to cancel trips and make up excuses why we leave friends parties or events as soon as I get accused of something. At first, I thought all girls were like this that are insecure but we've been married 25 years now and it's obvious to me not everyone is going through this much. So basically, we have no friends left because I've pretty much given up on trying to salvage any types of relationships. I've been living in a bubble like her, only focusing on work and family. I go straight to work and home and have gotten off facebook. No one knows or seems to care why because they think we are probably stuck up by now. No matter what I have done to prove my innocence, the issue still persists but we are now trying everything possible with natural remedies instead of prescription drugs. She is totally on board to try anything because she realizes now more than ever when others and our own kids have had to correct her accusations about me. One time, she thought I was up in a VIP section of the club laughing and mingling with a group and when I showed up behind her after returning from the restroom, she was totally shocked how I could go from upstairs in the VIP right behind her!! She thinks I'm a magician!!! She still tells me it's not rational but her mind still tries to figure out how I did that trick! Another time, I decided to wear my punk rock ring I haven't worn for over 10 years out to the club and she thought some sort of mistress at the club gave it to me as a message to her and got so upset! She said I never owned that ring and thankfully, we took pictures of ourselves before leaving the house that night and when she saw the ring on my finger in the picture, she broke down crying and felt stupid!!!! But guess what!! Soon after she still tried to figure out if I pulled another stunt to trick her!! Like I wore it on purpose to make her think that way! I don't really want to give up going out, having friends and having a social life and we both enjoy traveling but it's like playing russian roullette planning, getting all excited, buying tickets, airfare, etc just to end up fighting and leaving, losing the money and feeling frustrated once more. I know one thing is for sure, alcohol does not help with this problem! She does not react to these thoughts all month, but when we go out and drink, she has no power over them and everything comes out and I never know what the trigger is going to be so I'm always on egg shells and can't be myself but then it's not right because it's perfectly ok for her to talk to others and laugh but if I do...something is up. No one knows she has this problem I'm dealing with because she covers it up really good in public but will start accusing me in my ear or with a look or pinch and that's when I know it's time to leave because I've tried reasoning with her and it just escalates. She doesn't trust me or anyone else when these thoughts occur and thinks everyone is laughing at her. Is this Delusional Disorder or is there more to them?"
"My First Post Hi everyone! This is my first time finding this site and finding out about DD. I was researching online just trying to understand what my wife is going through mentally so I can be more helpful and this really sounds like what she might have. We haven't seen anyone about this but 10 years ago we did try a marriage counselor and all the female counselor did was reinforce her beliefs that I must be cheating because her beliefs sound real. We got married at 18 and have been married over 25 years. We were H.S. sweethearts and everything was good except the occasional jealousy and insecurities I thought was normal. It's kept getting worse over the years and it's been hard dealing with the jealousy, conspiracies, panic attacks, anxiety and isolation from friends and family because of it. I guess the warning signs were always there but I always thought her jealousy and insecurities were just normal so I tried to do everything possible like setting up gps on my phone so she knows where I am at all times! Going to the gym at lunch so I have no life outside working hours! I will even give her my phone in a moments notice If I'm accused of anything. We do practically everything together! I mean, if you saw our life on facebook, you'll see that we are inseparable and always doing stuff together which would be great if I didn't also have to isolate myself from everyone. I certainly love being with my wife and all of the fun activities we do, but the problem is whenever we meet others, it triggers her jealousy and conspiracy thoughts against everyone. For example, we can travel all the way to Cancun and end up meeting a really nice couple but somehow I know them and planned this entire trip to meet them and didn't tell her! One time I signed us up for a party bus tour in Vegas and the hostess recognized my name over the phone and came over and said ""Hi, I'm the one you talked to on the phone"" and the night was ruined from the start! All of the sudden, I knew her personally and it's all a setup and she felt stupid thinking we are trying to fool her so we end up in a big fight and ditch the tour. I keep trying with my wife because I love her but it gotten to the point with money and accusations that I'm at a breaking point. I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't because no matter what I give up, there's always a new accusation. I must have a secret phone she doesn't know about! I have spent so much money on vacations that we cancel as a result and have to be so careful and refrain from talking to any strangers or it's a conspiracy! It's been hard on me and I know that she literally can't help it. She is suffering with these thoughts and will break down crying and apologizing the next day and it hurts me because I can't help her and I suffer from the frustration and pain I feel with the one I love not being able to trust me and the frustration I feel having to give up a life outside of our relationship too. No one knows about this struggle because we both hide these issues and just conveniently leave parties and events by making up some other excuse but the real reason is that my wife just came over and questioned my whereabouts when I had to go to the bathroom. I've learned that it's better to leave without fighting by getting her out of there ASAP instead of things escalating into more serious accusations that I upset me even more. We've had too many nights where we were lucky to make it home so now we just show up and leave just to make our presence known. Sometimes I think the night is going so well we stay later but all it takes is one too many drinks for her to bring out everything shes been holding in the entire week or month I had no clue about! I have left her once for a few months just to see if a break would help and that just put her into depression. Since then, she has acknowledged her problem and has opened up to me much more about it and I've been shocked and hurt to find out some things she has been thinking about She deals with these conspiracy thoughts on a regular basis but I never notice until we go out. I like to have fun and socialize and drink, gamble, dance, etc but that's when the real problems come out because I never know what the trigger is going to be tonight! She is the type that can't have fun without drinks or she'll just be bored but if she drinks one too many, her conspiracy thoughts spiral out of control and we have to leave before it gets worse! Anyways, we are trying natural remedies because I seriously do not want my wife on drug care. Has anyone ever found any natural remedies that actually work?"
"Delusional Jealousy - so tired of it I've been dealing with delusional jealousy with my wife for almost 3 years. We have 3 kids (17, 15, 8 ) so it's been stressful trying to maintain a sense of normalcy for them while living with the chaos of this illness. We've been married almost 24 years. We have been through both counseling and psychiatric care. The counselor and psychiatrist both agree that my wife has delusional jealousy and she was given medications: Risperdal - seemed to help a little but caused weight gain so she quit taking it. Seroquil - turned my wife into a zombie. The doctor never could find a level that didn't almost make her catatonic. She couldn't function as a parent in this state. She hasn't been on any medications for about 2 years now and refuses to attend counseling because in her view the last counselor was on my side because I paid the bill. I've encouraged her to find a different counselor but she refuses and it won't do any good if I find another one. All of the counseling in the world won't help if she just adds each counselor that doesn't agree with her to the idiot list. There is at least one difference between our problem and most of those I have read here (and elsewhere). My wife's delusional jealousy does not involve accusations of infidelity. She doesn't accuse me of sexual relationships with other women but instead accuses me of looking at other women. Now, mind you, when my wife says ""looking"" it sounds like a sex act. It's hard to put down in words just how debilitating this issue is. I've made major changes to my life to reduce her stress as much as possible like dropping my YMCA membership (women there), TV (women), woodworking magazines (a few women there), the newspaper (yep, women there too). When I drive to work (3 mile residential type driving) she calls me on the way and asks me how many women I have looked at. She picks out women we see regularly in the neighborhood as my ""friends"". She's not accusing me of having sex with them, just leering at them. She even picks out women at church that I am supposed to be leering at. And to really twist the knife she usually points out some other guy (just like me) and says ""Joe, wasn't looking at other women"". My most cruel experience with DJ was when my father was in the hospital last summer close to death (end stage Alzheimer's) and I had to stay in the hospital with him. In addition to the stress of my father being near death I had to hear constantly from my wife about ""What women are you looking at"". I also was expected to drive the back roads from my city to my father's so that I wouldn't see any billboards with women on them. Our families have been of no help. My family believes that ""I let my wife behave this way"", even though she is mentally ill. Her side doesn't know at all and even though I think my mother-in-law would understand and help my wife doesn't want them to know. I'm reaching the end of my patience, my wife seems to be getting progressively worse. I have stuck around in what is a toxic situation for me to allow my children to live with both parents but it's getting to the point where I think the children would be better off with us apart. I would love to hear from anyone who has had experience with delusional jealousy not involving accusations of infidelity."
"Yes - that behavior can be a pain in the butt, even from normal women. It is over exagerated with DD women. My wife has been in and out of that syndrome. When she and I were first dating, we would make a joke out of it. She would pick out the women she thought I would probably go for. I would say, ya she's got a nice ??whatever??, but not as nice as yours. Several years after we got married, and she put on some weight, her whole attitude changed, and I got a similar treatment as you describe (before her DD). My response was to be careful where I looked when she was with me. Strangely, knowing what I know today, during her worst DD she was more like she was at the beginning of our relationship, with a more open mind. However, I did get accused of - not flirting - but making contact with ""them"" through another women whose job it was to make sure that we would split up. (Almost a self fulfilling prophecy.) When you are by yourself, don't drive yourself nuts trying to prove what you are not doing. Don't feel guilty for looking - what she doesn't know won't hurt her, and mainly, there is no way you will ever convince her of what you are not doing."
"rubystar wrote: I have read that you're supposed to do the opposite of what your doing. In a way I think you are enabling her behavior to continue. You should do the things you enjoy, don't engage with her over her accusations. If she accuses you of infidelity don't reward her by explaning your innocence, leave the premises If you can. Eventually she will learn her accusations will make you leave, and I believe she'll try to control herself to prevent an unwanted outcome. If she is isolated encourage her to take classes, or pursue and interest she has. I think social isolation makes this condition worse, you don't want her have a lot of free time to focus on you. Yes, it seems my wife isn't the only one ignoring what the counselor tells them . I received this same advice from our counselor about 18 months ago and was unable/unwilling/scared to put it into practice. My wife gets so stressed and angry at anything that doesn't go her way I've been reluctant to force the issue. She behaves like a 3-year old and says horrible things without consideration whether our children are present or not. Of course, at this point, I don't think matters could get any worse so it's probably time to do it and not worry about her behavior. Thanks so much for your response.

In my wife's case she says that she didn't realize that married men like to look at women. She does say that it's perfectly normal for non-married men to look at women but that when we get married we're supposed to undergo some change that makes us no longer interested in other women. I have become the biggest liar on the planet dealing with this issue. I routinely tell my wife lies (didn't see any women on the way to work, she's not attractive, etc.) just to avoid a fight. I feel bad about lying to my loved one but I'd rather not spend an hour fighting about nonsense. Thanks for your response. Reading your experiences has certainly helped me understand that there are others out there going through this."
"For me, whether being accused of ""just looking"" or actual infidelities, the basic issue is lack of trust. My ex never got that, that it wasn't about sex, it was about him thinking I was not trustworthy. And that transcended mental illness to me - what was causing his distrust was almost irrelevant. The fact that he did not trust me ended the marriage. It got to the point, and still is there, that he didn't believe anything I said because he is delusional & believes I lie about everything, and I couldn't believe anything he said because he is delusional & believes the untrue things he says. Just a lose-lose situation all around."
"I am glad I just came to this forum because I have been diagnosed with d/do persecutory type after coming back from Iraq. Well I will tell you this This illness is a pain. Before I was in Iraq I was good no delusions or anything, just a normal soldier doing a job. well when I came back I was very controlling very jealous and all kinds of other crazy crap. Well I met my now fiance who has stuck by me the whole time and without her I would have been lost. Well it has been a whole year and a half since I have been diagnosed and since then I have wanted to get better and better. With these guys you have to make them think that what they think is not true. Its a pain I know but they also have to be willing to give up their delusion. To be honest the medication was worse then the illness itself so don't always count on that either. Well let me tell you something if you have an extremely jealous person and they are afraid of you having sex with somebody or cheating on you then tell them go do it themselves if they are so scared of you cheating on them tell them to find out why other women or men would cheat and have them cheat on you. So they know about it. Its a fear of unknown to these people they don't know about it and they themselves are very loyal and very rightous per say. Tell them that its o.k. to feel a little bit jealous but don't get out of hand. The Truth is they love you a lot and they truly care about you more then you will ever know. They just don't know about cheating and are afraid to be lied to. they have to be insightful and willing to talk to other people like mental health professionals and even research their illness. Inform them on whats out there. BUT DON'T FORCE IT ON THEM, if you know anybody that has these symptoms and would like to talk to me just send me an email at pvtromeroarmyapg@yahoo.com and put something about delusional disorder on it and I would be willing to write or call if you want."
"delusional jealousy I have been in a similiar situation, and am brokenhearted. I met the man of my dreams over two years ago after being a single mom for years. He was everything I had dreamed about - tall, goodlooking, tender, hard working, family oriented. We became engaged, and right after that problems started. He accused me of looking at men no matter where we went or what we did. I would reassure him that I looked at everbody when we were out - men, women, children. Normal to do when out in public - you look at the world around you! He would say I stared at them, and they stared back. He said some would look at him and smirk or wink. He mistrusted everone, and analyzed to the nth degree everything everyone said or did. It became so bad I was afraid to lift my head in public. Even that was not enough. We started going to counseling, first him alone and then us together. When the counselors just talked to him, they seemed to think he had a legimitate view. But when they heard the other side, they started to see things differently, which made him angry. He was convinced I somehow had dazzled them to my way of thinking. He has absolutly no insight to the condition, and refuses to even consider it. He never accused me of actually being unfaithful, only looking at men. But he carries it to the next step inside and thinks that I will someday. I love him with my whole heart, and could never think of another man. But I don't think he will ever get that. We have been living like this quite awhile. He has left a couple of times before, and left again this week. Even though this relationship has caused me so much anguish, I can not seem to let go. I keep chasing the dreams I had when I first met him. I think this leaving may be different though - he has been out of contact and very cold. So maybe that is what it will take - for him to end it. I don't think I am strong enough to - no matter how much I read about it, and the negative prognosis, I can not seem to believe it."
"nowformerfiance Read Faithful's posts. You can pick up her story almost anywhere you see her name in this forum. She has had much bitter experience like yours. You are lucky, though. You have a chance to get out before you get married and get sucked in deeper. If he left you, let him go. It will be the best thing you can do for yourself. If he comes back, run the other way."
"Delusional Jealousy - so tired of it My wife has the same problem and has no insight. When I tell her about it she just tells me that I want to trick her this way. Have 2 children otherwise would have ended the marriage. She has attacked me physically for thinking I have thoughts about other women. Unfortunately has happened that she threw the food and kicked her and I'm on an intervention order now which most likely would end in 2 weeks but not very willing for it to end. mainly worrying about my kids. Unfortunately doesn't even seem would be a tablet or solution to it, so disappointing."
"Random events controlling me When I was clearer I sometimes heard a new fancy word and then a day or two later hear it again like it was trending. Happend to you before? After a little stress and a abbuse of L-Tryptophan and 5-HTP Now I have these invasive thoughts. Z happens I think its because of Y somethimes even X is there to support them. I googled a character from Southpark called Tweek because he has tics Next day a new Season started and I looped in my head . I thought I would cut my mothers trees and she calls me rightaway. Later that day I bring a Bandaid to kid that fell on the street then a long time friend wrote to me. The feeling is like paranoia however lobbying for their traid. For example I would hear and see constantly planes (I like planes) When I quit my job because everyone was sniffing I got four letters with the same month paycheck. I am antisocial as of now every cough or look makes me angry because I´m in my own head the whole time. If anyone has ideas as of what I could research, let me know please, Joshua"

Random events controlling me My family and GP know of the situation. I am however scared to take anti-psichotics. After 3 Months of falling I get some peace from time to time. Excercise and Concentrating on Tasks give instant relief. ACC and Tyrosin seam to eliminate almost all the delusions. I hope that I can bounce back to a more realistic perception. I fear that I will carry triggers. Thank you for caring and for letting me write
"Random events controlling me Dealing with triggers is hard. I have them occur sometimes in the real world. The most important part for me, at least, is to try to dismiss it as fast as possible or change my situation or start surrounding myself with people.

"Random events controlling me Yeah, getting with people and do stuff is building me up and breathing is helpful to keep a straight pokerface. Its like when I´m alone I talk to myself with tweaks every thing makes a certain noise and random noise is corresponding. With adrenaline all is chill however without it I´d like to flight and hide. I hope that all the toxins and deppendecies wear out."
Random events controlling me I went with a swollen ear to my GP and came back with Risperidon. My delusions are very subtle nowadays and I dont know what to do. The subconscious wants the med; I don´t want to do anything. I am not scared of the side effects even if I should be. I just don´t want to mess up my personality again. I´m 22 and feel like I´m a 100 and always looking back to what a man I was.
"Random events controlling me It doesn't sound like these events are ""controlling"" you in anyway. Your thoughts seem to be linked to events in a way that could very well be a coincidence, but even a pure coincidence will be experienced as a bit trippy. I would suggest steering clear of the belief that there really is a connection. Maybe there is, maybe there isn't. Time will tell. Or maybe it won't, who knows."
"Random events controlling me Life is random I guess however its like everything is laughing at you (e.g. wood cracks, banging car doors), trying to destroy my composure. The event puts seeds of evil in my mind like: hey they arent looking you can steal candy. Then another noise happens and says we know what you thought. In conversations I´m on a other level and I act on it sadly automatical. Staying clear of these thoughts sounds healthy."
"Random events controlling me So, is it like your conscience or something? Your subconscious, super-ego, what ever you want to call it. Part of you feels that your behaviour is unacceptable, so you're quick to jump on any opportunity to justify to yourself that your behaviour really is unacceptable, by personifying your environment and believing it is sending your messages. Realise that the messages you are getting are probably just your own mind, and what your mind is telling you might not be correct. I read something about challenging your deeply held beliefs... so what beliefs do you think you hold that are leading you to have these interpretations of events? These feelings of being laughed at, of being watched?"
"Random events controlling me You are on the right track. When I was 21 my ""super ego"" resonated with my actions and my body language. Then somehow ""id"" creeped into my head. E.g: I could ignore girls and stay super cool. Now: I look at butts or act in a way that they think I do. When I was young someone told me that conscience are like two beasts and the fattest wins. However its like both have a dark humor and dont really care what happpens. My moral compass is still the same my perception is just funky."
"Spouse Responding Well To Meds In order to give others hope I wanted to share my story, the upshot of which is that Delusional Disorder is very amiable to treatment if the sufferer is prepared to take their medication. You can read my other posts about my wife to see some of the symptoms that I have been dealing with for the last 7 or 8 years. My wife was classic DDJ and paranoid. Although my last post was in 2014, in 2015 things really went down hill in a major way. By the end of the year my wife was in hospital (for 5 weeks) and had a court order baring her from our home or contact with our kids. While in hospital they tried everything to get her better, and finally risperidone worked and her delusions lifted in the space of a few days. Since then she has moved back into our home and reconnected with the kids. She is a brand new person and is definitely back to the woman I originally fell in love with and married. She is very remorseful about all the harm she has caused, but she is not letting it get her down and is powering ahead with life. She has been great now for over 6 months and I haven't seen any signs of delusions or unusual behavior. We are fortunate that we can afford the injectable version of Risperidone (its not covered by our insurance), so I can administer it and I don't need to rely on her taking her meds, which I know is a huge win for the prospects of continued success with her treatment. (I know 6 months is not a long time and I am not declaring victory by any means and will always be on guard, but so far so good ) Good luck to everyone out there and know that this condition is treatable. AM"
"Spouse Responding Well To Meds Congrats! The prognosis for this illness is so bleak, it's great to hear that you're having success. I hope you don't mind me asking you some questions. What eventually landed your wife in the hospital? Was it a psychotic episode? What other drugs has the hospital tried? How were you able to regain enough trust from her to allow you to be in charge of administering the drug? Do you see the psychiatrist with her? What about a therapist? DDJ ended my marriage more than a year ago. Recently, my ex-wife went through some stuff that didn't make sense to her. After taking to me for a few days, she's open to seeing a psychiatrist. Any advice from you is much appreciated. Thanks."
"Spouse Responding Well To Meds Hi, To answer your questions: What landed my wife in hospital: Her delusions became much worse and I knew I needed to do something drastic. I initially just went to the police and said I think my wife is going to be a danger to the kids. The immediately send a mental health elevator and they convinced her to go to hospital. However she was released after a few hours as they said that while she was delusional she wasn't a danger. She tried to run away with the kids a few days later and the police managed to stop her (very dramatic!). At that point they put her under a supervision order (myself and some others to be the supervisors). About a month later she was very delusional and I tried to stop her waking up one of the kids (to look for microphones in her bedroom!!) and she attacked me. That was great in retrospect as now there was evidence that she might be a danger. I immediately called the police (who were very familiar with our house at this point) and they removed her from the house. She was brought to hospital for a couple of days but she refused meds and they released her. In that few days a court put a baring order on her and she was not allowed see the kids. About a week later (she was living in a hotel at this point) she checked herself into a mental health facility and ended up in there for about 5 weeks (she tried to leave a day after checking in, but they felt her condition was too bad so they forced her to stay - best thing that happened to my family). What order drugs did we try? Abilify was the only other dug we tried. It has no effect at all. Risperdal worked immediately. How did she trust me to administer? Once on risperdal her delusions lifted and she became very aware of how ill she was. She was very sorry for all the trouble she caused and is very complient in allowing me to administer the drug. Did we see a psychiatrist together? Yes. I suggested that we needed to see a therapist as ""marriage counseling"", but it was just a ploy to get her to see a professional. The counseller we saw was very good and picked up on her mental health condition within 2 sessions. He convinced her she was suffering from anxiety and maybe depression and got her to see a psychiatrist. Although he prescribed Abilify to her she never took it. All this was before she ended up in hospital and although the docs didn't manage to cure her until the court order on the kids came down, it was very helpful for me to have them as a support network. It was also useful with getting the court order sorted as they were able to give evidence of her mental health issues. Hope all is well with your wife! If you have other questions please just let me know. Kind regards. -- Fri May 05, 2017 5:53 pm -- Hi, To answer your questions: What landed my wife in hospital: Her delusions became much worse and I knew I needed to do something drastic.

"Is this psychosis? I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and I've read that people with this disorder can have psychotic symptoms. I've been briefly part of the Tumblr community, but from what I've read of those posts, none of those people seem to have psychotic symptoms; or, if they have, they don't talk about them. I find that a bit weird, because I struggle a lot with psychotic symptoms. I've had four psychotic episodes in the last three years. To summarize: I was certain I was a dead famous personality; I was certain I was a completely different person that travelled in time from the 19th century; I was certain I had multiple personalities and I showed signs of personality dissociation, according to my therapist; I was certain a person in my life wanted to harm me. Aside from that, I also have hallucinations. They are minor, just shadows I see and sometimes when I look back when I'm walking I see people that aren't there. Occasionally I have terrible hallucinations of monsters jumping towards me and I hear things that aren't there. I've never heard voices in my head (except for the time when I thought I had dissociative personality disorder). My therapist and my psychiatrist never told me if this is psychosis. I've never really discussed these episodes with them (except for the third one), and they never gave me a diagnosis for these symptoms. They only gave me the borderline diagnosis after I pushed them for it, because I fit the entire criteria for the disorder, but, while my therapist diagnosed me, my psychiatrist was reluctant because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. I'm asking this because I was wondering if I should get a separated diagnosis for psychosis. These episodes are frequent, they last for months and sometimes I have delusions even when I am on medication."
"Delusions caused Hi, I don't have a psychotic spectrum illness but I do have OCD. I also have Aspergers. Aspergers alone doesn't cause much more than social difficulty but when that's combined with OCD it makes for a very weird situation. So before you read on, just make sure to keep in mind when I say races I don't mean stuff like Black and White, but more like genetic bits of information that are in all of us. I'm not a physical actual racist. I feel like some races are there to destroy others, that the world is a battle between the good and bad, and that we must stop or eliminate the dangerous ones. Some are conspiring against others, and their whole purpose is to infect the clean races with degenerate and inferior DNA to destroy the rest. I am a member of the failed species, so I must be stopped and detained. Usually the races that are the same have similar features. The bad races are caused by viral infections that mutate and breed inside of humans, and with each generation of human children distortion occurs. Also, the bacteria is not from earth. It was engineered by the hidden forces. I do not yet know what these hidden forces are. There is only a matter of time before the bad races take over us all. Any of us (I'm already one) could also be bad races! It's scaring the hell out of me. The bad races typically have ugly features (I'm extremely ugly, and sometimes as I'm walking around I can clearly distinguish the ugly ones, but many other people can't because they live in denial of the ugly features"". The media is run by the bad ones, who try to make us feel like beauty is not an ideal, and that ugliness must be accepted. I could just go on and on, so I'm going to stop here. I also feel like the universe is empty, save for a few particles. We exist in a ""dream"" state, and our whole world is just part of the imagination of some massive entity. We are a disorder, a virus, of this massive entity, so it tries to rid us from the world by causing this horrible disease that kills us called DEATH I've gone into hiding and I feel like shooting myself in the leg because I'm absolutely disgusted by these thoughts, but I'm at a loss for what to do. I believe them, and the only thing that keeps me from going out there and preaching my beliefs is the fact that people who are close to me tell me they're not true. Also I have 30-40 people on the street come up to me and physically threaten me because of my ""neo-Nazi beliefs???"". I'm not a neo-Nazi! I truly believe this, and for some reason no matter how many facts I read I can't shake it. If it helps to say this, I am on a medication, which could be causing these thoughts."
"An observation? Maybe? Hey, so I was reading about how antipsychotics work in the brain and the chemicals that they deal with also are used for many things in the brain and body including memory. Now I usually have very bad memory especially when it involves directions or locations. But recently ive been doing a lot better in reguards to my depression and also in reguards to my directional memory. I know how to get places that ive only been to once over a year ago, something that i would never have been able to do before. But how is it working, I thought. What makes the most sense is that the meds that ive been taking are disrupting the government signal thats being transmitted through the microchip. The signal was blocking my memory of how to get places so that i would be easier? To control? Or keep track of? Or something like that. I think that the signal is being broken up somehow? The meds I guess. But that leads me to wonder why the government hasn't intervened? Just a working theory. But it makes some sense, right?"
"An observation? Maybe? I'm not going to say whether your theory is right or wrong, who am I to say that anything is anything in this world? Society is a big place with big technology. I think everything is possible and nothing is possible and I'm pretty sure my real self lives in a spiritual limbo and not this physical reality. I have my own theories. They're a work in progress somewhat. Anyway, I'm sorry you're having to sit in this confusion and frustration, especially when you're also feeling threatened, it's not easy. If you want to hash theories back and forth or talk or whatever, message me or reply to this or something. I like living in the world in my head because I'm in charge half the time."
"Just want to get something off my chest Hi all, I am a 19 yo, was diagnosed with psychosis about a year ago. I am currently being treated for it but the stress overwhelms me sometimes, there is something that I really want to get off my chest and it is quite serious and a heavy topic so if your not in the mood I suggest not reading any further. Its about this election this year. During my psychosis I became paranoid that Donald Trump was supposed to represent me and the reason he is so hated is because people really hate me. That sounds crazy but it honestly really stresses me out so I just want to say, Im sorry I voted for him. I am not a hateful person really, in fact I hate racism, bigotry, evil, hatred, those are all wrong. The only reason I voted for him is because I wanted to support myself, and love myself more. I believed that the hatred towards him was actually towards me, and so I cast my vote simply for myself. I have since come to my senses, and after seeing his administration in action, I just want to say i deeply regret my decision. Since then, I just want to say that I have come to love the left side, I fully support black lives matter, I love the liberal movement, LGBT community, feminism, and I have always supported marijuana. I hate the wave of racism and bigotry that has swept this country, and I believe that I might actually have played a hand in causing it in the first place. I am deeply sorry for this. I have come to hate the entire right side and I believe that their message of ignorance and hate is wrong. Most of all though, I am sorry for what I have done and the hateful things I have felt towards such kind, and loving people. Overall I just want to say that Hate is wrong, and love is right. i believe in this with all my heart and I am disgusted by how much racism and hatred has grown after the election. I am sorry, to the left side. Black lives DO matter, and my attitude before was just naive, and living in the past... I have grown as a person, and, I just want the world to understand, I believe HATE, is wrong."
"Just want to get something off my chest Hey, it happens. Don't feel bad about it. Your reason for voting for him is unfortunately more rational than those who did. That being said, not everyone who voted for him is a racist, homophobic, sexist bigot. I've heard many reasons that people voted for him and know many blacks, women, and lgbtq who voted for him too. Voting for a $#%^ candidate doesn't make you a bad person, especially when the alternative was another $#%^ candidate. This is coming from someone who hates the two party system too, and is involved in the lgbtq community. DX: Nihilist"
"Am I delusional? Hey I will try to be honest about my question, my aunt introduced me to tarot when I was 13. Its always been an interest for me and I'm good at it. Recently, she confined in me and we are from a family of very powerful women and that I know things otherz sdont know. Like a good witch. Now I believe I was chosen to keep the traditions of our ancestors and help people know theyre future. I am schizo affective and take abilify. Is this a false belief or are their others who also have medium powers and a mental illness?"
Am I delusional? my experiane was thet i was the only proven psycic as in telepathy i though perpole were under cover that and did not want to let me know my power full power. there were pepole following me thats a fact or at least a reduclas amont of coincededs . it ended up with me thinking i was studied arun the word this led onto voices and visions smells and my skin crawling at times it started like you said a above the im the guiniuss ones ran along the same lines i have scitzo affective disorder bipolar type
"Am I delusional? Belief in a religious concept does not make you delusional. What you have described so far seems typical and commonplace among witches. However, such a thing could easily turn into a delusion sinply because religous beliefs cannot be proven with hard facts. Here are aome helpful stepa I follow to check my religious beliefs against delusions: 1. If you can find scientific facts to prove any part of it, do it. Be mindful, however, of hindsight bias. Once you've researched something it is easier to convince yourself you knew these things in advance (past life memories). 2. Ask yourself if what you believe has any logic to it. What are the moat unbelievable parts? Does your religious community as a whole also believe these things? Are they part of a core doctrine or just specific to you. How did you decide to believe this? If it seems illogical what experiences have you had to confirm your beliefs? How possible is it that these experiences are imagined? Did they happen here and now or in another time? Is there any physical proof of your experience? 3. How do your beliefs affect your life? How do they affect the world around you? Since you atarted believing these things have you or your peers been negatively affected? 4. The last suggestion I have is something you won't want to hear and probably won't believe. Having come from a history of witchcraft, I find that the beat way to ward off major symptoms of mental illness is through prayer, worship, and study of the Bible. It has helped me greatly. Might be worth a shot if you feel yourself slip too far into the dark."
"Am I delusional? I believe so, and there is a difference between religious beliefs and religious delusions. For example, a person may think they are possessed by a demon, which is a delusion. Their religion may believe in the potentiality of possession, but its not directly tied into the doctrine. That being said, I also believe (personally) that religion relies heavily on pushing delusions onto people in order to indoctrinate them. That is just my personal bias. However,if you truly believe that you have supernatural powers, then you are delusion. In some cultures this is acceptable, in others it is not. My best advice is to talk to a psychologist.

"I feel like I'm sharing mind with a girl. Help! I hear voices and I think they are real people. They can control my body and they can hear my thoughts. Sometimes I feel like the people who are controlling me are people who suffers from a 'mental disorder' like me and our minds are connected to each other. Then I've had an idea that I can control them and I can enter their minds too. So everytime I think negative thoughts, it will enter their mind and they will think negatively too. I sometimes worry too much for ""them"" because of this. Now I think I'm sharing mind with a girl whom I'm destined to be with, and she's struggling because of me. A curse (because of my past sins) has tied our minds together and we need to find each other to end this curse. The problem is I don't know where to find her and she doesn't know where to find me. (I always ask where to find her but something is blocking/interrupting my mind and I can't understand her answer). I get depressed whenever I think she is hearing voices too because of me. Help me. I know she's real because I can hear and feel her. She can even hug me. I am in love with her. I need to find her. HELP!

"Obsession with fame/""leaving my mark""tw i dont really have a good reason to be writting this here i just feel like i need to be heard. I have attempted suicide many times and have come to the conclusion im a coward. so i stopped trying its been almost a year now since my last attempt. i started thinking of ideas to keep me in the world for what ever purpose. The major thing is i want to be remembered. i want people to think about me when im gone ever people i never met i want someone out there to say they can relate to me. i thought abou how i wanted to try to be a singer/song writter... but lately my thoughts have gotten darker. what if that doesnt work out? i cant even write lately my mind is too busy. i cant focus on one god damn thing. so if that doesnt happen i might as well have wasted my time here in my opinion because that is all i want. i thought about a second plan if that one fails.... im honesly not expecting feedback merely just an outlit because i know everything im thinking right now is gone out of control and my morals are dead, but no matter what i always feel like this in the end... im so sick of pushing things to the side. im going to make an impact on this world one way or another."

"How To Achieve A Realisation In A Delusional Disorder Person I need advice on how to care for my mother who has been diagnosed with Delusional Disorder. She is confused and does not understand that she is mentally ill. The head psychiatrist told me that people with this illness can't realise that what they are experiencing is not reality, although some can achieve it if they are on medication, undergoing therapy and are 'lucky'. We were also told we can't tell her she is unwell or it will break up her relationship with that person, and she will always resent them for it as she will probably always believe it was real. To be honest, the health system that are helping us have been extremely unhelpful and we are really struggling. My mother has not been eating or sleeping well for a while and is under constant surveillance from the family. Although she is not panicking like she used to about the voices she hears and the facts that they tell her are true, she is adamant that she is not unwell. Unfortunately her social worker included me in the conversation of persuading her to take medication. However she has not turned her back on me as a result so far, which she was doing if we said that something was what it was-and not what she thinks it is. As she is not a danger to herself she has to come to some sort of realisation to accept psychotic medication or accept going into the hospital ward again. She did agree to medication when faced with the social workers persuasion, but then quickly went back on it because she doesn't think she is ill. Does anyone know if they can come to realise that they are ill? The head psychiatrist said it as if it is brain chemistry but I can see some people in this community know that it's not real by themselves. I'm wondering if it is chemical or psychological. It's been about a month and we haven't had any evidence or any proof that these 'stalkers' planting things and posting things online exist and are doing what they say they are doing, to her. Our assigned long term planner won't get back to us on a plan for my mother and the social worker hasn't got back to us after my mother said she would take them. Which now she decided she won't. I don't want to loose the bond I have with my mother and I'm scared that while my family are seeking advice on how to deal with this situation, and not tell her she is ill, something will go wrong, and I might loose that bond. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks."
"How To Achieve A Realisation In A Delusional Disorder Person Don't push drugs on your mother. She might have realisation that it has some side effects. Personally I would be thankful if people listened to me when telling them to change the environment and so they change so he ill person can be happy. An mentally ill person might ask for stuff like more silence , calm environment and not making her angry."
"What would happen if anything... Hi everyone, I'm new here and I hope no one minds that I'm posting for advice already. I just I don't have anyone else to talk to about this. I would just like to know if any of you know what could happen if I stop showing up to my CMHT appointments and basically disappear. I've been diagnosed with psychosis. I think it's ptsd. I'm not keen on the medication. They've told me I don't have a choice. I've never been a danger to anyone. I have attempted suicide in the past. Never been hospitalised. Haven't mentioned suicidal thoughts since before Christmas. Told my nurse last week that I wasn't taking the antipsychotics regularly. Have intermittently continued to voice some delusional fears. Have never hallucinated. Thank you for any support or advice you're willing to give. Love."
"What would happen if anything... Hello Nice to hear from you I do not know what CMHT is so I will assume it is some type of therapy or mental health treatment. I dont know if there are any legal ramifications of stopping treatment with this program. As far as stoping treatment. It is always your choice. I believe that my medication and therapy has helped me be less depressed and not hyper focused on my ""delusional"" beliefs which has helped me in my functioning at work and socially. I believe that medication and therapy can be an aid to ""getting out of your own head"" a bit so that you can get a different perspective on how your living life and dealing with stress. Some people just dont want to be on meds, some people cope enough to keep a job or stay in school and some cant function at all and end up on the street. Not saying that might happen to you. I just know how hard it is to keep up your everyday appearances when struggling with psychosis and suicidal thoughts. Its unbearable at times and tolerable at times. Its also something that can improve. Life can sometimes be mentally, horrifyingly painful. Its hard to be in it alone. I would recommend giving treatment another shot and try a different medication, there are a lot of different medications out there and something will work better than something else. Also if you decide that medication is not what you want to do then maybe just therapy to help with coping skills when things get really bad and suicide has come into the picture again. It is good to have social support. Hope all goes well."
"What would happen if anything... Hi, it sounds like you're in a similar situation to me. I became ill after the birth of my second child who's 2in a couple of months. I hated taking meds as I became so sleepy, I put on 5stone in the first 6months and I felt they stopped making me feel like me. Always, what I wanted to say was.....I know I will have to have involvement of some kind from the psychosis team until I've been without a relapse for 2years. But the visits from nurses have become much less frequent. So my advice to you if you are feeling better is to accept that they're in your life right now but know it's not forever. If you play by their rules they will leave you alone sooner. If you did just disappear it will make everything worse in the long run.....I did try that! Xx"
"Looking for help and support I am new to this forum and am desperately seeking support. My boyfriend (now ex?) of 4 years has been experiencing persecutory delusions that have become increasingly worse over the past year. I work in the mental health field and managed to get him to the hospital in early January. Prior to being admitted to the hospital, he started involving me in the delusions...saying that I had knowledge of or was involved in this conspiracy that was happening to him. He believes that some kind of paramilitary mafia like organization is monitoring and surveilling him...invading every portion of his life down to the food he orders and his care providers. While he was in the hospital, he started distancing himself from me...he would hang up on me or tell the nurse to tell me he wasn't available. When I came to visit, he asked me to leave early because I was ""triggering"" him. He discharged from the hospital against medical advice after 10 days and had started refusing his antipsychotic medication several days prior. When he left the hospital, he didn't come home but instead went to live with his parents in a different city. He maintained contact with me for about a week and then broke up with me and cut off contact with me. He then insisted on coming to move his belongings out of the house because he did not feel safe with his things here. After he moved out, he reached out and was apologizing and begging to have me back in his life. This gave me hope and made me believe that our relationship might be able to work. He came to visit the weekend before Valentine's Day and even brought me gifts. He left abruptly on Valentine's Day before we even got to go to dinner claiming that I was evil and had conspired against him with the neighbors. He felt horribly about how he treated me and tried to continue being in contact with me. He then cut off contact with me about a week later insisting that talking to me was keeping him sick. He sent me a heart shaped note in early March that said he would always have hope in his heart for me. I mailed him a sweet greeting card that let him know how much I cared about him and his mom texted me with a message from him. (He destroyed his phone in a fire). He said that he found my card heartbreaking because he needed me to be honest about the ""barriers to trust"" and never wanted to talk to me again. I don't know, but I'm guessing that he wanted me to confess to things that I didn't do. That was almost 2 weeks ago and I have not heard from him since. I feel so heartbroken and am at a loss as to what to do. It seems like reaching out to him makes things worse but I'm having such a hard time letting go because I love him so much. Does he really mean it when he says he never wants to talk to me again? Will I really never hear from him again? Will the distance from me help to dislodge me from his delusional system? Is there anything I can do to offer him my support when he has cut me out of his life like this? I'm already doing everything I know to do to take care of myself but am still having such a hard time. I would greatly appreciate support and any words of wisdom because this really is so difficult for me."
"Looking for help and support Hi Hangingontohope, I'm sorry that your ex isn't well. For me, when the delusions have gone untreated for a length of time, and aren't treated early, they seem to grow deep roots in the memories and corrupt a lot of good history. Thankfully, he doesn't sound like a threat to himself or you. I'm sorry that you have to go through this. Debonding is hard even when everyone involved is sane and healthy. When there is illness, it just feels so wrong. I wrote a book to come to terms with my illness, and try to find acceptance and move on in life letting go of the pieces of my broken puzzle and putting it on the shelf is hard. I found that through taking medication after my first full psychotic episode, the medication helped me gain insight, along with support from friends and family. For me, work is my best therapy. I think it sounds like you've done everything you can to support a path to healing, unfortunately, without insight mental illness is tough on relationships. Even with insight, my family gets tired of hearing my deeper concerns over time. But I rely on them to help guide me along the path of sanity. Relationships are important. I'm sorry this happened to you. I hope you will find healing through your experience and are able to eventually see this as an informative experience for your work in the mental health field. FYI, there is a friends and family forum where we send most of the threads of family and ex's seeking support. You'll hear a lot of heartbreak there, but thanks for reaching out. Hope my message helps. Sincerely, Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
Looking for advice Hello I am looking for some advice about how to live with the diagnosis of delusional disorder. I know that it is just a label and that I know the truth and others just dont believe me. But still i feel like i can not talk to anyone about how i feel. I've had this diagnosis for like a year and a half. In that time i have found no one who will agree with what i believe. No one believes me. I have not told many people about the truth because i know they wont believe and I dont want negative consequences. I dont know what to do. I guess i am just wondering if anyone out there knows what im going through and has any advice for the future?
"Looking for advice Hi TrustMe, Sorry I've been away from the forum for a while. I wanted to respond and say that I hear you. I experienced something so significant, but I couldn't articulate it to the people around me until I wrote it out in a book, and published it with a feminist press. Until my friends and family read my story that I wrote as ""fiction based on a true story"" with a pen name to protect my professional identity, nobody understood me. I felt so isolated and alone with my issue. I could go into details about how I felt like a targeted individual, but it is so taboo... I don't know what your beliefs are that people can't relate to, but mine are at times problematic for me, even having had wikileaks document that the technology exists that make a story like mine not only *possible, but in certain opinions *probable. It is possible that a hacker, cia, or other person with the tools needed to interfere with me, may have actually happened in reality. It is possible that it wasn't all in my head, but the people who love me prefer to think I was just sick, and it was impossible for my new york times app on my iphone to be taken over and controlled by some other force. I don't know at times how best to cope with my memories. I have to focus on the reality that others share with me, and believe that if there was a deeper purpose to my experience it is for me to overcome my internal desire to understand *why. I struggle with this as an emotional learner. Sincerely, Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
How can I help myself? I have been diagnosed with delusional disorder myself. Although i do not believe i am delusional i am still looking for advice on how to deal with everyday things i guess. Some advice would help. I dont know what to do no one believes me. If anyone is family of someone with this please let me know what you go through or what i could do or say to my family who doesn't get it.
"How can I help myself? Hi, Just wanted to say, I felt my delusions deeply when I first started my journey to recovery from delusions. I know what the experience is like to lose your ability to know the real from the unreal as others perceive it. The best advice I have is to focus on things that bring you joy, pleasure, and love. Focus on the light and in time the memories fade. I wish I could have let go of the pain earlier in my journey. I felt so many emotions in response to my perceived experiences. It was challenging to work through the reactions and get back to being the person I want to be. By transforming the negative energy into light, our creative selves can grow and blossom. I used my focus to write about my experience, and that helped when I produced a full length novel to reduce my isolation. Hope that helps. Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Coming to Terms with Diagnosis. Recovery, What to Expect? I'm newly diagnosed and wondering about other's experiences/advice. I'm doing well now but wonder what the future holds. Those who have been diagnosed with DD, what has your experience been like long-term? For me, medication seems to prevent the delusions. And as time goes on the memory of them is less strong. So I'm hopeful. But I'm wondering what the future looks like. Are recurring delusions a problem? How do you come to terms with not trusting your memory of periods of time? What about the lingering thoughts/feelings based on delusions? Does it affect your day to day life? How do you cope? How do I stop worrying about deteriorating, or should I? Any tips for recognizing delusions? So many questions, but I just want to know what it is like for others. And of course would love to hear some hopeful stories."
"Coming to Terms with Diagnosis. Recovery, What to Expect? Dear phindel: My experience with delusions and healing: it is similar to what was depicted in the movie Beautiful Mind. The main character was seeing a group of people throughout his life, talking to them, interacting. At one point he figured: although he was years and decades older, that group of people were still the same age, the girl in the group was always a girl, she never grew up. He had delusions (and hallucinations), believing he was seeing people that were really there. When he figured they weren't really there, every time he saw them, even though he saw them, he knew they weren't real. Over time he saw them less often, and they no longer talked with him. Our delusions get weaker when we identify them. We can still FEEL like they are real, but we get to know the feeling and delusion and prepared, when we feel that way and believe that way, we know it is not true or real. atina"
"Coming to Terms with Diagnosis. Recovery, What to Expect? not a schizophrenic although i was once misdiagnosed with delusional disorder. so i couldn't answer your questions. but just wanted to say that it seems like you're on the right path (getting help and self-insight). wish you lots of luck on your recovery journey, Phindel pumice piece."
"Coming to Terms with Diagnosis. Recovery, What to Expect? Hi, I wanted to share that for me, hope is the most important ingredient in my journey to recovery. Surrounding myself with people who believe in me and can see my strengths goes a long way towards healing, and having work that I enjoy is a wonderful aid in my journey towards healing. I'm in recovery, but still healing from the trauma of my experiences with psychosis. My long standing diagnosis from 2005-2014 was delusional disorder, then I changed providers in 2014 and the diagnosis was reclassified as schizophrenia, but I think the diagnosis is less important than the knowledge that medication (when I take it everyday) is effective for me, and that with time the delusions begin to fade. I wrote a book about my experience because I couldn't find a story other than a beautiful mind to describe my experience, and I have a good ending... Not an ending so much as a beginning of living life surrounded by people I love, who love me too, and healing. My pain over the years from stigma, rejection, and trauma are now a greater challenge than my illness. With medication I find my illness is well controlled. It is an internal struggle to not try to solve the pieces of my delusional thinking that I experienced in 2005, 2006, and 2011 when I was taken off medication or just beginning my journey through mental illness. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Sunny ""I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on."" -Sunnyg"
"Coping with Delusional Disorder? [Note: This post is lengthy because it provides background information and clarification on the question at hand but please take the time to bother to read it anyways.] Hello I am new to this forum and have decided to join because I would like advice from other people pertaining to delusional disorder. I suffer from both bizarre and non bizarre delusions including believing in telepathy(bizarre) and believing people are out to get me (non-bizarre). I have not been officially diagnosed with delusional disorder but I have been having delusions for about 4-5 years. My delusions include believing people can telepathically read my thoughts which would be classified as bizarre delusions as they are considered impossible and unlikely to happen. My other delusions have been thinking people are out to get me,have ill intent,or have said things behind my back which are considered non bizarre as they have the possibility to happen... I do not know if my symptoms truly mean I have delusional disorder as I may be misinterpreting the information of delusional disorder incorrectly but it appears I have it... Moving along...the reason why I am so self aware despite my psychosis is due to my rational mind and belief in science which assures me that telepathy is not possible since there has been no proof of telepathy being possible.The only ""proof"" that has ever been given on telepathy has come from pseudo scientific studies.Meaning people who claim to be scientists and who claim to have proof which in reality isn't proof at all. So thanks to my highly rational scientific mind I am able to realize I am delusional. However the delusions have made my brain develop a pattern of irrational thinking which causes me to be very psychotic despite this realization.Basically the irrational pattern of thinking caused by my psychosis overpowers my rational personality which is why I'm self aware yet psychotic. Thankfully thanks to my rational mind I am at least capable of realizing I have a problem and despite not being able to cope I have decided to go to therapy to unravel my irrational thinking or at the very least get anti psychotic medication... Which brings me to my next statement...I have to wait a couple of years until I can get therapy and antipsychotic medications...I have a hard time making social connections due to my paranoid persecutory paranoid thoughts and due to my overall psychosis which means I lack a support group... Whilst I wait for the ability to go to therapy and take my antipsychotic medications I want to cope,in a relatively healthy way,with the delusions I have so I can socialize and be a regular happy person. So I have thought about drinking when I am the legal age for drinking in my area. As I plan to self medicate for the social anxiety I have by becoming a social drinker whilst I wait for therapy I am left wondering if healthy,controlled,self medication with alcohol is possible for delusional disorder... I am not stating in any shape way or form that I plan to become a alcoholic or refuse therapy/treatment for my delusional disorder. I fully plan and intend to get therapy and medications for my mental illness so I will not harm myself or others and so I can live a healthy happy life. I also plan to drink responsibly as it is my responsibility to do no harm to myself or others. However I am stating that I am considering self medicating with alcohol in a responsible manner to cope with delusions whilst I wait for therapy.Not now but when I am legally allowed to drink alcohol. I would drink responsibly and have no intent on getting excessively drunk only enough to ""take off the edge"". With my background and intentions in mind now clarified that leads me to my actual question. Can I use alcohol,responsibly of course,to cope with delusions,in a safe controlled environment,whilst I am waiting for the opportunity to gain enough money to get therapy and/or anti-psychotic medications? Meaning... Will alcohol be able to help me cope with delusions? I am not sure if it would help but I would like some opinions from other people...Please and thank you"
"Coping with Delusional Disorder? Hello Since for some reason you are unable to get psych help from a professional I would recomend going to support groups for depression or anxiety, you stated that you have some social anxiety. The groups are free and you could probably find something in your area. Also you could call the suicide hotline and ask for free mental health programs in your area if that is something you would be able to do. As for self medication with alcohol, I dont recomend it. It can make the delusions worse and when your not intoxicated you could become depressed. Also even though you have the intent to not get drunk, when you are out with friends it is hard to stop and know your limits, especially since you will be new to drinking and social drinking. If you start relying on alcohol to control your anxiety then it would be very easy for your drinking to get out of hand. Remember no one has the intent to become an alcoholic the drinking just gets out of hand. I have some similar issues with persicutory delusions and social anxiety and I found that when I drank I would just be more likely to talk to people about my beliefs and be more openly passionate about what I know is true and what everyone else knows is false. That could get you into trouble socially, people will most likely not be kind when rejecting your viewpoint and then when your not drunk or under the influence you will have to address what you said and how you acted and try to back peddle to try and convince that person that you are not crazy if you would like for them to still accept you into their social circle. I commend you for reaching out on this forum and for having such incite into your beliefs as such a young age. I feel that professional help would be the best option. You can always talk to me whenever you need."
"Any suggestions on how to help someone who thinks they are normal??? My husband was recently diagnosed with Delusional Disorder (after years of wierd behavior and me and my family knowing something was way off) He never can see how odd his behavior is and thinks it is all me and not him. About 3 years ago he started in on researching a ""plot"" my Dad and I were in on since before my husband and I were even married...he insists we did a ""real estate scam"" on him...and that my Dad is a pedifile (or however you spell it) and has been abusing me since I was 5 up until current ...it is so disgusting the things my husband comes up with. He has outbursts and out of control anger - thinks it is totally justified because of ""all the things we have done to him"". He is up all night long on the internet compiling his ""evidence against me"" - he was up all night Thursday and still on he computer when I got up. Other times he goes to bed at 5am and gets up at 2 in the afternoon. A few mos ago he was having chest pains. I figured it was anziety or depression. After 4 days he felt a bit better. In the middle of the night he left to go to Tucson to visit a friend. On facebook I saw him post that he felt like he was going to die due to sever chest pains. I told him ""well, if you had told me you were going I would have said to wait - not a good idea to make a long drive when you are having chest pains"" and he got all mad at me about it. I told him to go to the hospital (which he did 2 DAYS after getting to Tucson) He had a lot of fluid around his heart which was drained (they said 2 more days he may have died) so I drove out there and arrived at 5 am - his surgery was at 8. He started yelling at me and they had to give him valium before the surgery to calm him down. 5 days later he told me to get the ""F"" out of his room (he was yelling about the real estate scam he thinks i did) and then later that day on the phone he threatened me and the nurse heard it. They involuntarily admitted him to the mental hospital which is where the phychiatrist told me they diagnosed him with delusional disorder. any suggestions on how to get him to see he needs HELP?"
"Any suggestions on how to help someone who thinks they are Hi Enna, I have been through this with my hubby of 22 years, it is actually good for you and him that there is some kind of diagnosis. It will support you and will open the doors for him to get some help. The only way I have been able to get my husband to face the fact that he needs help was to get some counselling for myself (gives you tools to handle things) and leaving the home with our kids. My husband too has had thoughts of my father taking advantage of him. But instead of my husband having a health crisis, my father had a heart attack after my husband threatened him. If I didnt have such a love for my husband and his children I don't know if I would be hanging in."
"Any suggestions on how to help someone who thinks they are ENNA wrote: They involuntarily admitted him to the mental hospital which is where the phychiatrist told me they diagnosed him with delusional disorder. any suggestions on how to get him to see he needs HELP? He's getting the help he needs now. Whether he wants it, or thinks he needs it or not. I'm not sure how the medical system works where you are, but they probably won't keep him involuntarily forever. You might want to talk to your husband's doctor back home, and ask him to speak with the psychiatrist who is currently treating your husband, then go from there. Good luck."
"Any suggestions on how to help someone who thinks they are I totally agree that having a diagnosis is such a relief, even if it is like a death sentence for a relationship. My now ex was diagnosed with DDJ back in 2003. It began with the accusation, out of nowhere, that I was having a lesbian affair, then the accusations spread to my co-workers, friends, and ultimately to almost every female I came in contact with. I kept patiently asking for his reasoning saying, ""please help me to understand why you're thinking these things?""... His response was, ""I can tell by the way you look at them""... I asked for an example of ""the look"" and what I got was the most rediculous example, it was a look you'd see an actor having in a movie where they come upon a beautiful oasis after spending a week in the middle of an Arabian dessert. Get the picture? The sad part is that this IS WHAT HE SAW IN HIS MIND. He even accused me of possibly having our new born artifically inseminated by the brother of one of my alleged lesbian mates in order to have a child close to her DNA. Yes, I had just given birth to our 4th child 3 months before this craziness was dumped on me. Over time I became somewhat callous, and perhaps a little cynical, it was my only defense mechanism for the emotional pain I was feeling. I was beyond pissed, I was bitter, just plain bitter. Why did my loving husband become a monster? This was the first and only man I had ever been with.... we met when I was 17 and he was 20 back in 1980. I didn't know anyone who had this sort of situation to talk to, I only wish I had come upon this site back then. At the time I felt so ALONE. What hurt most was that HE BELIEVED ALL HIS ACCUSATIONS BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT. I remember telling my counselor how I'd like to trade places with him so that he could feel the pain he was causing me... He quickly interrupted my thoughts and said, ""don't ever say that again, there is no greater pain than what he's feeling as a prisoner of DDJ."" As for help, good luck in convincing him that he needs it... like you, my then husband was 100% sure that I was the one that needed help. In his mind, the only reason the psychiatrists we saw suggested he needed intense therapy for his delusions and meds for his paranoia and depression, is because I paid them to say that... So unfortunately, if your husband truly does have a delusional disorder, you're probably in the same boat... which is why I am now divorced and raising four children practically on my own. Through the grace of God, I've grown accustomed to my ""new normal"" life. At first I thought I'd never be happy again... don't get me wrong, I still miss the beautiful, loving, man I married and loved with all my heart, but holding on to the past doesn't let me appreciate all the wonderful things I still have. Through faith, I know I'll see his beautiful smile and sweet eyes again.... but not in this lifetime. I hope your situation will be the exception to the rule. If you do find a way to get through to him PLEASE let the rest of us know. God bless and good luck. ~ Beautiful Mind"
"Any suggestions on how to help someone who thinks they are My boyfriend, who I have known for 25yrs and dated for the last eight, began having periodic episodes that mimicked schizophrenia. He would become paranoid, accuse me of plotting against him, have disillusion of him working for the county doing such top secret work under cover agents had to constantly surveillance him for our protection. These episodes seemed to come and go. He could be totally normal, sometimes for months and then crash into bizarre thinking and behavior lasting anywhere from a couple days to two weeks. For the most part while immersed in the delusion there was no convincing him of reality. His actions and behavior did not seem odd to him. That's when I realized that crazy people, don't know they're crazy. Everything they are doing makes perfect sense to them. They are in a different realm of reality. There were some points, however, at which he seemed to briefly be aware and confused about what he was doing. Almost as though he knew something wasn't right, but couldn't put his finger on it. In hopes of finding a trigger to his episodes I began a journal. From the log I was able to track obvious triggers, such as stress. I noted a pattern of behavior that would lead up to an episode, such as he would change his sleeping pattern. Rather than a full 8-10hr sleep, he would sleep 2-3hrs, if at all. He would spend money frivolously and either become very needy and insecure, or overly confident and condescending to others. Strangely I also noted his voice would change. He would start speaking through his nose as if he had a cold. Based on the reasoning that there was such a fluctuation in personality. He was completely normal for weeks, or months, than lost in delusion for days. It occurred to me that he must be experiencing some sort of chemical imbalance. I started researching online and came across an article about a Doctor that had found miraculous improvement in patients with schizophrenia by administering vitamin B3 (niacin) and vitamin C supplements to their diet. After years of clinical studies and research he even concluded that vitamin B3 could be a possible cure for patients with schizophrenia. Read one of many of the published findings hehttp://www.orthomolecularvitamincentre. ... hrenia.php I began my boyfriend on a daily vitamin regime which included a multi vit in the morning and then B3(niacin) 500 mg after meals, vitamin C 1000 mg after meals, folic acid 15 mg daily, vitamin B-12 l mg subliminally daily, l-lysine 1000 mg after each meal, vitamin E 400 iu daily and zinc citrate 50 mg daily. I could see noted improvement in a week. After a month he seemed more clear minded with no episodes. Month 2 he forgot to take the vitamins for just two days and started into having an episode. Once he took the supplements his paranoia diminished within 24hrs. He has now been regularly taking the vitamin supplements for four months. If he forgets a dose he will start showing signs of having an episode in 24-72hrs. As soon as he replenishes his body he returns to a healthy state of mind. I am completely amazed at his improvement. It's like a miracle and offers hope for the future. I am so grateful to Dr. Abram Hoffer and his research. I wanted to share my hope with others suffering. Especially since its such an affordable, readily available treatment with no side effects or risks involved. It can even be taken with existing medication, but of course verify with your current treating physician. I'd be interested to hear if after starting the B3 treatment if anyone else finds it was as miraculously helpful as I did, so please post your results."
"Therapy? Hi, I've had delusional disorder for probably about 4 years and was diagnosed at the end of 2014. I'm on medication which has helped partially, but I still have a lot of delusions- I know they're delusions, but they feel so real they keep me from functioning properly. I've put off going for therapy for a long time because I had so many bad experiences in the past (therapy for ADHD), but now I feel therapy is my only chance left. How has everyone here dealt with therapy? Has anyone found it helpful?"
"Therapy? Hello, I've been in therapy for awhile with a therapist that i really trusted. I found it very helpful. It is good to have someone to talk to about stuff going on in your life. I dont have any social support really so it is good to talk to someone. I had to recently get a new therapist due to insurance changing and its been hard starting with someone new. You will probably have to agree to disagree about what you know is true and what they know is true. So therapy can not help with delusions. Medications can make them less intense which is helpful for daily life. Therapy can also help you deal with anxiety and coping with stresses. I get very paranoid and have anxiety and therapy has taught me different coping skills. I dont always use them but it is helpful sometimes. I find therapy helpful because my therapist was the only person i was truly honest with and they do not judge you. They try to help. They do help"
"You can trust me, I'm Psychotic *TW* Hello I hate the stigma around the word psychotic. I am not crazy, not by any means. People dont believe me. I have not met a mental health professional who has believed what I say. I am just looking for support I guess. I feel like I am alone sometimes. Maybe someone here can relate. The topic that I have failed to convince people of the truth is: microchips implanted in your brain that the government uses for experiments and control. That is the very basic idea. I of course have much more information and evidence but I suspect that now is not the time. I wish I could just have a conversation with someone and have them listen to me and not just discredit me right away based on ""general knowledge"" beliefs that contradict my beliefs. I am wondering if anyone here has had experiences similar to mine and could give some advise. Thanks"
"how can i help a delusional person? i need advices. i live with someone who suffer of delusional disorder (grandiose and persecutory) from two years. two long horrible years and i can't cope with this hell anymore. i've tried and tried again, but a change it's impossibile. there is no insight into this man, no light. i can't say if he's schizophrenic or suffer from DD because he has never been diagnosed. i know just our life is dominated by paranoia. i know, it's hard for everyone but he have a really strong personality, he never admit to have a huge problem. i resisted all this time for love and i lost everything; my friends, respect for my parents, my job, my interests, all. and i do all i can for him but he seems to hate and despise me. i think the solution is to just leave, but i can't accept it... i need to know that there is an hope..."
"how can i help a delusional person? In all honesty, there really isn't any hope. Be glad it's only been 2 years. Get out now. Get out while you still haven't invested more years of your life with someone that is seriously ill, and cannot even see it. This disease is worse than cancer. It kills the one you love and makes you the enemy. Believe me when I tell you... run. Run and don't look back."
"how can i help a delusional person? Dear alicenohope, I am a person who is suffering from 'Delusional Disorder'. And I am aware of this fact and i am on medication for life. Things are very normal for me now & i am happily married with two children. I don't remember when i fought with my wife in past 2 years. So DON'T have misconceptions about anything. First of all I disagree with your diagnosis. Please both of you visit a Psychologist or a Psychiatrist for a correct diagnosis. Then ACCEPTANCE is the key. If you don't accept, then you can never be cured. [I took 2 years to accept it completely that i am mentally ill] One funny thing i want to tell. Initially I had thought that my wife suffered from mental illness. After 10 yrs with her today I am diagnosed with mental illness and i have accepted the fact that she is normal. So don't judge without proper expertise anyone. Even if it's your spouse or boy/girl-friend. I pray that your life become easy going forward. Cheers...."
"how can i help a delusional person? Unfortunately you cannot help this person. I have a loved one who has been diagnosed with delusional disorder also. She will not take meds or go back to the doctor because she feels there is nothing wrong with her. Do not argue with him. It will do no good. The delusion is fixed. You cannot agree with the person either. I have been accused of stealing from her, running up huge bills and now she is going to lose her house because she is going to have to oay off my debt. All of this is entirely untrue. It is a tough situation. I have found the best tactic is to try to divert their attention on to something else. I do not live with my loved one and think that would be impossible. You have to remember to take care of yourself."
"how can i help a delusional person? I can't quiet belive it has taken me so long to finally accept that my husband is suffering from some type of delusional disorder. His behaviour has been odd for years ranging from the the bizarre to the ridiculous. He firmly believed The police, or people connected to the police were following and harassing him for years. The phone , house and car were all bugged . people driving cars with high beam lights were part of the conspiracy. According to my husband we were followed around the supermarket, by the family and friends of police officers , we were even followed on holiday. When I tried to address these beliefs he got angry and accused me of being naive and stupid. It finally came to a head after about three years and I tried to talk to him about DD , he went wild , shouting , aggressive accusing me of wanting to get him sectioned. He flatly refused to get help or talk to anyone about his problems. However Following a visit to Jamaica some months later, he told me he had spoken to a Doctor and he was feeling better. I asked him if he still held his beliefs about being followed and he said no. I wasn't entirely convinced but gave him the benefit of the doubt he refused to discuss the issue again . Now another year later it's started again. This time the paranoia appears to be about me. He says I'm playing a game , trying to trap him but the things / signs that alert him to this attack are just strange and seemingly have no logic whatsoever . Here are three recent examples that show him I'm conspiring against him 1. Me showing him a dog related video on You Tube 2. Me wearing my rucksack on both shoulders 3. Me pretending to have a slight knee injury and limping slightly ( in my defence this last accusation follows a 13 k run I did yesterday as I'm training for a half marathon). He won't or can't explain the significance of these things , but they make him anxious and angry and I'm the lightning rod for all the delusions. I just hope they don't escalate , he has never been violent but I worry that he's getting much worse. I'm at the end of my tether I've had enough. Nothing I say or do seems to help , he either refuses flat out to see the Doctor or screams and shouts at me. He says I have a mental health condition because I cry and I'm down and depressed. Well yes I suppose I am depressed about living with him and his delusions for so many years. I am finally giving up on him , the house is up for sale and I want a divorce after 22 years. My life is not my own and I'm on edge all the time , I now need some respite from all this pain and misery his condition has brought to our family. I do still feel for him and I know living with his condition must be hard and a daily struggle , but I now feel like it's either him or me .. And as Irvine Welsh so profoundly wrote ' I choose life' . This board is lifesaver by the way, I thought for years this was my fault , or something to do with me not being kind or loving enough , but I now realise my experience is not unique and I'm not to blame it's just a horrible , destructive illness. Thanks to everyone brave enough to post your words have helped me immeasurably."
"how can i help a delusional person? at the end he left me 3 weeks ago. in december it seemed to be back to normal, but unfortunately I have to accept that he will never be normal and will never return the person he was. throughout the month of december he has fake. no longer he talks of ""them"" but it was just an act. he was supposed to be a great actor. he left me saying horrible things, totally unexpectedly (I knew that sooner or later it would happen again but not like this, not now). I took his phone and saw that he had sent some messages to ""them"" (he writes on mobile or PC direct messages to them, cause they spying him 24 hours 24 and read all he writes). I lost the game. everyone tells me I'm lucky and I should be happy but nevertheless I seems to have abandoned him to an horrible fate. he's very ill and no one knows. he lives alone, so now he can talk to them all the time... his parents are selfish and doesn't care about it. i'm not joking, they are not in denial, they are selfish and criminals. they pay the rent and bills to him for not having him at home, and he has not worked for three years and is unemployed. alone, unemployed, delusional. i'm suffering so much. i've lost 10 years of my life with him for what? and he push away the only person in the world who cares about him. I listened him for two years talking ONLY about things that DO NOT EXIST. I spent sleepless nights seeing him cry over things that do not exist. it was heartbreaking. I am destroyed. my life is destroyed. i hate his parents to the bone. naboo I often think of that phrase of trainspotting too ... but I had chosen to stay with him despite everything. and sometimes think he has some insight and has left me free for this...but it's just a dream."
"how can i help a delusional person? Just wanted to write to say I can relate. In fact, I checked back on this forum today because I had a dream about my ex last night and I can't shake the sadness, even though we've been apart for over two years. He was who I thought was my ""soul mate,"" and it's so hard to let go of who he was before his mental illness suddenly took over. It took every ounce of my being this morning, not to reach out to him or to his mom, who I also loved like a mother. Like most here, I am not sure if my ex had delusional disorder, or if his psychosis was a visible symptom of something else that was going untreated, such as schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder...bipolar...who knows. He was very much against seeing a doctor. Anyways, I am here to say I know it's hard....it's so hard. Nothing will change that. Life does go on, and I think that going no-contact (which is what I did, although not willingly) offers the best chances at healing. But yeah...it's so, so difficult to come to terms with the end of a relationship when there is absolutely no closure, and you feel you have been personally mischaracterized...when the other person's words and actions make you wonder if they ever loved you....or make you wonder if maybe YOU are mentally ill. See a therapist, yourself, if you can. Talking to a professional is really helpful when dealing with a challenge this big. I think an experience like this can actually cause PTSD in the non-delusional partner. -- Thu Feb 16, 2017 11:29 am -- Just wanted to write to say I can relate.

"how can i help a delusional person? i see a psychologist (like 2 years ago) but doesn't help at all..he say ''it's paranoid schizophrenia, you better run, you can do nothing for help him. he's brain is scary and full of torments and there is no space for you'' yeah tanks, i know that. but i can't stop to think he can been help. i can't accept to have lost the person i love for a mental ill. it's too unfair. we are all on the same boat. i read a lot of similar story here and i feel less alone... few days ago he wrote me (nothing specials). i know he feel alone and bored but i keep no contact. i don't know if is the right thing to do with him."
"Was it psychosis? Hi there, until two months ago I had a job. It was not the best job and I was unhappy doing it. Getting that money was my only motivator. Many times I broke down crying while doing it; luckily nobody saw me. One day my manager (a sociopath who hates me ) came to me and said: ""from now on, I'm gonna pay you for X-1 hours a day instead of X. I don't care whether you need more time to do it; you have only X-1 hours."". There I lost it and quit. I had some more hours in the afternoon with the same company, but I was so angry (at him and then at the whole company) that I left every activity I had been doing. A month later I started regretting everything: I could have stayed anyways, doing a worse job in order to avoid unpaid overtime; I could only have left the place managed by the sociopath; Yet I was so mad that I dropped the job. Was it psychosis?"
"Interview with psychologist Lloyd Ross about delusions Psychologist Lloyd Ross and I just put together this interview about working with delusions, hallucinations, and other issues commonly labeled ""schizophrenic"": https://www.madinamerica.com/2017/02/un ... loyd-ross/ Lloyd has a particular approach which he described in this way: Quote: ""Over the last 40 years I saw approximately 150 people who could be considered schizophrenic because they were having delusions and hallucinations, i.e. they had a serious break with reality. Some of these therapies were very brief because they didn’t accept that I don’t use medication, which I always explained in the first session... Now out of these 150 people whom I saw over 40 years, probably about 100 of them accepted my non-medication approach. The large majority of these stayed in treatment for at least one year, and many stayed for between three to five years or more...Most of the people I consulted with chose to try working without medication, which was often because they or their parents didn’t like what the medications were doing to them... With somebody who was experiencing symptoms that the profession labels schizophrenic, such as having hallucinations, delusions, or being very paranoid, I would usually see them 3-5 times per week over a period of at least two years. Many of these schizophrenic clients were young people undergoing life transitions — these life transitions, like leaving home and going to college, often cause a stress that brings up earlier trauma and can cause a break with reality in a vulnerable person. But I also saw some older clients whose life stresses had precipitated a break. I worked intensively with them because psychotic conditions are very serious and require intensive help. "" We also discussed his success with the group that stayed over the longer term: Quote: ""The large majority of them get much better. I’d say 85-90% of the schizophrenic men and women who stayed in therapy at least two years got well to the point of being able to go to school, to work, to function in a meaningful, personally satisfying way, and to be involved in relationships. Probably a majority of these got married and had families. Sometimes their functioning was a bit awkward but they still functioned. For example, a young man who had been psychotic might date or marry the quiet, shy girl rather than the girl who was the life of the party. But they could still have a meaningful intimate relationship and become good parents. So yes, for most people diagnosed with schizophrenia, if they get effective help they get better. They go out into the world and function, and most often they don’t become severely psychotic again. In the early part of the work, what happens a lot of times is that as a psychotic person starts to function better, the voices reoccur; but they’re not as disturbing anymore, they’re okay. Later on, if the person more fully works through their issues, these symptoms can completely or mostly go away. Or they still occur but don’t bother the person much at all, because they’re much stronger emotionally."" And then we discussed many other issues like the biogenetic model, how to understand hallucinations as meaningful phenomena, some trauma in Lloyd's own history, Lloyd's views on NAMI and the business of psychiatry (may be controversial). etc. I hope you will check it out."
"I would like to talk about somthing else, if i can Right, i know my posts are being scrutinised, and that you may think my previous post is barmy, well heres where it gets bat $#%^ crazy. Has anyone seen the movie bon voyage charlie brown? This movie was made i think in 1980. Anyway i used to watch it a lot as a kid and picked up on a few details in this move. Turns out its full of hypnotic sugestion. Now it supports a certain political ideology, i talked breifly about a story i told in 1984, i discussed some of these things that i picked up on from bon voyage charlie brown. My story caught the attention of an extreemly prominant American business man with orange skin and yellow hair. Anyways, my father was struggling for money and this plonker shows up at my house and my father effectively sold his own son to this guy. He wanted me to rig an election for him, this orange cock has been controling me with hypnosis and views me as his property.

"What is litmus test for delusional disorder or schizophrenia Well, I'm not quite sure what the difference is between Delusional Disorder and Schizophrenia. I thought that they could all be classified under Schizophrenia. What I'd like to know is if there is some way of identifying, some way of testing someone in some casual conversation to find out if they have a major psychotic problem. Like example if I said, what would you do or think or feel about such and such a thing. The idea being, can I find some general loose connection in her circuits. The purpose of which would be to help her cure her problem or prove to her that she has a weakness and should go see someone. Here are the circumstances. My friend seems so absolutely normal in so many ways. She has many problems in her life and seems to be busy solving them, though in a different manner than I would, but she does solve her problems. At the same time, she strongly advocates conspiracy theories, that she is being monitored, that she has devices planted in her and that the government is harboring aliens from another world, that so much of everything is psychic and numerous other types of thoughts of what appear to me to be competely delusional. And she could tell I'm skeptical and asks me why I don't believe her. The thing is that so much of her seems absoutely normal and then there's a part of her that seems completely psychotic. If anyone here met her, the first impression would be that this is a wonderful woman etc. but when she starts going into all this crazy stuff then you'd think different. It's no use getting her to see someone because she is tremendously proud and strongly arrogant in what she believes and even finds it an insult that I question her beliefs in these things. Then to prove that she is right, she goes to Youtube and shows me the lying conspiracy assholes who put up nothing but false information. I constantly tell her that such broadcasters never give true facts but take only circumstantial facts and incorrectly draw them together in wrong conclusions. These Youtubers also have no one to answer to for the truth of their facts. At least the standard media have bosses to answer to and other media organizations to answer to when they are wrong and will be publicly humiliated or fired if so proven. Well, she doesn't really get it and says that she won't believe a word of what the standard media says. In the old days, people used to call this type of normal and abnormal behavior monomania where you could seem so normal and wonderful on one side and totally psychotic on another side. Later on psychologists and psychiatrists realized that if these types of people were further tested you would find out inadequacies across the board and the term monomania was stopped and I guess Schizophrenia or other names were used. So is there some way that by casual conversation I can do a litmus test and get to the root of her disorder to find out what circuits are loose for the purpose of helping her or getting her to see someone."
"What is litmus test for delusional disorder or schizophrenia she could just be a fan of conspiracy. my ex bf has scary delusions. he initially thought to have been chosen to become a sort of new steve jobs, being watched, that his thoughts could be read, then to be an experiment of illuminati, thought that the media were speaking about him code, that films were made about him etc. i asked my psychologist (expert in psychosis) if it could be delusional disorder or bipolar disorder, and he told me that delusions of this kind are typical of paranoid schizophrenia. he told me that in delusional disorder ''the plots'' are linked to the reality you live (my wife cheats on me, my neighbor steals my mail ...) he also seems ""normal"" if you don't know about it."
"What is litmus test for delusional disorder or schizophrenia Alice, Thank you for your response. We were supposed to get married but deep down for me, that is now out of the question. I have been reading some about these problems. During the Gold Rush, a lot of people were coming down with mental illness and there were many reports that it was due to the fact that life just didn't work out for a lot of people - that they became very poor and could barely survive and that's what cause the problem. It could be that these observations were correct but that it was a deeper cause than just financial ruin, it was caused by a tremendous amount of stress and that some people treat stress one way and other people deal with it another way meaning that they go crazy if they are severely stressed out. During the gold rush this seemed to be particularly so for those people who people had accumulated great wealth with gold stocks or otherwise which made them millionaires only then to lose every dime of it when the stocks dropped or their business went down the drain."
"Help me please About a year and a half ago, I went into a delusional episode. It started off with me thinking that someone was going into my office after I left work (could be partially true, people were cleaning the office), and that my emails were hacked and that no Internet connection was secure. I was becoming aggressive because of these thoughts, and was eventually told my contract would not be renewed. After that I strongly believed that I was never laid off, that there was disagreement among management, and to salvage my job and refrain from getting hurt (my family as well), I had to send ideas for articles to a local tabloid. It’s worthwhile to mention that my job had to do with the media, and while on the job I was requested to deal with this tabloid, but I refused to because I did not think they were credible. I also believed there was a secret language associated with those who work in the media. I eventually landed a second job but two months later was told I did not pass my probation period. The delusions made me refuse instructions because I thought my manager then was out to get me as well. My family was able to talk me into seeing a therapist. He initially prescribed 2.5 mg of respirdal, down to 1.5 mg now. He never gave me a definitive diagnosis but said I had paranoid thoughts. I’m seeing another therapist now who says she thinks it is delusional disorder. I’m concerned I might be schizophrenic and that this is just where my woes begin. The first therapist I saw said he ""knew"" I wasn't schizophrenic. This is such a concern with me that my therapist now says I’m slipping into secondary depression. It’s also worthwhile to mention that, as of late, I’ve been having sleep-related hallucinations. I heard a door slam, voices saying various things, a doorbell ringing, and other mainly auditory encounters, all upon waking up or right before falling asleep, which scares me even more. Does anyone have insight as to wether this could be the onset of schizophrenia? I’m a 32 year old female, and I had moved to a new country before this all started."
"Help me please Dear anonymoususer1234: Until not too long ago, when I was walking and a car drove by me, I thought they may want to drive over me o purpose. One time I saw it was a postal van driving behind me, and I thought: good, i don't think the postman wants his van damaged if he runs over me because it will be bad for his employment. I kept thinking drivers don't like the way I walk, too slow, too fast and are intent on running over me. If I walked over a hole in the ground, I thought someone dug it especially for me so that I will fall into it. I thought someone didn't like me walking there and dug the hole so I get injured and no longer walk there. These delusions stemmed from growing up with a very punishing mother. She hurt me again and again, so I couldn't trust anyone. Doing better now, following ongoing therapy and post therapy healing. Hope you do better and better as well. atina"
"Help me please Hello I wanted to say, it would be helpful to relax. When your imagination runs wild, and you get these fears, stress may be a trigger. Remember triggers,they could be something you see,hear,or experience. They wake up the thoughts and feelings we may have that trouble us at the end of the day.When I get overwhelmed and start thinking something is wrong.I step back and breath,relax,listen to music.Then it doesnt seem so strongly important."

"I have never felt so alone. (Delusional SO) Monday I had to have my husband of 31 years taken away. He is the strongest man I know. I have so many questions. How, why, what, when. This is so hard. I am not even sure were to begin. A little over a year ago he started taking about aliens. Eventually they were everywhere. The he beleived that buzzards were following him then turning into spaceships. None of it was dangerous. About 3 weeks ago his demeanor changed. He started focusing on my computer devices. Started asking me a bunch of questions. Started trying to opening up emails from other programs and of course they would not open. I could show him the time stamped email from the correct email servers and he told me tat I was hiding something. All last weekend I tried everything to answer andwak through all of his questions. Then he started getting violent. To the point that sunday we spent our first night apart in over three decadeds. I asked for him to find some help but he insists there is nothing wrong. So I was forced to make the most difficult choice. I followed the proper steps and had him assessed. They agreed that he needed further tests. And OMG he hates me. So. I guess my question here is. When or if he returns home, will he remember all of theses accusations and slip back to that person? Or will he just not remember why I sent him away. Thank you"
I have never felt so alone. (Delusional SO) I've dealt with something like this with my ex husband. He seems to have calmed down with his delusions but he still believes them. He's not obsessing about them though or trying to convince others his delusions are true. I can't say exactly what will happen with your partner but if he gets the right treatment something good has to come out of it of course. Stay strong you did the right thing.
"Delusion that im a narcissist??? Hey. So for the last 6 months ive been obsessed if im a narcissist. Everyday is a struggle and everything I do is analyzed to see if im a narcissist and I truly believe I am. I dont want to be but I am so proccupied with myself. I dont feel attached to anyone or anything and have perceptual disturbance all day long where things look different and more real or darker and closer if that makes sense. All day long im constantly thinking about it and i go into panic attacks when i realise ive done something thats narcissistic. All i think about is how others percieve me and how I can prove to them im not narcissistic. I just dont know anymore and I really need help cause ive literally have no perception of time or whats going on around me and everyday feels like a blur. I dont know if im delusional or narcissistic i dont want to be either. How can I tell if I am a narcissist, will I know or will I just distort reality i dont even know.."
"Delusion that im a narcissist??? The fact that you are concerned about this suggests to me that you are not a narcissist.. I know 2 narcissists, and the idea that there could possibly be something 'wrong' with them would never cross their mind. Do you think you have any OCD traits? Any Anxiety? 30yo female, formal Dx DID, aka 'me' .. 16 others"
"Delusion that im a narcissist??? Ive had MUCH experience with narcissists, true narcissists aka Narcissistic Personality Disorder. [mod edit] Nothing at all you have said, in any way, indicates NPD. Go over to the NPD forums, and take a look. Youll see. 100% guaranteed. Not many people understand the true depths and insidious darkness, unbelievable reality and details of the condition. Nor the pathological soul core damage and subsequent behaviours/thoughts/feelings etc of true narcissists. Its extraordinarily severe, it almost seems fictional. I could go on to write a 1000 page novel about it. I could also do the same about overlaps with other conditions from mood disorders to other personality disorders, medication causes and developmental too. The mind is a place of incredible distortion and trickery. There are just no words to describe it. But i can say: [mod edit] I have a few ideas what might be happening with you though, from what youre describing. Let me know if you want to talk about it Last edited by Echinacea on Sun Nov 13, 2016 3:01 pm, edited 2 times in total.

"Delusion that im a narcissist??? Just another thing -- NPD, encompasses almost otherwordly levels of delusion. Narcissists are the pinnacle of delusion. More so than schizophrenics. Much worse. So what you are basically asking is ""I think im delusional about being severely delusional"". This is a strange statement. We need to discuss this further if you would like."
"Delusion that im a narcissist??? This is my understanding: You know that you are normal. You are afraid of people wrongly perceiving you as narcissistic. Your being normal is the truth. You being narcissistic is the lie. People who suffer from narcissistic personality disorder want people to believe their lies, as it gives them as sense of outsmarting people and being more intelligent than others. You are the exact opposite: you desperately want people to believe the truth, but have somehow gotten the idea that they won't. Ergo: you are not a narcissist. You need to dig for the underlying reason behind your fear of being misunderstood."
"Is this delusional or just my own self/thoughts? I'm 25. I have some thoughts that always bother me. Maybe they’re delusions…but I can't seem to tell the difference. The thoughts make my 'life' sort of difficult. I feel everything is the same. I feel like I'm the only different one and everyone around me is the same. I feel like I can't tell my own emotions, thoughts, opinions, feelings, because I don't believe they're real. I don't believe I'm a person. I don't believe I exist as a person. I believe I'm just like a ghost. No one understands me. Even if someone tells me, ""I feel the same"" I think it's fake, or we don't really feel the same at all. I think like this for everything. Even hobbies or anything. If someone says “Oh I like books too” I think, no, it’s not the same, it’s different for me. It’s always different. I alienate myself in every possible way. I don't have friends. I've never had friends. I think it's a problem but, again, I can't really tell the difference between what's a problem and what's not. Because I'm not a person. I have no desire for relationships. I think something’s wrong with me to not want to do anything productive in life or form relationships with anyone. I guess I just don't feel like there's any point or it's not as great as people make it out to be. I feel like I'm alone, and only God is with me. I believe that I'm on a journey, that it's my purpose to do something great, even if it's in the afterlife. I feel like everything I do is part of the journey. I feel like crying because my mind is a mess, and I feel like I believe in stuff just because I can. I think, ""If ‘I’ believe in it, why can't it be true?"" I believe I can talk to God in my mind and God can talk back...so why can't it be true? I can't even comprehend how it cannot be true. It's not that I hear voices, and I think somewhere deep inside I know it's 'just me'... but I still think, why can't it be true? So then I believe in it. When do beliefs end and your thoughts become something 'delusional'? I don't know how I can continue on with this mind-set. I'm on anti psychotic.I can't even tell if it works or not."
"Is this delusional or just my own self/thoughts? thank you for your comment... I still don't know what to do. I still feel the same, even though I posted this a while ago. Always the same. Everything in my life is a mess. I feel like I'm just going to die... I guess no one wanted to comment on this...I dunno... Thank you."
"Is this delusional or just my own self/thoughts? Dear Hennet: You've been alone for too long. People are social beings, in our nature. We need to communicate with others, be in the company of others and communicate. Alone, we become almost ... non-beings, or ""ghost"" like you wrote. I hope you can see a competent, empathetic psychotherapist, someone who will be safe to communicate with and who will help you to learn more about your real journey. You can also join a support group, a group with rules so that the members treat others and get treated with respect. atina"
"Is this delusional or just my own self/thoughts? Hey Hennet, I feel somewhat connected to what your experience describes. I have been following this inner knowing for a long while now. It's like a narrative that I create and that I am created by that doesn't feel entirely me. Sometimes it feels like God. Sometimes it feels like it's just my own spinning thoughts. But I have encountered some spooky stuff that coincides with things/places/events in life. It seems so perfectly synchronous to be just me though. I feel like I'm supposed to learn something or realize something. I know that, too, I find myself alienated. I think I do this intentionally because I'm somewhat consumed by this feeling and I'm unable to relate to others. Also, the narrative is not as straightforward as it is when I'm alone. I haven't a clue with what to do about it, whether it will go away, or even if I want it to. I've been on antipsychotics and recently had a terrible episode trying to quit on my own. I don't advise trying to quit, but If you can talk with your doc about finding something that helps you coexist with this and remain at least somewhat content/functional maybe that's good. In any case, I agree with Atina. When you listen to that inner knowing it can begin to feel like an echo and personally I find that when I have been able to speak to someone (therapist), it has helped clear the air like starting a new paragraph. Even speaking on the most basic of terms regarding some of the challenges you encounter (even if it doesn't exactly explicitly address your experience as a whole), it can help to move on. Like rungs on a ladder. Just keep climbing. Anyways, I don't know if this misses the mark but I came to this website to see if there are others and there are."
"this is quite odd, what would say it is? Hello I would like to have your opinion about these beliefs that I've been having. Considering that my grandfather was schizohrenic, and I have many anxiety problems. I think it may have started when I was 12 going on 13, and I read the whole Twilight series in just a few weeks. I was totally obsessed, and addicted, as I am with so many other romance shows and books. Anyway, I found myself totally believing in vampires. I believed in them so much that I'd go at the end of my dad's ex's garden at night, facing the woods, and start talking to ""them"". I wanted to become one, I made loads of research trying to prove their existence, even had a website aha, and I'd always also feel like there'd be one reading my mind etc. Anyway, that lasted for like 2 years. I also have these sort of ""delusions""/beliefs, probably started around the same year, in which people are into me. Happens EVERYDAY day, with DOZENS of people (strangers). I'm honestly not narcissistic or anything, it's more like my brain is trying to make me feel more confident, and also trying to ease this sort of ""addiction"" I have. Cause also when someone actually does like me I don't enjoy it all. But I can't stop those thoughts, they make me totally obsessed and anxious and paranoid. I usually KNOW it's not true, but I still believe it 100%. It's kind of hard to explain. Anyway, here's an example of what happens : I'll hop in the bus, already thinking about it as I always do when I'm out, then I'll notice out of the corner of my eye some person that MIGHT be looking at me, and then my brain will straight away tell me ""they like you"". The rational side of me tells me ""this is stupid"", but I still TOTALLY believe it. If I see the person again I will obsess over them. I've even stalked people. Anyway I feel sooo weird and I can't find what's wrong with me. And I HAVE talked to therapists about it, even though it makes me really embarrassed. I used to think it was erotomania, then love addiction, then asexuality + aromantism. Now I just don't know..."
"this is quite odd, what would say it is? Dear kweenovak: I used to be sure that two pastors in two different churches (one Christian, another new age) were in love with me. I sat in the audience among hundreds of people and was sure that the pastor was looking at me and talking to me personally and was in love with me. I had the lowest self esteem in the world but I believed it. Now I realize it is not true. The pastors never tried to contact me, not even once. I think the reason I had that delusion is that I so very, very much wanted an ""important ""person to fall in love with me, to think I was special. I also dreamed when I was a child or a teenager that I was flying in the sky, like a bird, and was sure for days or weeks or months, maybe longer that I really did fly. I now know it must have been a dream. Good news, these delusions did not develop to a psychotic illness and I stayed ""just"" anxious, depressed, borderline (BPD), with OCD and Tourette. atina"
"Foods to prevent Alzheimer's disease Good topic! Mom discarded all our aluminum cookware when a study came out in the 1980's about it causing Alzheimer's and dementia. Subsequent studies haven't proven this as rock-hard evidence though. I think that pesticides and other chemical 'processing' residues in our food and water are more of a danger. It is important to eat well. I try to buy the least processed foods and cook for myself.

"Stepmother wants to divorce, is become ill in alzheimers My dads wife has recently submitted an application for divorcing. In fact, I don't care about her, she have always accused me for being lazy and things like that, because I can't work any more. She had a son which suffered from schizophrenia, and before she met my dad, he committed suicide. But I think her divorcing depends on beginning Alzheimers... I have noticed how oblivious she is. For example, we use to go to theatre, and in the afternoon, she ask when the theatre begins for about 10 times... I've seen people get ill in Alzheimers, my grandma. My poor grandpa wanted to have her home at long that it is was possible. But in the last years she went on a nursing home. She didn't take a note when my grandpa, her husband, died. She didn't recognised my father or me. And the little she talked was on German. They came from Germany. But I care about my dad! He had agreed to the divorcing, but I think my stepmother is becoming very ill... For now, she accuse my dad to take over her money-account. In fact, it is my dad who pays all the bills and other costs. He owns 75% of their flat, and 50% of their company. But I still wonder what is going to happen to her... I guess she is going to move to an apartment and only have contact with her daughter. But I think she can't take care of her self for a longer time. Well, I don't really have a question, maybe just wonder if someone recognize the situation? I use Google Translate - Sorry for grammar- or typographical error. For now, I'm on... -Venlafaxine 375 mg - Against depression -Pregabalin 225 mg - Against anxiety -Haloperidol 3 mg - Against paranoia and psychoses -Clonazepam 2 mg - Against anxiety -Alimemazine 120 mg - For sleep -Zopiclone 7,5 mg - For sleep"
"Stepmother wants to divorce, is become ill in alzheimers this isn't a good move on her behalf. if she really has alzheimer's, she's going to need all the help that she can get. sadly, a symptom of alzheimer's can be mistrust. she may simply not know what she's really doing or why. something knocked me out' the trees now i'm on my knees ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey there is one thing you must be sure of i can't take any more ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey don't like it but i guess i'm learning ... shock the monkey to life"
"""i will light your darkness with confusion"" ... and that was exactly what it felt like, caring for my father with alzheimer's disease for over a year. as the disease progressed, everything fell into a darkness that was totally confused. if he understood me, he often didn't say so. if i asked him anything, he almost always replied that he didn't know. and, i have to say, the thing that threw me the most was that here i was trying to communicate with someone who had always been perfectly rational and i just couldn't get my head around the fact that he appeared to make no sense anymore. towards the end i started to twig that even if he did understand me, he just wasn't able to translate that understanding into actions. and, even if he said he didn't know, somewhere at a deeper inaccessible level there was a reason for what he did. i have to say that i remain deeply saddened that i didn't realise these things sooner. my father's parting gift to me was to get me to understand that i didn't understand. something knocked me out' the trees now i'm on my knees ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey there is one thing you must be sure of i can't take any more ... don't you know you're gonna shock the monkey don't like it but i guess i'm learning ... shock the monkey to life"
"Will a person's true nature come out? *may trigger* Hi, Can someone please answer this question? Can a person's true nature come out when they have alzheimer's? This is about my mother. Please read about her here - child-abuse/topic205164.html So far as I can see, her jealousy and hatred of me does not emerge unless she is lucid and know its actually me. She is not that far gone. She can eat by herself, can talk. She just won't remember what you said by the time you get to the second sentence. Does not recognise anyone. So because she is ""nice"" all the time in this alzheimer's state, my dad thinks she is a nice person. Anyway, hope someone can shed light on this. Thank you.

"A lot on the ball, reckless spending, legal-medical gray are I'm generally happy. Everything under control. In an unusual new situation. I'm an adult only-child of elderly parents. My parents had me late. My extended family is pushing me and my parents to appoint a legal guardian for them due to poor/incomplete estate planning and the health of my parents. This is a legal issue not a medical issue but ....I need to stay sane and I don't know whom I can talk to besides my dr. I have a lot on the ball and if I succumb to this .... As an aside I may need to appoint a lawyer to represent ME now. I was always taught not to trust people especially where money is concerned. And therefore I am hampered in talking about it to people and am concerned about beginning a vicious cycle of isolation..And concerned the extended family coming after me after they would try to declare my parents incapacitated, which is how I discovered on my own the guardianship proceedings work. I don't even think I should post but I'm starting to break.. I have a lot of potential and my extended family is selling it to me like I can either try to take care of my parents for the rest of my life or I can make something of myself. I dropped out of med school because my dad got Alzheimer's (this is within the last 5 yrs) and some other of my own issues. I have a very important interview coming up for a new career that is very important to me and now caring for them has come to the fore-- and you better believe I'm looking out for my self-interest. My brilliant father always took care of everything and where finances were concerned for my mother, he made a lot of money but was not a planner. My mom is not the brightest. Admittedly I have persuaded my family to give me lump sums of money many times it's not cute but its reality, so I believe there is some sentiment with my extended family that I am not trustworthy. I got my extended family to get off my back until at least the New Year. I promised for my part I would get an asset inventory and get information from money manager like MS, Vanguard, etc because I believe before a legal representative is even considered parents should manage their money better. (Asset inventory was my idea based on my previous dealings with lawyers for my parents) The extended family wants to convince my parents to get an independent legal guardianship. They came down to visit them on the auspice of taking care of my mother during what should have been a routine cataract surgery but due to her senility and mostly her personality it was a mess. I first stormed out on them. They brought it up again and I was really raw due to caring for my mother so I must have agreed I would consider it. Sister is wealthy and she paid for some in-home care over the weekend until my interview. She was already asking to speak to my doctor and I won't allow. I have not left my parents yet since mother's surgery but I am not proud of this, I blocked my mother's sisters phone number on her phone because what I am reading about legal representative for seniors scares me. >In most cases the process will start with a determination whether the alleged incapacitated person is actually incapacitated. There will often be an evidentiary hearing and determination of whether guardian is necessary and who guardian would be. >in some cases a guardianship dispute could become quite contentious....essentially a pre-probate dispute over parents' wealth. My mother's personality at this point is really also that she wishes someone would run her life. I am currently Executor to parents' estate but as mentioned estate planning is really slim for them. I'm in a catch-22 because rather than keep outplaying money to me my family may only be convinced to set up a trust, for example, if I use extended family as a mediator, but they are also being sneaky about their intentions and I would have to accept their ""help"" of ""get a legal guardian for them"". One relative involved probated a distant cousin's will for their money. So I guess to continue along this line of rational? thought, first they will want to say my parents are incapacitated and next they come after me!? Also why should my parents assets be any of their business, but also since my parents have few contacts and trust few people it's their ""worst best hope"". I rarely belly ache woe is me life's not fair anymore. (I used to runaway a lot as a teen) At some point I believe you quit blaming your parents and live your life. But it seems like every time I try to make a foray at something they are in crisis and I have to help, see lawyers, accountants, estate planners for them and it messes me up. I'm still young. Lately I've taken to buying things to cope. I don't know what to do it's not a medical issue, it's legal but if I can't get a handle on myself and I succumb to this I'm worse off I just kind of want to avoid this and wish it weren't happening....."
"Alzheimer's is caused by a break-down of sub-cellular activities in the brain due to improperly-folded proteins (I think). This can occur in cells that are no longer efficient at 'mopping-up' cellular waste. Thus, I believe that maintaining a good diet throughout life is one way to prevent (or at best delay) the onset of Alzheimer's. Kevin"
"Games can help! From what I've learned, AD can't be prevented, but there are ways to slow the progression. In addition to medicines and supplements, mental activities are recommended, especially puzzles and games. For game therapy, Senior Sez games are really good. They work for ""mixed"" groups, with different levels of cognitive functioning. You can play the games in groups, or one-on-one. They're easy and fun, and really help to lift spirits. So they are helpful emotionally as well as therapeutically. There are several different Senior Sez games: a Trivia Game, a Categories Game, and a game with Popular Sayings. You can find out more about these games at www.seniorsez.com . Hope this is helpful! P.S. You don't need tables, paper, or pens to play the games. They come with wrist bands that are used to keep score. We have even played them on bus trips."
"No, undefined, it is commonly agreed that Alzheimer's is caused by a break-down in sub-cellular 'cleaning-up' mechanisms. Every cell in the human body produces new proteins for various functions. Some proteins, however, aren't created correctly and end-up as 'garbage'. The cells of young people are well-capable of cleaning-up this garbage. In old people, however, the cells are not so good at it. In some cases, cells in the brains of old people build-up a lot of 'garbage' and this then causes Alzheimer's. Strangely enough, there is research at the moment where they areactually using viruses to actually cure Alzheimer's. Kevin"
Everyone would probably get it if they live long enough - the body's mechanisms break down eventually. The best things to do are stay physically and mentally active. Fist oil probably helps. Large dose b vitamins lower homocystien levels which may help. Vitamin e may help. tumeric may help. I take all of it. A recent study showed that people on statins have a lower rate of AD. I may start taking a statin. The plaques that cause AD may be cleared out by the statin. The plaques are very similar to cholesterol.
"That is good advice Parador. There is a lot of good to be said for leading a healthy lifestyle. Basically, you can add many quality extra years to your life if you just look after your body. Statins, I believe, are 'wonder-drugs'. With them, there is no reason why people in their 40's and 50's should be dying of heart-attacks due to clogged arteries. Heart-disease is the leading killer in Ireland, but I'm sure this could be stopped if we took statins. While saying that, some dude a few weeks ago DID die due to having an adverse reaction to a statin. Kevin"

"Hey, They would be genetically-engineered viruses (and, so, they wouldn't be capable of causing harm). Basically, the virus would 'carry' a strand of genetically-engineered DNA into the affected cells of the person with Alzheimer's. Then, this short genetically-engineered strand of DNA would become incorporated into the much larger DNA of the individual that already exists in the affected cells. From there, the 'new' DNA could 'fix' the cell. This approach (using viruses) is already used to treat other things. They are used because they are so small and can easily find their way into cells. A typical virus particle is about a million times smaller than a human cell, and 1,000 times smaller than a bacterial cell. Kevin"

"Anyone with premature Alzheimer? Hi Bella, Just saw your post. I was a while ago but no one has replied yet. Not sure where you're living, but there are many support groups for people with young onset dementia (I'm assuming that's what you mean by premature Alzheimer's?) Having young onset dementia (be it, Alzheiner's, frontotempotal dementia, Pick's, etc) can be devastating, not just to the person, but to their career, their family (often still have young children at home), their social life and future care options. If you're in the US, a local chapter of the Alzheimer's Association. Depending on where you are, they may have support groups, education sessions, therapy, etc. Find your local chapter in the US hehttp://m.alz.org/find-your-local-chapter.asp Hope this helps. All the best"

I find it and chastize him about it but he continues to do it. Is it part of some disorder? He used to drink a lot of alcohol, maybe that has something to do with it. No, this is seen with many, many disorders, from OCD to schizophrenia and many more. Just from this one thing, there is no way to decide what condition your brother has. We had a young man with schizophrenia in our house for many months who did this - when he got on medication he stopped. But it can be caused by many other conditions, too. If he has been drinking VERY heavily, he may have damaged his brain and that may be permanent, and that can cause symptoms like dementia and also Korsakoff's Syndrome - almost immediately, forgetting what just happened, or making up stories about what happened - the stories ramble and don't make complete sense. Alcohol alone can damage the brain. This can happen due to drinking every day, or even, from 'binge drinking' once a week or once every few weeks. Many people think 'binge drinking' is not harmful - that is wrong. It does incredible harm. Sometimes, if the person is young, vitamin supplements can help reverse some of the damage of alcohol. But this must be started so quickly and the drinking stopped immediately. Alcohol blocks some vitamins from being absorbed. This can actually kill a person. Many people drink alcohol BECAUSE they have a mental illness. so your brother could have mental illness. The alcohol use then, when it happens with mental illness, is called 'Self Medicating'(it is of course, also alcoholism, because they can not stop or control their drinking). Instead of getting proper treatment from a psychiatrist, many, many people do this. About 50% of schizophrenics have an alcohol or drug problem, and generally, it is because they are 'Self Medicating' - trying to deal with the symptoms of mental illness. It makes them feel a little better for a few minutes, kind of numbs a person to the symptoms, so it becomes a habit. And it causes incredible damage. When a person with mental illness drinks alcohol, they do a lot of damage to an already fragile brain tissue. Not a good mix. I would try to guess what is wrong, based on your brother's age (over 65-70, dementia more possible, 17-25 and this is just starting, schizophrenia is possible), years of drinking (many years, alcoholic dementia possible), but many older people have alcohol brain damage AND dementia AND mental illness. It is a matter for a doctor. Unfortunately, many of these people refuse to get any help. In most cases, you have no legal ability to force them to accept help. Contact your local Adult Protective Services and if he is older, county geriatric services. See what can be done. Sometimes you can get them to accept help by kind of 'baby stepping' them towards it and moving gradually."
"urine hoarding I'd guess he is so comfortable in his room, and maybe fearfull of the thought of leaving that comfort that collecting urine in the room is a more viable option.

"Alzheimer's Research For any carers who care for a family member who suffers from Alzheimer's Disease, please contemplate dropping by the research section of the PsychForums to read about a project that is being carried out by the University of Glasgow, Scotland. Thanks very much for taking the time to read this. Please follow this link: surveys-studies/topic89408.html"
"Alzheimer's Research For those who are interested in learning more about alzheimer, read this article: Researchers hope to discover an easy and accurate way to detect Alzheimer's before these devastating symptoms begin. Experts believe that biomarkers (short for ""biological markers"") offer one of the most promising paths. Biomarkers are reliable predictors and indicators of a disease process. They include proteins in blood or spinal fluid, genetic variations (mutations) or brain changes detectable by imaging. Sign up for our weekly e-news and stay up-to-date on the latest advances in Alzheimer's diagnosis, treatments, care and research. Neuroimaging is among the most promising areas of research focused on early detection. Today, a standard workup for Alzheimer's disease often includes structural imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). These tests are currently used chiefly to rule out other conditions that may cause symptoms similar to Alzheimer's but require different treatment. Structural imaging can reveal tumors, evidence of small or large strokes, damage from severe head trauma or a buildup of fluid in the brain. Preliminary research suggests that emerging imaging technologies and new applications of current technology may be able to detect hallmark changes associated with Alzheimer's disease in the brains of living individuals. If further research confirms the potential value of brain imaging, its use may one day be expanded to play a more direct role in diagnosing Alzheimer's and in earlier detection of the disease. Imaging technologies used in Alzheimer's research Structural imaging provides information about the shape, position or volume of brain tissue. Structural techniques include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Functional imaging reveals how well cells in various brain regions are working by showing how actively the cells use sugar or oxygen. Functional techniques include positron emission tomography (PET) and functional MRI (fMRI). Molecular imaging uses highly targeted radiotracers to detect cellular or chemical changes linked to specific diseases. Molecular imaging technologies include PET, fMRI and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Structural imaging studies have shown that the brains of people with Alzheimer's shrink significantly as the disease progresses. Research has also shown that shrinkage in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus may be an early sign of Alzheimer's. However, scientists have not yet agreed upon standardized values for brain volume that would establish the significance of a specific amount of shrinkage for any individual person at a single point in time. Functional imaging research with positron emission tomography (PET) and other methods suggests that those with Alzheimer's typically have reduced brain cell activity in certain regions. For example, studies with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET indicate that Alzheimer's disease is often associated with reduced use of glucose (sugar) in brain areas important in memory, learning and problem solving. However, as with the shrinkage detected by structural imaging, there is not yet enough information to translate these general patterns of reduced activity into diagnostic information about individuals. Molecular imaging technologies are among the most active areas of research aimed at finding new approaches to diagnose Alzheimer's in its earliest stages. Molecular strategies may detect biological clues indicating Alzheimer's is under way before the disease changes the brain's structure or function, or takes an irreversible toll on memory, thinking and reasoning. Molecular imaging also may offer a new strategy to monitor disease progression and assess the effectiveness of next-generation, disease-modifying treatments. Molecular imaging compounds currently used in Alzheimer research include: Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) was the first radiotracer capable of highlighting deposits of beta-amyloid—one pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease—in living individuals during a PET scan. The Alzheimer's Association helped fund early PIB development. The Association in 2006 also awarded a $2.1 million grant to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to expand this long-term, nationwide study to include PIB-PET imaging. 18F flutemetamol (flute), another radiotracer that highlights beta-amyloid in a PET scan, is structurally identical to PIB except for one fluorine atom in place of a carbon atom. That small chemical change enables flutemetamol to remain stable significantly longer than does PIB, potentially increasing its usefulness outside research settings. In phase II study results reported in the Annals of Neurology, flutemetamol performed similarly to PIB. Additional testing is under way. Florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45) is also a radiotracer that highlights brain beta-amyloid during a PET scan. At the 2010 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (AAICAD), florbetapir's developer first reported data, later published in the JAMA, showing nearly perfect correlation between brain amyloid levels detected by florbetapir PET scans in study volunteers and levels found in autopsies of the same individuals a few months later. The developer has sought Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market florbetapir under the brand name Amyvid. The FDA has said it will withhold approval until the developer establishes a professional training program to ensure accuracy and consistency in reading and interpreting Amyvid scans. Florbetaben (BAY 94-9172) is another radiotracer designed to detect beta-amyloid during a PET scan. Phase II study results and other florbetaben data were reported at the 2010 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (AAICAD). Phase II data were also later published in Lancet Neurology. Further studies are now under way. I really enjoyed this article, I hope you like it as well. The more we know about this desease, the more we can fight against it and help the ones we love."
"Alzheimer's Research MrKap wrote: What about choline? I've read some people get a brain fog from the cheaper sources, but I've read it slows the onset. MrKap, that is brilliant... I too have tried choline as a supplement and find it to better than coffee, but perhaps not quite as good as Green Tea. Not comparable, just saying... The lecithin, not so good, imo... the other stuff, a little better. Testy Testy Testy... what's good for the Goose is poison to the Gander"
"Alzheimer's Research Yeah it comes with trade-offs, specifically sensitivity. Choline. I used to eat it like candy, and the guy who I was madder than hell at for ruining my life, started mouthing off about their frustrations about me being on steroids. So I've been hush hush about it. They put the stuff in baby formula, by law."
"Alzheimer's Research Choline...spot on. Now, not all choline supplements are created equal. In other words, in terms of purity, rate of absorption, you will have to shop around. I normally take a high supplement of choline when I use aniracetam. Choline impacts the production of memory neurotransmitters in the brain. What is great about it, is that there are few side effects and it is extremely cheap. I am personally taking lecithin."
"Long Term Care - Please Help! Hello all, My name is Karla Johnson and I am a 67 year old woman from Texas (yeehaw! ). Here is my situation, I hope someone has advice for me as I really need it! I have self diagnosed myself with the early stages of alzheimer's disease. My mother got it as well and I went through the whole process from start to current day (she is in now in a nursing home). Anyways, I was able to find a website that guided me through the application process for Long Term Care in my state ( LongTermCareInsuranceFinder.com ) and now that I have the quote back for how much it is going to cost me, I don't know if I can afford it! I have looked everywhere and it seems the free quote I got back from them was one of the lowest so that is not the problem, it is just that I have been out of work for quite some time and my husband is long passed away. My funds are running out and I am not sure where to turn next. I fear that I will become a financial burden to my family if I can not afford to pay for this Long Term Care Health Insurance which I think I will very desperately need soon. Does anyone have any suggestions as where I may seek state or government funding for my Long Term Care payments? Any information would be greatly appreciated as I am losing my mind day by day over this (literally!). Thank you! -Old Grammy"
"Long Term Care - Please Help! I was just posting about the same type of concern for my loved one. It is time for long term care but i can not afford it! This is what I have found, maybe it would be an option for you as well or maybe not but I thought you might want to know about it. Knowing that there are others out there facing the same challenges as I am makes it easier and gives me strength. My search yesterday was somewhat successful. I have been terrified of the expenses I faced with long term care but know that I now have no choice but to move forward with placing the one I love so I am looking into all of my options. I have been doing some research and found that a possibility I have may be Mexico. I live only minutes from the border so I would be very nearby. The cost is only $1700 for a private room and $1500 for a shared room at the facility I am looking at and it includes everything for the month.This facility is actually beachfront where my loved one can watch sun sets and dolphins. The idea of this peaceful atmosphere is very appealing. The nurses are all from the US and from speaking to the facility yesterday I am feeling very good about this place. I think I will go and check it out tomorrow. Has anyone else used Mexico as a more affordable option than care within the US and if so how do you feel about it? Thanks again and Bless You all."
"Long Term Care - Please Help! Hi, I know this post is a little later than what you expected. Generally, if you want to stay close to USA, it is good to go to Costa Rica, where most americans usually retire without many problems. At 1500 a month, you can live off good over there. If you want a cheaper alternative, go to Nicaragua, but it is not as safe. Now regarding alzheimers, people make it sound like they got it and that there is nothing else they can do. To the poster who lives in texas, I am near houston, and we can exchange information if you want to know more about dealing with alzheimers. If you want to know, alzheimers usually occurs after a prolonged period of neglect. Great ways to fight this endemic problem, is through dieting, exercising, supplementing, and mind-body exercises. These alternatives are relatively cheap, and require trivial investment. Oftentimes, people look for the hard way to solve their problems, which is often the ""norm."" PM if interested"
"Hi, There is no specific age-limit for Alzheimer's, but your mother's forgetfullness is not necessarily a sign of Alzheimer's. Everyone's brain loses some of it's 'substance' as the person gets older. When this substance is lost, so is the memory that it contained. It is a natural process. If you are very worried about it, tell your mother about your worries and ask her to go to a doctor with you. Take care, Kevin"
"Mother at the age of 58 Hello, unfortunately, early onset Alzheimer's does occur and can be a possibility, however that is not the only thing that can cause these type of symptoms. Best way to know for sure is to have your mom see a Neurologist or Psychiatrist, in order to get a diagnosis. Diagnosing Alzheimer's is done by ruling out all other possible causes and a complete brain scan (MRI or CT scan) is needed for diagnosis. Often times other factors can cause similar symptoms to Alzheimer's (Even vitamin deficiencies!) and early onset Alzheimer's (Which occurs before age 65) is not as common, overall. Good luck! -Dan."
"Mother at the age of 58 She may also be suffering from what is known as MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment). This is often mistaken for full third-stage Alzheimer's. Of course there are also other non-Alzheimer's types of dementia such as vascular dementia or Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Vascular Dementia often shows up in people after a stroke (but not always). I'll echo what others have said and say that only a psychiatrist or neurologist can be certain. What she is experiencing may be nothing to worry about but an exam can't hurt and not only would it put your mind at ease, it would also help determine if treatment is needed. Catching any disease or condition early is always a good thing."
Dependent personality mother with Dementia! Does anyone out there have experience with this problem? My mother is a very dependent person and probably meets the criteria for Dependent Personailty Disorder. She also has dementia. The move to a rest home seems to have triggered her dependency needs and now she has the aides calling us constantly. Since she forgets she has talked to us she calls over and over again. We are totally exhausted from her neediness. She could care less about the other residents or all the activities the rest home offers. All she wants is us - no substitutions - and we are plum worn out. I fear the only thing that will soothe her is to be with us 24/7. Please help!!!
"Dependent personality mother with Dementia! I am sorry you are going through this. Have you spoken to the staff at the home as they may have some suggestions about what to do as it is likely they have come across this before. Good luck Cracked So long and thanks for all the fish Now we are out of the sea and we're keeping away from the sharks We don't delete posts on demand The Rules When all else fails, hug the CAT Obey The Moderator"
"Dependent personality mother with Dementia! Hi IslandLass, I also think that it would be beneficial to know the view of the staff of care Home as dependent personality disorder makes a person full of anxiety and feels so helpless that he could not start anything without any help. I think it would not be possible to completely cure this disorder unlike other disorders. Person is not able to make a quick decision most of the time and finds it difficult to be alone anywhere. Psychotherapy is the most effective method which is used to get relief from such kind of disorder although complete treatment would not be possible"
"Dependent personality mother with Dementia! Yes, I absolutely have the same situation, and it is heartbreaking. Growing up, my mother went through a divorce, and she latched onto me as the older daughter. Then when I got married; she found someone and got married, and suddenly I didn't exist. She became so latched onto her husband that every sentence began with ""Bob and I."" I couldn't even sit near her without her sitting and holding his hand. She decided to move from Connecticut to Florida with him, because he had 5 kids, and she didn't want to deal with them. When she moved 2000 miles away, I was heartbroken; but she told me I would get over it. She missed all the years of my son (her grandson) growing up, and when she did visit, all she cared about was being with her husband, and going back to Florida. Her husband died at age 79, and the day he died, she latched onto my single sister, Sarah and moved back up to Connecticut to live with Sarah for five years. My mother never went back to her home in Florida She started to use phrases like ""Sarah and I."" She was extremely despondent and lost lots of weight. Finally, my sister couldn't take it anymore. My mother was losing her mind. Long, story short, we had to finally place her in a dementia unit; this time closer to my house. This place is gorgeous. It is like a 5 star hotel, with excellent food, activities all day, maid service, bus trips. It is bright and clean, and yet all my mother does is keep packing to go home with SARAH. She calls SARAH night and day. They finally had to take the key from my mother, because she tripped over her own things that she packed by the door, and knocked herself out, and landed in the hospital (another day of hysteria). She threatened to put a bullet in her head, and she landed in the hospital psych ward. The psychologists are trying to get her on some type of anti-anxiety andepressant medications. She pegged her whole life on her husband, and when he deceased, she glued herself to my sister, and my sister burnt out. I visit at least twice a week, and every weekend we go out for a ride and ice cream. Now my mother wants me to sleep over with her in a semi-private room in the dementia ward. Sometimes, she forgets it is me and calls me Sarah. She is angry, because she said she came up North to be with her kids, and noone cares, so she threatens to go back to Florida. She can't go anywhere, because she is now 82 and has moderate to severe dementia. They don't know if it is Alzheimers, but it is really bad. The guilt I feel is enormous, because she is so unhappy. don't know how much longer I will have her, and I want to enjoy our time together."
"alzheimers Most important advice for dealing with someone who has Alzheimer's is to familiarize yourself with it. Also it is very important to be compassionate and patient with the person. You will need patience because often you will find yourself repeating the same things over & over to this person, which can get frustrating & emotionally draining. Having patience is needed, so that you do not take your frustration out on the person with Alzheimer's, which can make things worse, for both you and them. -Dan ------------------------------ Here is a great resource for you, to learning about this debilitating disease: www.alz.org/ (Alzheimer's association)"

I live with a 65 year old man, that I am curious about. he has an online business and many times he forgets to send in orders or email the customer tracking numbers, also in the car he'll be driving and totally forget where he is going. He routinely loses credit cards and other important items he has put in the same place for years. He leaves his cell phone everywhere. I tell him I have an appointment an hour later he completely forgets I have it and he is becoming very quick to anger. He is sleeping a lot more then normal as well. I am worried about him.

"Alzheimer's or something else? It does sound like it can be some type of Dementia, although Dementia is only an umbrella term for many memory/cognitive diseases, including Alzheimer's. It can sometimes also be caused by underlying medical-health problems, not related to Dementia, certain medications or vitamin deficiencies. Best way to know for sure is to have this gentleman see a Neurologist or Psychiatrist, in order to get a diagnosis.

"How risky is the contracting of Alzheimer's Disease? The Alzheimer's disease symptoms are frequently confused with the changes that occur in usual aging, so it is significant to know the difference. I have read in ‘nun study treatment’ in google recently that we must determine about Alzheimer's disease because this disease is actually not an ordinary part of aging. When the ApoE4 gene occurs, the danger will continue, and due to this, the risk of contracting Alzheimer's may enhance to 50%. Some symptoms are can be observed in older people or even in ourselves. So it should be measured as a serious condition especially if it is hereditary."
"How risky is the contracting of Alzheimer's Disease? Alzheimer’s is such a critical condition to have. Having a family that had an Alzheimer’s can cause you to have one too. So we must go to our doctors and ask for a check up to know if we are going to have this one. Me myself is experiencing of forgetting things. And it’s not just that simple of forgetfulness. So I think I would have a meeting with my doctor. I had also read at ‘nun study treatment’ that having a depression might cause you to have an Alzheimer’s. I think preventing is better than cure, especially that Alzheimer’s doesn’t have a treatment yet, they are still discovering it. So we must know what are the signs and symptoms of it, so we could slow down the process of forming Alzheimer’s."
"How risky is the contracting of Alzheimer's Disease? It is very difficult to convince a family member of mine to be fitted for a much needed hearing aid, let alone an assessment to determine what's really going on with them mentally.. Some days this family member's mind is sharp as a tack. Other times the mind is forgetful and dull as a butter knife. Right now our family is only allowed to observe from a distance and not touch. I may not know my way right now, but I will know real soon .."
"Are these symtoms of Alzheimer's disease? I have this query for my father-in-law who is over 73 years of age now. Since past some weeks we have noticed some unusual problems in him. This is mainly that of loss of memory. And he gets lost in the way - there are incidents that he forgets for what reason he had started off from home and also he forgets things that he used to keep at the same place all the time. In the last week, he had pain in his left eye along with blurred vision for which the ophthalmologist has prescribed an eye drop - a drop of which is being poured into the eye. And he reported dizziness shortly after this which is to be confirmed yet with the ophthalmologist if its because of the drop. Our concern is to know why he has this kind of memory loss... Alzheimer's?? N.B: he is a little diabetic but under control as the tests show Awaiting your reply. Thanks"
"Are these symtoms of Alzheimer's disease? It certainly sounds like some form of dementia. If he is forgetting why he left home, there is definitely something wrong. Talk to his doctor about this. There is no cure for the disease, but it's progression can be slowed down. I would definitely bring it up. Do it now because it sounds like he is in the earlier stages. If you wait too long, treatments won't be nearly as effective."
Are these symtoms of Alzheimer's disease? there may be something here so it would be best to check it up with a doctor asap forgetting things mid way is a classic sign of alzheimers - I have an uncle who has it so I know what it's like and it isn't nice. better to get treatment now and get it checked up asap
"Are these symtoms of Alzheimer's disease? Neurologists or Geriatricians are the best type of doctors for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease or other causes of dementia. It might be best to be referred to them. They order HEAD CT or other scans, labwork, and look at the whole picture. Sometimes they will do some very lengthy testing to figure out what the exact problem could be."

"Are these symtoms of Alzheimer's disease? Memory loss is one symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Other symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include putting objects in weird or unusual places, repeating the same sentences over and over again (several times in a span of a few minutes), repetitive behaviors, odd speech patterns, delusions, personality changes, an inability to focus or concentrate, and a loss of ability to do simple tasks. It's quite an insidious disease so best get him checked out. Serving healthy doses of truth since 1996."

"How to properly gauge worsening of cognitive decline Is there a consensus in the assessment of cognitive decline worsening which combines several neuropsychological battery tests? For example, in assessing the worsening of a patient's dementia I would think it is insufficient to simply look at his/her CDR score or MMSE score alone. Is there a combination of CDR, MMSE and perhaps some other tests that over a one-year period would indicate worsening of decline? Is there a consensus variable that combines several tests or do researchers gauge worsening each in their own way?"
"Alzheimer's with grandma HI people, I just wanted to share a bit of my experience with people who have had alzheimer's. My grandma had it, and she lived with us. Over the course of about 7-10 years it kept getting worse. At the end, she was mute and bedridden. Before she got so bad she used to argue with me and my parents about everything. She despised me though, since I lived in the room right across from her. She told me I was stealing from her, when later the stuff was found in her closet and she denied it being there. It's very difficult to work with an alzheimer's person, especially when they're not on medication for it. My grandma would throw away her medications. Mum and I found them in the trash. Right before she died she was in a nursing home. Then one night at about 2am they called telling us that her lips were turning blue and a lot of other things - and they asked what to do about it. Mum said ""get her to the ER now!"". We got there soon after. She was in horrible shape. I cried for her. Mum went to work at about 7am while they were still waiting for a ""room"" to put grandma in. Dad and I left too. Then mum gets a call at work saying that grandma died. She died in ER waiting for a room. She had many illnesses, but what I heard about how she died was that her lungs filled up with phlem because she didn't know to cough. When my great aunt died, she went downhill FAST. Once while she was still able to get up, she ran away and her son had to go find her. She would also smoke cigarettes and when she was done she'd throw them in the trashcan, not the ashtray. What got her down was falling down the steps and breaking her hip. From then on, she was bedridden too. When we went to see her, the doctor said she was brain dead and would go anytime. When my cousin got the call that his mum died, he cried, balling! I'm so glad he got it out. I'm glad we were there for him. He almost passed out a few times. I cried with him and hugged him and told him that it will soon pass and be easier on the mind. (I recently lost a dog, so I know how bad it feels to lose something or someone you love). Please know this - when a loved one gets alzheimers, they need the love and support more than ever. I wish there was a cure for alzheimer's. Well I hope I've helped someone by my story. I know it's a sad thing to go through with a loved one, but remember when they die that they're not suffering anymore, especially if they know the Lord. Take care guys, Rock Of Ages ""Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it"" (Luke 18:17)"

Sure, there are MANY negatives about it, but the relative seems to be in her own world and - I must admit - happier than she was before she had Alzheimer's. Before she had it, death was always on her mind, but now she is in her own world and genuinely seems happy. The way that your relative died wasn't nice, but there is no 'perfect' way to make the transition from life to death, to be honest. So, try not to focus on that too much. Take care, Kevin"

"Alzheimer's with grandma My uncle had alzheimers. He died almost two years ago. It was very tough for us because a lot of times he would try to flush towels, or he would actually try to escape the house. We realized how bad it had gotten for him when his wife, my aunt, asked him to go buy bread over at the store that was just down the street from where they lived, and he got lost. I also remember that one time, he wanted to buy some candy for himself. The thing was, he had diabetes as well, and he wasn't supposed to eat candy. And he had forgotten that he was a diabetic. it's a scary thing watching a loved one just deteriorate like that. Especially when you know that when they were young, they were very strong and fit."
"There are the risk factors Zapatista, hope they answer your question... Age: The risk of developing Alzheimer’s increases with age. One out of every 10 persons 65 years and older is a victim of Alzheimer's disease, although early-onset victims may be in their 40s and 50s. Approximately 20 percent of Americans between the ages of 75 and 84, and almost half of those 85 years and older suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Genetics: Early-onset Alzheimer's has been clearly shown to be genetic in origin. While mutations on chromosomes 9 and 19 have been linked with late-onset Alzheimer's (the most common form), not everyone with the mutations develops the disease. The relationship between genetics and late-onset Alzheimer's is not fully known. Other: Some studies have implicated prior traumatic head injury, lower education level, and female gender as possible risk factors. However, at the present time, no definitive causes have been identified."
"It can strike any age, however the chances increase the older you get. most who get the disease don't even realize it. the chances you, at 20, would have it are very very very slim. there are many other causes that could be causing these symptoms, it is best to see a doctor. depression is one disease that can often mask or mimic some symptoms of dementia."
"What Age Does Alzheimer's Usually Start? Alzheimer’s disease is mostly seen in older people but very occasionally it develops in middle age, occasionally in the 30’s (about 10% of all Alzheimer’s cases). People over the age of 65 are most frequently affected. The incidence of Alzheimer’s disease increases with age and by the age of 85 years nearly half of all people are affected by the disease. Thanks"
What Age Does Alzheimer's Usually Start? Yes my aunt is suffering from alzheimers and the last time i met her she could'nt even recognize me . Only then did i realize that this disease does'nt physically affect the person much but emotionally and mentally . Its so hard to even imagine a person suffering so mcuh but just cant show it out . Alzheimers can be prevented by just being socially active and staying fit and occasionally drinking a cup of coffee .

I'm separating myself from him and just becoming his care taker because it hurts so much. I tell myself that he has died and I'm taking care of his body til the lord takes it. My children are in denial and seldom come around. He doesn't seem to know him anyway. I don't know how to meat their need because they won't talk to me. I've told them I need them if only for a few minutes. They never return my request. I feel so alone and am dealing with my own years of mental illness and abuse.

Establish a routine to make each day more predictable and less confusing. Schedule the most difficult tasks, such as bathing or medical appointments, for the time of day when your loved one tends to be most calm and agreeable. Take your time. Expect things to take longer than they used to. Schedule more time to complete even simple tasks so that you don't need to hurry your loved one. Involve your loved one. Allow your loved one to do as much as possible with the least amount of assistance. For example, perhaps your loved one can dress alone if you lay out the clothes in the order they go on. Limit choices. The fewer the options, the easier it is to decide. For example, provide two outfits to choose between — not a closet full of clothes. Provide simple instructions. When you ask your loved one to do something, do it one step at a time. Reduce distractions. Turn off the TV and minimize other distractions at mealtime and during conversations so that your loved one can better focus on the task at hand. Blessings to all!"
"About the mesothelioma... Mesothelioma: ""It is documented that Australia had the highest per capita use of asbestos in the world from the 1950’s until the 1970’s. As a tragic consequence, Australia now has the highest per capita incidence of mesothelioma in the world. With more than 500 Australians contracting mesothelioma per year, it is estimated that up to 18,000 Australians will die from this asbestos related cancer by the year 2020... Mesothelioma is an unusual, but no longer seldom cancer that is difficult to diagnose, treat, and responds poorly to therapy. Mesothelioma is a cancer in which cancerous or malignant cells appear around the heart, chest or abdominal region of the body. It is believed the main cause is exposure to asbestos. Infact, it takes about 30-40 years after asbestos exposure, for mesothelioma symptoms to occur..."" Your comments, please... === A lot information about mesothelioma and asbestos"
"About the mesothelioma... Mesothelioma might be one of the rarer cancers, but it is often very deadly. I have been looking into it more and more for a friend whose father used to work in a mill. I think one of the better resources we found here . I encourage everyone to come up to speed with this disease and its causes."
"alzheimer and dementia Hi, Alzheimer's progresses slowly in an individual, as far as I'm aware. How long ago was he diagnosed with it? To clear up the classification of these things, Alzheimer's is one of many types of Dementia. Dementia itself encompasses many different neurodegenerative disorders. I'm merely saying this for my own benefit, I guess, as I want to learn more in this area.

"alzheimer and dementia These diseases can have an onset and you might not notice it for 5 years or more. It often takes even up to 10 years for you to notice anything is getting worse. We just started to notice my grandma's dementia in 2003 and we thought it was just old age. We didn't realize anything was actually wrong with her until 2008. Even then she was still able to take her medication on her own and be by herself all day. Usually, if someone with dementia gets an illness, you will see a definite progression in the disease. For example, my grandma broke her hip and she suddenly went from just forgetful to not being able to speak sentences! Then it progressed very slowly again and we actually thought she was getting better! But she got sick again and went straight to not walking or speaking anything we could understand. It's been 2 years since then and we haven't noticed her getting any worse. Just hope that your grandpa doesn't break his hip, get pneumonia, fall or have a stroke. If he stays free of that, he might be lucky enough to die before he suffers to much from Alzheimer's."
"Magnesium to help with Memory? Based on a study done last year looks like they found that more magnesium in the brain helps with short term and long term memory. ""Magnesium is essential for the proper functioning of many tissues in the body, including the brain and, in an earlier study, we demonstrated that magnesium promoted synaptic plasticity in cultured brain cells,"" - Professor Guosong Liu, Director of the Center for Learning and Memory at Tsinghua University in Beijing Here is the original article: Magnesium Supplement Helps Boost Brainpower http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100127121524.htm Here is the original study published: Enhancement of Learning and Memory by Elevating Brain Magnesium http://download.cell.com/neuron/pdf/PIIS0896627309010447.pdf?intermediate=true Anyone believe in this stuff, looks like only the specific magnesium l-threonate helps with increasing magnesium levels in the brain? I am a bit skeptical but looks promising. Anyone have any idea on how magnesium affect the brain? Or even where we can find this stuff? Only thing I found was a few forum topics and these guys http://www.mlt500.com"
"Magnesium to help with Memory? All I know is something like 80% of our body processes are for our BRAIN. We think about neurotransmittors as something separate but they are not - they are from our NUTRITION we take in. But so many things are needed! I have no doubt magnesium (Mg) may be needed, but so are the B vitamins, and so is vitamin D and so are the essential fatty acids, and so is GABA, and carnitine, and CoQ10, and ...... So, if I were really concerned (and I am), I would (and I did) get some extensive nutritional testing. I had ulterior motives - having cancer, but in the course of the cancer events discovered genetically, I am at increased risk for Alzheimer's. One thing I find comforting is that because so many factors go into ultimate risk (and health) that we DO have control over, I am pleased. I can increase exercise. I can have my healthy shakes/shakes in the mornings. I can eat organic, increase my veggies, get better sleep, etc. By the way, the doctor just said I need to take a magnesium supplement at nights, but to decrease it if it changes my bowel movements too much. I don't know what he meant by that - might it cause me constipation? diarrhea? I don't know... I'm going to look that up on this wonderful resource called the Internet before I start on the supplement tonight."
"Magnesium to help with Memory? I just looked up Mg on WebMD. Unfortunately it could cause diarrhea. Sheesh. I sure don't need that! And I don't really understand why my doctor says I need to take it because we get it from fiber-rich fruits and dark green leafy veggies which I eat every day. At any rate, WebMD verifies its many uses in addition to constipation - bad cholesterol, heart disease, and sure enough - problems affecting the functioning of our nerves and brain!!! .... from WebMD: attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, leg cramps during pregnancy, diabetes, kidney stones, migraine headaches, weak bones (osteoporosis), premenstrual syndrome (PMS), altitude sickness, urinary incontinence, restless leg syndrome, asthma, hayfever, multiple sclerosis, and for preventing hearing loss."
"i care for my grandad with alzheimers .... Hi, i live with my grandad who has alzheimers and im scared that i shouldnt be here.. i suffer from depression and anxiety and i'm kinda agoraphobic i was diagnosed with bpd but think its crap.. i need to go doctors again but i get scared to tell them how i am and how i feel cos should i be caring for him? to be honest its the only reason i get out of bed in the mornin because i have to because of him.. so maybe its a good thing aswell? could i be seen as unfit to be his carer?"
"i care for my grandad with alzheimers .... Baze, you don't sound like you are a terrible carer/worker, and the fact that you are even worrying about your position is indication enough for me that you will do what is right in the present and future. Howevr, you should try to open-up more when you talk to a doctor. I know that you probably fear that he/she will deam you unsuitable to take care of your grandad, but I seriously doubt that would happen. In fact, it would be showing more responsibility on your behalf if you were dealing with your problems, rather than if you were just ignoring them.

"Side effects of Ebixa?? My dad has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. I can no more see his condition. He talks when he is alone and sometimes talks about things that are not in the room. For instance, the other day he was telling me that there is water on the floor when actually there was nothing over there. He behaves abnormally. The doctor prescribed him Ebixa and he has been taking this since last month but yesterday I noticed a lump on his head. It’s oily but it doesn’t pain. At first I thought that it could be a side effect of the medicine but when I checked the side effects of Ebixa on the net nothing of this sort has been said. What do you think could be the problem? I am phoning the doctor since yesterday but can’t reach him."
"Sorry, but I think it's really a long-shot for anyone here to have such specialized knowledge. Googling ""elixia side-effects"" is probably as good as it gets. You don't mention any reason for feeling urgent about an oily, non-painful lump. Perhaps rather than phoning the doc you can set up an appt. Docs aren't generally big on diagnosing a problem over the phone. Good luck. —LQ"

"Side effects of Ebixa?? You can try Aricept. Aricept is used to treat mild to moderate dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease. Aricept improves the function of nerve cells in the brain. Aricept prevents the breakdown of a chemical called acetylcholine. People suffering from dementia usually have lower levels of this chemical, which is important for the processes of memory, thinking, and reasoning."
"role of confabulation in alzheimer's or dementia? does anyone know how much of a role confabulation plays in alzheimers, dementia or any other similar disease? is it an early warning sign of that type of disease or an indicator of a different type of disorder? my mother, 69, tends to fabricate complete stories or parts of stories and i just wondered if she does it to over compensate for failing health or if there could possibly be a problem she isn't aware of. any help is appreciated thanks!"

"role of confabulation in alzheimer's or dementia? Yes that definitely can be a sign of Alzheimer's disease. Does she have any forgetfulness? Does she tend to be more firendly and social than usual? Is she turing more stubborn? I used to think that stubbornness was just part of old age, but it really can be a sign of dementia or alzhemer's."
"role of confabulation in alzheimer's or dementia? Yes my mother, who has had dementia for about 8 years, makes up parts of stories. Thee is usually a grain of truth to what she says (no little green men in her room). But she'll add details that we know aren't true. And she becomes adamant about her version no matter what say! I think it's part of the delusionary system they often develop as part of the disorder. Actually, this was one of her earliest symptoms."
"role of confabulation in alzheimer's or dementia? Hi All, I feel sorry that I do not know much about confabulation disorder, what I know is that confabulation is a kind of brain disorder which occurs in those type of elders who have sustained damaged in their basal fore brain and frontal lobes in brain and a obvious symptoms of this disorder is that patient starts producing spontaneously false memories like memories such events which has never occurred. persons suffering from this kind of disease often remain unaware from the fact that the stories or events they are describing are fake in fact they believe that they are telling the truth and can start argue with you about the genuineness of that event."
"stem cell therapy relieves some symtoms of Alzheimer Check it out at www.newlifestemcell.com .

Feel free to ask me on stem cell therapy so I could be able to provide certain knowledge for this and get started for a valuable discussion."
"stem cell therapy relieves some symtoms of Alzheimer Stem Cell Therapy Issues relating to a wide series of innovative health technologies are currently being covered and discussed in the web. Different treatment methods were introduced in the field and unquestionably, people keep way on what is more effective and safe way of healing procedure. Stem cell treatment is one of the intervention strategies that can address problems on human diseases and experts find its potential to treat such as brain damage, cancer, heart damage, deafness, diabetes and other complications. Stem cell treatment has its prospective to change the face of diseases and alleviate the suffering of humans. This kind of treatment introduces new cells into damaged tissues and it can replace damage areas in the body with a minimal risk of rejection and side effects. Stem cells give rise to subsequent generations with variable degrees of differentiation capacities. Different innovations in this field are still arising and medical researchers anticipate that soon they’ll be able to treat cancer other illnesses. There are approved centers that are currently focuses on offering stem cell transplantation to help restore function of a variety of organs and tissues, and to prolong life, enhance emotional and mental outlook, and offer effective relief of a variety of conditions and functional disorders. Always do remember that dealing with the best medical practitioners is an essential factor to fulfill best treatment results."
"stem cell therapy relieves some symtoms of Alzheimer What are Stem Cells? Stem cells are cells with the potential to develop different types of cells in the body. They are characterized by the ability to renew themselves through mitotic cell division and differentiating into a diverse range of specialized cell types. Studying stem cells may help explain how serious conditions such as cancer appear. There are types of stem cells determined by their functional capabilities. Totipotent stem cells, meaning their potential is total, have the capacity to give rise to every cell type of the body and to form an entire organism. Pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells, are capable of generating virtually all cell types of the body but are unable to form a functioning organism. Multipotent stem cells can give rise only to a limited number of cell types. For example, adult stem cells, also called organ- or tissue-specific stem cells, are multipotent stem cells found in specialized organs and tissues after birth. Their primary function is to replenish cells lost from normal turnover or disease in the specific organs and tissues in which they are found. Stem cells have amazing promise as a medical treatment, but there are still huge obstacles to overcome. It may fulfill this promise but it always needs lot efforts to gain possible real results."
"I'm being looked after My Grandparents are my caregivers: I am 14 at the moment and there are many fees that need to be paid, and places that I need to be driven. My Grandma is not well-educated and cannot drive, so she acts as the housewife figure and takes up the stereotypical women's role. My Granddad is in charge of keeping a roof over our head and he has Alzheimer's. It's not serious yet, but we can see it becoming increasingly so. I sometimes have family therapy sessions, but they are not working because all arguments begin with my Granddad's forgetfulness. He forgets that he bought something expensive, and blames my Grandma for wasting money; he forgets where he put something, and blames my Grandma for losing it; he forgets the words for things, and he has many enemies from social isolation; he forgets how to fix something, and blames us for interfering; he forgets his line of conversation, and so rambles on with the same racist 'speech' that nobody respects, and is suspicious of everybody around him. All day we get yelled at and only sometimes does he admit to his poor memory. Our family never stops arguing and I'm tired. I don't know what I should do as this gets worse and I don't know how we will survive when he forgets how to do the things that nobody else in the household knows how to do. He's stubborn, so he will always be our problem: there's no confession. I don't know what the future holds and how we are going to deal."

"question about alzheimer Hi, my name is Michelle. I have a question about Alzheimer's. I read that there is a new product for Alzheimer's which is based on the results from the nun-study. They say it does not fight plaques but inflammation of the brains, which is, according to the nun study the root cause of Alzheimer's. The medicine is called OCW for Alzheimer's. Does anyone has any experience with that? Did someone try this OCW medicine? The website where they sell it and the film documentations there convinced me a lot but before I buy the product I want to ask whether someone has any experience with that. Thank you so much for your response. Kind regards Michelle"
"question about alzheimer Hi Michelle, Unfortunately, there are no professionals working here and this particular part of the website isn't all too active anyway. So, your best bet is to talk to a doctor about this. Kevin psychforums.com rules: http://www.psychforums.com/forum-rules.php Please send me a private message if you need help with anything."
"question about alzheimer Michelle, do you mean the website http://www.nun-study.com ? I have found that when i made a search on OCW Alzheimer, so I think it must be what you are referring to. I would not jump on this anti-inflammtory bandwaggon immediately, eventhough the movies there look very much scientific and are convincing. I also made a seach on ""anti-inflammatory theorie Pat McGeer"" and there is lots of information coming up with tons of scientific reports and testing. Also Wikipedia has Pat McGeer listed as the father of anti-inflammatory alzheimer scientist - so I guess these things about the product OCW are true. But still I am hesitating to purchase this product for my mom since it is quite expensive to take on a monthly basis and as far as I read about it you must take it regularly in order to succeed. Maybe if money is not your concern then I would give it a try. Warmest Richard"
"Independent Bathing Walk In Tub Solutions For Alzheimer's I am a caregiver take care of my Uncle who suffers from Alzheimer's. If you are a caregiver, while you might not be personally dealing with a family member, When you show as much love and patience as you can, even in such personal matters like bath time, you are showing your patients that you care. As the caregiver are the one required to set up the schedule of bath time. my Uncle with Alzheimer's forgets to take bath everyday. My uncle doesn't like to be given a bath he can still manage to bath himself. I worry about him bathing along in a conventional bathtub. I found lots of mobility solutions at Ellasbubbles no longer do i need to worry about my uncle bathing alone. I have installed grab bars and a walk in tub. Takes the stress of senior bathing for me and my Uncle. He enjoys the relaxing aspect of a walk in tub such as the hydrotherapy jets. It was a great solutions I remind him of his daily bath and he can bath in private with me standing around right outside the door. Another benefit of the walk in tub vs the conventional bathtub is that rate of falling is greatly reduced because the walk in tub doesnt leak water onto the floor and there is no need for my uncle to step the ella's deluxe model has a steel door that opens. Sharing my story hope it helps others edited by Administration--no commercial links"
"Independent Bathing Walk In Tub Solutions For Alzheimer's ...Only advertising products? - Not to worry. If you are indeed a caregiver, then you should be very proud of what you do.

"Are hallucinations common in people with Alzheimer's? Hi, I can imagine that it is very common, because the brain 'pathways' in a person with Alzheimer's become rather garbled (for want of a better word), and therefore memories can become crossed. So, whilst it might not be an hallucination per se , it is a pseudo-hallucnation in that it's a number of different memories being joined into one, and that makes it seem weird. Think of it as a dream, where many different memories are brought together. Kevin"
"Husband obsessed with having Alheimers My 68 year old husband has had memory and cognitive problems for as long as I have known him. He had a couple of traumatic events in his childhood and has very low emotional/social intelligence. He takes meds for ADD and depression. A year or so ago, he became obsessed with the idea that he had Alzheimer's. He finally went to a mental health professional (whom he had had no previous interaction with) who talked with him for an hour and said ""Yeah, maybe you have the beginnings of Alzheimer's."" and gave him scrip for a couple of meds, including Aricept. I scheduled a complete physical with another physician who referred my husband to a doctor who specializes in cognitive problems. He gave my husband a battery of tests and, after evalutating the results, said that he had a terrible memory but that the tests did not show Alzheimers. However, the tests are not always conclusive and my husband thought the Aricept might be helping his memory so the doc indicated he could continue to take it. As a result, I cannot get long term care insurance for my husband - but that is another long, sad story. Anyway, my husband continues to believe that he has Alzheimer's. He is obsessed with it - and I fear that it is a self-fulfilling loop. All of the ""symptoms"" he exhibits are of long standing but he now interprets behaviors he has engaged in for 30 years or more as evidence that he is has Alzherimer's. Adding fuel to the fire is the fact that he has long eaten a very unusual diet, which he believes to be healthy and he is addicted to supplements. He reads selectively and believes anything that fits his paradigm. I have always been the bread winner - he has never contributed to our support. I am now working about half time but instead of bringing me stress relief, the reduced hours mean more time with my husband and I am going stark raving mad. Any suggestions?"
"Husband obsessed with having Alheimers Hey, Perhaps Munchausen's Syndrome is more applicable here, if you genuinely think that he's only doing this for attention. Munchausen's is where the person feigns illness just for attention at first, but then it bciomes an addictive cycle. I am only 26 but I believe that older people are much more set in their ways than younger people, and therefore it might be tough to get him out of this way of thinking. If you perhaps present him with an official list of symptoms of Alzhimer's, then maybe he will notice that he doesn't have it. An alternative approach is to simply ignore him when he mentions that he has Alzheimer's - i.e. pretend that he didn't even speak. Kevin"
"Husband obsessed with having Alheimers Tell him the best way to stave off AD is to stay mentally and physically active. Have him go out for long walks and do crossword puzzles. If you can get him busy doing things he won't think about it so much. Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast."
"obsession At my Dad's former care home, the owners had a lap top computer my dad found interesting. The owners talked me into getting him his own, saying they would help him with it, maybe he could get emails from grandkids, etc. I gave it to him for his birthday. He got obsessed with it, insisted on trying to carry it around (he uses a walker, so that was dangerous) and refused to be helped, insisting he could learn to use it, lots of cussing & frustration. It turned into a big hassle & eventually I took it home with me, hoping he would forget about it. It has been several months, he's living in a new care home, but every time I see him he asks for his ""typewriter"". He wants to write letters (old friends write him letters occassionally). He does not have the dexterity to use the lap top, or ability to write a coherent letter (last letter he wrote was a couple years ago & it was complete nonsense). I have told him the lap top was too difficult for him & I fear if I brought it to him, he would react in the same obsessive, angry way he did before. But every time I see him he asks, now more like insists, I bring him the lap top, essentially accusing me of stealing it from him. I find myself avoiding visiting him, because it just turns into him begging for the ""typewriter"", and me, again, telling him it is too difficult for him. I've offered to take dictation from him and write any letters myself, but he refuses and just gets angry with me. I am at my wits end about this. Does anyone else have experience with this type of obsessive behavior in a person with Alzheimers? Any suggestions?"
"Hi, I do not have any direct experience with an Alzheimer's patient but I suggest that whenever he mentions the laptop again, ignore him and move onto the next subject - i.e. pretend as if you never heard him. It may take a long time for him to accept the fact that he cannot have it. Kevin"
"My Granny Hello. I didn't really know how to title this post. I introduced myself in the 'intro' topic. I am the 34 year old granddaughter of an 89 year old woman with Alzheimer's. She is my Mum's Mum, and she now lives in a nursing home which specialises in Alzheimer's. I'm writing this on behalf of my Mum really, as she would like to know more about other people's experiences, but she doesn't want to be a burden and she's not confident enough with computers to be able to use this forum. Granny was in sheltered housing, with a flat to herself and a warden. This was about 5 years ago. She was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's after she lost the following: Ability to tell the time. Ability to recognise the values of coins and notes. Became forgetful (would leave the stove on, etc), and confused about things. Began to wander around town at night, until she was found by a good-natured member of the public or a police officer. Regualrly insisted that people/neighbours were coming into her house and stealing/moving things around. She would have arguments with the neighbours, accusing them of all sorts of things. Mum and Dad tried to take her on holiday, the journey was taken by car with frequent stops. Dad had a sattelite nav system in the car, which was switched on. At the end of the journey (a few hundred miles) Granny leapt out of the car and ran away accross the road, in a distressed state. She had got the idea into her head that the sattelite nav computer was controlling Dad (because it was telling him which way to go and he was obeying), and that he wasn't Dad any more but some imposter ('bad' Dad) who meant to harm her. She also thought that this 'bad' Dad had done away with 'good' Dad, and had convinced Mum to be with him instead of 'good' Dad. After Mum went after Granny and explained to her the real situation, Granny didn't believe her. She would not let Dad into the holiday cottage, so he had to wait down at the local pub until Mum phoned him to say that Granny was asleep and it was 'safe' to come back. In the morning Granny still believed in the 'bad' Dad, and would not accept food or drink from Mum or Dad, as she believed that they were trying to poison her. They had to cut the holiday short and bring her home again. They contacted the doctor immediately. After that, Granny was put into a residential assessment centre where she stayed for some months until the progression/level of her Alzheimer's was established, then a suitable place was found for her to recieve residential care. The care home is only 10 miles away from Mum and Dad, and Mum goes to see Granny every day. Nowadays Granny talks mostly nonsense, but she does have short periods of lucidity (ie: only a sentence or two at a time, 5 minutes on a good day). I live over the other side of the country to Mum and Dad, so I don't get to see them or Granny very often, but we are in telephone contact regularly. A couple of weeks ago I went to visit her with my Mum and my sister, who brought her baby along to meet Granny. That went well - in amongst the nonsense Granny understood that this was her great-granddaughter. She was very proud and pleased to have her family around her, she was able to hold the baby for 10 minutes with no problems. Baby needed a feed, and my sister and Mum left the room. I said I would catch them up, and stayed talking with Granny for a little longer. She seemed to be more lucid with me than with the other members of the family - we spoke about Grandad (who had died when I was 17), who she has not mentioned for years and years to anyone else - Mum had thought that she had forgotten about him! But then Mum called me to leave - I didn't really want to as Granny seemed to be having a good time with me, but I had to go - Mum can't spend too long with Granny as it upsets her and she finds it very stressful to see her mother deteriorate as time goes by. Mum has manic depression, and has been told by her doctor that she would not be able to look after Granny, which is why she can't spend so much time with her. I wish that I lived nearer so that I could visit Granny more often, but money and time are short (I work in the community support area, which means low wages and long hours). I speak to Granny on the phone, but she is rather deaf, and refuses to wear a hearing aid, so I know that she doesn't hear much of what I say, even when I raise my voice. Sorry about this, I'm rambling - here come my questions soon.... 7 days ago Granny fell over in her room while Mum was visiting. An ambulance was called, and luckily Granny had not broken anything. After Mum and the ambulance left Granny fell again, this time she broke her hip. She was on the floor for 30 mins before staff found her (luckily, as if it had been a different time of day she could have been lying on the floor all night!). She went straight to hospital and her hip was pinned. The doctors' plan is to give her physiotherapy to get her back on her feet, and then she can go back to the nursing home. The trouble is, Granny is not sure where she is in hospital. Since the operation she has had no lucid moments at all, and is increasingly confused. She is very suspicious and thinks that people are trying to poison her again. So, she is refusing all food, drink, and medications. She has another urinary infection (she has always been reluctant to drink for fear of wetting herself, so she gets loads of these infections, which don't do her mind any good) because she will not drink. Doctors did put a drip in her arm, but she kept pulling it out, so they won't put another one in. She also tries to pull out her catheter. She has become violent with doctors and nursing staff, trying to bite and hit them. I'm very glad that she was able to see her great-granddaughter before she broke her hip and took a turn for the worse. I am wondering if there has been anyone else who has had similar experiences of: Being told by doctors that you can't look after your loved one because you have a mental illness. Alzheimer's patients taking a turn for the worse since being under anaesthetic for a major operation. I think that's about it really, thanks for reading. sorry it was so long, but it all sort of flooded out!"
"Uggh, Alzheimer's is such a terrible disease. A Couple of my Great Aunts have it, I dont see them much but I do work in a nursing home as a CNA , so many of my residents have Alzheimer's. Many people think that the quailty of life for people who get this god awful disease is totally gone, but I disagree. Many of my residents live very happy fufilling lives ... in their own worlds of course, but most of them are very pleasent and cherry. So don't let doctors tell you everything. Do what you and your mom see fit. Thats the best advice I can give. Two steps forward One step back... The story of my life...."
"investigational medications My father had alzheimer's, but it was cancer that killed him. I just wanted to metion a couple of medications that are not yet approved in the US for use, but that seem to help. They can be obtained with the help of a sympathetic doctor. One is called clioquinol. It is an old drug that was banned 30 years ago because of side effects, but it seems to be safe if used in moderation. It seems to redude the amount of plaque in the brain by flushing out some of the copper and zinc that is in the plaques since it is a chealating agent. It is still used in African counties as a traetment for ameobic dissentary. I found a compounding pharnacist who was able to get some from a US company. There is a nerve growth factor called cerebrolysin whcih seemed to help my father also. I had it shipped from Austria. The big problem with it is that it needs to injected intravenously five days a week for a month. It has been used in Germany for years and it known to be a safe medication."
"From my based experience I recommend mariguana, because of its strong effect on mental process, can be the cure to many diseases, its just its impossible even for modern medicine to prove this, and even its so hard for me to explain it in words, but I recommend it cannabis harmless, and natural medication. Theorically speaking, I would guess looking upwards is like watching towards Gods heaven, looking down is like seeing through hell, then actually where are we walking through now? Simple, none of those, its the earth."
"Moving to new care home My dad's been in a care home for 2 years 500 miles away. His friends have all died or become disabled and only his wife is able to visit & such, but she can no longer do that due to health problems of her own, so we've decided to move him near me & his grown grandchildren. Does anyone have experience with how people with AD cope with such a move? He is I suppose mid-level AD, he still knows us, but his abilty to speak is pretty impaired so we don't know really how much he understands. Thanks for sharing any of your experiences."
"dear Faithful, My mother died a few months ago after a long decline from Parkinson's. She was similar to your Dad in that she eventually could barely speak, just make little grunts, so it was really hard to know what she was thinking. Her facial expression was also rigid, so reading emotional content was impossible. We tried as much as possible to relate to her as though she understood us. It was sort of like having a baby, but without the expressiveness infants show. Very difficult. My heart goes out to you. If he still can recognize you, I would think going to see him alot, and providing him with familiar objects, like a favorite blanket, ect. might help him cope. I often felt that my mother was lost in a big house she used to know her way around in. She would look out the windows so to speak, but not recognize the neighborhood. Very lonely. So like I said, go see him alot. Go sit with him and don't worry too much about feedback. Just pet him and hug him. ""So It Goes..."" Kurt Vonnegut http://schizoids.net/forum/index.php"
