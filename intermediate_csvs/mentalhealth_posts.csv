1,"Hey y’all. I dunno what’s been going on, but I think it might be DPD or Depersonalization. Come to think of it, it started after I smoked with my cousin for the first time. It was really chill, I didn’t take any massive hits or anything, but the next morning I’ve been where I am now. Life just doesn’t  seem as vivid anymore. I know I’m me and the world around me feels real it’s just not as *bright* anymore. How, if it’s even possible, do I get myself back to normal?"
2,"As the title states my boyfriend (M24)can't tell the difference between relationshipsc in video games and real life. 

This started as early as 2019. My dog died in August of 2019 and I (FM25) was heart broken. I couldn't stand to go home without him. I didn't sleep in my apartment for 2 weeks (stayed with family). When I finally would go back to my apartment I would cry till I couldn't breath and would have chest pains. 

Fast forward to 2021 and I am in a new apartment. We were walking back to my apartment from shopping and what not when we were talking about dying from a broken heart. It was mainly focused on how Elephants have died from broken hearts. I explained to my bf that when my dog died I had similar chest pains to what was described from Broken Heart Syndome.   He then chimes in and said he's also felt the same way. He went on to compare the sadness I felt from my dog dying to a video game characters dying. 

For those who are wondering the video game in question was ""Danganronpa V3"" and the character he was referring to was ""Gonta Gokuhara"". Now, I have no issue with video games. I enjoy them too! I grew up playing video games with my siblings. There have been times I rage quit from playing video games. But I have never once saw a link between real life and video games the way my boyfriend compared them. He also gets upset when I talk about video games as ""code"". I understand I can do stupid stuff in video games and it will never affect my real life. There is a distinct difference between the two. One you can replay and replay all you want and the other you only get one chance at. He refuses to do ""bad"" things in games or play as the antagonist/villain in games. 

So, I have asked him several times throughout the last 4 years about that very statement. He felt 'the same pain about a video game character as I did for my dog'. Every time he has answered the same way. He believes he has built relationships with these characters. He will say things like ""oh, I haven't hung out with [video game character name] recently..."" or ""today, I have to go play with [video game character]"". 

I don't want to downplay his gaming experience but to me he is blurring the lines between real life and video games. I understand video games, tv shows, books, and movies are meant to evoke emotional responses. It feels like he's going beyond the emotions expected when he plays. I also feel like he's downplaying the grief of losing my best friend.

 My dog helped me throughout the years with anxiety and depression after a sibling passed. He was my rock when I couldn't sleep. At some point I started to rely on him to tell me everything was fine. He was a very quiet dog and only ever barked or perked up when people were around. He cuddled with me and stayed by my side no matter what I was doing. So, to hear someone compare his death to piece of code is very hard.

Tldr;  Back in 2021 my boyfriend compared a video game characters death to my dog's death. Over the past 4 years I've asked him about it at different times and he still stands by his comparison. To me, it's blurring the lines between video games and real life. I have a definitive line between video games and reality. I don't like it when he does this. 

I was stuck between tagging this as Venting vs Opinions/Thoughts."
3,"Lately, I’ve been feeling completely unappreciated and invisible. Life is just… hectic. Work is full on, family life is non-stop, parenting feels relentless, and even being a partner has become another exhausting responsibility. I do so much—for everyone. I’ve taken on far more than I should, and it’s weighing me down.

I throw myself into his interests, always making the effort. But does he do the same for mine? Not really. He doesn’t want to go to the things I want to do. And sure, okay—maybe it’s not his thing. Fine. I’ll still go on my own. But the thing is, I go to the stuff he wants to do, even when I don’t enjoy it, just to be there with him. Because it’s important to him, and being with him is important to me. That effort? That’s not mutual.

He’ll grit his teeth and go through the motions sometimes, but there’s no genuine care or enthusiasm it seems unless my mental health collapses. Only then, when I’ve hit the edge, does he step up—and even then, only briefly.

I’m always showing love. I say “I love you.” I give affection. I try to connect. But does he post about me? Show me off? Celebrate me? No. Never. It stings more than I like to admit. And when it comes to intimacy, the digs about me not initiating are so hurtful—because I always have to be the one to make the move or suggest it. If I raise it, somehow I’m the one to blame.

I just want to be appreciated. To be seen. For what I do manage, and even for the things I can’t, because I’m barely keeping my head above water. I spend nearly all my money on our home, on us, and it’s like dragging a boulder uphill just to get him to spend his own. It’s not supposed to be this hard.

I’m tired of showing up. I want a day—just one—where I get to sleep in. Where I get to be lazy. Where someone else makes every decision, does all the chores, handles the load. I want to rot in bed if that’s what I choose. I want to not smile, not fake my mood, not pretend everything’s fine. Because right now, it’s not. I’m not happy. I’m not sad. I’m just blank. Numb. Empty.

No one actually checks if I’m okay. They just assume I’m being cranky or hormonal. No one looks deeper. No one asks genuinely how I’m doing. As long as everyone’s getting what they need from me, who cares how i actually am?

I’m hurting. I’m tired. And honestly? I’m starting to feel more like a housemate than a partner. There’s a distance between us, and I feel like I’m carrying all the weight. I just want to feel like I matter—not for what I do, but for who I am."
4,"Title: She told me to only talk to her if I knew what I wanted… then lied, cheated, and gaslit me the entire time

A little over a month ago, I started talking to a girl who made it very clear early on: “Only talk to me if you know what you want.” So I did. I went all in — emotionally, mentally, and financially.

I took her on expensive dates, bought her thoughtful gifts, supported her through “mental health struggles,” and made her feel seen and cared for. I told her I was proud of her. I treated her the way every girl says she wants to be treated.

Meanwhile, behind the scenes, she was:
	•	Keeping her notifications silenced constantly — claiming it was for mental health, but really to hide texts/calls from her ex.
	•	Taking 15+ minute bathroom breaks during dates — which I later realized were to talk to him.
	•	Cancelling plans with me last minute and then hooking up with her ex that same day.
	•	Telling me we were exclusive, while literally staying over at her ex’s house and sleeping with him.

Even when I gave her an out — saying “If you’re still figuring things out, we can just be friends” — she kept lying to my face. She told me what I wanted to hear just to keep me emotionally hooked.

Then one night, her ex physically attacked me. He showed up, completely unprovoked, and laid his hands on me. That’s when I finally realized just how deep her lies went.
And when I tried to confront her? She said I didn’t care about her.

After everything I did — the love, the money, the patience, the emotional support — she flipped the narrative and acted like I was the problem.

And the most pathetic part?
Even at the very end, when it all came out, she couldn’t be honest. She said she needed time to “work on herself” and “would reach out when she was in a better place.”
It was just one final lie to leave the door cracked — one last string to keep me hanging.

I finally called her out. Told her everything I’d realized. Told her how manipulative, selfish, and narcissistic she really is.
And what did she do?

Blocked me.

She couldn’t face the truth.
Because people like that don’t want love — they want control, validation, and someone to bleed dry until they’re empty.

And honestly?
This has happened to me at least three times.
Each time, the person who cheated lied to my face, denied everything until they couldn’t, and when I finally confronted them with the truth — they were emotionless, just like this girl.
No remorse. No apology. Just a cold, “Yeah, you’re right.”
Like I was disposable. Like none of it mattered.

I feel stupid. I feel used. I feel heartbroken."
5,"I don’t rlly know where to start so imma just go with it. I don’t feel like myself right now. I’m a loser and everyone knows it. All my hobbies aren’t enjoyable right now, I leave group hangouts early and I don’t even know why. It’s like I just can’t be there anymore. Maybe I feel like people don’t need me there. Like it doesn’t make a difference if I’m not there. I’ve just been so mentally out of it my stomach physically aches. I’m graduating next week and have no free time because of homework and exams. I’ve struggled with ARFID my whole life and it’s been especially bad recently. On top of that my fucking dnd game got canceled this week like that’s all I really look forward too anymore. I’m not even excited to graduate I just wanna leave it behind. I like this girl who’s in my group and there’s probably a very slim chance anything comes of it so that’s just adding fuel to the fire. It’s not even like I can avoid her because she’s in my group I hang around. On top of everything I’m just a shitty person I’m mean to people I love and then feel bad after. I can’t shake this urge to just go alone to the water and be a peace. No im not suicidal btw. Idk I just feel like I can’t rlly talk to my friends about this stuff I feel like they wouldn’t get it because they are all pretty good mentally and I don’t want them to pity me. Idk sorry for rambling I just needed to write my feelings out there"

Just wish i can bring him back i wish i. Can hug him one more time "
7,"For those who sleep 8 hours straight, what can I do to avoid waking up in the middle of the night? This is getting in the way and making me feel disconnected."
8,"I feel like that’s a thing everyone’s said at some point in their life, but I genuinely believe I do not deserve love from another person. I’ve always been extremely insecure about myself and hated myself for a long time. This was due to many reasons. I’ve always hated my body. Maybe the largest reason why I don’t deserve love is because I’m not good enough. My body isn’t good enough. I’m a skinny dude, so I’m by no means attractive with my shirt off. And in regards to my penis I fall around the average length, but I hear all my friends talk about their girlfriends can “barely fit it in their mouths” (sorry probably tmi) and I feel inadequate. I hear average is fine all the time but I want to be impressive, I want to be able to be desired, not tolerated. I feel ashamed of my own body. I don’t deserve to love someone because my body won’t be enough for them. I can’t do that to someone, I’m limiting their happiness for my satisfaction. That’s wrong.
Another reason why I think this is because I have a self destructive tendency to destroy everything good I touch. Relationships, hobbies, what have you. I always end up ruining it. I usually don’t want to date anyone because I know I’ll just ruin it. Or they’ll see how horrible I am and they’ll leave me for someone better. I am so horrible and so miserable all the time no one deserves a partner like that.

But that’s all I want. I want someone there for me, and I want to be there for them. I want to go on dates all the time and tell them funny stories and share intimate moments. But I don’t deserve it. I am a desolate, despicable person who only deserves hate and pain. I hate myself. God I sound like a child but it’s true. I am not enough."

11,"Hi. I've been wondering how to improve my lifelong memory issues? I usually remember times and dates but forget to send friends messages; I know to shower every day but can't remember to wash my face; I do dead hangs but can't remember to walk daily. Someone will say something and I will try to remember it, but the moment they're done I can't recall.

I've got no depression, no anxiety, I don't know what stress feels like and are very happy. I am tired all the time, but that's from an underlying condition that I'm getting tested for. I don't do substances, I get 8-10 hours of sleep daily, I have a varied diet and do take supplements.

What can I do to better my memory? I am hardly an adult and it would be good to improve before I get a job."

13,"So, I’m a highschool student and I’m taking psychology this year. I got assigned a presentation about psyhotic disorders, and am interested to learn more about them.
Now, I have read the passages in my textbook and have searched the internet, but I’m really interested in personal experiences, which is why I’m posting here. 
My textbook makes the disorders seem really scary and dehumanising, which i don’t believe to be true at all.
I would like to hear your experiences- symptoms, diagnoses, tratment, anything human really. I really don’t like the idea of giving a presentation on something and just creating a further stigma around it.
Also, sorry if my English is not great, it’s not my first language.

14,"Hi, I'm 22 (f) never been in a romantic relationship (which makes me sad), but I have few close friends. No one has ever romantically interested in me, and I have zero situationships. So I feel like the phrase “it’s bc you didn’t  settle for less than” doesn’t even apply to my life :/ I have lost all hope in ever being in a fulfilling committed relationship with someone who truly loves me. I have tried dating apps (which just lowered my self esteem).I am pretty friendly outgoing person, but literally no one has ever been interested in me romantically. I do want to be in a romantic relationship one day, (side note: I am old soul so I typically seek deep connections). I am working on being happier. I guess I’m just looking for support to have some faith in the finding romantic love. I just don’t know why it hasn’t happened yet :/ Any advice, or kind words would be very appreciated. "
15,"I’m a 20 year old female college student and my best friend said we can’t be friends anymore because i’m too anxious of a person for her to be around. I don’t even know what to think anymore. I said that I could act less anxious around her but she said that it doesn’t matter because she’ll always know that inside i’m anxious and that makes her a more anxious person apparently. I’m distraught because my entire friend group is blown up now and i’m basically alone again. I’ve read tons of books or short stories of people with mental health issues and they always have either a best friend(s) or significant other to support them, but my friend just left me and now the rest of the friend group doesn’t want anything to do with me. What the fuck do I even do anymore."
16,"There's been several people saying to just get more confidence, stop being shy, stop caring about what people think of you etc... to keep one from having anxiety. I've rarely heard any actual advice as in confronting people, expressing your emotions, etc... from adults, so I took what they said literally and I feel nothing anymore. Every time I feel empathetic toward someone when I've been wronged, I just say what I think and ignore their emotions; people disrespect me a lot less, but I don't feel like I'm genuinely a good person anymore.

For example: I straight up told someone to stop talking about me behind my back earlier, ignoring them to not give them more ""control"" over you would make more sense but I don't care, if I have to remove every ""friend"" to not go insane then so be it."
17,"Hi Reddit,

I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this, so if there’s a better place to post, please let me know. I’ve tried to keep this as short as possible, but it’s still kind of a rant — thanks in advance for reading.

Background:  
I’m from an Asian country and was homeschooled by choice, so I could pursue a variety of interests. Growing up, I was seen as the “black horse” — full of potential, with high expectations placed on me by family and others. I eventually got into a prestigious university.

But ever since I started college, my life feels like it’s been spiraling.

There was a misunderstanding early on that led to rumors. Long story short, my reputation took a hit and hasn’t really recovered since freshman year. I went from being outgoing and charismatic to feeling like a social outcast. Around the same time, I experienced housing instability — I was homeless for a week and moving around for half a year. I’m not sure how much that affected me psychologically, but it’s worth mentioning.

Since then:  
I’ve thrown myself into socializing — especially during exchange semesters or summers back home. Lots of nightlife, partying, clubbing. I know these aren’t the best environments, but I genuinely don’t know how to find or keep healthier friendships. Even when I meet good people, I struggle to maintain the connection.

My parents have voiced concerns, especially about the crowd I’ve been hanging out with. And this summer in particular… it’s been bad.

I missed a flight.

I rented a car with a friend to save money, only to find out we couldn’t return it in our city. I ended up having to drive it back and then take the train anyway — my parents were understandably frustrated.

Then I got into a car accident. Totally my fault. No one was hurt, but it shook me up because it revealed a level of irresponsibility that even I can’t justify.

I kept trying to explain all this away with “there must be a psychological reason for why this keeps happening,” but at some point, I have to face the fact that maybe something is going on.

Current state:  
I’ve been feeling detached, emotionally flat, and kind of on autopilot. I avoid confrontation and only reflect on things superficially. Sometimes I wonder if this could be derealization, or maybe something else — but I have no real knowledge to self-diagnose.

Another factor might be my obsession with seeking romantic attention. I’ve been single for my whole life, and I think a big part of my extroversion is driven by a desire for affirmation and emotional trust. I’ve been spending a lot of time in shallow situationships, hoping for something deeper — maybe to fill some internal gap.

Why I’m writing:  
I’m scared. I don’t want my spiraling to hurt others or put my family at risk, financially or emotionally. I don’t know what I’m going through, and I don’t know how to get back on track.

If anyone here has experienced something similar, or if you have any insight — psychological, emotional, or practical — I’d really appreciate it.

Thanks for taking the time to read this."
18,"Hi everyone,
I'm part of a small team working on a mental health and wellness platform aimed at supporting emotional and physical healing. We're designing it to be a safe space where people can connect with licensed counselors, use self-help tools, and receive daily guidance to deal with life’s emotional challenges.

We’re building this out of personal experiences with mental health struggles, and we want to make sure it’s something genuinely helpful. If anyone is open to sharing what kind of tools, features, or support you think would really make a difference, we’d love your thoughts."
19,"Are anti-depressants effective or it just makes it worse? Been prescribed with options of Sertraline, Zosert, and Zotral. Now imma play Russian Roulette on which pill works or worsens"
20,I can’t even muster the worlds for some of the things.
21,"IM SO DONE. i only find attractive men in their 40s - 50s. i cant even imagine to LIKE boys my age. with that type of men i mean intelligent and acculturated men, not any randoms. literally any mid men is my type after i find out he’s smart. for example, i like my geography teacher and he acts as a woman but he’s straight. he’s 2 meters tall, has long brown hair that’s always in a slick back low bun, a brown beard but like a taken care of beard and he acts “gay”. he traveled ALL the fufking world except congo, afghanistan and some other country and is rich af since he worked as a sales manager in italian fashion brands like armani, prada, etc.. he’s so haughty and side eyes anyone but i like him sooo muchh like i do anything to see him. im a lil shy but i’d love to convo w him since we have the same political ideas but i dont know how to start. i also have high grades in his subject to make him proud of him and i always stay silent in class (i do this with every subject but especially his) and btw other than geography he does italian so 😀 (i’m in italy) 

another man that i likee so much is a coach that coaches the u13 in my volleyball club. he’s like 180 meters tall and he has whiteish greyish hair with some salt and pepper beard and bluee eyes.. he’s funny and handsome and a good coach too. i hope next year ill have him coach my team 🙏🏻 i dont know his political ideas much but he has some strong views on like our city’s future and projects. yall help out is this some kind of trauma or idk cause i feel like im obsessed and in love but not jealous like a sociopath 🙂"
22,"I have had severe anxiety for the past 10 years or so of my life (late 30s) and tried several SSRIs with very bad side effects. Benzos do help the anxiety but I talked to a psychiatrist today about some alarming patterns Ive been noticing for the past few years happening whether or not I was on meds or not:

-My mind cannot turnoff, the only time my brain is at rest is when Im busy doing something

-I seem to plan crazy projects or get myself unnecessarily busy just in order to calm my brain down

-I don’t even look forward to a day off unless I have a crazy project planned (could be cooking, hobby etc)

-I get obsessed with something to calm my brain down, go at it for 3-4 weeks and it just overstimulates my brain and then I abandon it all together (often leads to drinking, even though I don’t enjoy it anymore)
This has occurred time and time again in the last few years even on ssris or benzos. 

I start a new hobby or lifestyle go 100% into it but will only last a few weeks to a month

Ill only want to order one specific meal for dinner then order it everyday for 2-3 weeks meanwhile spending hundreds of dollars

I cannot break this cycle and its driving me insane!

My Psychiatrist thinks this may be ADHD and were planning to try meds. But I also worry this is just the General Anxiety disorder. I never thought I had ADD in highschool or anything. But I did find it extremely hard to sit still in class. Found it so boring. But now I cant watch TV or a movie. I Need to be doing something. 

Does anyone else think this is ADHD or just general anxiety?"
23,"Ok, this is going to be somwhat LONG. If you don't have time, I will add a TLDR at the end, but if you do take that 5-7 minutes to read, I will forever be in debt to you. Thank you❤️.

I'm 15, going on 16 and think I may have a form of depression. Here I'm going to say what's been going on in my life to make me feel this way, and if I should get it checked out or not. So I was feeling off in freshman year, sad and confused. It carried over to this year when my hockey season started, the whole time it was going on for the 3 months I was in pure mental anguish the whole time. Full self doubt and comparing myself to others the whole time, even thought I wasn't that bad and I knew it. I just couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't enough. My IMMENSE anxiety didn't end either, only got worse. I felt burnt out, drained, and even felt like just giving up and running away until the season ended. Once it ended, I felt so free and happy that I thought things were finaly starting to look up. I've got a whole friend group whom I care about deeply, and a family who loves me. But it made me want to quit hockey because of how it made me feel, and I don't know if im just being a wuss, but I tell myself ""The sport you love shouldn't be making you feel like this"". I was in constant fear of telling my parents because of how they'd react, think in soft, or never hearing the words ""I'm proud of you"" ever again. But off of that, the sadness has slowly, slowly crept back and I find myself having 1 day a week on average where I'm just down in the pits of despair. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy and healthy(I think) but I can't help but feel like something is wrong when I'm experiencing constant Anxiety, Overthinking to EXTREME levels, and self hate/doubt. Now I'm going to go through these, with a little highlighted section for a question I have. (Again I'm so sorry for how long this is I know🙁)

Anxiety: I have INSANE anxiety, I think of scenarios that can't possibly happen, the worst case everytime. I set myself up for disappointment so it doesn't hit hard, as I'm used to it now. I can't see good in anything when my anxiety kicks in. Simple tasks make me start tweaking out, thinking I'm doing something wrong. SOCIAL Anxiety is also a problem, I can't look people on the eyes unless I'm close with them when I talk. I hate seeing people from my school in public because I think just the sight of me is pitifull. 

Overthinking: I overthink SO much it's unbearable. Off of the ""always thinking the worst case scenario"", I mentally collapse in stressful situations and can't hold up a simple task in the fear of just getting it screwed up. I also think of things that don't matter, embarrassing things that happend 2 or 3 years ago that made me look like an idiot, and I find myself making up scenarios in my head like ""what if it had gone better/worse"". Those awful thoughts, that even the people who witnessed them don't remember, don' ever leave and always remind me of how awfull i am. The final thing, is small situations making me immensely sad.
🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨
QUESTION: Why do I get so sad over things that are supposed to make me happy? For example, seeing a happy message ment to make me feel batter, makes me overthink and get sad. Seeing a cute animal just makes me suddenly sad for no reason. The other day I saw a smiley face, A SIMPLE SMILEY FACE made me almost cry. WHY?

Self hate: I Hate myself so much it disgusts me. I will post the rest in replies."
24,"Sorry for the bad english, language is not my first language
Im 16, i never felt close to any one even after having multiple friends, the past years feel like a blur, i felt out of touch, and reality.
Im autisitic but its very difficult to tell, i had to Ask some years ago to be evaluated since nobody believed me. I dont have a poor self-esteem or something like that but i cant help but feel im an annoyance to everyone, some people confirm i am. I dont expect anything anymore, i try to self evaluate, study social interaction and not commit errors, but doesnt really work. And even when it works out in some way i get tired of the person and interact less eventually.
I keep having nightmares, and im waiting so i can get my own house and get some type of help about that, i want to change my name, and disconnect from my old life, i dont like where i live, i keep missing school because i feel drained at home, and im pretty sure the mold in the walls is making me sick (it cant be taken out)
I keep wanting to cut out food and then i feel too bad to go to school too
I dont think i feel depressive but i dont feel good either and never felt, i feel somehow alien, and i dont feel connected to anyone, im not afraid of relationships, i dont avoid people, im pretty sociable and often called smart and a ""Waste of talent"" by older people. I often engage in clubs, talk to people, go to parks, but nothing really helps.
I just feel empty, and like i cant get close to anyone in any way. 
I dont think that will change, and i dont mind it much since im more focused on my hobbies and goals, but it feels weird, especially when i hear how other people live, i dont feel that much attached to my life either, i just feel like im here to pass highschool and go to college hopefully to a science related Field if i could pass. 
I hope this doesnt sound too edgy, i wanted to know an external opinion about this"
25,"So, I recently been living free of workless-time. I basically, work whenever I am awake and whenever I am not working, I feel anxious to work. I wake up 8:30 every day, with some days 6:30 after going to sleep 2AM. But I noticed I've taken a hit in my productivity. I can't fucking look at a computer's screen and give in to the smallest of distractions, I am stressed 24/7 and my physical health has been declining. The only non-work activity I do is sex, which is only twice a week since I am not married nor dating. 

I have a psychiatrist because I do have OCD, he's been successful in treating it, I noticed it decreased significatively since the beginning of the treatment. I recently talked to him about my life's balance and he said I might be experiencing a burnout, he asked I wanted to have medicine prescribed but I refused on health concerns.

Is there a way to cure this burnout and keep working? I have a company and there's a project I've sunken a bunch of time and effort into, competitors, although also in early stage, are starting to appear and I need to be at my max productivity currently. I usually don't drink coffee or energy drinks (the latter being on health concerns) but I took a couple of Red Bulls some months ago and it felt amazing, I was so energized for so long (although the focus was still a problem). Problem is, I don't want to drink energy drinks because of the health side effects, I can't drink coffee because the hotel I am living in had no coffee machine and in Brazil there aren't many healthy energy-consumable options like Celsius or KetoneIQ.

There were some large holidays in Brazil some weeks ago and I took a large pause from life. I felt so relaxed, but currently I can't do that and need to be at my max.

What should I do?"
26,"We are literally in a mini-recession. There have been many layoffs, and students and workers are both anxious about the future. Sometimes, I wish people would accept that anxiety and worry aren't always the person's fault; maybe it's just that we are in such turbulent times right now. I am in graduate school at an HCOL, and I worry a lot about being able to find a job and afford to live a decent life. I mean, we would all be happy if we all made six figures and only worked 40 hours a week maximum. But it's getting hard even to achieve that these days. I don't think it's just social media that is creating such angst and anxiety these days. "
27,"
I'm gonna try to keep this as short as I can. My sister is 10 years older than me in her late 30s. She struggled with addiction (meth) in her teens. She overcame that and has had 3 kids and a pretty healthy life ever since (aside from drinking and violent outburst sometimes) but for the most part she was a good person worked lived a normal life with her partner. This has all changed since she left her partner and met a new one and also out mom passed in the same year. The guy has been in prisoner most of his life and an addict. She knew this. She fell into a violent co dependency and he got her back on drugs. This time meth and fentayl.
She has lost everything she is now homeless living in shelters and motel with my nieces. He is back in prison for 5 years. (They are still together and married/in contact) most of our family has cut her off due to she treats people Terribly and her overall lifestyle. We come from an upbringing of drugs and alcohol and being homeless for period of time so it's extremely triggering for me. CPS has got involved but won't take the kids. The dad is involved and would take the kids full time buy my sister won't let him because she gets lonely and needs the kids to be in programs/get funding and housing. It makes me sick. I want to be there for her because I know she's very miserable but how do I be there for someone who doesn't want to change/ plays victim constantly and it's traumatizing my nieces? I feel so much guilt and just trying to understand and know what I can do...


TLDR my sister is a manipulative addict that is traumatizing her kids and doesn't seem to want to change her situation how do I be there for her and also the kids without compromising my metal health ?"
28,"I'm lost. When I'm in my room all alone, my thoughts get to me. I realize everything I don't want to. I realize that the girl I like will never go for me but I can't get her out of my head. I realize that I'm not body's go to friend and the friend I have now feel distant. A lot of the time I feel like a disappointment. I know I am. But when I am alone I feel like I'm just a shell trying to be filled by love or companionship. I don't know what to do anymore."
29,"I can’t do it anymore. I want my brain to stop overthinking and for once just for once focus on what’s important. I have been struggling to get a job for so many years. I don’t have anyone to guide me. I have a 3 year career gap and nothing to show for it, which is ruining every aspect of my life. I have to study for an exam and it’s has gotten to a point where I feel no matter what I do now, I will fail and this thought isn’t letting me focus for long. 

My health is not good. I have basically stopped all my pcos medicines and it has made my periods irregular (And a few others too because I just couldn’t take anymore medicines because I am fed up of them). I have been having 7-10 days long periods for a few months now. My periods ended on May 6 after going on for 11 days and it has started again today. I am an emotional mess rn, nobody to share these feelings with, nobody to motivate. But today I finally started my medication again. I hope I take them regularly. 

I am not able to lose weight because I just don’t have the stamina to exercise. I have started walking but it doesn’t seem to do anything. I have so much body pain idk why. It gets difficult to wake up with it everyday because I just can’t move in the morning. 

I have been crying a lot since 4-5 days for some reason or the other. It’s getting difficult to face people because everybody just keeps on asking what I am doing these days or saying things like you have gained a lot of weight without showing even an ounce of empathy. But they call without thinking twice about anything when they need my help. I resent each and every person other than my immediate family because I thought the people who are close to you are supposed to help you in whatever way they can but the people in my life seem to have forgotten my existence except for days where my presence is necessary for them. 

Why can’t anybody see that I am struggling? That I am not being myself anymore? I was such a happy kid, didn’t give a fuck about people or anything in general, I did what I wanted to without stressing about the consequences but now? Now I just rot in my room, sleep a lot, watch useless content to numb my brain to make it stop overthinking and stressing so I don’t do anything irrational, go to doctors or other appointments for the 10 different problems that I have to deal with and I am not able to continue even that because I don’t see results and I feel like I’m just wasting my parents’ money. I am tired of people commenting on my body hair. I was a literal kid when it started. Now I don’t want to do anything about it because fuck society, I will do it when I feel comfortable doing it. Why should I get it removed because someday a man won’t marry me because I have body hair? I’m happy with my body hair, just please leave me and my body hair alone. Even the supposedly educated doctors can’t shut up about it, they just have to comment on it everytime they see it.

I don’t even have the guts to end my misery because what will happen to my family? My family has seen enough and I can’t put them through this horrible pain. So I am trying my best just for them and I will continue trying until I can’t anymore. 
"
30,"I just can't find it in me to care about things in general. I don't feel motivated in the slightest to do anything unless I *have* to do it, and even then, a part of me keeps asking myself why I'm doing it--if there's any point to begin with, which usually, I feel like there is none. I still feel emotions, and I still have some semblance of basic reason intact, yet everything still feels so pointless to me. I lack motivation as well as the desire to do much of anything.

The only exception to this is certain pieces of media. Certain cathartic moments, mostly from books, videos, or games. I don't know why, but something about it is just so magical to me. Something about it makes me feel alive. There have been times where I've been so productive it's hard for me to think that was actually me. It turns out that was just the effects of some media that had a great, lasting impact on me. It's rare for me to find media that works wonders for me like that. I replay it over and over to experience it again, and again, and again. Eventually, it wears off. I worry about what'll happen to my mental state once the few pieces of media I can turn to lose their magic.

What's wrong with me? I know this is not normal. I honestly don't know why I am this way, but I'm pretty certain I've always been like this."

32,"I've been struggling a lot with metal health and not letting them win but I only told one person at my school and it ended not in the way I hoped and since then they've only gotten worse and I want to tell my mother about it but when I went to go tell her a hour ago I just couldn't, so now I'm in a state where I need to tell someone I talk to alot about it but i don't have the strength to do it and I need advice "
33,For example when im walking around my house i feel the need to touch all 4 corners of door frames or all for corners of a tv just weird stuff like that and its stuff like counting the numbers of walls in my room even though i know the number or counting the number of facial features even though i know its going to be 9 i dont know i feel like im going insane I was thinking it could be ocd but i dont know please tell me if you any ideas. Thank you
34,"Going thru med changes and I just want to feel like me again 😪.  I struggle with extreme social anxiety and depression, currently heightened by my stressors. I'm hoping that the new change of meds and my weekly therapy helps ease some of the overwhelming emotions. It's hard to explain to others the feelings of anxiety unless you live it. There's not a turn off button. I'm managing day to day, but at times it's too much and I just want tonrun home and hide. "
35,"For context I’m a 20 yr old (f) and who’s starting her 3rd year of university. However I’m stuck in a major that I hate bc my parents want me to become a doctor and I don’t want to become one. At first since I didn’t have a passion of my own I thought that it would be fine but as the years went on it’s becoming unbearable my grades have even slipped up (they don’t know). I don’t know how to tell them how miserable I am especially since I’m about to begin my 3rd year as a Bio major and I have strict Indian parents that don’t believe in mental health issues. However if I continue down this path I genuinely don’t think that I will survive. I want to take a semester off school but am so scared to tell them, what should I do? "
36,"For some background I've gone through bouts of anxiety/depression since freshman year of hs but have had no formal diagnosis and therapy hasn't always worked. Since I was a kid I have been a pretty sensitive person and high stress or anger makes me cry easily. Because of this I am a pretty closed door emotionally and bottle a lot up.

Every time I hit a wall like this I climb over it by succeeding, forgetting, or crying it out, but now that I'm slowly adulting, I feel like I can't. Fall semester I started my ""dream"" degree and it destroyed me, luckily I got out and in trade school before collapsing. My serving job started out perfect, making money, loving the opportunity, and overall enjoying my coworkers. Now said coworkers are leaving, slow season leaves me financially worried, and the dread always follows me home. Not to mention the standard package, like less of a social life, aging family, car repairs, and generally taking care of you.

Unfortunately, my anxiety and stress has gone into overload and I'm struggling to take care of cleaning/organization, hygiene, and eating in my ideal calorie range. Finals, needy and crappy managers and guests, and terrible financial skills have contributed. I always feel judgement, guilt, and overall burden making any decision as well which further deepens a limbo state.

Just today I got the devastating news my dog has a tumor with 6 months max to live. I already felt crushed, and now even more so to the point I don't want to move or eat at all. Just the thought of having a busy and ever-changing life while any day could be her last is killing me.

On the bright side, however, I am down almost 40 pounds, big vacay here soon, I'm studying for a career I'll enjoy, and I'm a coach and player for a sport I can't get enough of. I am also grateful and fortunate to have a loving (as much as you can get lol) immediate family who helps take care of most bills while studying.

Some days I just want to collapse, give up, and not engage with anything. The only things keeping me together are a stuffed animal and my dog, but as stated above one has a date on her.

I am going to see my therapist but I really needed to get it out there to someone who was kind enough to read. Any advice on anything in my life would help. If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to hear me ♥️

TLDR: Everything in my life, good and bad, is happening all at once and it's taking a toll on me in the worst ways possible including passive ideation"
37,I don't really know what's wrong with me. Might be ocd or autism or both. My symtoms haven't been ruining my life. I still feel like it would be nice to know and have an explaination for what's wrong with me.
38,"I don't mean to come across as an emo teenager here to tell you about how much I hate myself, but I really have no one to talk to and can't find a way to explain my behavior. As a disclaimer, I am currently not diagnosed with anything, so I have no idea what could be causing this. 
This all started coming up when I started a group project with this girl at school, but our personalities weren't clashing well. She was (and is actively) critiquing everything I did, while simultaneously forcing all of the work onto me. The way she says it is quite condescending, but it may just be the way i interpret it since I can't STAND criticism. 
The problem is that the first time we got into a full argument, I felt so guilty I sent her SEVEN full paragraphs of apology texts and harmed myself (I had never done so previously, I was just in a terrible mood). I was fully convinced it was my fault. When I told my teacher about it when she wasn't there one day, she talked me through it and said that she was pretty clearly using me to her advantage (my teacher is awesome shoutout to Ms. L!!). 
But that completely turned around my thought process to only interpret things as fully HER fault, no matter how wrong I do something. I've been in a constant switch of absolutely hating myself and feeling immense guilt to glorifying myself and completely shitting on this other person. 
I have no idea what's wrong with me, though I am aware that I'm partially at fault (at the moment, I'm in a self-hatred fit rn). Many of my friends have said I have narcissistic tendencies, and though that is almost true, narcissists don't feel such intense emotions of guilt as far as I know. If anyone can help that's great, but I don't expect anyone to read all of this lol. "
39,"**Life is beautiful.** And among all its wonders, learning is the most beautiful of all. It's like the cold, moist wind gently grazing your face — a quiet joy, like a small, contented smile forming without effort. It stirs a pleasant feeling, the calm assurance of growth, maturing, and becoming more.

**Yes, we stumble sometimes.** But those moments — the stones we trip on — are just brief deviations. They don’t steal our happiness. They remind us. They awaken us to the challenges on our path and teach us to stay aware. They prepare the mind, sharpen our focus, and help us grow stronger.

**They don’t take the moment away — they prepare us for the real world.**"
40,"Intrusive thoughts?

I know that people throw that around a lot so I’ve never really used the term to describe this. I do struggle with impulsive thoughts and behaviors. Sometimes hurting myself over other people, but not in a serious way. Pinching, slapping, poking, aggression. I do everything a on a whim quitting jobs, buying shit I shouldn’t, running away from home as a kid or straight disappearing as an adult, shaving most of my head, saying things I shouldn’t, substance abuse. These are what I would describe as impulsive. 

It’s the truly awful things that I’m concerned about. Things I wouldn’t admit to save my life. They’re generally fleeting, but often recurring. Some of the less awful ones would be things in my mouth. Gross things. I see something gross and just immediately I imagine it in my mouth so vividly I puke. Rotten food, vomit, any bodily fluids, fingernails, hair, sand or dirt, bugs. Anything and EVERYTHING gross I see. Serious thoughts of hurting myself or other people. 

For example I remember when my brother was a baby he was sat up in the kitchen next to a knife and all I could think of was just stabbing him right through his throat. I love my brother, especially at that age. He was an adorable little baby. 

What’s really disturbing me now is my dog passed away. We buried her at my mom’s. When they came to get her to take her out there it was quite a trip. I loved my dog. She was so much more than a dog to me. My best friend for 12 years. With me through so much trauma. All I could think about was her body in a hot car. The bloating, the detail of these thoughts. Then after she was buried, the bugs and underground things just eating away at her. This one is more than fleeting. It’s been constant. These are just some of the examples. 

Like I said there’s far worse thing that cross my mind, like truly awful that I literally will never allow to leave my head. Things that have tore me down and made me believe I probably shouldn’t be alive. Things that as a kid caused such anxiety that I had this insane irrational fear that someone would be able to read my mind or life isn’t real and it’s actually a test and that whatever was testing me could read my mind and knew what a disgusting person I was. Could this be trauma? I’ve had an unbelievable amount of trauma in my life but as far as I know this predates it. It just got worse after. How can I fix/cope with this? "
41," Hey guys/girls/other, I was just wondering if its normal for me to suddenly the next day like over night have a sudden surge of energy and confidence like i could conqure the bl-ody f_cking world.

The day before i spranged my ankle falling 6 feet into mud off my bike in the woods when talking with some friends, i was a id-t lol."
42,"i am a 16 M years old teenager. ( warning about the grammar and typos ) me and my girlfriend (almost a year together) are currently on a break… or maybe we’ve already broken up. i’ve hurt her over and over again with my jealousy, insecurity, and immaturity — i kept promising her i’d change, but i didn’t follow through until it was too late.

she gave me so many chances, and i ruined every single one. now she’s taken off the promise ring we had, and she’s been more active with her friends, especially one that used to be my close friend. it hurts watching her live her life like i never existed. it makes me feel like i’m easy to replace, while i’m still here — crying over memories, writing poems i never thought i’d write, and trying to become a better man… for her and for myself.

what makes it worse is i don’t really have anyone to talk to. i feel so alone. my mom and sister just tell me to “move on” and stop caring, but it’s not that easy when she was my everything. it felt like its nothing for them while im here trying to hold on to live.. even just being her friend again would be enough for me right now. i miss her so much it both emotionally and physically hurts me..

she’s even in contact with the guy she used to be with again, and i don’t want to be controlling, but it’s breaking me. i don't have any problems about it.. but why right after when we stopped talking? i keep asking myself why i wasn’t enough — why i lost the only person who made me feel safe and loved. i feel so guilty and keep blaming myself.. because im the reason how i this all started. but i wouldn't really blame her for all of that.. but that triggered something in me where i sometimes include my sister and my mom unintentionally.. i cried in the floor alot while they don't do anything about it (i dont blame them..), i harmed myself and thought alot about overdosing..

that made me hate myself even more and made my suicidal thoughts alot worse.. i feel like a burden to everyone.

i just have no idea on how to stop thinking about her or distract myself.. i don't have that much friends to talk to.. i tried everythign like playing, drawing, do physical fitness, watching, reading and writing. but it never worked, i just keep falling in the same hole over and over begging for her to come back. cause i cant get my fear out and the thought of losing her.. i honestly have no idea what to do..

i’m not looking for pity. i just don’t want to feel invisible anymore. i’m trying to be better… but it’s hard when it feels like being better won’t bring her back.. it feels like i won't be able to live having the thoughts that theres a chance that she will find someone else better or just never comeback..

it just keeps repeating on my mind everyday why i didn't change sooner.. i regret everything. i lost everything cause of my immaturity. i can't stop crying.."
43,"Long story short, I needed to complete 30 additional credits beyond my masters degree to get into a higher salary track as a teacher. Between custody of kids, getting divorced, and rebuilding my life in between it’s taking me five years, but I just finished the other day. I started kindergarten in 1989 so I’ve been at the school thing for 36 years. And I didn’t even really like School growing up. 

So at the very end of a decades long academic career, I was hoping to have a sense of accomplishment. I’ve been working hard towards this to get the necessary raise I need for living a comfortable life and now I’ve achieved it. But now that it’s here, I don’t feel anything. I don’t feel good or bad just nothingness. This has been my mountain to climb for years at this point.  I put a lot of eggs in the basket that life would be greener on this side of the fence. 

It might only be that it’s been a few days since it happened and I haven’t really come to respect the new free time I will have. It might also be because I’m a guy and were taught to just put our heads down and move onto the next task. No one really celebrates us. Anyone have any suggestions how I can force myself to stop and smell the roses?"
44,"I am so lonely and miserable and overwhelming. I am a 19 year old guy who is struggling and the best way I can put it is I feel like I am drowning. I have always suffered with bad anxiety and self image issues for years now, but recently it has reached a breaking point. I am also Type 1 Diabetic and suffer with Aspergers (Autism) and ADHD.

I am not in the slightest way an unfortunate guy, I have a decent part time job plus I am a law student. But even with all this I feel so lonely. I have no one to talk to at my university and feel so isolated as my university experience so far, has not lived up to what I had hoped. I have really good friends outside of university and specific ones are aware of my current issues but even so I feel like a burden and am overbearing. 

I have never ever had any difficulties in obtaining a relationship, but in no way shape or form can I sustain one. I panic and overthink every little thing and often my behaviour such as constant text messages and trying to contact them on a few different social apps when they don't respond can end up pushing partners away. I just would love affection but I know whilst I am like this I can never have the affection I so desire. 

I feel like I have no purpose in my life and even though I know what I want in my life as I like to have everything planned out, I don't have my current life figured out. I feel like I have no reason to be sad, I have a decent job and decent friends and a supportive family but I just dont feel happy.

I have tried Cognitive Behavioural Therapy as well as Talking Therapies but nothing in the past 2 years has worked at all. I am currently looking into medications that I would like to see if my doctor can pescribe. I am usually very isolated and apart from when I go to uni or work, I spend all of my time at home doing nothing really.

The worst bit of all for me, is the fact that I am aware of how my behaviour makes other people feel, (in the sense of me being overwhelming). I would give anything to change that, but I just cant no matter how much I try and wish I can. I even feel like crying, and tear up sometimes yet no matter how much I want to, I just can't cry.

I have also for the record never ever contemplated taking my own life, however there have been many times when I wish I wasn't alive, or that my Diabetes would have an episode when I went to sleep or something along those lines.

I appreciate people taking the time to read my story and I ask that no one passes judgement on me or how I feel at the moment."
45,"Hello I don’t know if this is a problem caused by me or something else, for most people i talk nowadays it’s a few sentences and rarely a full conversation but these feel only fun and useful when they happen and I feel like I need to be as funny and nice to talk to as possible or my ”friends will leave me”, and even if they are a friend they never feel close. I have one friend I like to talk to but he has other friends he likes alot and when he get a millisecond of a chance he leaves me. I just want a close friend I can talk and vent to about my personal life since it compilcated and i want answers but I don’t feel safe telling anyone and there are a few people that ask if I am ok but I don’t know how to describe my feelings,i have had a few times where I became close to someone but when it happens I feel different and I can’t talk normally anymore and I feel cringe and corny, So In the end I make no close friends."

47,"My childhood (16 years old) dog has been sick, I’m now in debt from her bills, my family sucks, my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years broke up with me, I failed my classes for collage and had to pay out of pocket for my next round and hid it from my family, my job won’t promote me and held it above my head, I got into a car crash and totalled my car (which injured my dog and cost me more in bills but she’s stable), and left my church/ only friends right before my bf left me. He also told me to get a credit card and now I have one and don’t know how to use it. It feels like I have nothing and no one and I can’t afford therapy, found out my ex (before my newest ex) is happily married with a kid even though he cheated on me and treated me like garbage. I get yelled at constantly and have to pretend to be happy. Every step I take forward I just get pushed back. How do you guys do it?? I honestly don’t know what to do or how to take this day by day. I just try so hard to be a good person and help others and I feel like nothing I do matters. Every-time I sleep I wake up at night  every few hours worrying my dog will stop breathing in her sleep (now she’s a bit better) and now I’m just having so many nightmares about my ex bf leaving me. Life sucks rn."
48,"This has been on my mind for a while, and I wanted to see if anyone else can relate.

I have a therapy session every Friday at 8am. My therapist is great I feel seen and supported but after the session ends, it often feels like I can’t breathe again until the next one. I hold in so many thoughts and emotions during the week, and by the time Friday comes, everything floods out. Then the cycle resets.

The time in between is hard. I struggle with overthinking, rumination, and not knowing where to put everything I’m carrying. I’ve tried different things, but it’s difficult to process everything on my own between sessions especially when I don’t feel like I can open up to people around me.

So I’m wondering:

* **Has anyone else experienced this?**
* **How do you get through the days between your therapy sessions?**
* **What’s helped you emotionally regulate or express yourself in between?**
* **If you’ve brought this up with your therapist did they recommend anything that helped?**
* **Do you think therapists should offer tools or support that help with those six “in between” days? What would that even look like?**

I’d really love to hear from people who’ve found ways to manage the empty space between sessions. Even if it’s messy, I’m open to hearing what’s worked for you.

Thanks!"
49,I hate having anxiety. It’s so annoying. My heart rate spikes so high and I try to calm myself down and it does help some but then my anxiety comes back again. I don’t know what else to do but I hope it does go away for good eventually.
50,"My imagination is so vivid and powerful that it scares me. It bothers me a lot because the way my mind slips into different modes and makes me lose focus really frustrates me. For example, when I’m dancing in my room with my heels and music playing, I can imagine a whole stage. I see the crowd, the audience, the props, my outfit, how I’m going to use my hands, my facial expressions, my dancing partners, and everything else. Whenever I dance, I feel like I’m in a completely different reality. The same thing happens when I’m singing. I imagine myself in a beautiful white dress, doing a soft and emotional performance with a grand piano.

I also have sensory issues. Sometimes I imagine patterns or weird textures on my body, and it drives me crazy. It makes me itchy, and I feel fear and pain. I hate holes, so when I imagine them, my skin starts crawling. My imagination is so strong that when I talk to myself, I imagine full conversations with other people. I can see what they are wearing, how they talk, their facial expressions, what we are talking about, how I feel, and the mood of the whole conversation.

When I was younger, I used to see strange things. A belt would look like a snake, or a backpack would look like a dog. It used to upset me. I also like to write books, and I create characters with so much detail that I can feel their emotions. I hear their voices, I understand their thoughts, and I feel empathy for them even though they are not real. I imagine how they would talk and how they would act like real people.

Sometimes I imagine animal fur on my body. It bothers me so much that I start to itch, get scared, and even cry because it triggers me. One time, my friend said something interesting, and my brain started playing a full movie in my head. I saw colors, people, and scenes from a third-person point of view, and I completely lost focus.

Even though my friends say I’m creative, I think it’s because my imagination feels like reality. That is how I come up with ideas when I’m dancing. If I need to make up a dance move, I imagine Beyoncé or Michael Jackson dancing, and then I get the courage to try it myself, even if the move doesn’t exist yet.

When I try to make music, it is hard to use a beat because I already have a full song in my head. It has a chorus, a bridge, and everything, but it is really hard to turn it into a real song.

I really want help. This is bothering me a lot"
51,"(Sorry for the typos and my weird way of writing) For the context im 20 M and for the majority of my life I bottled my feelings without really thinking about it, for exemple whenever I felt like shit I would just put these feelings aside and tell to myself that worse happens to a lot of people every day and that I was illegitimate about feeling this way or that it is what it is for now and that it would be better in the future.
 But recently im feeling overwhelmed and stressed by a lot of small things like an important exam that I think I failed, a friendzone where im feeling like a dick for still having feelings but at the same time feeling worthless because I never got into a relationship, only seeing my family 2 week-ends out of these 2 months, an important school project where im late that could fail leaving me with nothing for the oral exam, feeling like a failure at being a son and a brother, etc... . All these things are making me overthink everything about my life and im really starting to feel like im a mistake.
It got to a point that I developped anger issues, that I get less than 4h of sleep every day because I cant help but think about all these things at night and that I need to do something like listening to music / watching videos non stop to put an end to the thoughts. I cant bottle these things anymore but I dont want them to affect other people in any way and im feeling like talking about them would either worry or make me look like a baby needing attention.
Sorry if my story feels cringe, weird or not that important but if anyone has any advice of some sort im open to them.
Thanks for reading. "
52,"So i’m 15 year old (16 in December.) male, and i have mood swings so often that i started thinking about death, ive been doing self harm since i was 14 too. Normally my mood changes were pretty normal like a person who is going through puberty could have like being sad for a few days or being happy for a few days in a cycle ect. but recently ive been having these mood changes every hour i am sometimes happy, sad (to a point where i dont even talk or/ and eat for 2 days or if i can keep starving, more) and nauseous, i also feel confused because there is nothing that happened that could make me feel sad recently, however i did go trough some traumatic experiences in my childhood that i’m not sure if i can share here. I still have nightmares about them, i also thought about being bipolar as my family (not my mom and dad) did have bipolar and they did have the tradition to marry with their cousins ect. 


Over all it would be really good to get some advices on how to stop self harm, or/ and how to deal with past trauma. And i want to know who i need to ask (like a therapist, a doctor) about bipolar or if it is possible for me to have it

Ps: Excuse me if i made mistakes while spelling or grammar mistakes as i’m not fluent in English."
53,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I feel stuck, helpless, and scared for my older brother, who is 24. I don’t know where else to turn, and I’m hoping someone here might understand or offer guidance.

My brother hasn’t worked in years. A while ago, he suffered a leg injury that left him unable to work for a long time. He also has severe scoliosis and chronic back pain, but he never asked our parents for help probably because he didn’t want to be a burden. He’s never received proper treatment, mostly due to money reasons, and now his pain is worse than ever.

He’s been out of work for about three or four years (he’s actually never had a job). He spends nearly all his time in his room, barely speaks to anyone, and constantly uses his back pain as the main reason he can’t work. I do believe his pain is real, but I also think that if he got medical support, there might be jobs he could do that don’t involve physical strain and can have his autonomy. But it’s like he’s convinced he can’t do anything, and he can't find solutions.


Our family situation makes things worse. My father is emotionally abusive. Sometimes, he insults my brother, my mom or me when i don't talk to him. He’s overwhelmed by work and other family problems, but instead of dealing with them, he takes it out on us.

My older brother also struggles with anger. He has a really hard time controlling it. When my dad provokes him (like saying he doesn't do nothing), things escalate fast. The last time they argued, it turned violent. I had to call the police. In the fight, also my other brother was injured. 

After that night, my older brother left the house and didn’t come back in the night. The day after I rode around the city on my bike and found him alone in a parking lot. I didn’t approach him, but I called my mom because she was panicking. He eventually came back home, but since then, he’s completely shut down.

He hasn’t eaten in over two days. He doesn’t talk to anyone. When my mom tries to speak to him or ask him to eat, he tells her to leave. The food we leave for him just sits there. He only leaves his room to use the bathroom. That’s it. He doesn't have money for buying food for himself. 

I want to help him, but he won’t accept anything from me or from anyone in our family. I know the way our parents, especially my father, have handled things has made everything worse. My brother is clearly not okay now. This isn’t just laziness or a bad attitude. He’s shutting down emotionally more and more each day.

I don’t want him to be forced into hospitalization or treated like he’s “crazy.” I just want him to be safe and to get help, help that respects his dignity and autonomy. But I’m scared that if nothing changes, we’re just waiting for another explosion. It feels like a ticking time bomb.

We live in the same house, but we haven’t spoken to each other in five years because of a family fight we had in the past. At first, he still talked to my mom, but after this recent fight, he stopped talking to anyone

How can I help someone who refuses help from everyone? Can someone give me some advice? "
54,"So i almost cried today in school cuz my “friends” pulled down my pants in class cuz it was “funny”
I felt so bad man.
They laughed at me too.
Ppl always say i am overly sensitive for not accepting disrespect that is a “joke” in their eyes and it REALLY gets to me.
What can i do?"
55,"
I’m living in such agony. 

Please please please does anyone have anything that helped them in this situation? 

Please if it hasn’t worked for severe depression (ie for a person that never had thoughts of offing themself) please do not send it. Please no claims to success like “I was super anxious for public speaking and I put it into perspective how lucky I am to get to public speak and it fixed it”"
56,"I've been on intensive care on Sanatory. It has passed 9 days and I am exhausted. Even people I interact with says is for my own good, I feel like I am in jail. Meds are good. I just want to go home. 

Any advices? Thanks."
57,"I just realized that my enjoyment in games literally only depends on achievements. I mean, I obviously do enjoy the games, but I continuously try to play games especially for the achievements on steam or for the challenges in games. I have executive dysfunction so it feels difficult for me to enjoy the games because of how little things I do in games, which upsets me because I DO enjoy them and want to play for the real fun of it, but achievements is always what makes me feel something. 

I mostly play competitive modes in multiplayer games too, it makes me feel so happy to rank up. I wish I didn’t take these so seriously

I’m wondering if anyone else with perfectionism struggles with this? I’m not sure if I’m overthinking this or if it’s really the result of my perfectionism "
58,"I am extremely depressed. I have signs of BPD but I have not been formally diagnosed. I have a deep, terminal, violent self hatred that is almost narcissistic in nature because it is always with me and consumes my thoughts. I am very isolated, in a self imposed way to an extent, because I withdraw from friends and family. 

I get extremely attached to toxic people, and when they hurt me, it destroys me. I struggle with severe insecure attachment. It is terribly unhealthy for everyone involved. I feel awful about it. I am feeling very suicidal and hopeless. I have friends but they are all getting married. I will never find a healthy relationship because I am so profoundly broken, and I have been verbally abused by anyone I have attempted to get close to in that context. I believe them when they say I am not worth loving, and that hurts me deeply. I derive no pleasure from this life and am seriously considering ending it. Can anyone relate?  "
59,"

I’m 16 and I’m absolutely fucked. I’ve had thoughts of ending it even though i know I never will coz I couldn’t do it to my family but I’m so fucking tired of everything. I’m failing classes in school but I’m trying so hard to stay on top of things but it just never works out for me. I try to go to the gym for mental therapy but it doesn’t do it anymore for me, I’ve become so unmotivated and I don’t know what to do anymore. Everyone thinks that I’m fine and I’m the most easygoing person but inside I’m absolutely not ok. I can feel friends that I’ve had since fucking primary slipping away from me. everything always seems to turn to fucking shit for me. My parents have literally no money and are quite literally starving themselves to provide for me. Nowhere will employ me, my cv has no qualifications at all coz nobody will employ me. I have applied for so many places such as restaurants, hotels, shops, leisure centres, gyms, car dealerships, even fucking greggs won’t take me. I do karate and have done since like 6 and I absolutely adore it and i know I’m not good enough to make it big or anything but it’s my getaway. That hour and a half my problems go away and I can just kick the shit out of someone or something. This sounds like I’m trying to make myself sound cool or hard or something but I’m not I promise. I’ve had no luck with girls whatsoever, just can’t get a connection at all and I don’t want to be with someone who doesn’t care for me at all. I had a criminology exam today and I absolutely fucked it up, like awful, I’m not doing this I may have a C or a D I have U. I try so hard in life, I put everything I have into something and it just never prevails for me. I just feel like if I was gone nobody would even bat an eyelid at the minute, nobody would really care and I feel like such a burden to everyone. Pls someone give me some advice if u have cared to read all of this, I’m sorry this has been hard to read but I’ve just ranted without making any changes or looking over what I’ve written so sorry if some of it doesnt make sense. I’ve left a lot out tbh but I just needed to get some stuff off my chest. Thanks for reading if u have 👍"
60,"I'm 24 y/o today but I've never been able to describe to anyone what I been through my whole life.

When I was 8 y/o an older cousin of mine forced me to watch a video where a baby was m*rdered and it changed me. That night when I went to sleep I remember clearly that I was shaking and felt horrible in general but I didn't told my mom that anything had happened, but once I was in bed i couldn't even breath from the panic I felt. I remember being unable to move nor sleep through the whole night because I kept seeing those images in my head.
I was a normal kid until then and to my surprise I quickly forgot about this whole thing (my brain trying to protect me? Idk). The thing is about a year later or so I was in class and one of my classmates came to me to ""show me something"" and it was a video of a guy jumping of a cliff and getting his face ripped in two. And that's where this ""started"".
 I felt sick af immediately, my stomach ached, I couldn't breath, I was shaking, etc. I made it home somehow and at one point I remember I started crying and just simply gave up. I cried for the next 6 months, ALL DAY. My parents were worried sick but didn't know what to do. They took me to the doctor, put relaxing videos, made me eat things for my stomach, they even made an ""exorcism"" thinking that someone cursed me or something. For those 6 months i couldn't do anything alone, I didn't eat, I didn't go to the bathroom alone, I just cried all day and ache. I also feared to tell to my parents what had happened cause this cousin was living with us at the time and was really violent with me, but I didn't really care, I was just focused on suffering. I talked to god to end my suffering, I asked him to take me with him so I wouldn't suffer anymore. Then one day, I just stopped crying and felt better.
Until I was 13 and happened again when we were watching Saw 7 in the classroom. Same story. 3 months in bed, crying, suffering and begging to be gone. It happened again at 14 but this time was different, I didn't have my parents on my side that time and I couldn't handle it. I was seriously thinking on taking my life since nothing solved that pain, I was triggered by anything blood-related and felt terrible for weeks. Until something happened and I learned a ""technique"" to relieve my terrible anxiety and pain. That ""technique"" was sex-related let's say and I've been using it for 10 years now, but it's effectiveness has really gotten down.
After 16 years of suffering and dealing with this terrible problem which I don't know if is the main source of other problems like I have such as extreme fear at times, the absolute no tolerance to g*re or any violent material, the sensation that sometimes will come out of the dark and k*ll me, high imagination on terrible things such as accidents, deaths, etc. I have to deal everyday with this at some level, today for example, was terrible and that's why I'm making this post. 
The things is, I don't know what to call this, I don't know if it's some kind of PTSD or something like that and I would like to talk about it with my therapist but I only see him once a month since I'm in a community program and I'm not able to pay for a therapist of my own. So I wouldn't like to ""waste"" a session to talk to a thing that may to lead anywhere. I would like some help or advice cause I really don't know what to do anymore, I'm really depressed and can barely function on my own rn. Anything is welcomed. Thanks.

61,"[TW: anxiety, depression, trauma, low self-esteem]

I’ve had a hard time my whole life trying to fit in. From a young age, I was afraid of people and struggled to connect. Between ages 4 and 7, I had several surgeries and felt like my parents didn’t really give me room to grow or be myself. Growing up, I faced violence from my father and lived with constant anxiety. I was born premature and faced tough odds for my health.

Living with just my mom helped calm some anxiety, but I still felt trapped in fear. I couldn’t express my thoughts well or keep up mentally. I always felt different and misunderstood. I was often isolated and scared.

When I was 13, I found friends online and escaped there. But even those friendships didn’t last. I felt insecure and awkward, and people eventually distanced themselves. I tried jobs and new things, but nothing felt right. I feel like my mind doesn’t work properly and I keep disappointing people.

About a year ago, I moved back in with my dad, hoping things might improve. Instead, I felt unsupported and alone. I lied a lot to hide my pain and couldn’t stand up for myself. I felt invisible, like I wasn’t taken seriously.

Now at 18, I feel stuck. I’m addicted to weed and smoke a lot to numb the pain. I spend most days on my phone, dreaming of a better life I don’t believe in. I struggle to be “normal” in relationships and social situations. I don’t see a future for myself and feel like I’m just surviving, lying to myself and others. No one seems to believe in me.

I even stayed with a girlfriend who cheated on me because I felt too weak to leave. I often lash out at my mom, the only person still around, even though I hate myself for it. I’m selfish and make the same mistakes over and over.

I don’t want pity or sympathy. I just need someone to hear me. If anyone else feels like this, please reach out. I’m open to sharing more if someone wants to listen."
62,"I’ve been bullied most of my life because of how I look. People avoided me, made fun of me, and often only interacted with me when they needed something, like help with school. Because of this, I grew up without real friends and carried this belief that I was fundamentally unworthy of being liked. And right now at 22, that hasn’t changed, if anything it’s gotten worse.

I’ve tried therapy several times (not just because of how I look) but it hasn’t helped me feel any better about myself. I rarely go outside unless I absolutely have to. When I do, I cover my face with scarves or my hands because I feel so ashamed and afraid of how people will react. I can’t eat in public. I can’t walk normally, I can’t relax. I feel like everyone I pass is silently judging me, comparing themselves to me, and feeling relieved they don’t look like me. 

Even in my own home, I struggle. I wear a hoodie constantly, and when I did have some friends, I couldn’t bring myself to send them a photo of my face. I eventually deleted apps like Snapchat, Instagram etc because it made me feel too exposed, too ugly to exist in a space like that.

I haven’t talked about this with anyone for years. Either they don’t understand, or they try to make me feel better by saying things they don’t really believe. I know when someone’s lying just to be polite, and that hurts more than silence.

Last year, I didn’t even go on vacation with my family to our home country. I was too ashamed to show my face. While they were reuniting with my grandmother and relatives after six years, I was home alone, stuck in my thoughts, missing out on memories because of this shame.

This affects every part of my life. It’s not just a low self-esteem issue. I feel trapped in my body, and I don’t know how to keep living like this. No matter what I try to do, whether it’s social, personal, or even small daily things, this feeling of being ugly ruins it all."
63,"I have always had mental health issues, and have been medicated since kindergarten. I had a rough childhood and raised my self in many ways. I was sent to alternative school my first year of highschool. I made so many bad designs from age 12-20. Since then I have completely turned my life around . I lost 150 pounds, Graduated college, work 3 jobs, and have gf and friends that truly love me. I have been in a good mental state for about 6 years know.  However over the past 2 months I’m completely hyper fixated on my past, specifically one  bad thing I did when I had just turned 19. I won’t say what I did as it is technically a crime where I live but in like 30 states it’s not. I’m completely haunted by this and other things from my past and don’t know how to forgive myself and move on. I understand the underlying reason for why I did what I did and would never do it again, but I still can’t forgive myself. I’m trying to find a therapist but if you have any other tips please let me know. "
64,"

i've known my gf for years. we weren't always dating, but i've known her for at least 7-8 years. she has plans for her future, and they involve me. marriage. pets. a cozy cottage with fun decals and stickers on the windows to the make the sun shine rainbow. a warm atmosphere. maybe an adopted child. 

i want to live alone in a dark house, surrounded by nothing, living with no one, and eventually 0ff myself infront of a bathroom mirror with only a candle lit. my poems, books, and goodbye letters will be set on the dresser in my bedroom, and will leave a note telling whoever finds it to publish them. this has always been my plan. i find solace in the idea, and my heart begins to race when i think of my life going any other way. 

i can't hurt her. my gfs soul is too pure. she is the embodiment of spring and a ray of sunshine. i cannot bare to watch myself dampen her sunlight with the dark cloud that is myself. 

i'm scared to even say i love you back. i mean, i do, but it's mostly over text. it's hard to look her in her big brown eyes and tell her truth that will only end up ripping her apart in the future. how do i go about telling her? do i tell her at all? i dont know. i really like this girl. she really likes me. i can't keep lying to her."
65,Is it just me that feels sick a lot? It only started happening after I was assaulted but I feel sick in some kind of way everyday. Sometimes it feels like it’s in my throat but I don’t actually throw up.
66,"Warning: Short description of gore.

I (43M) can't help but feel responsible for it running across the street and getting hit by the car. I was walking down the residental street on the left side and crossed over to the right side. Then I noticed two cats, who couldn't have been more then a year old, playing and having fun in front of me, at the same time I saw a car coming in the opposite direction. 

So I  stopped walking some distance from them because I didn't want to scare the cats and they would run into the street, I looked down for a minute and after the car passed, I see one of the cats was on the other side of the street laying on it's side and flopping and squirming. At first I didn't realize what had happened, because (1) I didn't hear the cat make any sound at all and (2) I didn't hear the car run over the cat.

I ran to the cat and immediately saw that is head had been run over, blood was all over it's face and putting l pouring out of it's mouth, and is left eyeball and popped out. I couldn't believe what just happened because before I had looked down before that, I literally saw it happen in my mind.

Once the cat stopped moving I picked it up and moved it back to it's house because I didn't want it to get run over some more, plus out of respect for it and is owner. Plus so that the other cats that lived there who saw it happen could not be in danger while they say goodbye. 

No one was home and I couldn't carry it to my home to take to the vet, plus I knew that it was gone already because it never made a sound and occasionally spasm until it's whole body relaxed. It all happened less then 5 mins. 

But I can't help but constantly replaying in my head what happened, and what I could have done so that it didn't happen. I feel that if I had stayed on the original side that I was on, it never would have tried to cross the street. Or I wonder that if I was the reason it ran, eventho I had stopped and I was several houses down from it. Or I should have kept on eye on them while the car passed to try to stop the car if I saw the cat make a move towards the street, especially after seeing the vision of it happening before it did. 

Btw, the car never stopped or slowed down..."
67,"First time posting about something like this. Please forgive my rambling, just need to get it off my chest.

I have always been a extroverted person, my mom called me a social butterfly in school. Unfortunately I also have a large hate for myself. I hate that I struggled in school; I was never good at any subject in school, I hate that I struggle with remembering anything outside of the things I am obsessed with. I hate that tho I can come off as a easy going guy, I always worry about all the things that can go wrong and how I will fuck it up. I truly believe I'm not fit to do anything. I've only found love and self worth in my artform that is dance.

I've been to therapy and it's helped me realize how much of my behavior stems from my dad and how he  always put down my interest and hobbies that weren't sports, and called me stupid all my life. He never showed any belief in my capabilities or told me he was proud of me. And to this day looks down on my life's passion and questions why I do it.

I don't really know what I'm looking for but today was a spiral and just needed to vent."
68,"Hi. My name’s Emily, and I’m a stay-at-home mom, artist, and trauma survivor trying to turn pain into purpose—through mental health art and healing resources for others like me.

I grew up in a household full of chaos and addiction. I’ve survived foster care, abuse, grief, postpartum depression, and the kind of silence that leaves scars. And despite all of it—I’ve chosen to create instead of crumble. I’ve been building journals, coping tools, and art bundles to support others with ADHD, trauma, and depression.

Right now, I’m trying to launch my project quietly—without family judgment, shame, or ridicule. I’m doing everything I can to give my son a life full of love, creativity, and emotional safety… but I need a little help getting there.

If you’ve ever felt like the “black sheep” or the one who had to survive silently, I see you. If you can give anything—$5, $15, or just share this with someone kind—I’d be forever grateful.

Should I go to a private psychologist or whatever and pay for it from money I’ve got as a gift and been saving it for my whole teenage years. If I go I could afford 30-40 sessions. And how I should tell my parents about it. I kinda need their permission too.

Or should I make my parents pay for it? But I don’t know how. They have money for it . I have been asking them to get me a psychologist for 2 years. And recently my dad said I will go to a private one. But he’s been saying it for more than a month. And today they joked about it.

Public one is whatever…Because I need to wait for 1 year and 3 months.

I want to give up. Really.

And don’t say to ask school or police or whatever for help. Because I’ve asked them and they did nothing. Really. It changed nothing. But this whole stressed me very much, when I came to them for help.

And I won’t report my parents to anyone because I’m scared. And police and others act really slowly. It was not worth it when I asked my school back then. They reacted slowly and my parents tripled abuse in house.

So should I pay for it or keep the money for it to help myself to move out when I’m 18. Because I will instantly move out, or my life will be miserable.

I’m 16 and live in Poland so I doubt there is any job I could find. And I focus on my school now. And also Im too tired and depressed to have job.

70,"So over the last few years I've been feeling like I'm not really living just existing. I'm not depressed or happy just neutral. Everyday is the same I get up, go to work, go home, smoke a spliff, play a game or watch something, smoke another, get in bed, go on my phone and waste time, realise its like 1oclock in the morning and finally try to sleep. Then it repeats. I know and think of so much more I could be doing but for whatever reason I don't or cant be bothered. I know I should go to bed earlier, I know I shouldn't smoke so much weed, I could easily do more I have quite alot of free time but I just don't its like I'm on auto pilot just repeating the same things day in day out. I dont know why I don't actually do it like in the case of sleeping earlier I've don't it a few times no problem I know if I just shut my eyes I'd go to sleep but im never tired at night so I just don't. Same with smoking weed I'm not even that bothered theres times I haven't smoked I'm not addicted I don't smoke before work, I still save money, if I cant get one I'm not scrounging round trying to get some, like all day I'll be thinking I won't smoke tonight then when I'm home I just do it anyway. Also I go to the gym I could put alot more effort in and I have a few times but most of the time I just do the bare minimum. I think I'll get on a dating app but then don't I'm not scared of women or anything but im just not that bothered and I don't know why. Like if a girl walked up to me and asked me on a date I'd do it or if my mate asks me to do something I will but when it comes to doing it myself I'm not that bothered and most of the time don't. Its like I'm just to easy going and could take or leave pretty much anything. And I know if I just start doing it I'd be much happier but I just don't. Any advice?

71,"I’d say for a large portion of my life I’ve been unhappy , there’s times where you might look at me and think I am happy  when I’m around friends and family or doing something I enjoy that’s because I am actually happy in the moment , but as soon as I’m on my own or I have to time to just sit and think with no distractions I’m just severely upset for no reason , I don’t know why I feel this way , sometimes it’s so bad I feel like throwing up and balling crying just because deep down I feel severely unhappy , recently I went on a holiday abroad with my friends and while there we met these two girls , looks aside they were two of the most beautiful people I’ve ever met , I’ve never met people so full of joy , happiness and kindness , 24/7 these two girls were just the most amazing people to be around and talk to , they got up and danced in the bar they talked to everyone they sang as loud as they could and didn’t care about anything else , since returning from my holiday and saying goodbye to the girls I’ve been in absolute spiral just to see two people like this who seemed to just be so full of life and happy all the time , obviously I don’t know what they are like on their own but if you met these girls you’d never think they’d be upset , sitting here writing this I have the same sick feeling in my stomach of just how unhappy I am and for what reason I don’t know , I’m going to stop now because I feel I’ve said the same thing over and over and I’m sorry for the poorly constructed format but I felt like I had to say this whether out loud or typed , thanks "

I have a wife, a daughter, and a Job who both look up to and support me 200%. I just have never done therapy before, I don’t think.. (I remember going to a Dr as a kid for ADHD, maybe?) but idk that was when I was 11 or 12, but I’m 31 now.

73,"I'm a 26M, i have ADHD, depression and anxiety. I just got fired from my job yesterday, i fell out with a friend 2 months ago, and my girlfriend walked out on me at the beginning of this year. I have no money, no friends, and no love. It seems like i ruined my own life with my ineptitude, my stupidity and my emotions. 

I've never liked a single fiber of my being throughout my life. I've always known there is something fundamentally wrong with me. I can't focus, i can't control my emotions, i have no particular talents in anything, I'm unbelievably stupid, i fail at every aspect of my life, and my face looks like roadkill.

I'm always wondering why i couldn't just be like my peers back in school. I see them with their perfect lives, a good job, a house, a wife and children. I on the other hand can't even be loved by anyone or work for things that i want because i keep fucking things up. I ask myself why i can't just be like them. I just want to be like them. Instead I'm a royal fuck up that will never amount to anything. My biggest regret is that i wasn't stillborn at birth because i don't even deserve the air that i breathe.

I know that nobody likes me. People give me looks of contempt all the time. I can't even talk to anyone for fear of getting rejected and being told to fuck off. Because of that i always retreat to my own space, close the blinds on my windows and shut of all my lights and just hide. I don't want to ruin people's days with my existence.

I just wish i was normal and being able to be proud of something I've done. I'm so close at becoming 30 with nothing to show for it. I'm an absolute failure and the world would be better off if i didn't exist."

What Am I Supposed to Do? 

Sometimes, I sit with the sinking realisation that this isn’t even a good relationship. At all. And what hurts even more is that I’ve known it deep down for a long time—but I’m stuck. Not just emotionally or mentally, but financially too. I fear that if I cut off contact with my parents, it might give me a sense of pride, independence, maybe even some peace, but it would also bring intense suffering. Because in this world—especially in this economy—it’s extremely hard to support yourself when you’re 24, just starting out, and dealing with health issues every single day.

I feel like I’m in a lose-lose situation. Staying in contact with them feels like slow psychological torture. But cutting them off might push me into financial ruin, force me into burnout just to survive, and maybe even worsen my health. And my health already isn’t great.

It’s not just mental anymore—it’s physical, real, undeniable. I experience pain and symptoms that doctors don’t always understand. But I know in my gut—and my gut has always been one of the problem areas—that much of it is related to years of chronic stress, abuse, invalidation, and trauma.

I have Crohn’s disease, which I’ve had most of my life. I achieved remission by finding the right medication and doctor myself, not through my parents’ support but only financially. As a child, I was taken to numerous doctors who repeatedly called my condition “indeterminate,” leaving me without clarity. I had to solve it on my own. Even now, after years of managing it, they doubt my approach, mocking my interest in holistic or functional medicine and calling me extreme. But where were they when I was in pain, seeking answers, and needed support?

All they ever gave me was shame. Even their attempts at encouragement now to make up for their mistakes fall flat . It seems so fake and too late . 

The physical violence didn’t help, either. It still haunts me. My father used to beat and kick me. Not just when I was small, but even when I was a teenager. Even when I was old enough to understand how wrong it was. And it wasn’t “discipline.” It was rage. It was control. He would call it “arguing” whenever I tried to explain myself. But it wasn’t arguing—it was me trying to have a voice. And him trying to silence it.

Once, he fractured my finger. He said it was an accident. But how can you “accidentally” hurt someone when you’re filled with rage and grabbing them during a so-called “argument”? My therapist said I could have reported him to the police. I didn’t. Because if “reputation” and not wanting to tear the family apart. He owes me that reputation. He owes me so much more than he’ll ever admit.

Now, he doesn’t hit me anymore—but the emotional violence continues. Every time I talk to him, I brace myself for the possibility of aggression. I hope he’ll be kind, supportive, changed. And every time, I’m disappointed. Every time, I’m reminded that healing doesn’t come from people who refuse to acknowledge the damage they caused.

76,"I went to the psychiatrist the other day and she suspects I possibly have bi polar. Idk how to feel about it. It makes me feel bad, worse almost. I want to date someone so bad and I feel like now I’m going to be alone forever because I’m unstable. It’s just draining me emotionally. And all my negative emotions feels so heightened. Idk what to do, my meds are ok but they aren’t helping me on the inside and idk I just feel so empty."

I’m terrified over whats going to happen to me if I cant lift myself out of this dark place.  I am completely lost"
80,"Hello i am not looking for help on this but I just want to get all this off my chest  


So to shorten the story I went to a different school and I couldn’t make friends but then I went back to a school where I had friends and I was able to have conversations again, Although I wasn’t satisfied, eventually summer break hit and I went to a another school(friends came),I so badly wanted to make new friends since i was scared my friends would ditch me and i found it embrassing having less friends, talking to people was the main thing I thought about, I would think in my head of scenarios. I didn’t know how to have deep conversations with people other then my base friend group so I would just use humour I thought of and started befriending a lot of the boys in my class. A lot of them kinda liked the weird humour and I had some good “friends” although I wanted to have deep conversations with them and I would try by asking a question like “do you \_\_\_\_\_” and they didn’t like it also my humour wasn’t as funny anymore and they started to not like me anymore and I would try my best to be friends again by doing the same things, even if they insulted me I would ignore it since I wanted to be as nice as possible. I didnt like my life but that would change when I would change to a class with people I like more and life was much different. The minute I joined the class I suddenly felt confident and that I was nice to talk to, I started to talk so much that I felt tired from it and was happy and I realised I shouldnt be respecting my old friends and stopped talking to them and annoying them.I felt so happy since I was no longer in a argument from my other class, I had a good friendgroup and lots of people were supporting me and befriending me and I no longer felt disrespected by the old friend group. I actually felt in control only thing I worried about is that if I said something dumb or wrong that the people befriend me wouldnt like me anymore but netherless this was one of the best times I have had since I felt relaxed too, but this wouldnt last since I was too worried to talk to the new people and they stopped talking too so I was left with a good amount of friends yet I still wanted to befriend the others. on the other hand during all of this I was beefing with some girls in another class  and whenever I was around them I felt scared that this wasn’t my best self and I wanted them to be worried when I showed up so I would avoid them unless I wanted to argue so I would change stairs just for this. back to friends I would keep on trying to make more and what I would do is try to change mindsets so I could possibly have better conversations or studying and it worked and was  useless. most of the classes at this point was me just learning and thinking about stuff and a little conversations or a bigger one. so i only had like 6-9 friends I would talk to consistently and i never felt close with them even tho I was better with deep conversations now, and i did get close with one but then i felt weird and kinda cringe for some reason and I was scared my friend would think I am cringe too. this repeated until last term where I did some good personal stuff and started to care less about what other people thinked and this made things better but not perfect and here I am"
81,I have been thinking about ending my life for a long time. There are a lot of mental health issues on my mother’s side of the family and I don’t want to be like her or some of her siblings. I think I will choose my day and plan it around a wedding. My life has been plentiful and I’m ready to see what the other side is like. 
82,"WARNING - this is connected to LGBTQ+

I'm sorry if this is a stupid situation because everything's pretty obvious here. Luckily, I'm not a teen anymore, so there won't be any new ""trauma"" about that, I hope. But still I haven't experienced anything like this before, and now I still can't decide what it was. 

So, I'd been chatting with some person here who had the same mental issues as me (social anxiety, loneliness, isolation, etc.). I wrote in the first place that I was queer, and he was OK with that. At first it was great. Someone finally was interested and supportive since I don't have anyone really to talk to. He said it was a ""safe space"" and suggested we stay positive about our lives. I have (and haven't had for years) no one to talk to at all, so I was really trying to find at least one person here to not feel so lonely and isolated. I almost thought we were ""soul mates"". 

But after a couple of days, ""red flags"" came, which I ignored at first. When I said that I hate my voice but used to have a channel on YT (with 7K subs, if so), he suggested I send him a voice note. It was meant to make me feel better, but then questions like ""Can I address you as ""sweety"", ""honey"", etc. or ""Send me a note saying ""Good night"" came. I thought it was weird.

I suspected that he thought I was female (since I wrote that I was just ""queer"" and also smth a bit misleading in my response at first). So, eventually I ""confessed"" that I was gay (with some gender issues). He said it was ok, and we can talk anyway.

But soon he openly suggested sending a dick pic to rate him ""as a friend"". I was confused but didn't end the chat immediately. He said that he wanted to explore his ""gay side"", that he's lonely, and that it's just a body part. As a person with a lot of sh\*t myself, I tried to ""save the conversation"" by saying honestly what I think about such things (being closeted and not really ok with my own sexuality). Of course I didn't agree to see or even rate his cock. I advised him to be more careful and to see a therapist. So he wished me luck with my issues and wrote the final ""Bye"".

Was he really a predator (besides being quite a perv), even if he tried to be ""supportive"" most of the time? Now I feel used and even rejected in a twisted way. I hope you won't just laugh because it still hit me, actually. It's stupid, but I can't stop thinking about what would have happened if I'd agreed?.. I can't even say I was really against that ""idea,"" since I wrote a lot after he suggested it, ""explaining"" myself. I feel horrible anyway, honestly. The only good thing that our ""friendship"" didn't last long "
83,I feel the life is getting weird and non fulfilling. Nothing seems to give a sense of satisfaction or success. I have been looking for a partner from quite some time but could not get that. It’s always some or the other issue that breaks the deal. I reduced my weight too have been really good now in talking and interacting. Have a stable and well paying job but nothing seems to work all this made me feel useless and unwanted. Then i started to play a game in mobile. It’s a pay 2 win game i made friends and got a huge crush on a friend there but she is now really interested in someone else. I have saved money. I’m able to take care of my family and have even spend 1000USD on the game to get stronger over some time. I just can’t make peace with myself. Everything feels so distant. Even when I’m home with friends or family or anyone it feels my consciousness is away searching for the answer to why do I live now. Why am i here my money my job nothing makes me happy even not my parents or friends. But I’m just scared n not fully convinced to die too. O have taken therapy twice did not fully help. Any suggestions. I’m not saying I have. Huge trauma or something i don’t know i just feel so dejected and away from everything.
84,Today at my hospitality job I fucked up really badly. I changed a keg incorrectly which led to me wasting an entire keg straight down the drain which cost about £200. My managers have been rinsing me and I don't think they will ever trust me again and most likely think I'm an idiot. I've been crying for about 5 hours thinking I'm the stupidest most incompetent person to ever roam the earth. I now realise it's not really about the keg. Goddamn
85,"Hey Everyone, I hope you are all doing okay and looking after yourselves. 

So I'm reaching out because I am afraid of my dark side, which includes Intrusive thoughts, and I think I have Sexual Compulsive behavior and OCD. I'm afraid of opening up about it, because I'm scared of being judged.  I'm a kind, caring, honest, and supportive person, but every time I feel scared, angry, irritated, frustrated, lonely, not seen, heard, loved, or supported, my thoughts turn very dark and I start thinking about harmful behaviors. It scares me, and I need help to control these thoughts.

86,"I’ve got a 15-minute consult tomorrow morning with a new therapist. She seems great—trauma-informed, queer- and neurodivergent-affirming—but I’m overwhelmed trying to figure out how to even start.

I’m 34, queer, autistic, and have a diagnosis of Bipolar II. But the “bipolar” part has always felt murky. I don’t have manic episodes—maybe not even true hypomania. What I do have is obsession. I fixate, repeat things, lose myself in spirals of thought. When I was younger, they called it OCD or anxiety. Now people say it’s part of being bipolar. The only thing that maybe feels “hypomanic” is that sometimes my reflection looks like a different person, like I shift.

I had to leave high school after 9th grade because things were so bad. I was hospitalized four times as a teenager for compulsive self-harm. In 2022, I ended up in a Partial Hospitalization Program. And a few weeks ago, I finished 12 sessions of ECT. It didn’t work. I’ve also tried ketamine, which helped a lot, but I can’t afford it anymore.

Right now I’m taking:
	•	Rexulti (1 mg, just restarted recently)
	•	Wellbutrin XL (450 mg)
	•	Pristiq (200 mg)
	•	Mydayis (12.5 mg)


I’m dealing with:
	•	Severe anhedonia and executive dysfunction (showering, eating, cleaning are huge hurdles)
	•	Financial ruin—debt collectors are calling, and I can’t manage basic bills
	•	Fear of losing my job, which would also mean losing insurance
	•	Isolation—I feel disconnected from friends, my community, even myself

I don’t drink alcohol, but I’ve been using kratom. I know it’s not good, but it’s felt like the only thing that takes the edge off when things get unbearable.

There’s a part of me that wonders if I just need to give up and try to get on disability. But I don’t want to. I went to college in my early 20s, and while it was hard, I was more stable then. I had friends. I had joy. Now I feel like I’m unraveling.

Has anyone else been through something like this? How did you explain your story to a new therapist when everything felt too big to put into words?

Any solidarity, advice, or shared experience would mean a lot right now."
87,"Content warning is in reference to my friend who passed away.
I 24M have basically been having an abysmal time mentally and its a lot so please bear with me.
I'm Autistic and I also struggle with OCD and have really strong suspicions of some form of Bipolar disorder and/or ADHD. I've never worked a day in my life ever since my early/mid teens when I went into a period of time where I dropped put of secondary school and had these really intense delusions that fed into my OCD (I won't get into specifics because its too detailed) . 
I often am delusional though in the sense I have these inflated ideas about my abilities/skills/intellect but I also become really depressed and hopeless at other times .
My best friend killed herself eight months ago and ever since I've been up and down going from hopeful about the future to completely hopeless and back again . I'm not suicidal but sometimes I don't care if I die . 
I feel so worthless and lonely . I'm obese because I eat impulsively . Im broke because I spend my disability money impulsively . Im so fucking lonely . 
I thought I'd be something by now . I thought I'd have figured out how to control my eating for fuck sake . I feel sometimes like I'm unwillingly killing myself with how foolishly I eat . Sometimes I'm ok but then I lose control and eat thousands of calories in one go . Food is my addiction . 
Idk how I'll ever work or who would hire a fuck up like me who has no history of working in his mid twenties . I feel so fucked . 
I can't really explain it to the people in my life . They either don't care or can't handle it depending on the person. I'm so fucking unwell now .
I miss my best friend more as time goes on . Some days I'm on the verge of tears but I can't cry even when I try to let myself . I just stay like that with a catch in my throat as it I'm about to start sobbing and sometimes it lasts for days with only slight breaks from it . 
I don't know how to have a normal life .  I wanna matter and do something meaningful . I want to be healthy . Most of all I want to be in love . Theres so many things I want I haven't experienced yet . I feel like shit watching my 20F sister live her life hitting all these milestones I haven't . My parents put more time into helping her and connecting with her emotionally . Shes the better investment for them because she isnt fucked up like me.  
Thats not to say they don't do things for me they've given me a lot financially but they don't connect with me or try to know me like they do with her . Its fucking lonely . She gets so much more of their mental and emotional energy .
I know I sound pathetic in parts of this but thats how I feel . 
When will things get better???? Please God I am actually begging for life to become better"

89,"hii!! i (F17) really need help trying to understand why i am the way i am, i can never find a label that describes it well enough

i’ve noticed this only recently , i started getting closer to some online friends, and they’ve become a very important part of my life , i talk to them a lottt a lot i was close to two people at first , and they knew each other for a little longer than i did, but when i found out that they texted each other just as much as they texted me , i genuinely felt so annoyed it put me off for the rest of the day, but i was able to deal with it. after that i got closer to another person, and we got super close, but she had other friends she had known for years , but for some reason any time she would bring them up i would like shut down , my brain would like hate it for some reason and i would feel so violent and it’s a constant thing now, anytime i see her talking to other people i feel so annoyed and so filled with irrational rage. i’ve talked to her about it and she’s reassured me that she values me at a higher standard than most of the other people she talks to , but for some reason, i still feel inadequate any time she isn’t talking to me, it’s taken a toll over my life. this isn’t the first time/person this happens with , but it’s just the most recent and i really don’t like it. most of the time i would be the one to leave other people first , so maybe i have a fear of that happening to me? but at the same time i know it wouldn’t happen. i have a lot of underlying problems but i think maybe finding out what This is first would help me manage the rest of my issues

i know this may seem like a surface level issue but it’s genuinely taking a toll on my life and everything and i just want to know possible reasons to Why i am the way i am

Mom's losing her battle with cancer, she looks nothing like her pictures from December. Pop's disabled due to heart attack since 2019. Home has deteriorated a lot the last time I visited this April.

I live miles away for college. Always had stellar grades on a premiere uni due to the pressure of the scholarship. Now on my 4th year and failing horribly this semester. 

I don't have a face to show and tell this to my sister who stays with my parents and helps me with my bills.

I'm on a cycle of lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, sleeping or crying at home after classes. I don't have the will to continue my damn thesis or life for that matter.

Looks like everything I value and everything that I can truly call 'mine' is falling apart or gone and I feel paralyzed. I know I need to move forward, but my mind is not cooperating, my thoughts are swallowing me whole.

Idk where to start..."
92,"I was always a question-asker.

Even as a little girl in church, I asked too many questions. Why would God allow pain? Why did I feel things others didn’t? Why did the Bible sometimes sound...off?

I remember adults getting uncomfortable. Teachers brushing me off. They said I talked too much, thought too hard. But really, I was just spiritually awake—hungry for truth.

Then my family broke.

My daddy left. Mama shut down. Emotionally absent. I was left floating in a world that made no sense.

That’s when I met RB and her family. Her daughters became my best friends. Their household looked ""spiritual."" They talked about God and Christ and prophecy... but they also whispered about Freemasonry, aliens, rituals, and spiritual warfare. It was a strange mix of conspiracy, Bible, and something much darker.

At the time, I just wanted to belong. I was a little girl looking for a place to land.

They called it spiritual training.

We wore white gowns. Learned scripture. Prayed for hours. Fasted. We were taught that pain purged sin. That obedience was holiness.

It escalated fast. The rituals grew darker.

They starved me. Forced me to hurt others. Said God demanded it. Said I had to die to my “flesh” to be pure.

They buried me alive. Made me drink blood. Urinated on me. I was called Omega. The ""last chosen one.” They said I was special. A final vessel. It wasn’t love—it was manipulation. They spoke of a planet, Nibiru, with beings called Annunaki who had enslaved humanity. 

And in the midst of all of that… I started seeing light.

Not metaphorical light. Actual light.

I began seeing clear, transparent lines—geometry in the air. Lattices. Grids. Sacred patterns over everything. I saw it during rituals, during trauma. In the darkest moments.

No drugs. No hallucinations. I was a child. This was real.

At first, I thought it was something they had “done” to me. Like they had activated something supernatural. But deep down, I knew—it wasn’t from them. It was older. Divine. A glimpse of what they were trying to imitate and control.

Even then, I sensed it came from God.

They wanted to make me a vessel for evil. But something holy slipped through the cracks. That sacred geometry—it’s never gone away. I still see it.

Eventually, I escaped.

One night, mud-covered and terrified, I ran. A man on a tractor found me and got help. That night led to RB being rescued too.

But the rest? They vanished. The case was buried. No justice. Just silence.

I shut it all away. Until I had my son.

At 25, the memories started returning. At first, flashes. Then body memories. Then full recall. I began understanding why I reacted the way I did to certain phrases, smells, prayers.

Everything made sense.

And the geometry? It remained. Steady. Quiet. Watching.

Now I see it for what it is.

They tried to break me. But they accidentally awakened me.

I was never meant to be theirs. I was made for truth. And the Light? It never left me.

Now I follow Christ—not the distorted Christ they used to control, but the real Christ. The one who weeps with the wounded. The one who walks through the geometry and brings peace.

I’m still recovering. But I’m not ashamed.

I was called Omega. The last.

But in Christ, I am a beginning.

The geometry they tried to twist became a key.

The pain they gave me became prophecy.

The girl they buried is risen."
93,"PREFACE: I do have a therapy appointment in about a month already scheduled, so I have started seeking help. Just seeking further direction, people who have experienced something similar, or possible answers at this point

It's been about a year since I graduated high school, and what began as a difficult transition has become more and more evident that something else is going on. I graduated top ten of my class, very sure about going to college to become a music educator, had one of the best summers of my life. I've always struggled with mental health at times, mostly depression, anxiety, and dissociation (although some obsessions and compulsions and mild hallucinations had begun near the second half of my senior year of high school at this point--had assumed it was related to stress). 

However, I got to college and experienced a very sudden inability to make friends or function at all. I was also dealing with some pretty bad health problems (was in the ER three times, one of those times with deadly low blood sugar), but it got to the point where I wasn't making it to any of my classes and couldn't do any of my coursework. I no longer felt like I fit in with my peers or my major, but without extra money to spend on trying to figure out a different major I simply dropped out after three months with plans of getting a full time job.

After five months I did get a full time job and even moved out of my parents' house. However, my attendance began to flag again and I was recently terminated and am now looking for another job. I can only describe my current experience as terrifying. 

To be honest, I am suicidal nearly all the time and my brain can only be what I describe as loud. It's filled with thoughts that don't feel like my own and I have to yell in my own head for them to be quiet. I have terrible mood swings where I will be okay and dealing with my situation and trying to fix it when suddenly it's all I can do to lie down and have a panic attack. It feels like my body is burning all of the time and I see people that don't exist nearly daily (if I leave my apartment--i don't generally see them if i am inside the apartment). Every time I drive if I go over any kind of bump I have to convince myself I didn't run over a person. It's very hard to do normal life things like I used to and I have little desire to do anything at all. But also sometimes I am fine and I want to get my life together and fix everything. It's very confusing. Nothing feels like real life anymore. Everything used to feel very certain and grounded and now it all feels too big."
94,"TL;DR: Built a playful app where your daily work from home habits and breaks help a little planet thrive (or struggle) - think Forest meets Tamagotchi for your mental health. Does this resonate? Would you use it?

\------

I love working from home, but if I’m totally honest, it’s been kind of a rollercoaster mentally. Some days I can barely start working - other days I find myself stuck in work mode even at 10pm. It’s hard to keep clear boundaries between work life and personal life, and I often feel guilty taking breaks or struggle with procrastination. Basically: motivation, balance, and guilt-free rest can be tough.

I used to be a developer but shifted into project management. Lately, I’ve missed building stuff myself, so I started a little weekend side project that’s actually been helping me a lot. I made an app that’s basically a playful way to manage mental well-being while working remotely.

The idea: you get your own little planet that mirrors your mental health and daily habits. Your goal is to keep your planet healthy, alive, and protected. When you start the day focused (with a quick morning routine), your planet brightens and thrives. If you take proper breaks (like a short breathwork or mindfulness session), you add a visual shield of protection around it. Ending the day with reflection helps your planet regenerate. But skipping breaks, procrastinating too much, or blurring work/home boundaries stresses your planet out—storms might start appearing, or the ecosystem might get shaky.

Here’s a quick rundown of the main features I’m already working on:

* Morning kickstart to enter the workday intentionally.
* Short guided mindfulness breaks to refresh and recharge.
* Evening reflection ritual to mentally detach from work.
* Quick mood check-ins to see patterns and track stress.
* A visual planet ecosystem that grows or struggles based on how well you handle your workday.

It’s honestly been helping me stay sane, and now I’m wondering if others might relate and benefit from it too. I’m thinking about polishing it up a bit and putting it out there for free (no ads, just a hobby project).

Does this resonate with anyone else here? Would a playful, visual app like this help you maintain better habits, clear boundaries, and guilt-free breaks during your work-from-home day?

I’d genuinely love your feedback or suggestions - thanks a ton for reading this far! :)"
95,"Hi as the title says I’m looking for some long term help anywhere in the world, the more affordable the better. I’ve dealt with serious childhood trauma and have had a few mental health hospital stays and lots of issues most of my life. I’m 24 years old and I just don’t want this to be my life forever. I’m really struggling keeping up with therapy, diets, sobriety etc. I tend to do well in an environment where the choice is taken away from me and I follow a set structure. I don’t think your standard mental hospital stay is what I need. I need to break habits, I need to get on track, I need to fix my mind. I’m going to come into a bit of money soon and I’m willing to spend the money on my health to make a true long term change in my life. I’m preferably looking for something that’s 6-16 weeks long. That does psychotherapy but also focuses on nutrition and metabolic health. I have seen a few options that tick these boxes but they charge $60,000+. If anyone has any suggestions that would be a great help. "

97,"Oh, I'm first use Reddit, i hope i didn't do anything wrong. If I do something wrong, please tell me. I will change that.



Before there, i try to use Instagram But i Don't know how to use. That is not a good put diary's place. So I'm here.

I thought about why I like to think in English... Until I saw a saying that said this. ' the first language always had everything about bad memory. It's all younger Trauma are happened in first language. So if you use another language to thinking, you will jump out about old trauma.'

I didn't have a best life when I was a child, But either I can't say that was a bad time. Just like have some little hurts everyday. Not enough to wanna end myself, Not enough to live happily.

I can't stay in crowd, I'm afraid of person. I left school when I am eleven years old. Mental illness and stress make me couldn't breathe. I stayed at home six years.

I do the only thing is draw and write. When i was a kid i like drawing some original pictures and writing some imagine story, that is my favorite hobby. But now, create something is the only way can make me feel 'I'm still alive.'

I don't have lot of friends, they are busy in school or work. I don't mean i want to go back to school or get a job. I have plans to my life, But just sometimes... Maybe when you stay in bed want to sleep, the loneliness will eat your heart and your self confidence. It's like, suddenly, you wonder if the decision you've made is stupid and will destroy you.I don't know... did I do something right?

Please forgive my poor English. The last time I learned it was when i was in school.

My vocabulary is really insufficient, in short, I have been taking psychotropic drugs for a long time, and I also have a psychological counselor. But these can't avoid sometimes i will feel terrible and useless, they're makes me helpless.

I wanna have a new start. Maybe some communicatee? I can't tell this thing to my familiar friend, i don't want them worried me so much.

I had normal life. But deep down i felt my spirit is bit by bit crumble uneasily. I don't know how can l do that, Maybe learn? Maybe start to get a healthy life? I slept in the afternoon again today, I really should do something.

So i try to use English speak and noted here. But anyway, i had bad English. I try, i just can't do that.



Maybe this will be a start? I don't know, But i hope so. Apologies again for my terrible English, thank you for seeing this."

99,"I had a nightmare last night. I dreamed that I was homeless. I wandered from place to place. I finally ended up in a rec center, where they let me stay overnight, as long as I took care of two kids. I kept watch over them most of the night before finally drifting off to sleep. When I woke up, the kids were gone. I was arrested by the police for vagrancy. The police said I wasn't allowed to be there and I was responsible for the missing kids. They put me in the back of a squad car. I thought they were taking me to the precinct, but instead they pulled off at a funeral home. They led me in, told me I was to be executed for my crimes, and put a gun to my head. They put a film on and had me watch the movie while they loaded the gun. The dream ended when they put a bullet in my skull.

I've been living on a razor's edge for a long time, making just enough money to pay my rent, but this month has been especially hard with bills. I take care of my elderly mom and my little dog and they both are dependent on me to work and provide for them. But with everything going on in the news (I live in California), I'm afraid that we'll be homeless before long and that will be the end of us. I'm doing everything I can to find a better job that pays more and I have support through social services, but it's been an uphill struggle. I feel like this dream is a sign of my worst fears manifesting themselves. Losing those I'm supposed to protect, being homeless, and being punished for not having a place to live."
100,"basically, i've been trying to hide my emotions when hanging out with friends or having conversations with them because my gut is telling me ""telling them about what you're struggling with is selfish and a burden to them"" which, yeah, i know thats not true, but it just sticks with you, yk?

  
yeah, i have family, but conversations with my family about these things are pretty uncomfortable. hell, my family in general makes me uncomfortable. i don't let them touch me. no hugs, fist bumps, high fives, none of that. my family urks me in ways i cant explain, but im getting side tracked. back to the matter at hand



i've been seeing posts about people and how they hate being the ""therapist friend"" and hearing what all those people have to deal with, the emotional baggage, the pressure, the feeling of walking on eggshells, all of that just made my fear of opening up just expand. it makes me never wanna open up to them at all because i dont want them to become the ""therapist friend""

  
i have never seen anyone talk about this struggle of hiding everything out of fear of burdening your friends and them becoming ""the therapist"". i've tried therapy multiple times before, but all those sessions and facilities were uncomfortable and left me with more trauma than before, which makes me scared of reaching out again.

  
i just wanted to find a way to vent about this thought process and see if others feel the same way

  
is this something that anyone else has experienced? the fear of opening up to anyone bc they're not your therapist? or is this just a me problem?"

105,"Hello,
I dont know If anyone can relate... Probably Not, because this is Not Something that everyone goes through. But basically, the Last couple years I've been struggling with my mental health and therefore wasnt able to pursue my degree in Art school. However, I posted my Art online on my tiktok Account. It never Really went viral but I Just kept Posting as making Art was my Hobby so It didnt seem so hard to me. But I neglected everything else. Friendships. My whole Life basically. And Posting and talking in my Account didnt fill Up my social needs and now I feel so disconnected from myself. I think because I havent been connecting with Others. I dont know how to regain that connecting to myself again. Should I delete my tiktok Account?
In September I will start my degree in Art school this year. So then, I wont have time to Post anymore anyway. Although Posting was my escape from... Everything. Can anyone Understand how I feel ? "

I don't do any sports, I don't have any real hobbies and nobody ever messages me. Im scared that im never going to find another girl that likes me and im scared that im never gonna feel happy again.

115,"My online best friend W found me when I was at a very low point in my life, struggling mentally. We initially connected over a similar interest, but our relationship quickly grew deeper, and they helped me a lot when I needed it the most. As I got to know W better, they revealed that they're also having problems with their mental health. It never affected our relationship until recently.

It all started three months ago. They are approaching the finishing point of their studies, and told me that as it grows closer, they feel more and more willing to take their own life, saying that they will do it soon after graduation. At this point, we became extremely close and spent a lot of time together, so I became genuinely worried for my dear friend. I tried to do everything I possibly could to guide them through this uneasy period to the best of my knowledge, as I personally know what dealing with suicidal thoughts feels like.

However, this completely changed the way I'm communicating with them. I always second-guess my every word and action as I am extremely afraid of accidentally hurting them. They said they don't want me to walk on eggshells around them, yet I feel like I can't help but always do just that. As I mentioned before, I myself struggled with mental health issues quite a lot, and even though I am in a better spot now than I was when I just met W, I am still going through the healing process. However, I feel like I can't focus on that anymore.

What happened today left me reevaluating. They told me that they are going to take their own life tonight, when they come home after studying, which would be in approximately three hours. I messaged them back, trying to stay calm and collected, saying that I'm here to listen and support them, as I have no other way to get them help. For three hours we chatted on and off, with me trying to offer them any support I could. They said they don't want to do anything anymore, that they're tired and want out. I was crying and had a panic attack when they stopped replying altogether. I texted them that I'll be waiting for them to come back patiently, hoping for the best. The next hour was pure torture, as every second I kept questioning how W was doing and if they were safe.

To my great relief, they eventually texted me back. I asked them where they are right now, and they said that they're home, but it seems like they changed their mind, saying that they're going to sleep, hoping not to wake up the next morning. The last messages they sent me were them saying they will try to take their own life again soon. I lack the resources to involve a third party in this. I am scared.

I love W very much and feel a deep emotional connection towards them. And I know it is mutual and that they wish me no harm (or that is what I want to believe). But I feel like our relationship drains me and worsens my anxiety, which is something I'm currently battling hard with. I'm very torn, because I feel responsible for them relying on me always being there to listen, care about them, and want to help them as much as I can. On the other hand, I feel helpless, anxious, and unable to continue my own recovery because of this. But I cannot just cross them out of my life, because they're my friend who's clearly going through a lot in their life and trusts me with it, and I'm afraid that me leaving will make it worse for both of us.

Is my approach the problem in this situation? What should I do?"
116,"I think it might be disassociation but I’m nor sure. So basically when it happens I feel like I’m not really **there**, like I fully understand what is going on, I can do things, talk to people etc. but everything seems unreal, like a tv show, a video, I’m not sure how to describe it best. It just feels like I’m not fully present in the moment and that nothing around me is real. Does anyone know what this might be?"
117,"I spoke to my PCP recently about how I’ve been feeling, and she suggested I try Sertraline or Fluoxetine. I’m really hesitant to start medication though, so I’m looking for a second opinion. I’ve been struggling with constant brain fog, low concentration, and this deep mental exhaustion that doesn’t go away. Even simple things like having a conversation, being around friends, or studying leave me completely drained. No matter how much I sleep, I still wake up tired. I drink coffee, tea, and even energy drinks, which help a little, but I still feel mentally off. It’s frustrating because I don’t think I’m depressed, but I definitely don’t feel like myself. Could this be something else?"
118,"I can't seem to stop using food as an emotional support system. I turn to food when I'm sad, anxious, scared, lonely, tired, bored and even happy. Food Is the only thing that makes me happy. I have a husband and children and I love them, but food always hits the spot. I've tried replacing food with something else but it just doesn't work. I'm obese and extremely unhappy with my weight. I completely avoid mirrors. Sometimes I catch a reflection of myself in a shop window and I feel disgusted. That makes me feel low and I eat. Has anyone found anything to replace food? I'm so unhappy with my size. It's also impacting my physical health too. I'm 41.and my entire body constantly aches..my knees hurt, especially walking downstairs, my feet hurt, my joints and back hurt. I just don't know that to do "
119,"i (f17) have been struggling with this since around 8 years now, but every few months i completely shut down for a random length of time. i refuse to speak to friends and family, i sleep too much (i wake up to go to school for around 4 hours and i come home to sleep again), stop feeding myself, and i'm just generally in a bad state of mind. i get worse and worse the more this happens to me.

the most minuscule things tick me off, my friends (who i've been completely fine with prior to this) begin to irritate me to the point of me going out of my way to avoid seeing them, i start to believe my parents hate me and never loved me, and i go MIA for weeks or more. my entire thought process changes when i feel this way, its like i'm a whole different person.

i noticed that it normally happens after i'm ""too social"". and what i mean by that is whenever i keep in touch with friends daily via text or irl for more than a few hours a day, after a month or so i fall back into this state. 

for example, a few years ago i met a new friend online who i really liked and connected with. we talked daily and never had any bad blood. after a few months of constant communication, out of the blue i woke up in one of ""my moods"", i didn't have the energy to speak to this friend, i stopped speaking to my irl friends and family, and i began isolating myself. i was constantly upset and angry at everything and anything and my irl friend said i looked like i wanted to kill her. i didn't have the energy to speak to this person again until 2-3 years later, obviously by then it was too late and i lost this friend and damaged my relationship with my irl friends. 

i really hate feeling so angry at the world all the time and losing good friends over this, am i just being dramatic and this is normal behavior? or is there just something wrong with me?"
120,"Lately I’ve been going to therapy for dissociation and one topic today we talked about is the fact that deep down I am bisexual and I’ve been trying to hide that part of me and that has been adding to all the stress but I am in a committed straight relationship and I just don’t know what to do, I don’t want men to be a part of my future and I want to get married to a women but I don’t know how to do that without shutting a part of myself out… it is unbelievably stressful and I’m making this post to see if anyone has any tips or has done this themeselves? It may also be important to add that I was manipulated and bullied by the only 2 men I had relations with a few years ago."

123,"I have accomplished things I should be proud of. I’ve gotten a degree, I have a really cool job that I enjoy, I’m set up in a position where I can enjoy my job without worrying too much about financial struggles right now, I’ve written an unpublished novel, etc. Yet, I never feel proud of any of my accomplishments. I only feel ashamed that I haven’t done more, and I hate it.

Like, oh I got a Bachelor’s Degree and all, but other people have gotten a Master’s Degree, why don’t I have a Master’s Degree? And I bet if I had a Master’s Degree, I’d brush it off and wonder why I don’t have a PhD and if I got a PhD, I’d probably brush it off and wonder why I didn’t choose a better field.

Not to mention, since my degree was in a humanities major, I constantly feel ashamed because it wasn’t a STEM field.

And whenever I hear someone else has done something great, I immediately feel ashamed. I view my accomplishments as shit or nonexistent and theirs as incredible and unobtainable.

When I try to write another novel, I always feel like it’s shit and needs to be rewritten. I’ve had others read my work and compliment my writing, but it doesn’t matter, it’s still shit in my eyes. 

Back in college, my professor (who was a strict grader) complimented my writing and gave me a high grade, saying I could be a great writer one day. I still don’t think that paper was all that great.

Being the idiot teen i am i just thought ok maybe thats normal a few messages later she sends me a nude showing her tits. Then asks me to show her my dick. I say no. Then a few chats later she sends me another nude. A few chats later of me saying no to showing her my dick she Ghosts me i block her.

Also saw someone who had there dick as there profile picture i reported him.

125,"I was a trouble child when I was younger just because I was hyper. I didn't understand that other people were real people with feelings even though I'm sure someone tried to tell me at some point.

My teachers in elementary school weren't good with children. They would of course punish me for disrupting class, but also for small things like bouncing my leg to hard. They didn't really distinguish the punishments at all so it felt the whole time like I got punished no matter what I did. I didn't really understand how to get it to stop.

I would get an isolated desk, put on silent, couldn't participate in class activities, couldn't go to recess, and was sent to the office very often. In the office they had a punishment system where they would lock you in a closet sized room with a desk for a while after getting scolded, so you could think, I guess. I remember a few teachers when I was very young like 1st or 2nd grade would bring Christmas and Easter treats for everyone in the class except for me. I wasn't allowed in any special needs stuff or recommended for getting a mental disability looked into at all since I was one of the best at learning the material and doing work.

Now I feel panicked or just a sense of dread in general if I'm in a room alone with an adult, if I'm told to wait alone in a room, or if an adult tells me to look them in the eyes. It doesn't remind me of being punished exactly, but I've been wondering why I feel that way and I think that may be why. Maybe I'm subconsciously scared of being that way again?

I only started really thinking about my time in elementary school recently and all the memories started coming back when I looked at old journals and stuff.

I don't think it's severe enough to be a trauma but it affects me and it's scaring me."

127," I suffer with depression and anxiety already but I can get quite riled up on Reddit.

For example, I could go onto a site like 4chan and be told the meanest things imaginable... and I feel nothing. But if someone on Reddit is negative towards me... It stings. Is it because things are less 'anonymous' on Reddit and it's an ""actual"" person replying to me rather than some faceless anon?"
128,"Three years ago, my psychologist diagnosed me with panic/anxiety disorder and earlystage depression. That’s what the papers say, although I never really felt depressed or maybe I just have the wrong impression of what depression should look like.

Long story short, I’ve had some rough years involving alcohol and drugs at certain points in my life, as well as some pretty toxic relationships (including one with someone who had schizophrenia and seriously messed up a lot of things for me). All of this, I think, gave me a very warped view of what life and relationships should look like.

I met a great guy, got pregnant, but my life still crumbles from time to time.

I’m extremely paranoid all the time. I worry constantly that my partner is cheating (even though I don’t know when he possibly could, he works from home). I’m paranoid about our baby and our safety to a degree that’s really disturbing. We live in one of the top 10 safest countries in the world, but I still fear that someone will break in and kill us all. I even hide knives while washing them, just in case a neighbor can see through the window.

I won’t let our child go out with our parents because, even though I trust them 100000% and know they’re normal and loving, my mind still doesn’t trust them. I fear they’ll do something impulsive, like throw her in the river. I can’t let them take her in the car or hold her while walking down stairs because all I see is them falling and crushing her head.

My mind invents horrible, impossible scenarios every single day. It’s driving me literally crazy. Because of this, my daughter only wants me and I’m totally overwhelmed and exhausted, to the point of a mental breakdown. And the same time I freak out if she’s not with me because I don’t trust anyone else to follow our routine exactly. I feel guilty if the routine isn’t done perfectly, exactly the way my mind says it should be.

I’m constantly thinking.. What if she’s sick and we don’t know? What if she dies in a few years? What if someone does something to her?

My partner is the most mentally stable person I know, but even then my mind creates scenarios, like him throwing her off the balcony.

Also I’m exhausted because I feel like everything has to be perfectly clean and organized, her things sterilized, etc.

My baby is 13 months old. I was wondering if this could be postpartum anxiety? It sounds silly but google actually suggested it could be OCD.

This is just a tiny glimpse of the thoughts that go through my head every day.

Is there anyone who’s had a similar experience and could share some tips? I’m feeling pretty lost. I don’t have any more free sessions with my psychologist, and I can’t really afford to pay for weekly sessions on my own.

Thanks in advance. "
129,"I think that might be true of some cases but not true of others.

People mellow out over time. With age comes maturity due to experience, and sometimes the thing we think devastating or emotionally overwhelming will eventually seem like less of a tragedy.

After a manic episode, I was placed on court ordered treatment for 1 year.

For the following 5 years, I made mostly all of my appointments and took the medications my psychiatrist prescribed.

That was a difficult time in my life, and I think my level of alcohol abuse had much to do with the unstable moods I experienced during that time.

And while it may seem like a relatively quick, easy fix to medicate with prescriptions, are these psychiatric drugs any better than other options for maintaining long-term health and stability while achieving life goals? I read down the lists of the side effects that can occur when taking my prescriptions, and of course, I experienced all of them.

Now, once my primary care physician reviewed my labwork, I have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder.

For those new to the subject, the thyroid is a butterfly-shaped organ located in the lower front of the neck.

The thyroid controls the production of certain hormones in the body and helps regulate metabolism.

Thyroid dysfunction can mimic a mental health episode.

Basically, once I began taking the medication to maintain thyroid function, I noticed that the thyroid medication worked amazingly well, better than my psychiatric medications.

Essentially what I'm saying is, psychiatric medications aren't life.

Eventually, over several discussion opportunities, I sort of conversationally cornered my psychiatrist and found that wanting to help people by pushing these psychiatric medications is fine, but also that **some psychiatrists might receive monetary kickbacks based on the number of their patients taking a certain prescription.**

I don't know what I thought would happen.

I feel so much more normal detoxing from my psychiatric medications, although I understand that the picture of ideal mental health may be different for you or anyone else besides me.

(Other conditions I know of that can mimic mental health episodes include tropical diseases and metal poisoning, to give a few alternate examples).

I probably love you too much. I know I'll get flack for this post."
130,"Okay, I couldn’t add both flairs but this is mostly good news now, I will keep backstory to a minimum here. 

I (25F) was brutally broken up with just about 2 years ago from a manipulative, narc of an ex who to this day still apparently claims some serious lies about me, wished me dead to my face and a tonne more, but leaving out the majority of the story which reveals this was not at all the case. It messed me so badly I am now looking at PTSD and on strong anxiety meds to counteract flashbacks. A year later (last year) I was S.A’d (won’t use r word here) by someone I thought I trusted while I was in a severe mental breakdown, to the point of complete dissociation and amnesia for over a week. He bragged to me about it after like it wasn’t assault. It destroyed me, he’s gone out of my life but flashbacks were starting to fade in and everything got pretty awful. It’s worth mentioning I’m diagnosed bipolar, and have now been totally stable since roughly August last year in that regard.

But today, after a looong doctors appointment yesterday. Meds are sorted and working for the extreme anxiety, sleep improved last night, and I was referred to a crisis counsellor specialist in PTSD from S.A and emotional abuse (2 birds one stone) which I attended today to gather some details with the help and support of my best friend. As well as this, a man I have been talking to for roughly a year has been my shining light through everything. I am head over heels in love and it’s reciprocal. He is so funny, gentle, and just all in all so respectful of things that have happened, and are moving at a slow pace in order to build the best possible connection. 

Today, the big win. Is finally looking after myself the way I deserve. Purely focused on healing my damaged past, my complete mistrust in pretty much every man, and a checkered past with my body image. I just feel like an elephant has lifted off my chest. There has been other downs in my life also the last year, but these were by far the most lethal and long lasting. If my ex was to read this. All I could say is, I truly hope karma has come back to you - and you’re living the life I think you deserve now. Maybe he will, but I don’t care anymore. 

I. AM. FREE "

133,"I'm a closeted black trans girl (18yrs old) who hasn't come out to anyone but my school counselor and online friends and is about to graduate high school. I genuinely cannot tell if I have undiagnosed ADHD, depression, or something similar.

My thoughts are all over the place, and it's like I have minor mood swings. The only reason I can keep them in check is cause I'm working community service right now, primarily working with disabled and neurodivergent children. The children are my only lifeline from the inescapable depression I have right now. I can't tell if it's normal to go on rants every other day on my private Twitter account about how much I hate the world and hate myself for being such an incompetent piece of crap, why I'm letting everyone around me down, why can't I do more for the shitty state of the world. Years ago, I had anger issues, throwing fits over my classmates not behaving, but now I've pointed that anger on myself and how I shouldn't care about their mistakes and obnoxiousness, even if it'll get us punished.

136,"Does anyone else just feel extremely done with life and having to put effort. I didnt ask to be born and given these responsibilities, they were all just placed onto me unfairly. Im only 17 and mentally im already at rock bottom, nothing feels rewarding, living feels like a chore. As much as ive had fun in my life it still doesnt outweight the amount of absolute toture ""life"" consists of. Im by no means suicidal but if i had a choice between being alive currently and not existing id choose the latter in a heartbeat. Im just lost, i dont see myself ""thugging it out"" for the next few years, let alone 40+ years till i die. I feel like im at the edge of becoming mentally insane and i don't know what to do."
137,"i'm having a really bad time at the moment. i'm trying all the techniques to take my mind off it but it's not helping today. 
i'm so tired of feeling this way. 
hope everyone else is having a better day than me :]"
138,"Mental health is often overlooked by a lot of people and it's not really considered a health problem by the world (which is stupid, I know) for me, it hurts so share my emotional pain because everytime I do, people just dismiss me by saying ""okay"" or ""What the actual hell"" or ""you're too sensitive"" and ""you need to grow a spine"", so basically what they're telling me is that I'm supposed to be numb? Oh, God forbid I feel human emotion. Like I can't control it if I cry easily, I can't help my bodily fluids. No one can, it's out of our control.

I'm also always told to ""just ignore it"" and people tell me ""sticks and stones break your bones but words can't hurt you"" ummm.... then please tell me why there's laws against verbal abuse, discrimination and harassment? Society is stupid and no one realizes the damage any type of neglect or abuse has on people, adolescence especially. 

Also, if you have personal experiences, let me know "
139,So my friend asked me if I wanted to go to his football match on the group chat and I said no. My other 2 friends who were going. 1 of them said that I should feel bad about it and put me down for it. He is a really mean person and is always like this but I can't get away from him because the others are friends with him. Should I feel bad because I didn't go? And what should I do about my mean friend
140,"I’m 35M, married to my amazing wife (29F) for 9 years. We have a beautiful 7-year-old daughter. But here’s the hard truth: I’ve been kind of a monster for most of that time. Not physically or emotionally abusive in the way some might assume—but angry, cold, defensive, and hard to live with. I used to pick fights 5–6 times a week over… well, anything. Especially money.

I’ve always carried the financial weight of the household, and it’s been eating me alive for years. On our wedding day, my dad—who is the root of a lot of my personal baggage—told me, *“Now your job is taking care of her. Have fun.”* That one sentence wrecked me. It stuck like a curse, and I’ve let it rule me ever since… until a few weeks ago.

About 4 weeks back, my wife and I sat down and made a 5-year plan. We mapped out how we’ll tackle our debt, build our savings, and eventually our dream home. Something clicked during that talk. I felt seen. Heard. For the first time in a long time, we were a team again, not just co-parents or roommates passing in the chaos of life.

Since that night, it’s like a switch flipped. I’ve had almost zero stress—despite getting slammed with a surprise x6 water bill and a $500 dental issue. We’ve been building an emergency fund, and I was able to cover both hits and refill the fund at my next paycheck. No spiraling, no panic. Just peace.

I don’t know if this is a midlife crisis, a breakthrough, or what… but I feel lighter. My wife is glowing. Our connection is stronger than it’s been in years. My daughter runs to me again. I’ve stopped clinging to dead conversations and old friendships that only took and never gave. I’ve been letting go of things I used to white-knuckle for no reason.

I do still feel some fear—like maybe I’m letting my guard down too much and setting myself up to get hurt. But I’m also starting to realize that *I’m allowed to be happy*. That I don’t need to live in survival mode all the time.

Looking back, I know I could’ve been kinder. More present. More loving. My wife has always loved me deeply, and somehow she stayed through the worst of me. I thank her every morning and every night for that now.

I know this is kind of a ramble, but I needed to get it out. Has anyone else gone through something similar? A turning point that made you re-evaluate how you were showing up in your relationships and life?

**TL;DR:**  
35M, married 9 years with a 7yo daughter. Spent most of the marriage stressed, angry, and hard to live with due to financial pressure and unresolved trauma. Had a breakthrough 4 weeks ago after making a 5-year financial plan with my wife. Since then, I’ve felt calm, connected, and genuinely happy for the first time in years. Realizing I’m allowed to be happy and let my guard down. Just wondering if others have had a similar turning point in life."
141,"I have always found myself deep down uncomfortable around other people. I can have fun and let loose, but it never lasts too long before my inner dialogue starts critiquing me. I'm not funny enough, I talk over people too much, I talk about myself too much, I didn't say the right thing to someone else, they all dislike me and are just waiting for me to leave, I laughed too obnoxiously just then, I dont wanna be there anymore... ECT. 

I wonder if people truly just let lose and are totally comfortable around someone else without constantly thinking about all the things they are doing wrong and how the other person must hate them. Are we all just constantly second guessing and doubting ourselves? Destined to have that inner dialogue constantly critiquing every little thing we say or do in a social interaction? 

I hate this. "
142,"I've worked out, gained muscle, dieted, lost weight (I want to lose a little more) but I'm simply not the shape I want to be. My face, body is just not right. 
I do know that not all women on social media are real, but it wouldn't hurt to have been blessed even slightly with a bit more curve in the right places, maybe even rounder breasts. I feel like whoever created my body did it as a sick joke. Sometimes I can look in the mirror and think whatever. But god I wish I was slightly more attractive. 
Sometimes I even think im a little bit attractive, and then someone takes a photo of me or I see myself in a changing room mirror or Im stood next to other women and I think oh my fucking god its over. 
I have a boyfriend and honestly I feel sorry for him sometimes. I'm trying my best to not project insecurity, I just wish I was good  looking. I cant do any surgeries, what else can I do? Loose more weight? Fucking pilates? Idk man im so tired. Im not even fat maybe a bit chubby in all the wrong places. I've thought about harming the places I hate but its so silly. Why am I so bothered by what I look like."
143,"I read this somewhere today and it hit hard: ""you never really gave your all in anything because you were afraid that failing even after trying your best would prove you never had that ***potential*** to begin with""  
If any of guys feel that way or have felt that way please take a moment to tell your story...i want to listen to somebody else's voice here instead of my own"
144,Like what are the signs something is wrong with you mentally? How did you know? 
145,"so i’ve been on zoloft for two years now, my psychiatrist kept asking me to go to therapy, which i did recently and the therapist said since there’s no proper indication of what’s causing my depression there isn’t much to work with and she also thinks my depression is biological because i’m doing fine with meds

i don’t wanna take meds anymore, idk why i hate it sm i just wanna give up now i also think i might have bipolar II because ive had mania episodes before taking meds after after meds ive never had them, just depressive episodes sometimes

also have a focusing problem which is so fucking bad, i can’t study and i know that i have an potential and i’m not using it"
146,"i’m 16, 17 later this year. the past two years nothing has went my way including the starting of high school. family life sucks, school life sucks, dating life is nonexistent. nothing has ever went my way. everything also seems to break like my pc and other things i own. even though they’re materialistic, it’s the little things that still play in to me thinking that nothing has ever went my way. i used to be so lively and used to be excited to go to school and to wake up and live another day. now i feel like i put in a shift at the coal mines at the end of the day. it’s horrible and exhausting and feels like a never ending loop of “okay maybe it’s getting a little better” than oops someone in my family dies, or my moms work isn’t going great and we have problems money wise. i just want a win. when will i get a win? when i RARELY find a woman i enjoy talking to she turns out to be a manipulative person who always ends up making fun of me and saying just overall rude things to me by the end of the relationship. i know that im not perfect. but im trying. i’m exhausted. balancing school, my friend group, somehow having to figure out what im going to do with the rest of my life, parents, just everything piled up against me. i’m trying to keep going but it is just getting so hard. who knows what im going to do to myself when im older and alone. i know i dont want to be like this, i want to prove the younger me right who swore to never do any substances after seeing what it did to people around me. but these past few years have taught me why people in my family smoke and drink. life is too stressful.

sorry for this thought dump with no organization at all. im just writing every single thought out at once. i guess the only question(s) i have is, will it get better? is highschool meant to be missed and cherished? everyone says highschool was the best time of their lives and all of my friends love it, me personally, this is the worst time of my life.

147,I know This Sounds unusual but Im 15 and i have this Problem whith whenever i have Have a liking in Something Like a Hobby or a Music Genre that i Like That I get Tired and unintrested in it quickly i have been fighting whith this Problem in my head for many years now i Just cant stay whith one Hobby i Just Stop liking it at one Point because my mind Just Starts Feeling Like that its really really really annoying i Just dont know whats wrong whith me...
148,"There’s a quote that’s been sitting with me lately:  
*“What punishments of God are not gifts?”*

It’s heavy. Maybe even offensive, depending on where you are in your journey. But when I heard it, it didn’t feel cruel. It felt honest. The idea is this: it’s a gift to exist, and with that existence comes suffering. There’s no escaping it. And if you choose to be grateful for your life, which is hard sometimes but still a worthy goal, then that gratitude has to include all of it—not just the good parts, but the painful ones too.

It’s made me wonder. If life was good all the time, would it even feel good? If you never experienced the lows, would the highs really be highs? Or would they just be... normal? Flat? I think it’s the contrast that gives things meaning. The fact that things can fall apart is what makes it so powerful when they come together.

I went through something early in life that I wish hadn’t happened. Something I wouldn’t wish on anyone. But I’ve slowly learned to live with it. Not by pretending it was okay, but by acknowledging how it shaped me. It gave me a lens. So now, when I’m in relationships—whether with my partner, my friends, or my family—I try to see people. I mean really see them. Their pain. Their silence. Their defense mechanisms. Because I know what it’s like to carry something and feel like no one sees it.

We’re all suffering in our own way. And when you understand that, not just intellectually but deeply, it changes how you show up for people. You start loving more honestly. Less performatively. You become less afraid to sit with someone in their pain, because you’ve sat in your own.

I’m not saying suffering is good. I’m saying that if it’s part of life, and it is, then maybe the way through it is to stop resisting it so hard. Maybe the better path is to use it as a bridge. To connect. To grow. To love more deeply.

Anyway, just wanted to share this in case someone else out there is struggling to make peace with their story. You’re not alone."
149,"I woke up today feeling so overwhelmed with the worst kind of emotions. I rather feel like I'm trying to find excuses to avoid the blame on myself for being so unproductive lately and wasting my opportunities. I need someone to help me understand whats wrong with me. I've grown a really bad habit of pushing myself into the toxic spiral over and over again and I'm unable to work on myself. Been feeling a bit too soulless lately. I've never felt this low for like more than 3yrs now.
I'm kinda giving up rn, feels like there shouldn't have been the few people that care about me. I can't ruin other's life with a selfish decision. so ending it isnt an option. I've been the same phase for years but I was just avoiding it and refused to acknowledge my problems until everything feels like falling apart.

I'm up for any kind of talks, whether its psychology, music, binge watching movies or tv series or just life or past events and fun or not fun memories. I like spending my time engaging myself with interactions and listening to others.

I've adhd and i go through maladaptive daydreaming, if youve some experience with it, that would help. but doesn't matter if you dont. just small things help me a lot, I'd love to hear from anyone.

I feel like I've never been understood (maybe I haven't let many people near me)."
150,"Hello everyone, and thank you for your time. I hope you’re all doing okay.

I’m from England and living in a town near London. I’m posting on here to ask for some advice. I’m currently going through a mental health crisis to sue some health issues that have been happening for the past 2 1/2 years. Ensure, I have continuing hearing loss and it is getting worse rapidly lately, I’m experiencing burning in my air canal and across my face when I’m around smells or cooking food and I get head pressure and dizziness at times. I’ve been going to so many ENT’s and audiology appointments, but at this point, I’m scared of going deaf and I am afraid of my future and having dark thoughts. I’ve called the mental health crisis team in my area an hour and a half ago and they told me that someone would call back but as of now, no one has called back. I know the services are busy and I don’t know how long it will take for the court to happen. I am due to go to work tonight and tomorrow night as I work at a care home Night Shift and wondering whether it is worth calling in now to say I shouldn’t be coming in tonight due to the fact that I am so emotionally unstable and many things are going onto the point where I don’t think I can function as a normal human being. I need advice as to whether this is okay and whether I won’t receive any drawbacks or consequences from cancelling my shift like that. I really look forward to any advice and grateful for any advice you can give. I’m really Sorry I’m having so many things in my head happen and emotionally all over the place. Thank you once again in advance.🙏🙏"
151,"Delayed success is completely fine. perhaps, you were pressured by success itself. also by your friends' successful journey, by your parents' words, or by just the other people who are very close to their dreams.

but life is not a race. if you failed today, you can still come back the next time you're ready. so, don't pressure yourself. it is okay to be late than to give up, and proving yourself that you're better but ended up failing. make those as your inspiration and just keep on fighting. you can make it. BETTER LATE THAN NEVER!

you should be proud of yourself for still fighting and continuing. because eventually, you'll still have your winning time and moment.

152,"
I’m 21(F), in my final year of architecture, diagnosed with GAD and social anxiety, and have been on 40mg Prozac for the past two months. I’ve noticed some changes since my dose increased, but I’m not sure how to bring this up to my doctor tomorrow.

I used to overthink everything, but now it feels like I’ve lost my ability to assess situations properly. Anxiety used to hold me back, but it also forced me to consider the consequences of my actions. Now, I sometimes make impulsive decisions, regret them, promise myself I won’t repeat the mistake, and then fall into the similar cycle a few weeks later.

For instance, on the day of a major presentation, I took Xanax, my Prozac, and then had alcohol. This led to me climbing rocks with a classmate, getting a bit too close, and eventually slipping, cutting my hand. I even woke up that night in a panic, texted the guy the next morning to cut things off, and spent the entire day crying, only to brush it off as me “overreacting” the next day. I keep falling into this pattern, and it’s exhausting.

I also had a similar episode where I mixed Prozac, a quarter Xanax, and a painkiller (Paracetamol ) just to sleep, without really thinking about the potential consequences. My stomach was a mess the next day, and I promised myself I wouldn’t do it again, but here we are.

I feel trapped in this cycle, seeking validation from friends or the internet because I can’t fully trust myself. I can’t open up to my family without feeling judged, and while my friends try to support me, they aren’t my therapists, and I don’t want to burden them. The only person I felt comfortable talking to turned out to have feelings for me, which only added to the mess and caused the cliff incident. 

I’m worried that these impulsive actions might be tied to my medication, and I don’t want to stay stuck in this loop. If anyone has been through something similar or has advice on how to explain this to my doctor, I’d appreciate it."
153,"So I've lived with depression since I was a child. I've been on the okay side for a few yrs thanks to medication but the last few months I've been feeling off. Not my old full blown need to check myself in for new grippy socks but my whole body feels off. I constantly have brain fog, I sometimes feel dumb and disconnected when ppl are trying to talk to me. I can't stand for longer then 45mins without feeling like I'm going to pass out or faint and even doing maybe 10mins of cardio I feel that as well. I randomly get feverish. And while I want to just chalk these things up to my diabetes and autoimmune disorder the brain fog and disconnected feeling is new. It's also getting harder to do my job which is in-home care to the elderly. 

I don't know what to do."
154,"What should I do if I hate my mom?
I love my mom very much, but at the same time, I can’t help but feel annoyed by her.
She constantly swears—like, seriously bad words—and treats those harsh curses like they’re just normal everyday talk.
I really dislike people who use such filthy language, but at home, I have to endure it all the time, which makes me feel irritated the moment she speaks.
Her emotions are unstable too. She can suddenly blow up over the tiniest things, shouting and blaming others wildly, then the next second, act like nothing happened and talk to me as if everything’s fine. I just can’t stand that.
She always tries to control me. For example, if I don’t answer her calls within an hour, she’ll contact everyone she knows to find me—and when she finally reaches me, she scolds me no matter what, even if I just overslept and missed the call.
She’s scared of airplane accidents and won’t let me fly. She’s afraid of any danger and forbids me from traveling with friends.
Every time I want to go on a trip, we end up having huge fights about this before I can leave, and even during the trip, she demands constant updates from me. It completely disrupts my normal life.
But her health isn’t great, and she often says things like, “I’m like this because you scared me,” which makes me feel really guilty.
She also keeps putting down my friends, badmouthing them, and even though I’ve seriously told her I hate that, she still won’t change.
I hate feeling this way about my mom, but I also feel guilty about it.
What should I do?"
155,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 23-year-old guy from France, and I wanted to share a bit of my story and ask a couple of questions.

I was diagnosed with BPD and anxiety-depressive disorder around 16–17 years old. I was having a weekly appointment with my therapist and I was on Paroxetine and Seresta back then, and honestly, it helped a lot. At some point, I felt so much better that I decided to stop the meds and therapy on my own. The withdrawal hit me hard—three days of being unable to stand up because of migraines—but eventually, things smoothed out, and I started enjoying life again.

Fast forward to now, I’m feeling like some of those old feelings are creeping back. My doctor prescribed me Xanax, but I’m hesitant to take it. Not sure if I really need it or if there’s another way.

Here’s what I’m wondering:
1.	Is it possible that I was actually “cured” from BPD/anxiety-depressive disorder? Or do these things always come back in waves? It is possible that I developed something else ? 
2.	I’d prefer not to go back on medication, but I can’t afford therapy anymore. In the meantime, does anyone know good ChatGPT prompts I can use to sort of guide myself through things like a DIY therapist?

Thanks a lot !! 

:)

156,"So the other day i watched a youtube video about a website with disgusting people, and unfortunately, the channel owner linked that website. Even tho he clearly said you shouldnt visit that site. So what did my underage brain do? Go to that website. After scrolling through suddenly a horrifieng video where unspeakable things were done to a cat popped up and as soon as it did i immediatly closed it. What will happen to my brain? Will i recover?"
157,"So I start with when I was a kid.
The only way I have ever functioned well in productively studying was with external accountability of my teacher till I was 15, not because I was scared of them, but because I did not want to disappoint them. I respected and loved them, so that's how I worked. due to that accountability I found joy in my work too, my curiosity and everything. I actually loved it. that was over once I entered the realm of competitive exams at 16, and it was like, if I study, if I win, if I study to win, then someone else loses, and I don't want to take anything, snatch anything from anyone, you know. I had pity for them, and mposter syndrome so I had no motivation to study in a win-lose scenario. i studied still but couldn't find any joy in it. And I could not find a reason to study. Like, I know love should be center of all things. But how can you love your work? Like, I don't know how can so anyone love to study, you know, in a way. Like, I do love to study when I am studying, but that is not a factor enough to get me to start studying. Like, I have been used to that external accountability, not by force, but by respect and love. And I can't do that. When I think about that, love should be center, it should focus you to study, but you should love yourself enough for that. But I love nature, I love the stars, I love the trees, but I have no love for myself. Because I have no love for myself, I have no love for others too that can motivate to study. Seems like whenever I look inside, that my heart is a white orb of light, but it is surrounded only by darkness. And it has no love to offer or share, even for itself. 
this has been building up within me for the past 2 almost 3 years now and I don't know what is wrong with me
can't talk to my friends as I presume they won't understand 
P.S Now it is at a point where I have started talking in poetry and it is not a good sign as far as my peace of mind is concerned 
P.P.S I have ADHD "
158,"Last year, because my friends got into fights so often, I think I unconciously shut off the part of my brain that feels sympathy to protect myself from how much it hurt.

Now, whenever they're sad or angry I just don't feel that much for them. I still feel empathy, I get that they're upset, and I do help them because I do still care for them and want them to be happy, however I'm just not there emotionally. It's the same like that for other things too, like movies, books, real world events, ...

It's not always, just most of the time.

I'm not sure what to do about it, or if I even want to do something about it. Sympathy just hurts so much, but it feels wrong to not have it, like there's an important piece of me missing. Has anyone else expierienced this? Any idea what's going on or what to do?"
159,"(Tw!!) So like ive been in therapy for a year, what my therapist thinks is that im doing fine and that i have have a history w sh and that i have social anxiety. And um honestly that aint true im doing rly bad rn but im scared to tell her the truth bcz ive been lying to her for so long and i also dont wanna end up in a mental hospital . Also, my school is for ""gifted kids"", and if i get sent to a mental hospital they'll provide kick me out and i dont want that to happen. BUT, if i keep lying and dont get help i might die or smth. Um send advice chat 😀"
160,"I'm not sure if this sub is the one I could post this one at, but...

Okay, getting to the topic I should tell one thing:

My stepfather jerked off to (the minor)me while I was (as he thought)sleeping. 

For some reason I haven't felt any more intense things than a small confusion, but I woken up immediately; I've got a lot of questions. I kept thinking about it the whole day before I decided to report about it to my mother and the next day to my biological father; and it shocked both of them.

I'm not a kind of a person that feels fragile towards sexual topics or anything like that and I just couldn't and still not able to find this situation highly traumatising or disturbing, and that's what I'm worried about.

My father keeps yelling to my mother so she would sue stepfather, while she is barely recovers from this information and visits a psychiatrist.

I've heard a lot that such situations should be heavily traumatizting though it's totally not the worst thing to happen at all. But I can't help but get uncomfortable and confused why I reacted to the whole situation a lot calmer than anyone else would and the only thing that creeps me out is the way how much my parents are reacting to this. I keep thinking about it for around a week and I'm not sure what to feel"
161,"Hi everyone! I work for a company that provides operational and administrative remote staffing to doctors and dentists across the US.

We’re launching a new webinar series, and for May—Mental Health Awareness Month—we’re kicking things off with two special fireside chats focused on the emotional and mental well-being of healthcare professionals. We’ll be hosting two separate panel-style sessions—one for doctors and one for dentists—and we’re currently looking for speakers for both.

Themes we’ll explore include:

- Managing stress and burnout in clinical settings

- Finding work-life balance in a demanding profession

- How remote support can ease the load and help clinics run more efficiently


If you're a doctor, dentist, or healthcare professional with thoughts or stories to share, we’d love to have you on the panel. Please note no slides or prep work is required as its more of a honest chat among colleagues and peers. Drop a comment or DM if you're interested or want to learn more!

164,"Hello all, I'm having a lot of trouble finding enough determination to finish working on a video, as I consistently look really tired/sad, unexpressive, and conventionally unattractive throughout the bits with my face in it. The main idea of the video requires me to show my face, and I can't bring myself to continue getting footage out of fear of the inevitable judgment I'll receive. I feel really weak.  
  
I began transitioning (MtF) recently and I want to use my feminine voice throughout the videos I make. It doesn't pass, and I'm worried people won't enjoy what I make because of that. I feel extremely dysphoric looking at my face paired with the work-in-progress voice I have, and I feel like showing my face and voice will end up polarizing my audience or hurting the videos' quality. I have no idea what to do, especially since I want to take video editing/creation more seriously and make funny videos.  
  
Showing my face and voice is the brave/inspiring thing to do, but I feel like I'm stuck in a lose-lose situation and I don't know what to do. I either share my face and trans voice and people don't enjoy the videos as much, or I hide it out of fear and miss out on ideas I want to pursue.  
  
How do I stop being sad and weak about it so I can just show my face and voice in the videos I make? Will it really turn a ton of people away?"

Please tell me how can I help myself "
166,"So, I don't use reddit very often but at this point I have nowhere else to go. I'm not asking for a diagnosis or anything, but just to maybe tell me if this is normal or not. So, short story, I had a great day -- bought some books, explored the city, went and bought some coffee -- a success in my eyes, seeing as I have mild social anxiety at times. I thought I'd call my dad and tell him all about it, you see, he has a tendency to either answer very happily or very angry. We're going to be talking about his sour attitude today. And I also want to stress that this is cyclical, not just a one-time occurrence, my sister who's 16 years my senior, told me the same thing has been happening even before I was born so there's that. My dad has this ability to, whenever he's in a sour mood (which is often) to infect everyone, the whole house and even me, someone who lives 5 hours away from home, with this sour mood. Sometimes he doesn't even say anything, there's no explosion of curses or grievances, no, he just sits on his armchair and stews in his anger, which makes everyone around him walk on eggshells and be tense overall, just making sure not to make him explode. He has never been physically abusive or anything like that, but he has this way with words to make you feel so small and so worthless at times. Some words he uttered to me years ago, when I was in middle school still sit with me. And so back to the original story, I called my dad which was already in a bad mood but I didn't know it, it's harder to recognize it through a phonecall, so I told him to speak louder cause I can't hear what he's saying to which he exploded asking me why I'm bothering him and then an amalgamation of curses in my direction. My mood shifted instantly, I began feeling like a burden all over again, a nuisance, which has been an issue of mine since middle school, which I've only now have been fighting with (and I think it has a lot to do with the fact I'm away from my family). I don't know, but I just wanted to ask is it normal for people to have this ability to completely 180 your day even through a phonecall? To have a person in your life which poisons the whole energy/atmosphere in the house every time they have a bad mood for the smallest reasons? This might seem infantile, but at this point, I'm questioning whether I'm going crazy or am i being too sensitive.   

If any additional info is needed to understand the situation i can add it, but i wanted to make this as brief as possible."
167,"I always feel so numb to everything, like I'm not really there. It's just so frustrating. I can't experience things to the same degree that others do. I sometimes wonder what would happen if I just disappeared. Would anyone try to find me? I don't really feel like anyone would notice.

My parents are always on about my grades. I'm getting As and Bs in all my subjects at school, but they say if I don't get perfect grades or try my absolute hardest, I'll never succeed in life. They go on and on about me becoming a doctor, but I don't even know if I want to do that anymore. It feels like I have to put on a mask when I'm around them. I can't really be myself around them or anyone.

I was always a gifted child growing up, but as I've gotten older, I’ve just lost all motivation and willpower to keep going. Whenever I try to defend myself by pointing out that I'm still getting great grades, they always bring up how they used to be better, or how I never used to turn in assignments late or not at all.

Sometimes I just break down in my room and feel so awful. I hate the idea of my younger siblings hearing that, but my parents don't do anything about it. Sometimes I break down in front of them, sobbing on the ground, and they just act like nothing is happening. They don’t really try to do anything about it.

I need to walk out of classes all the time because I just can't deal with everything. I usually just tell the teacher I need to go to the bathroom. I don’t even think most of my friends actually like me. I'm kind of just a background character, not really there. I know a lot of people, but I don’t think they'd go out of their way to invite me to anything.

Even when I go on trips with my friends, it doesn't really register that I'm away somewhere. I kind of just move with the crowd, like I'm just floating through it all without really being part of it. It’s like I’m physically there but not mentally present.

I feel like I have to put on a different personality when I’m around different groups of people. It feels like I’ve been doing that my entire life, and at this point, I just feel like a hollow shell. I have really random panic attacks over the most minor things, and I just feel trapped in my life.

Sometimes my dad says he'll take me somewhere, but then tells me that if I don't do this one thing, something he never even asked me to do, he won't take me and then acts like it’s all my fault.

The thing is, I feel like I don’t even have the right to feel the way I do, Both of my parents are doctors, and they support us financially in every way and I have had great experiences growing up. But I just don’t feel right.

anyways sorry for like a random dump, I just felt like I needed to say something, bye divas hope yall have had a great day xx

p.s. I'm not diagnosed with anything ( I have never been to therapy 😋) so I'm not like unstable I just needed a vent"
168,"I have Panic anxiety disorder, Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Chronic Depression and today I am feeling like a hollowed out shell. Ever since I my recent therapy treatment ( I am undergoing something called EMDR ) I haven't felt right at all. I've been through this treatment hundreds of times at this point, but this time it was diffierent. Like, something had been removed. 

I was crying but I didn't know why. I was warned by my therapist that I'm going to be off and let her know of anything out of the ordinary with me. This morning, I was in a discord group ( I have had issues with some of them and I had debated on leaving the group in the past with the discord moderator. 

When I first joined the group, I made a mistake as I was new and didn't really know anything yet. That was before I began to have problems with some of the group members, where one of them created a mob mentality scenario and were just being cruel. 

If I remember correctly, the moderator convinced me to not leave at all but had both me and the guy block each other as it was apparent that we weren't getting along. The guy was breaking a shit ton of rules but would complain when someone else tried to do the same thing.

This morning I had those same feelings of alienation, and rage making me want to leave again. They were faint memories, but still just as strong. A part of me knows that those feeling are from the side effects of the EMDR treatment, making old memories feel like they just happened. 

I am sorry if this is a long post, I am just not feeling like myself and I need to talk to someone... Anyone really to get myself back on track..."
169,"It happens everytime there's a specific situation going on [don't want to give details.]
I can't really move / speak, my body gets really cold, trembling and my hands are clammy. My mind feels blank in a weird way, like nothing around me is real and there aren't many thoughts, just the same few ones repeating. It lasts about 20 - 40 minutes, after which I usually cry to calm down. It's a pattern with the situation. What's going on and why can't it stop more quickly?"

172,"I’ve posted scout this before… I’m almost 27, living at home, making less than half a living wage at a job I love, but is probably a dead end. Never had a boyfriend. Doesn’t have many friends. Doesn’t get out much. Still trying to finish college. I never really had a life even when I was young, didn’t get our much. I don’t have memories or experiences and I don’t know who I want to be or what I want to do. It doesn’t feel like im worth fixing even if it were possible, and for many years I’ve had this horrific anxiety about aging and getting older before I can gain those experiences everyone else had when we were all teenagers. 

I’m not only terrified of getting older and staying a loser, but also watching the people I love get older. All I have right now are my parents. I need them and nobody else gives a shit about me… if something were to happen to them, there’s nobody in this world who would know me or know that I exist. This crisis has gotten exposed worse after I turned 25. "

176,"I've been waiting for 4,954 days, still feeling like something's missing in my heart. January 14th has been such a long day, and I don't even know how much I hate myself anymore. It's crazy how I keep falling for this shit again. Bro, I'm so stupid to think I could ever have that. Obviously, I can't—I'm just too annoying.
I wonder how I'd feel if things had never changed. Before I even realized it, it started to hurt more to hear people say, ""It's going to be different,"" when it's clearly never going to be. I feel like I've never truly been happy with others. I try to hang out with people because my parents want me to, but I don't think they understand that I have no one.
Bro, I literally beg people to hang out with me because I'm lonely, but it just ends up making me feel worse. Why do I keep striving to have people in my life who don't care about me? It's weird to think about because she was the only person who cared. Honestly, I can't even remember the last time someone texted me wanting to hang out.
To keep it real, it's been like five years. I've been hated my whole life, and the one person who cared eventually lost feelings. So, it doesn't even matter. If people are always going to lose feelings, then what's the point of life?
Everything is temporary, then what's the point of something? I have a feeling the only thing that lasts with you forever is the stuff you don't want to last forever —the hate, the jealousy for people who have that kind of happiness. What's the point?

178,"I don't really understand what's going on or if there is anything. here's some background info, I'm diagnosed adhd and asd. I'm 17, I was bullied for 5 years straight and put in therapy for a small amount of time for it.

when I'm alone I never actually feel alone, I always feel like there's something behind me or around a corner in my house or something. I feel like I'm about to be attacked, typically this is when I'm home alone moving around my house cleaning. I also feel like I see stuff, a shadow of a figure in the light coming through a door move or I hear the catflap go off when there's no cat there. 

another thing is I feel like there is a second version of myself in my mind, I don't know if this sounds fake or stupid or I'm making it up, I promise I'm not. I feel like there is an unhinged version of myself in my mind sometimes, in the past I have had loads of thoughts about harming/killing people but ive never acted on them. they're graphic, I don't get grossed our by gore at all but I get disgusted in myself for thinking about hurting people.

Hi, I’m a 19 y/o girl who survived an attempt. My attempt led me to spend about 1 year hospitalized, including 2 months in ICU in a coma, so it was a pretty serious matter. My parents did stay by my side during the whole process, they stayed in hospital with me, they were right by my side during rehab, etc. Unfortunately I can’t ask this directly to them because they (understandably) refuse to talk in any way about my “accident”, as they call it, but I’d like to put myself in their shoes and try to see things from their perspective: what did you think when you discovered about your child’s attempt? Where you mad or angry at them for giving you that pain to deal with? Did you ever think that the child was a burden, because after the attempt they had much more needs? Don’t be afraid to be brutally honest"

Putting this question is this thread because he suffers from depression in conjuction with all of these things. Curious what other people might do for work. His parents wont live forever to support him "
181,"I'm a 21-year-old female who has been experiencing what I believe are mood swings since I was 13. These aren't just minor fluctuations—they're extreme. Some days I feel incredibly good, active, and happy—like I could cry from joy. Other days, I can't imagine growing older and wouldn't mind not waking up at all, accompanied by a pressure-like feeling in my chest.

The pattern is unpredictable. Sometimes it switches daily, sometimes I feel one way for weeks, sometimes 4 months good followed by 1 month bad, sometimes 4 weeks bad with just 1 good week scattered in between.

I'm also a daydreamer—sometimes diving so deep into daydreams that I experience genuine emotions, crying hard or falling asleep feeling happy. I struggle with short-term memory; I can't remember many things from years ago or even conversations from just a week ago. It's like I experience a ""fog"" in my head.

Sometimes I wonder if I might have some kind of cognitive limitation. I'm socially awkward and find it difficult to communicate with people, even though I crave social contact. The best way I can describe my thought process is like this:

There's something I'm trying to understand or reach (let's call it a conclusion), but I can't see it directly. It's like there's a mental block or blind spot. Other people can see this conclusion clearly, but for me, it's invisible. I know something is there, but I just can't perceive it. This creates a sort of short-circuit in my thinking, causing me to end up with completely different thoughts or conclusions than others. Only with someone else's help can I finally ""see"" what was there all along. Once I see it, it seems so obvious, but I genuinely couldn't perceive it on my own.

I've also noticed I'm extremely sensitive. Words can determine my entire mood. One gentle word makes me happy, while a single criticism—even if it's not personal—can deeply affect me.

I've registered for mental health services, but the waiting time is six months. I only decided to seek help at age 21 because last month, I had an impulsive action about ending my life while driving, which terrified me. Fortunately, nothing happened, but it resulted in a crash of emotions I'd never experienced before—sadness mixed with aggression, followed by happiness an hour later. This sudden and intense emotional swing scared me enough to finally seek help.

Has anyone experienced something similar or have any advice while I wait for professional help?"
182,"I mean, how can anyone stand me if I sound like this? I don't sound like a woman, I sound... awkward. I don't have the feminine voice I wish I could have. It's a little bit on the deeper side. It sounds GENDERLESS, ugly. 

Doesn't help that, half the time, I trip up over words really badly and slur my words. Like I'll say (ironically) ""I'm slrrn ma words rinnow."" ""Lerrite down that"" (instead of let me write that down) - that's an actual thing I said to use as an example. I'll say ""remember"" as ""rmmbr."" Pretty much any sentence I say, I mess up, and I constantly have to re-pronounce words because I skew or slur them so badly.

Imagine me ever having a boyfriend? LOL. There's NO way a guy would ever want to hear THIS woman speaking."
183,"This is one of those silly insignificant things that happened years ago that nobody remembers, and that randomly come up in your brain, except this one is not embarassing but comforting.

One time during a theater lesson, the group was sitting in a circle listening to our instructor. I arrived late and sat outside the circle because I didn't want to interrupt, and the girl whom I sat behind moved and made room for me. That's it. For some reason, my brain finds this worth remembering from time to time.

I'm probabily so used to the opposite happening (being pushed out of the circle) that it's weird when things go differently.

I'm not complaining about being left out - this is a positive journal entry. I find it amusing that I remember that, and the possibility that someone may remember that time you held the door open for them."
184," I found this number a little while ago. When you call it, you don’t talk to anyone—there’s just a calm voice that leaves you with something gentle to hold onto.

I didn’t think it would do much at first. But it’s become part of how I reset when things start to spin.

The messages change a few times a week, and somehow they always say just enough without saying too much.

It’s hard to explain, but hearing a voice that expects nothing from me... that helps.

Anyway, I figured I’d share in case anyone else might need something like that. Quiet support. Nothing complicated."
185,"Hi Guys,

I do not usually post here or participate in discussions but I feel like there is no one else I can tell what I am about to, so I might as well tell some strangers.  Think what you will of the following, at this point I just want to let it all out cause it feels like I am falling apart.

Through my life I have gone through many challenges to do with my health and gone through a lot of physical and mental pain and hardships. I went through a heart surgery fully conscious and walked out of the operating room on my own too feet, my back gave out on me so hard i was stuck on bed for 3 months and over the last 8 months I've regained most of my mobility and yet nothing has brought me as much pain or grief as this love I feel for a girl that I know will never look at me as more than a friend.

We met by chance almost 10 years ago and became good friends and at some point I fell in love with her, back then I was young and she is 9 years younger than me, so I kept quiet until she found a boyfriend even older than me which was really bad news in my mind but I kept quiet because I wanted to be good friend. After some time passed I started drifting away from her and just went silent because my heart was tearing apart from grief that I missed my chance but I was able to get through that. 

About 3 years ago she tried to reconnect with me but after a few conversations I went into ghost mode again because I was still overwhelmed from a particularly bad episode where I almost died from anaphylactic shock.

A year ago she got in touch again, we started talking, doing stuff together and even share some things other people don't know about each of us, so we grew very close. We even sat down and discussed some of what happened years back and it turned out that she went through an awful period of her life shortly after I cut ties, I blame myself cause I knew the guy was bad news and I told her I am partly responsible for that, to which she responded with forgiveness, so we kept on being close friends.

 Two months ago I realized that I fell in love with her all over again. This time though she has a boyfriend (a damn good one too) that loves her and that she loves very much. I've decided instead of ghosting her I will remain her friend and endure however much pain I feel from that fact that I do not love her only as a friend but as a romantic interest and that she will probably never return my feelings or if I am lucky even find out about them in the first place.

At the time I took the decision I thought that I will take on all of the pain and endure it alone rather then chance to tell her and potentially ruin her happiness and relationship. I still think the same writing this today but after enduring this pain for the past 2 months all I can say is, damn it really hurts and the grief I feel, feels like it is insurmountable. Every time I am reminded of the fact how much she loves her boyfriend it feels like my heart has been stabbed by 100 knifes that are being simultaneously twisted in different directions. I've never before felt pain and grief this intense, to the point where it's starting to affect my mental wellbeing and work.

I know what most of you will tell me, to just cut ties, ghost her again or talk to her about it but you should already know I will not listen to you. I will either learn how to live with this pain or perish trying.

Thank you for listening to my story, regardless of your opinions."
186,So I (19F) have recently in the past couple months been diagnosed with fairly severe anxiety and depression. While I am now medicated for it and my partner says I seem to be doing a lot better than I used to I still have a really bad tendency to spiral whenever I think I’ve done something wrong or if I feel like I’ve made someone I like upset. It’s not a huge spiral anymore since I’ve gotten good enough at hiding it since I’ve been dealing with spiraling for so long but it sucks cause I don’t know how to manage it anymore than I already do. My partner recently told me that he feels like he’s walking on a wire sometimes when he wants to tell me something that bothers him cause I’m so sensitive and he knows I’ll get in my head about it and I absolutely hate that. I never want him to feel like I he has to be super careful with his words when he talks about his feelings and I wanted to know if anyone maybe had any advice on how to be less sensitive and be able to take helpful criticism without feeling like the world is ending and I’m not worth anything. I’ve been trying to better my mental health for a long time and while I’ve come very very far from what it used to be this is a hurdle I haven’t been able to figure out and work though no matter how hard I’ve tried. Any advice would be greatly appreciated even if it’s something small
187,"After 6 years of saying no to going to do stuff, sacrificing meals, picking up extra shifts and after work jobs, selling things to make ends meet, barely scraping by at times etc my car is finally paid off.

188,"hey guys, first let me give you a bit of backstory. i've always been strange since i was a kid — never happy, never satisfied. i started harming myself at 13. by 14/15, i was already depressed and went all in. i took a kitchen knife and kept stabbing my wrist. (the scars made me wear long sleeve tops until my early 20s. i still have them in my 30s, but now i don't care.)

i had a few more unsuccessful attempts — from a tree branch breaking to my wardrobe breaking. honestly, i've been unsuccessful for 15 years. my last serious attempt was at 25. that time, i was ready. it was supposed to be the end. halfway through, bleeding out in the bath, i picked up my phone and called my friend. ended up in the psych ward for 48 hours. and that was it.

i was on antidepressants for 2-3 years, and they ruined me. i tried therapy. i ran an ultramarathon, a few marathons. i've done sports all my life. i even joined the military in my mid-20s for 2-3 years just to prove to myself that i'm a man. and here i am now, in my early 30s, just so sick and tired of the constant fight. it’s like having a flu that never goes away. it’s become so chronic my mind just can’t focus anymore.

i'm not a weak person, but my brain is just completely gone. i’ve lost all hope. i’m not sad 24/7, but i’ve never been fully happy either. it’s eating me from the inside because i’ve been fighting this alone since i was a kid. and honestly — i just wanna die. i really do. for a long time, i waited and waited, but it’s been almost 20 years now, guys. c'mon… depression doesn’t last 20 years, right? i went from having nothing to becoming a business owner. i changed countries 3 times. i've lived alone since i was 18. i eat lunch alone, go to the cinema alone. i’ve done every single thing they tell you to do to “find peace and happiness” — from groups to solo hikes, solo trips to family holidays, trips with friends, everything. but i just can't do it anymore. i really can't."
189,"Okay so not literally but.

As I was about to go to sleep when i closed my eyes, I suddenly started seeinf all kinds of religious symbols and then images of Jesus. Not like in a hallucinatory way but it was sudden and couldn't control it..

I got a little paranoid because i thought i could die?? And this was a sign from God... And then he internally started speaking to me. He was calling me his child and how I've done good and death is a beautiful experience and I'm ready to go to heaven... Yeah basically told me i was gonna die.

Yeah so i was SCARED but brushed it off. And then i was so out of it. Suddenly the walls started breathing, the room looked like it was falling down, everything was shaking, i was shaking. When i closed my eyes i saw the light aka heaven?

So uhm... What is that?? Not the first time this has happened but it has never happened with Jesus before. "
190,"I am beyond saving.

I have wandered through different versions of existence, convinced that something out there—some place, some moment, some person—will make everything click. I have rearranged my surroundings, thrown myself into new routines, and fed myself distractions that promise comfort. But nothing truly changes. I still return to the same place, the same suffocating stillness that lingers inside me, untouched by all my efforts to drown it out.  

I am here, but I don’t know what it means to be here. I move through days in a state that barely qualifies as living. I tell myself I am trying—I give myself good things, I attempt to start anew, I clean my space in hopes that a fresh environment will untangle something deep inside me. I have given myself reasons to be okay, yet I remain unchanged. Maybe I have been lying to myself, disguising distractions as solutions. Maybe this emptiness isn't something that can be fixed, only carried.  

Some say I may have lost my purpose, that I have become emotionally numb, or that I am disconnected from myself. And maybe they’re right. I used to believe my purpose was clear—love, career, self improvement—but even in chasing those things, I find myself detached. Nothing lands, nothing resonates. I move toward my goals, but my mind is distant, watching from behind some invisible barrier. No matter how much I try to feel, something in me refuses to stir.  

I keep waiting—waiting for a sign, for clarity, for a sudden spark of realization that will finally make sense of it all. But time drags on, indifferent to my search, and I am left only with the absence of an answer. Nothing arrives. Nothing saves me. I am the same.  

There is a heaviness in knowing that I have done everything I could, yet none of it has made a difference. I wanted love to fill the void, but it didn’t. I wanted movement to shake me awake, but I remain dull. I wanted new surroundings to make me feel reborn, but wherever I go, I carry the same ghost of myself.  

I am just here. Existing without meaning, without direction. Not in agony, but not at peace. Not broken, but not whole. There is no resolution, only the quiet understanding that this is how it is. I am beyond saving."
191,"I just self-harmed, I’ve had attempts at it before but I never had anything come out of it, but in school today I just scratched the skin off a portion of my hand.

I didn't see her for a whole year because I was bed ridden sick and almost died. She never texted once and she knew. Recently I saw her and we started texting again and I'm getting butterflies.

194,"My pet hamster passed yesterday. For the longest time she was the only reason I got out of bed every day because I had to take care of her. Also when I first got her it was because I was suffering from really bad sleep paralysis every single night, it was only till she arrived that I could start actually sleeping again. Now that she’s gone I can’t stand sleeping again because I get reminded I’m the only living thing inside the room (I live alone). The only way I’m coping right now is to not think about it and just do nothing. Time used to pass so fast before but now it’s going by so slow. I don’t know what I’m doing. She did live up to 2years and nearly 3 months, and started showing signs of age a month ago. Despite mentally preparing for it for a month I still can’t accept it. I know she’s “just a pet” but she was my only attachment here. I don’t speak to anyone/hate speaking to others, left my social life to rot. The only company I had was her"
195,"Hi. I (21M) have been bottling things up my whole life and have tried to learn how to let go, forgive others, forgive myself, open up etc. but I feel like I'm getting no where. I really have tried please believe me, i hate feeling like this haha. I think a year ago, i decided/accepted that maybe if i bottle it up long enough, eventually it'll push me to the edge to end it all and that option didn't seem so bad. I started letting myself go and drinking and smoking lots to accelerate the process of pushing myself to the edge and get the resolve to end it all. But this approach has proven to backfire as things will just explode in my head at the worse time, mostly when I'm at work and I'll get emotional. I've suppressed things so much I think I may actually have memory loss as I can't seem to remember much anymore like work related stuff and this only came to my attention as my coworkers get upset when I can't remember things from ytd or the week before etc. but funnily enuf, memories from years ago will come up out of nowhere at the worse time n make me emotional. Therapy isnt an option for me as I am too broke haha (working 2 jobs rn while in uni and paying rent in a share house).

196,Does anyone else feel like they are barely a step above needing inpatient treatment or nahhh?? 
197,These are some good supplements to take for depression.
198,"I love people. But only if they do what I want. I can't form a natural connection with people. I can't care when my friends or partners leave me. I can't care when they say how cold I'm to them. I can't care when they get sad. I can't love people unconditionally. 

I had pet fishes when I was a child. One day they died out of sickness and while my sister who had nothing to do with them cried and buried them. I literally felt nothing. 

Then my parents got me a pet bird. I didn't took care of it (I was a child) and it died again. I didn't cared. 

I don't have anyone I miss. It's not that I can get over them. But that I couldn't care about them at first. I don't have anyone I can think of if that I ever cared for. 

I don't wanna be like this because it makes me feel lonely. I don't know if it's something I can change too. It's basically emotions and people say they are not to control but to accept. "
199,"OH MY LORD, ok.

the last time i posted here, i believed my online boyfriend had made an attempt on his life, and i have not had any contact from him for around 12 days. I fully believed he was gone. Today I open twitter, and its him dming me from his dads phone. He was hospitalized after his attempt, and doesn't have his phone yet. but I am just so happy he is alive. Thank you to all of you who reached out to me after my last post, you kept my hopes high, and kept me from doing something stupid."
200,"23m been dealing with daily seizures, speech issues, use a walker, I have pins and needles, vocal cords issued affecting my breathing and so on, still not 100% sure of cause of it and so on but basically my mom been saying things like she can't afford to keep me here longterm and this wasn't meant to be forever thing (came back in January due to losing housing) and things alike and that I need to work on somewhere to go that there's a timeline for me to go and find a place so I just feeling troubled honestly cus I severely disabled and idk what I suppose to do honestly but I am preparing to leave tomorrow I don't feel like i am in good mental space to say the least I feel extremely numb to emotions."
201,"So me and my gf (we are both 16) has been together for a decent amount of time, and I like to say that our relationship is pretty healthy, we both love eachother and we do plan moving in the future, we would usually go to boulevard to hangout, or after class we would go there until we went home, but this month, she keep opening up about her family and how much she is drained because of her, her (step) parents aren't particularly nice to her, every morning they would tell her to kill herself and leave the room, when she's breaking down, her mother would usually give her a rope and a blade and then leave the room, they sliced her wired earphones because of how distant she has been lately, she would rather stay silent rather than open up often, on her birthday, she attempted to kill herself but was stopped by her older siblings, when she asked help from her father he would always ignore her, they broke her phone because she accidentally came home late and had to resort using the family tablet to message me, she doesn't sleep, she doesn't eat, and she would cut herself every often, she is in a very bad shape, and, this week is where it started to go down, she would mention about killing herself someday, but I convinced her not to, today we decided to take a break until she got better, but i don't know on how I can trust her not killing herself, i trust her with my heart and she trustes me too, i don't know what to feel about it, i don't know what i'm feeling right now, i can't be there for her physically all the time because her parents are super strict about hanging out with other people, so i had to comfort her with words, but i know that it isn't enough to keep her going."

203,"I'm in a rough place right now, not sure where life is going. Stress regarding finances and job searching is triggering flare symptoms for my autoimmune disease. I went through major skill regression after getting diagnosed with autism (which can happen as one learns to unmask and understand themself better.) Then the pandemic hit and I've regressed even further into isolation and agoraphobic tendencies, while having no job and struggling with my health for years.

Just feels like there's no direction in my life. Finally went into remission for my illness and started daydreaming plans for finally moving forwards in life, but I've got no motivation anymore. No direction. No drive to want to achieve something. All I have are vague ideas that feel more like fictional concepts than things rooted in reality. I feel like a failure of a person, as I have no desire for anything. It sucks. I want to want things again."

But I can't stop my thoughts. Basically a mess of negative things in my head. I should be working rn, but can't. I can't distract myself from it, no hobby, work or exercise works. Right now I can't even find strength to do this anymore "
206,"Okay so I need help and advice on how to tell my psychiatrist. 


For reference this is my past history I was abused as a child semi severely included physically and mentally about my appearance how I looked etc aswell and was severely bullied in school physically mentally and also on social media. Now back to the now, I just realised I display quite heavy narcissistic qualities I’ve had suspicions about it in the past but realised now maybe I do I don’t know. But I have absolutely no empathy for others I love people yes but I don’t get that warm fuzzy feeling inside me that others do it’s just there they are just there ever since a young relationship at 15 all feelings for anyone around me have gone nothing

it’s just a bottomless pit I wish I felt empathy for others but I don’t. And this causes me to have a lack of emotion for them I can act out those emotions fine they don’t suspect a thing there are people I care about , my friends , my partner and I feel comfortable in that sense as I have fun and do things and they have my back but other days my emotions for them even go to or the lack of which was already there and they become sort of just living in my space. I respect that space tho I act as if I’m fine because I know they are my partner but sometimes I have broken up with them because I just didn’t feel anything . I’ve had thoughts of cheating which I never acted on but it was for the thrill of it the rush of I shouldn’t do it. I’ve stolen money from my parents when I was younger large sums which I didn’t bat an eye too because in my mind they need to repay me for what they did in my past now they do it by buying me therapy and meds thankgod anyway back to the story I also have thoughts when I’m annoyed masking what I actually am thinking and wanna say like if I don’t wanna be somewhere when people cry sometimes I wish they could just stop and it’s annoying but I never say it, Because that would display what I actually wanna
say and would lead me to have my reputation ruined . I get extremely jealous of others but I don’t show it because again I know that if I were to be like oh of course you get this and I don’t I’ll be seen as jealous and greedy. 
I need to be the best at everything sports, music,art, and think I am am always right there isn’t any other side when logically yes there is and I can be wrong but I don’t feel wrong or that sense of guilt only sometimes when I truly am wrong like my painting is the best and everything I do is better than everyone’s and if they try to give me help I don’t like it . 
I am not like this as much anymore I am on antipsychotics and have bipolar , adhd , autism , emotional dysregulation. Diagnosed by psychiatrist assessments 

How should I bring this up to him and what is this exactly or can anyone relate do I have npd or is this anything else based on how I’ve been feeling? 

Also by how should I bring this up I legit need people to write out a short sentence on how as I don’t actually know how to bring anything up in conversation.

207,"Do you suffer from age anxiety? It's crazy how little this is spoken about, considering how many people struggle with age anxiety.

I created a mini-series on understanding and regaining control of your age anxiety for those who are struggling 

[Age Anxiety - Elora Health](http://elora-health.com/collections/76d65784-5494-4501-aad5-33a170acf374)"
208,"I have always grown up as extremely anxious and low confidence person. In my 4 years high school, I was completely convinced I couldn’t make any friends. This didn’t help that during my freshman year it was online due to COVID; which absolutely destroyed any progress I had in being more social. Although I decided to join multiple clubs, I struggled to actually make connections with people and it made me have my anxiety and confidence go beyond just being a “quiet kid.” I was honestly devastated by my Senior year that I didn’t make friends to fuck around with in my little Honda 06, or need out with mangas. So I made a promise to myself I was going to change in college. I thought being in college with new faces, being 18, and my own little shitbox would help me make friends. However, I feel like everyone is completely focused on work during  our classes and then everyone heads straight to their car. ( which is pretty valid lol) I feel like I would bother their focus and just routine if I tried to make small talk. However, I still feel proud of myself that I’m starting to be slightly more confident in myself, views things positively, and just not freak out with someone talking to me. I hope I can try to make some friends just so my college years aren’t so boring like my high school time. lol."
209,"Okay so not literally but.

As I was about to go to sleep when i closed my eyes, I suddenly started seeinf all kinds of religious symbols and then images of Jesus. Not like in a hallucinatory way but it was sudden and couldn't control it..

I got a little paranoid because i thought i could die?? And this was a sign from God... And then he internally started speaking to me. He was calling me his child and how I've done good and death is a beautiful experience and I'm ready to go to heaven... Yeah basically told me i was gonna die.

Yeah so i was SCARED but brushed it off. And then i was so out of it. Suddenly the walls started breathing, the room looked like it was falling down, everything was shaking, i was shaking. When i closed my eyes i saw the light aka heaven?

So uhm... What is that?? Not the first time this has happened but it has never happened with Jesus before. "
210,"These past days, I have been having ""episodes."" I dont know the specific term, but its like you dont feel real, like everything arounf you has a layer in-between it. And I get all weird. And I keep altering between being my version of normal, and these episodes I have. 


This is becoming a daily occurance, and the frequency is only growing. This happened to me like 2 months ago for the very first time, and it just keeps happing with increasing frequency.  To the point where it's every day.


Yesterday, I finally gained the courage to hang out with a friend. A very rarely get to see him, and its mostly due to my severe social anxiety. Anyway, I start feeling it coming on while Im driving there. And were okay talking for a few minutes, and then it happens. 


My reality shifts. It's like my friend suddenly became insignificant, and like background noise. Like he wasn't real. Like a video. Anyway, I start acting weird. Like zoning out, looking around me wildly, and just not speaking normal. I dont think it was noticeable, and least not yet. Because it starts off like that, but grows worse. 


Anyway, I eventually suggest we walk to the store. Because I need a energy drink, because I haven't been sleeping well. (maybe Ill feel better then) I keep getting winded like every 5 minutes of the walk. I keep having to stop to take breaks, and it was really embarrassing. And as this walk continues, I grow more weird n shit. When we go to the store, I gave the cashier a $10 and rhen told her to keep the change. (It was a $2 drink.) She gave it to my Anyway, thank God. And then I realize what I did, and how weird that was. I also kept offering to buy him something over and over. 


Anyway, the walk back to the park was even worse. I genuinely thought I was going to puke at some point, and I had to sit down on the ground and just breathe. The physical issues added ontop of the mental issue really make everything worse. I felt weird, disgusting, and I couldn't talk normally with my friend.


At this point I think I was starting to make him uncomfortable, and he admitted to me later when I calmed down that I was staring to genuinely scare him. Anyway, we got back to the park. And after sitting down, I started to feel better, and reality was creeping back.


Outside of that, I managed to get my shit together and be normal for most od the day. I kept having ""mini episodes"" where reality would fade away, but id come back quick enough. "
211,"Sometimes when I am having the not fun thoughts, a part of me says with full intention of it being true: “Hey you need to kys, sooner the better” and normally other parts of me say “bro that’s insanely unproductive why should we”. But sometimes there isn’t any pushback and everyone is “yeah that seems to be the best course of action” and then I get scared of myself for that.  But that last part is part of a bigger cycle dw."
212,"Hey,
I’m a 16-year-old guy, and I’ve been feeling mentally off for about a year and a half, but I think today was the breaking point.

It all started on my birthday last year. My grandmother passed away that exact day. She was someone I loved deeply and thought about every single day since then. I’ve never really talked about her death with anyone. I just couldn’t. I still can’t. Every time someone brings her up at home, I go completely silent. I’d love to talk about how amazing she was and everything we did together, but I just… can’t. I stay quiet even though my heart is full of memories and pain.

Then about three weeks ago, my dog — who had been with us for 13 years — had to be put to sleep because she was seriously ill. I got home from my dorm, and my mom told me they were taking her to the vet to let her go. I had the chance to go and say goodbye. I refused. I stood at the window for about 30 minutes and watched her leave, not moving, just frozen. That day, I cried. It was the first time since my grandma died. Afterward, we buried her, and just like with my grandma, my family talked about her at home. But me? I didn’t say a single thing. Not one word. I wanted to — I have so much to say about her — but I couldn’t.

And when my mom said, “He doesn’t even care,” it shattered me. Because I cared so much. But I stayed quiet again.

I’ve realized I can’t express my emotions in front of others. I shut down. I act like I’m okay even when I’m really not. I think that’s what’s hurting me the most. I carry everything inside.

I live in a dorm during the week, and every weekend I look forward to going home because I feel so much more alive there. But now, I feel like I’m at my lowest.

Today especially hit me hard. I play football, and recently I’ve been getting benched for no clear reason. Today, for the first time, I didn’t even get to play at all. I felt useless. I could also see the disappointment in my parents’ faces, even though they try to hide it and support me. That hurt more than I expected. I don’t want to give up, but it’s tough when you feel like you’re being pushed aside for reasons out of your control.

And tomorrow, I have to go to school. I have to laugh at jokes, pretend I’m fine, act like I’m not falling apart inside. If I act quiet, people just joke that I have depression. So I fake it. Every. Day.

And no, I don’t want to run away or disappear forever. But if I could just stay hidden for two weeks and not deal with anything, I would. But I can’t. Life doesn’t work that way. I have to go through the motions and pretend everything’s okay when it’s not. Even with my parents, I don’t know how to say, “I’m just not okay.” What would they think? Would they even get it?

I know this might not sound like the worst thing in the world. But for me, it is. I’ve been holding on for months, and it’s exhausting. I don’t want pity. I just want to know if anyone has been through something similar… and how you got through it.
How do you talk when words just don’t come out?

Thanks to anyone who reads "
213,"Hey,
I’ve had my own share of mental health challenges, and I remember often feeling lost — like I couldn’t find straightforward, helpful info that actually made sense.

I’m talking to people right now to understand what they wish existed.
Not selling anything. I’m just trying to learn what’s missing, what’s helpful, and what’s not.

If you’ve ever looked for mental health info or support online — and it didn’t really help — I’d really love to hear about it.

What was missing?
What annoyed you?
What actually helped?

You can also drop your email in this link (https://wissen-psycho.onepage.me) if you’re curious to see what comes out of this — but no pressure at all. Mainly I’m just listening right now.

Thanks so much for reading. If you feel like sharing your experience, it would mean a lot."
214,"I have MDD and GAD. yes. I am suicidal. 28F. My family knows this. Diagnosed ako for 6 months now. Pero ive been having my symptoms for 6 years already. hindi nila maintindihan na sakit to. Resigned ako sa work last april. Naghahanap akong work till now. Wala akong mahanap. So ineenjoy ko na muna ung pahinga ko. But then ung nakakatanda kong kapatid e pinapadagdag ung sustento ko sa bahay. Nagpapatulong sya pag aralin ung isa naming kapatid. Which i dont want to sana. Dahil single mom na ako. Bigat na bigat na ako sa mga expenses sa bahay. Akin ung grocery sa bahay and pang kain sa pang araw araw. E hndi naman dapat sakin un sa magulang ko dapat. Pero walang work mga magulang ko. Tutor lang nanay ko. Tatay ko ung sa bahay. Pero sobra nako nabibigatan kaya ayoko na sana tumulong sa kuya ko. And siguro nabigatan na sya sa pagpapaaral sa kapatid kong isa and he was like “siguro naman mas importante ung tiyan kaysa sa mental health”. Like ha? Would you say that sa taong may cancer ? Diko magets bakit di nila magets. E nakikita naman nilang inuumpong ko sarili ko pag nasstress naglalaslas at nag bbreakdown. Akala ata nila ung gamot na iniinom ko e pampagaling. Mood stabilizer lang ang escitaloprm eh. Diko maintindihan bakit akala nila e mood swings lang ata ung mga episodes ko. I really dont want na buhatin ung kapatid ko. Dahil pagod nako sa kakaipon sa future ng anak ko and sa retirement ko. Dahil diko goal na maging palamunin ng anak ko ka graduate nya. Knina lang my doctor suggested na mag pet ako. So may balak mag bigay saking cat. Next month daw kase buntis pa. Edi Go. Persian, free lang. sinabi ko sa tatay ko na suggestion un ng doctor dahil di naman ako into pets. Pero gusto ko itry. then my father was like Wag kana. Aawayin lang ng dog natin hahahahah pati ung kapatid kong pinagaaral wag na daw. Kase sakanya dog ung meron kami dito sa loob ng bahay. Maltese kaya medyo matapang. Wag na daw ako mag cat. Lol diko alam ano mafifeel ko. Gusto ko magwala. "
215,"You know that feeling when you experience something that just doesn’t feel right? Maybe it’s a sensation of young adulthood—my rebellious intuition breaking through as I rant my problems away.

Seriously, whether it’s emotional, physical, political, or sexual—you name it—you just know someone is pushing you in the wrong direction. Deep down, it feels like something is rotting away inside you, screaming in agony, because you know what you’re experiencing is fundamentally wrong. Your brain can process it that way.

What pushes these people over the edge? Why do I even choose to sympathize with them in the first place? Maybe it’s because the true villains in each of our stories are often those closest to us. We don’t realize it at first because, in the usual sense, villains are masked marauders set on ruining lives, right? But most of us don’t fight crime—except our armed forces (thank you, by the way).

The villains in our stories look more like close friends, bosses, family members, or any authority figure, honestly. These are the ones who attack our mental well-being, sometimes without even realizing it. Abuse, in all its forms, inevitably takes center stage in our stories—breaking us down until we’re no longer someone we fully recognize.

It’s almost ironic how people can chip away at you day by day, slowly breaking you down. I have consistently found myself in emotionally abusive environments—places where people win through intimidation and aggression, manipulating me to the ground, showing me how destructive jealousy can be.

The hardest part for me is loving the horrible person, knowing they weren’t always like this. But how long can you cling to hope when you know what’s there now isn’t right? I feel for these people—mirrors of their own past experiences. But one person’s abuse shouldn’t become another’s.

"
216,"Before I start, I'm diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, GAD, SAD, and ASD. I'm saying this just in case this is some symptom I haven't heard of from one of these disorders? Also no, preemptively I'm not trying to be edgy or something if it comes off that way, I genuinely struggle with this and hope to get help in therapy for it if necessary.

Anyways, for basically as long as I can remember, I've had a lot of issues with self-esteem, some days feeling like I'm not really living up to much and generally just not liking myself. Sometimes on other days I'll feel like I'm the best, and often on those same days I'll lose complete interest in pretty much everything and everyone else. But most of the time, I'll fluctuate between the two or experience them simultaneously. I believe this issue is related to that, seeing as it seems to feel like self-loathing and feeling guilt-free simultaneously. 

The easiest way I can put it is an example of something that recently happened at a work place. I promised to cover for someone else, and so I showed up that day, but they did too. We both ended up having to work, but they ended up having to keep their end of our shared agreement for them to cover for me later in the week. I remember afterwards that I felt awkward and like I regretted coming, maybe I should have found a way to get in contact with them? But more than anything I just felt kinda mad at them for showing up in general. I mean, it felt like a failure of our agreement, and it felt like an insult to my intelligence, as if they thought I couldn't cover for them properly? Obviously I didn't say anything (SAD lol), but I was fuming for basically my entire shift and it felt so small and stupid but I felt upset that they showed up when they weren't supposed to and still asked if they still had to cover for me when I showed up for them on a day I had off? It just felt unfair and insulting. And I don't even dislike this person either, they're pretty nice. But I ended up with an odd grudge I don't even fully care about anymore but is still sticking with me. 

It's just weird. I don't genuinely think it'd be related to any disorder, or at least not one that I don't already have— I'm certainly not looking for some kind of diagnosis on here. I just kinda wanna know if this is a common feeling for people with my disorders or maybe like a trauma response or something like that? I intend to bring it up with my therapist but I already struggle to understand and explain my emotions enough so it'd help to have some kind of name for what I'm feeling."
217,"There's a lot happening, I really feel like crying and breaking down but i can't bring myself to cry, my chest hurts and feels uncomfortable with all the weight and no matter how bad things get i just can't cry it out
Is something wrong with me?
Is it normal?
I really need some help regarding this issue 
It seems very abnormal that i can't cry tho I'm very sad and i feel as if I'll have a breakdown "
218,"I’ve been on sick leave since May 2nd because I was having extreme anxiety attacks. I genuinely thought I was having heart problems, that’s how bad they were. I spent 1 hour in the doctor office having an ongoing attack.

Being off work helped a lot. I feel less anxious, I don’t feel like I have a heart attack lasting days anymore. But today I am going back. And I hate it.

I’ve had mental health issues for years, it was mostly depression, with a bit of anxiety but never to this level. This started appearing a month ago and I know for sure it’s because of my work.

My manager is toxic. She’s the kind of person who is all smile and kindness in front of you, but will talk shit about you behind your back. I know that because she talked shit about other coworkers to me. And my coworkers told me what she says about me. And she lies, she invents things to make us look bad.

Her supervisor, who is kinda our supervisor too, is no better. One day she’s playing nice and making jokes. The others she will flip on you for the tiniest thing and yell at you like you’re a badly behaved toddler. In front of other people. Including customers.

I’m working in a place that close at midnight, and I’ve been doing almost exclusively the closing shift since November. I have insomnia. I am exhausted. When I started mentioning that I would like earlier shifts from time to time both my manager and the supervisor brushed it off, “you just need to get used to it” “you should do a sport! It gives people energy!”.

I’ve been here 7 months and I’m the second most senior employee. People don’t stay. I’m stuck because it’s a fixed-term contract until the end of August and if I quit I will not receive the non-negligible bonus we get at the end of fixed-term contracts, and I will not be eligible for any unemployment benefits. I need the bonus to get back to school.

Sorry it is completely a rant but I just wanted to scream it into the void because in two hours I will be there, with a fake smile on my face and my superiors trying to pry informations about my health so they can talk about me behind my back.

Thank you."
219,"(21M) For the last two years, I have been feeling pretty numb and emotionless. Only emotion that i feel is anger, and a worse one. I have even lost interest in my relationship with my family (not like i have any issues with them but it's just me). I have two sisters (they are closest to me) who have moved out but whenever i meet them i act like i am meeting a stranger or something. I am currently in my worst shape physically, mentally and socially. I had great friends before but i started losing interest in them too. Later i lost touch with them and i literally have no friends now. I can't even talk to girls as I have pretty bad social anxiety. I do not even feel regret from my heart. I thought maybe getting on self improvement would help but i could not keep up because for doing any activity you need emotions to keep doing it (even for discipline). And i have no feelings towards anything.   
I have tried feeling sad for myself so many times but it just feels i am forcing it. This just led me into watching too much youtube, anime and thinking about sex all day. I tried going to therapy but my parents say that it is a waste of time and you are ok, there is nothing wrong with you.  
I am just scared that if this keeps going on, I would end up ruining my whole life and die a bad death.

220,"I m18 have been depressed for the last year and lost joy for everything I used to enjoy. 

I didn't have a bad childhood nor was i neglected. There was some bullying because I was overweight when I was 16 or so which led to me losing the weight and then developed body dysmorphia because I got too skinny.

Since then I got in to shape started playing soccer again etc. but for the last 12 months I have been miserable. 

Everything I used to enjoy I now do just for the sake of it. And soccer even fuels the anxiety because of the need to perform.

But the last few months were really bad I started drinking alcohol to numb the anxiety and started burning myself as sh and """"fasting"""" to counter my binge eating 

Why did this happen

221,Sorry kind of word vomit but I feel like an alien on this planet. Like I'm apart of the world enough to interact with it but not. Thinga just don't make senses to me. I can touch and grasp etc but it's ethereal. Say if the world constant is 1.0 I feel like I live in world .98 idk it's so hard to explain and it hurts and idk what to do. I'm just not people im an alien I'd idk what's wrong with me. Ssri didn't help they make me black out the other pills didn't either the anti psychotic the other stuff Idk even what they are. I just feel alone and hope someone can tell me what's wrong. Sorry
222,"Hi.
I want to talk assertively but  the anger makes me fool."
223,I am currently 23 and have been wanting to work in healthcare my entire life. I used to always want to be a dr but then got diagnosed w major depressive disorder in highschool about a yr or two after I began experiencing overwhelming sadness and harmful thoughts. I was also engaging in SH for quite (some time I am about 4 years clean now I think) but it was prevalent for a very long time in my life until college. I am on medication for depression. My symptoms have been relatively well managed and I have not have harmful thoughts in quite some time. However as I have begun my job at a hospital as a patient tech who aids the nurses on an inpatient unit. I seem to feel that many symptoms are returning where I find myself feeling overwhelmingly sad but not to the point where I want to hurt myself. I also have found myself cutting myself short of breaks at work bc I feel that I have to do everything expected of my for not only the patient who are also my number priority but I also have this obligation to do it for the nurses bc they are higher above in status than me (Ik this is cringe but this is just how my mind works?). I also have issues eating before work bc sometimes I feel so anxious to go in. I get so many thanks and compliments from both patients and colleagues but the  toxicity of some staff on our unit and rough shifts still get me hard. Idk if I’m like trying to starve myself and deprive myself of breaks bc it’s like a pseudo form of self harm? Idk? Am I over reacting lmao? Idk how to even explain this fully I’m not sure this will do a good job. Anyways now I’m trying to go to physicians assistant school. I also find myself at peace when I am busy. I don’t know if this is like a weird ocd like habit I have which may have been passed on by my mom or what. I always like having something to do at work tho which is why I would like to maybe pick up shifts in the emergency room and also learn more there as I have a background with my emt license. I like healthcare don’t get my wrong I know this is what I want to do. I just don’t know how to process these emotions. 
224, For the longest time I have had a lot of suicidal thoughts and I started to sh. I started doing even when I’m not feeling unset and when I do sh I don’t usually cry I just do it and than right after I’ll go on my phone sometimes I will be listening to music when doing it. I don’t know if it’s normal and what’s not. Sh makes me calm down and makes me feel like I’m the one in control

Making me doubt my self worth.


""Let's give sexual intimacy a try"", so I'm to lay down and let you have your way with me, even AFTER I expressed I don't want to?

""Sexual intimacy impoves connection"" and yet, you're no longer a safe place for me.

""You've promised to try to fix the relationship"", I did, it does not mean I want to have sex with you right now.

""You've never try, you how you know it won't help?"", I know because I don't want to have sex with you. 

""You promised to try"", I promised to try and fix what went wrong with us, NOT to have sexual intimacy with you.

""You're not keeping up your end of the agreement"", when all else fails, what makes you think having sex with you will change anything?

227,"*(English is not my first language and i have dyslexia so I am sorry if this isn't the best text)* I(F) have been to the doctors about this problem but nothing abnormal has appeared so im thinking what things would help me to energize. 

Im in school and i have been falling asleep in my classes and fighting to stay awake. I sleep 7-18hours every night. I cant sleep less that 7 hours or I will fall asleep and i cant function if I sleep less than 7hours. The only times i feel like im fully awake and energized is when I have slept three or so days almost 20hours each night. I try to exercises when Im not exhausted but it really doesn't wake me up it only gets me sleepy more. And I drink coffee sometimes but it aighter doesn't work or it work too to the point I feel like im jumping on the walls. 

Im thinking does anyone have advise for what could wake me up. I will take anything at this point Im so tired. I've tried/I am eating healthy but it didn't help so does anyone have better ideas?"

I struggle to talk to strangers and get overwhelmed quite easily in public situations. Id like to say i have 3 friends but its basically one. The most innteractions im most likey to have are in school and thats almost over. I dont want to dissapoint and i feel like after school my family will be the only people i talk to."
230,"*Disclaimer*: wasn't sure if I should post it here or in the r/TrueOffMyChest community, but based on relevancy and requirement picked this one.

Here's the context: I have an office friend, work under the same manager, joined a few months apart. It's my first job, she's experienced and a few years older than me. We met twice a year ago due to being on different floors, but this year we were all brought together so I see her everyday. Became friends two months ago, and she's very talkative. Like no filter talkative. Lots of things she was talking about and some stuff she did, didn't sit well with me but I downplayed it's significance to avoid causing trouble for myself at work. Two weeks into knowing each other, a big argument broke out and I couldn't take it any longer so I suggested we turn down the intensity of the friendship and keep it strictly professional. She agreed at first, but when she saw I was actually going through with it, starting badgering me with messages like 'how can you do this to me', 'ive never shared so much with anyone before', 'i felt a connection' and such. I tried to set my boundaries and didn't explain the things she did that were affecting me. A few days later, I gave in and starting being pretend friends with her so she would stop mentally harrassing me with her questions and life stories. Few days later that strategy failed and it was time for round two. The same cycle repeated and this time I gave in genuinely. I told myself I don't have to cross the boundaries I've set with her and verbally communicated it to her as well. I also backed it up with similar actions and responses. And for some time it was fine. Later on, it started to really drain me whenever I spoke to her and had to listen to her talk. Since I'm a very serious person, I take everything she says seriously. Everyone does because she expresses it that way. But she would only be joking. She has a lot of friends but chooses to hang out with me because she thinks we are close. I dont have as many friends but I enjoy my own company and actually prefer it over a group. She cannot be alone. In her words 'she would rather starve than go to a crowded place and eat alone'. I started treating her with passive aggression because I couldn't get myself to be diplomatic and take a stand for myself to keep our interactions strictly professional. I feel I'm edging closer to my breaking point but I'm being cautious about it.

What I don't get is, despite the way I treat her (my passive aggression and unwillingness to form a closer bond with her), why can't she just let me be? It is as if, if she finds there's a connection she feels with me it's enough and, my feelings do not matter? I feel tied down by her expectations. I would walk away at the first sign of someone showing displeasure in my company. I think most people would too, if they could. But, why can't she? It's not like I'm the only friend she has. She has tones of friends who seek her out, then why does she have to hold on to me?

She tells me she can walk away if someone hurts her so bad but that her threshold is very high. Have I not hurt or disrespected her enough? Does she not have any self respect for herself?

I'm continuing my neutral stance but, it's bleeding into my demenour these days and she even asked me why I was angry when she came to talk to me.

What's going on? What can I do? Clear and direct communication does not work with her."
231,"TLDR, I broke my leg in two places at the end of March getting off the bus in an ice storm. I told my parents and they asked if I wanted them to come get me and, weak and tired and disoriented, I agreed.

Now, a bit of background: I'm a grad student, and I live/go to school 2 hours away from my parents. This arrangement works well for me because my parents and I don't have a great relationship. In my view, they are judgemental people in general. There are small petty things I get needled for; like eating two chocolate chip cookies after dinner (my mom is a health nut) and my choice to have pink streaks in my hair. Then there are big things, like the fact that they are fundamentalist/evangelical Christians, and I'm agnostic and queer (you do the math).

Within one week of me being here, my parents and I got into an altercation and something awful was said to me (which I won't describe here as that could be its own post). To give you an idea, the two people I told this to (one of whom is also a parent) described their behaviour as emotionally abusive. And I had to go through that knowing I still had at least 5 weeks left in the house.

It is also just isolating in general here. I have one friend that I can see occasionally, otherwise I'm alone for at least 8 hours a day while my parents are at work (and I still have to work, just remotely, although I can barely concentrate). I still can't walk and so have basically been living like I'm in COVID lockdown again, doing online school, which is a personal nightmare. I do have a wheelchair I can use, but my parents live in a suburb so there's nowhere I can feasibly go by myself except a small nearby park (which is nice when the weather decides to play nice, I'm from Canada).

I've been managing to stay sane by distracting myself with hobbies. I also elected to interact with my parents as little as possible until this injury blew over. Things seem to take a turn for the better at my fracture clinic appointment 3 weeks ago, where the doctor said in 3 weeks (today) we should be able to get my medical boot off. Having an end date in mind helped me tremendously. I thought about all the things I wanted to do when I got back to my city, all the friends I wanted to see again and events to go to. I dreamed about the new place I'd be moving into, about not having to work from home anymore so I could concentrate again, and about just being away from my family and having my life and independence back. At this point it had been 6 weeks without walking.

Well, today I got the awful news. Although my injury is healing well, I still can't be weight bearing for at least another two weeks, and that even after that the road to independence will be slow. Realizing that not only could I go back to my life this weekend, but that there isn't even an end date to grasp onto, I was just absolutely crushed. I ended up going to the hospital food court and just sobbing for an hour.

This feels like a hell I can't escape; it feels so helpless and debilitating. How the hell do I get through this? I know it will be over some day but this legitimately feels like torture. The only way I have been able to get to this point is by imagining this would be the end of it and now I feel like I have nothing left to give. I feel like I can't catch a fucking break (ha, ha). I'm glad I at least have this subreddit to vent to. Most of my family has never broken a bone and they have no idea what I'm going through."

234,"I made a series of mistakes and fucked up decisions and I feel like I’m right at rock bottom. 

I can pinpoint where all of the self destructive behaviour comes from, just a desperation to be loved. But I have no idea what to do with that information. 

I’m unemployed, have no savings, and absolute no clue what to do with my life or what to do next. 

I feel so completely lost and angry, and ashamed, and defeated. Like a deadbeat waste of space.

235,I don't know where to post this so I hope here is okay I'm finally clean from cutting about two weeks now i really wanna wear shorts out when just going to take my dog out at night since that's what I usually wear to bed some of my scars are deep purple and light pink and I dont know if it's okay to go out in public showing them since I dont really know if they're fresh still or not (the deep purple ones are over a month old) can anyone help me kinda understand if a scar is fresh or not?
236,"So, this is gonna be a rant, maybe just me venting, so I don't expect anyone to get through all this.

Venting, ranting... just talking through things is what I did with my husband.  How can you fix things if you won't admit there's an issue or you try to hide things?  But he's gone now...

I've always dealt with anxiety, or as my family says ""I'm high strung"".  It's like mental health issues are rare to them - sure, *some* people have legit issues, but for most people, they just need to get out of bed, go for a walk, make a to-do list, and get things done.  Stop being lazy, just focus and you'll be fine.  Just calm down - telling people to calm down always works, right?  

I had been through therapy a few times in my life, so when my husband was diagnosed with cancer in 2017, I tried using some of the tools I learned to deal with it.  No ""talking it out"", just get things done, square breathing, reframe those thoughts.  I had that superhero anxiety energy at the beginning.  I was sooo busy - doing nothing.  Then I started burning out.  There were real things I needed to address, but I was up doing dishes at 3am.   Holding it all in, because *I* wasn't the one with cancer, did nothing but give me a panic attack.  My husband convinced me to go back into therapy.

He passed in February, and I had to put down our (his) cat in March.  I had quit my job in January to take care of him and his recovery from surgery, but the universe had other plans.  My family came out to help me address our house, but I realized that my issues never went away, they were just easier to deal with because I had him.  We were a team.  

All my life, I was told I needed to aim higher.  My degree choice was not approved by the family - I need to study hard, get a good job, etc.  I honestly think they were shocked that I even got married.  I was told that friends don't help you pay the bills.  Asking for help for any reason?  ""This is so easy, I don't see why you're having issues"".  My brother also got some of this, but my sister was the pretty one...  she was gonna marry well and make them proud.  I needed to study.

So now, because career was supposed to be my focus, and we didn't have kids - little remarks were made about where I am now, me finding another job, just something to get started - and then I can focus on getting promoted.  Um, I'm focusing on not falling apart.   I had quit smoking a long while back - ""I sure hope you don't start smoking again just because you're stressed"".  I can feel the anxiety creeping back, and I'm slowly shutting down.   I chose to go back to therapy, but apparently the right choice would be to make a to-do list, work on it, and make sure I get out for a walk every day.   I'm having issues getting out of bed, but I'll for sure get a walk in... and a to-do list won't overwhelm me at all!  

I check in daily with the family, because I don't want them calling for a wellness check.  I keep it short, though.  I'm not discussing what I discuss in therapy.  I'm reusing the dry erase calendar, the one we used for his appointments for my to-do list.  I'm not looking at next week, I'm looking at today and tomorrow.  I haven't gone out much, but that's OK.  I have some appointments scheduled where I have to leave the house, and that's enough for now.  I'm trying to remember that I was a whole person before I met him, and I'm a whole person now.  I need to treat myself as I would treat anyone else."
237,"You’ve read the books. You *know* your attachment style. You can map out your trauma history better than most therapists.  
So… why does the pain still linger? Here’s a hard truth I've learned: **Understanding isn't the same as healing.** In fact, *intellectualizing* can become a clever way to avoid the very thing that heals us: **Feeling.**

See, real healing doesn’t happen in the mind. It happens in the body.

That knot in your chest?  
The pressure in your throat?  
The heaviness in your gut?  
Those *are* your feelings.

Here's what most of us miss: **Healing is not a thought process. It’s a feeling process.** You don’t need another theory. You need to **breathe into what hurts,** to feel what you’ve avoided, to let your body speak—and let yourself listen.

The tragedy is that for many of us, no one thought us how to feel. Even if people know they're supposed to feel their feelings, the next question is usually, ""how do I feel my feelings when I don't even know what I'm feeling"". Use your body, that's where your feelings reside. For 5 minutes a day, sit with your body and observe the feelings that come up. Just sit with whatever sensations come up without thinking about then. You will realize that feelings (which manifest as sensations in your body) change every few seconds. Just watch, that's all you need to do for now. "
238,"Hi everyone. Just for context, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder in 2021 and then Type 2 diabetes in 2024 (this will be important for later). I was on various medications in the first 2 years, with little success in terms of managing my symptoms. It was only in June of 2023 where I was able to be managed on the current treatment I am on now. I also started gaining weight during this period and eating very unhealthy food which lead me to be at my heaviest weight and people making comments about my weight and judging me for it. I was also diagnosed with diabetes type 2 in August of 2024 and have been on treatment ever since. Fast forward to today and I feel so overwhelmed by everything. I am constantly stressed out by school as it is my final year and I don't want to fail any modules since I already failed some modules last year. School makes me feel anxious, I don't get proper sleep, my body does not want to get up and exercise. I eat like crap and I feel like I am one major event away from falling into a bipolar episode mixed in with depression and  manic episodes. My self-confidence is at an all time low and I am struggling to see a way out of this. I can't think straight, I can't talk to my family about what I am feeling as they will not understand and I don't know if my healthcare professionals will be able to help me."
239,"They aren’t scars, they’re pretty fresh (yesterday) I don’t know what to do because tomorrow I’m forced to wear a T-shirt and I don’t want people to see the cuts.

241,Lately I have been very anxious out of no where to the point I feel like I’m going to pass out. I find myself disassociating quite a bit too and I can’t keep a conversation because I genuinely don’t feel real. I take Zoloft for years now but I don’t think it has really made a huge impact how clonzepam has for me. I’m scared I will become addicted or dependent on clonzepam my whole life but I genuinely know I need it or I will have panic attack after panic attack. I have tried the breathing exercises I have tried therapy I have tried medication and I even quit my job at one point. I don’t know why it won’t go away. Am I really that weak minded that I’m letting this take over my whole life. I don’t know what to do anymore it’s ruining my everyday activities and relationships.
242,"
Let me preface this by saying: I’m not okay, but I will be. I’m a final-year architecture student, 21F, diagnosed with generalized and social anxiety. Recently started Prozac. Life was already a mess—but then I met him. Let’s call him “X.”

X and I were just classmates until this semester. We started talking more, trauma-bonded over architecture stress, existential anxiety and suddenly I found myself oversharing (thanks, SSRI-fueled impulsivity). He played the emotionally intelligent, supportive therapist role. Said all the right things. I thought he was harmless—maybe even gay. Spoiler: he wasn’t. He confessed feelings. I was shocked.

After a whirlwind of confusion, I agreed to “try” dating. I told him I had attachment issues. He said, “That’s okay. Just communicate.” But then came the weird part.

He started treating me like a project. Asked for proof I was working. Called me a “smart girl” like he was my teacher. Repeated my own motivational words back to me like he was programming me. Got me addicted to cigarettes. I found out he does the same to his roommate—calls him his “wife,” makes him do chores, “sits him down and talks to him like a 6-year-old.” Apparently this is part of his “father archetype” identity. He chose to be that, because it “works best.”

He told me he used to call people he “cared for” his pets. Not joking. Literal words. “I take care of them. I call them pets.” I wish I was making this up.

We went on a date. I was sleep-deprived, had mixed alcohol with my meds (Xanax and Prozac—yes, bad, I know). I was out of it. He kissed me by the water. It was my first kiss and I felt nothing—numb, dissociated. Later, I fell on the rocks and cut my hand open. He kept kissing me through it. I went home, passed out, woke up at 3 a.m. in a full-blown panic attack. The next morning, I broke up with him.

Then the real horror unfolded.

Turns out, X has a pattern. There was a girl before me—Russian, looked eerily similar (same hair, same eyes). People called me “the new [her name].” He and his weirdly submissive roommate even joked about it. That girl? She self-harmed. Developed an eating disorder. Chased him with a knife. Tried to jump out of a window. He says he got PTSD from her. But from what I gathered, he emotionally battered her into the ground.

He brags about “emotionally investing” in people until they break. Claims he doesn’t “humanize short people.” Has a “hierarchy of value” in his head but says I’m “special.” Uses phrases like “the one who angers you controls you” while being the one who constantly triggers emotional chaos and then steps back like he’s the rational one.

Now i take the same classes with him and couple group projects but thank god we’re graduating in 2 weeks. I don’t want to see his face but guess i’ll stay civil since he told me “The who angers you, controls you” in one of his fake ass therapy sessions . "
243,"Posting is limited to 1.5k chars here, but the full story is in my profile and in the DPDR subreddit. When I met my boyfriend half a year ago, he seemed cold, distant, and uninterested. But within minutes, he relaxed and became warm, funny, and engaging. That night we connected deeply. He felt like a different person. I noticed I was dating four versions of him: 1. sweet, romantic, emotionally available; 2. cold, disconnected, avoiding eye contact and touch; 3. sexually confident, dominant but emotionally distant; 4. playful, childish, focused on cartoons and games. Switches happened with stress, loud noises, fatigue, or intimacy. On our second date, I wore a dress he suggested; his expression turned disgusted and cold, but later that night, after a bright light, he switched back to warm and we had a good time. Other signs: 1. memory gaps—forgetting emotional stories; 2. he claimed a perfect childhood but couldn’t remember before age 7; 3. siblings had addiction problems, contradicting the perfect family story; 4. he showed me YouTube videos about DID and explained it empathetically. I’ve dated toxic people before and can spot manipulation—this didn’t feel like that. He was loving and emotionally present most of the time but the switching was exhausting. We briefly broke up; he was cold, then later called crying and said he loved me. I reflected and thought maybe DPDR or DID. I texted from a new number: “Please tell the one who used to love me I’m trying to reach him. I love all of you, even those afraid of me.” He replied, we met, and I said I accept all his “sides,” even if I don’t fully understand. He thanked me and said opening up was hard. We got back together. Since then, stress dropped, switches are less frequent, he feels safer, and we had deeper talks but haven’t discussed DID directly. 

TL;DR: My BF switches between loving, flat, dominant, and childish selves. Triggers are stress and closeness. He has memory gaps, no early memories, and knows about DID. After reconciliation, symptoms lessen. 

Questions: 1. Does this sound like DID/DPDR? 2. Which behaviors are typical or not? 3. How to talk about this gently without pressure or shame?"

So two weeks my dad passed and got diagnosed with heart failure. A week later he got out the hospital and seemed fine. He wouldn’t rest tho he would still do chores. Before he was a heavy smoker and kinda lazy but since he stopped he worked more often.  Then he passed out again but threw up blood this time. When I saw in the hospital he was normal. Now he’s has slurred speech and drunk like symptoms. He seem like he could fall out any second and his eyes are low. What I hate the most is since my dad stopped smoking we grew closer. But before he was diagnosed with heart failure I didn’t like him and accused him of being a bum. Now I feel horrible and every time I see my dad talk and walk like he’s drunk I feel hurt on the inside which rare for me being I never been the emotional type since I grew up being bullied.  But that’s another story. So how can cope with this"
246,"I’ve spent years trying to make sense of the pain I carry—the kind that eats away at you quietly, until you forget what light even looks like. I used to think I was alone in that darkness.

Recently, I started writing—really writing—as a way to survive. Not just journaling, but pouring out everything that’s ever clawed inside me. I just shared my second piece, called The Flicker, and it’s raw. It’s about those moments when you think you’re done, but something inside you refuses to die. That little spark. That flicker.

If this resonates with anyone here—especially those who’ve felt buried by trauma, abandonment, or their own thoughts—I hope you’ll give it a read. And if it speaks to you, even a little, I’d love to hear what it brings up.

248,"hello. i'm reaching out to ask for some help with my boyfriend. we've been going through a very rough patch as of late. we haven't been arguing, we've just gotten very distant. he's never been very open about his feelings with me, or his own issues and struggles for that matter, but tonight he opened up to me.

1. he's a few thousand dollars in debt
2. he feels incredibly ashamed living in my parent's basement with me
3. he doesn't have a stable job
4. he copes by smoking weed constantly
5. he wishes he wasn't alive and has suicidal ideations 
6. he doesn't have that much of a drive
7. he ""self-destructs"" himself, destroying any good progress he's made
8. he hasn't ever felt mentally ""okay"" or ""happy"" in his entire life

i am 21 and in college to become a teacher. he is 24 and was going to be taking classes this summer to become an electrician but he's not able to do this anymore because he will be going back to his hometown 2 1/2 hours away to watch his dog at his parent's house for pretty much the whole summer. he's told me he won't be happy in his hometown and he's not sure if things will improve. i want to help him any way i humanly can before i decide to call this relationship quits. i've told him i can't stay in this relationship if he continues to ""self-destruct"" in his own words.

i understand how dire this situation is and i understand that i can't stay here with him like this if things don't improve, so please don't comment that i should just leave. he knows i plan on breaking up if there's no improvement made by the end of this year. there are things that i also need to do to fix things between us and i fully realize that. i'm mostly wondering if anyone has any advice on how i can support him towards getting help. he's going to be calling his mother tomorrow and let her know how things are going and hopefully get a doctor's appointment scheduled/a therapist appointment scheduled. 

please, if anyone has any advice for me, let me know. thank you"

Hi , I am 26 from India . I am unemployed , broke  , no college degree , depressed & dumb enough to loose all my & my parents savings in Fantasy sports & gambling .

I lost $36000 in gambling (around 31,00,000 INR ).

I passed my highschool in 2017 & passed my CA entrance exam in same year . I enrolled for CA (Chartered Accountant) course in 2017 & now I was on Intermediate level . 

In 2020 I was introduced to fantasy sports & though I belongs to a Middle class family , still I used to have good bankroll & finance independence.

I don't have a father , he committed sui**cde when i was 13 year old , he was clinically depressed & suffering from epilepsy.

Back in 2017 I noticed that I am over anxious & stressed all the time , repetitive thoughts & anxiety . I consulted a psychologist & he gave me medicines , idk if they even worked or not but I started getting digestive issues like bloating , IBS & with seboric dermatitis.After 6-8 month I left my medicine 

My anxiety grew too much & I left my studies & coaching & locked myself in the house & that was my biggest mistake . I did nothing between 2018-20 , just me battling with my thoughts & depression.

In 2020-2021 covid came & I was introduced to fantasy sports I played & won some , though I took a break from a CA course but still I used to think I was smart enough to earn from here . Initially I won & got some adrenaline rush which helped me from overcoming my repetitive thoughts & depression.

Soon I become an addict , I used to play all day every game & with no accountability I lost my $6k (5LINR) savings.

In between I came into a relationship in 2022  & alot of s**x & intimacy distracted me from gambling.But not more than 6 months , we had a breakup & I being a mess , started my gambling journey again .

I was anxious due to my breakup & with buring desire of recovering all my money & took $16.5k ( 14LINR) from my mothers Maturing Fixed deposit , I told them I was investing it for good return .
I swear I fooled my mother , brother & my grandmother & I lost it all in a matter of a month .

I confessed & those pour souls even forgive me & encouraged me for again pursuing CA course .

But I was dumb enough to shift to online casino & betting apps now( BLUECHIP CASINO) .I started gambling & casinos & at one stage I won $2.5L ( 2,00,00,000 INR ) . I hit a 150× in crash games with 50000 INR .

I was on the top of sky & thought all that small losses & breakup got better out of me . ( That was my casino amount , not my real bank account)

 I withdrew almost 500000 INR {$6000} but afterwards delay in withdrawals & unnecessary account inspection were enough to break my patience & started rash gambling again in a matter of days I lost my casino balance .

Now upto this stage I was an professional thief & started looting my Grandmother , my mother & even my brother account & again lost it all.

One fine night I was loosing as usual & was anxious because of my dirty deeds & ran from my house & left a letter .

You wouldn't believe my house was under-construction at this time almost $2.5 lakh was the cost & I used to use that amount for gambling.

They read the letter & was very angry & anxious , called me home & requested me too come back .

I came back , but as an gambling addict, I started again & this time my parents & my elder brother got mad on me & started throwing hands .

250,"I don't know if anyone can relate but a lot of times when im looking at someone, talking to someone or just doing anything with someone, I feel like I'm living in the past and spending time with this person but they're already dead and it makes me super sad especially when it's about my family. At the same time, I feel like I don't spend enough time with my family and it also makes me sad but it's weird to suddenly spend time with them like staying super close to them and be expressive you know. And next month I'm gonna go study abroad. Although I still have some family there but my mom and dad aren't going with me. I dont know what I should do. Will I regret not spending time with them and be expressive about how much I love them? Will it be too late after I go study abroad? I really want someone to talk to about this. I don't know why I'm just afraid of the future, and it feels like I'm living my current life as if I'm living in the past (like im time traveling to the past and am reliving my life) and I've already lost everyone but I'm reliving the time when I had everything, does that make sense? I don't like the way I think. I really hate it. I don't know what I should do. I feel very sad..."
251,"I’ve been carrying a heavy grief that feels isolating, even though I’m not alone. I lost my dad a few months ago—just a week before my birthday. This week, he should’ve turned 81. Instead, I’m sitting with a silence that feels endless.

My father meant everything to me. He wasn’t perfect, but he was a good man—great to me. I don’t know if I’ve ever loved anyone the way I loved him. Losing him to cancer has left a hole that I can’t seem to fill.

I’ve tried to keep it together, to manage the pain quietly, especially around my spouse. I know she loves me, but I don’t want her to carry the weight of my sadness and frustration. So I’ve kept most of it to myself, hoping maybe I could find someone else—a counselor or EAP—to share with. But that hasn’t worked out. I still feel alone in this.

There’s so much inside me: pain, anger, frustration, and a deep sense of emptiness that catches me off guard. Sometimes my eyes feel high up, like I can see everything clearly, and yet there’s this massive low underneath it all—this void. I recently saw the new Thunderbolts movie, and when they talked about the void, I felt it. It wasn’t just a line—it felt like my life.

When I was younger, I could manage these emotions through working out or staying active in sports. That physical outlet gave me a way to release the pressure. But now that I’m older, I don’t have the same outlets. And the feelings? They’ve grown. They feel heavier, harder to shake, harder to carry.

I’m not sure what I’m hoping for in posting this—maybe just to not feel so alone in it. Maybe someone else has felt this kind of weight and made it through. If nothing else, thank you for reading."
252,"Sorry but the last 3 months have been really terrible and no amount of of hobbies I have is helping me cope. 

Lost job due to bad management-search endlessly for a job thankfully I have a gig I still make money from. Rent and bills get paid still. 

I hate being partially (actually more than partial) deaf. I haven’t met any other deaf women my age and it’s so draining. 

Found a job? Got excited then….Start date gets delayed (of course!)
It’s about to be my birthday and I can’t do anything during it because I’m broke. Saw a friend that I thought was going to celebrate our bdays together at our usual place stand me up. watched her ig stories showing all the bouquets and cake she got with other friends. We haven’t fought or anything so it was a weird blow to my self confidence. I worked a lot until I lost my last job and kinda hoped to see at least one of my friends. 

Also found out family is planning a cruise/vacation set for June without me. So all parents, siblings, couples, and kids are going but they left me out but kinda laughed it off they forgot to invite me. Not surprised by this as I’m used to being treated this way but it’s kinda getting tiring. 

I feel like the world is just constantly telling me I don’t deserve happiness. I dont have a partner, no real friends, family always treated me crappy, no money. Everybody else gets to flaunt their happiness in my face while I d** inside. Haven’t felt up to draw or paint like I used to either. i’m so tired of being depressed every year. "
253,"2 years ago I started having really bad anxiety and depression. 

It all started because of one traumatic experience. It’s funny because before that, I thought that depression and anxiety were not real. I won’t go in the details on what happened because it affects me just thinking about it.

But what I can say is that I found a meditation app on the App Store and it changed my life. It genuinely helped me and since then I’ve been able to control my anxiety better.

If you struggle with anxiety and depression, you’re genuinely not alone. 

"
254,"I've suffered from severe anxiety, panic disorder, depression, OCD,and hypochondria for almost 40 years. I am also deathly afraid of medications (pharmacophobia), so it's next to impossible to take meds for my issues. I've tried to navigate this my whole life, with limited success. In the past few months, I've begun to experience horrible physical pain. The doctors can't find the cause, but they think anxiety could be a factor. Because of this physical pain, lots of stress at work, and just random stressors in daily life, I ended up having a complete nervous breakdown a few weeks ago. I am on FMLA from work right now. I am doing a topical treatment for my pain, so I am slowly getting relief. My doctor wants to put me on a medication for anxiety and depression, which I know is necessary, but my fear of meds sends me into a panic when I even think about it. When I'm not at doctor appointments, I have been using my time away from work to try to eliminate stress and to pick up the pieces of my life. Right now everything is quiet - I've removed myself from social obligations, stopped watching the news, and removed all negativity and stress in my life. I've basically removed myself from society. Slowly, I'm starting to feel whole again. But I have a fear that once I am thrust back into this crazy world, things will unravel again, especially if I don't get on some kind of med. How can I cope? I feel like the society in which we live has contributed to all my mental health issues, and I just wasn't designed for it. Something is seriously wrong if so many people need to go on meds just to fit in with society. It makes me wonder if the society we have built for ourselves isn't destroying everyone mentally. Has anyone ever felt this way? And how do you find a way to live in a society that feels unnatural to you without losing your mind?"
255," 
Whenever my anxiety gets super super bad and I need support from my partner or family I feel soo guilty. The way my anxiety gets a bit better is if someone asks me to questions but usually my anxiety gets really bad at night which makes me have to having to ask my partner/ sometimes family member to ask 
Me questions. I hate it, I hate having people help me, I hate being an Inconvenience or a bother. I hate myself and wish anxiety wasn’t real.

256,"I wish I could feel loved. Once I had a long distance friend who got drunk at their birthday party. They warned me ""I'm sorry if I say anything weird when I get drunk"" I didn't pay it much attention then but later... when she texted me after getting drunk she sent me messages like ""I love you!"" ""I'm so happy you are here"" ""heheh I wish you were here so I could hug you"" and others among those lines. Needless to say I was very happy, it made feel loved. In my life my biggest struggle I feeling ""loved"" by someone. It's not as If people don't try to love me, they do. But most of the time I feel unteachable like I don't belong, like I don't match with anyone. And this feeling of loneliness no matter has consumed me my whole life. But I'm glad this person has made me see that it's possible for me to feel loved. I want to feel love again"
257,"I keep relapsing and I really do want to get better, I just don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this. Wishing everyone else going through similar struggles good luck ❤️"

Was I raped? Im not sure im confused so much
I dont understand at all

Summary -  >! I had sex with a guy(44m) that I(16F) met on an app, the whole time i was disconnect and confused feeling very scared and shaky too. Now I’m just so confused !<

>! Im 16f he is 44m !<

>! On the Sunday(May 11) i downloaded this app called ‘Pure’ a hookup app for curiosity. During this time i was also sexting online as a way to cope with some sexual trauma that happened in the past. Anyways i started texting this dude online, we live in the same city and decided to meet at the park at 11pm, i didn’t know he was 44 till after we made plans so i was grossed out but still decided to do it. When I told him I was 16 and now 18 he called himself a ‘dirty old man’ for making plans with a teenager. He also said things like ‘I’m excited to see your teenage pussy’ ‘i know this is wrong but i love how much of a horny good little girl you are’ and etc. Istarted becoming very hesitant as this was very risky, so i started calling a bunch of hotlines and going on venting discord servers to try and change my mind. This guy convinced me to do it by showing his address with his face and his house so i did it.   At 11pm we meet at the park and I get in his car and he starts touching me everywhere and starts putting a vibrator down there. I regretted it and became very uncomfortable but let him, then he drove over to his place and I got in his apartment where he put a collar on me got me on the bed, took off my clothing and made me bend over so he could cuff my wrist and ankles(he never cuffed the ankles though). Then he starting shoving dildos and his dick in both wholes while putting a vibrator on my clit, he used a shit ton of lube but it hurt it didnt feel good, i was also gagged during this and was actually disconnected and zoned out the whole time. I wanted it to stop i wanted to cry but i was genuinely scared he was going to hurt me. Eventually I do the safe code(snapping my fingers) which he listened to luckily and ungagged me and uncuffed me. We then lay down I was shaking a lot and all disconnected. He started jerking it and grabbed my head(very lightly) and put it on his dick where i give him head. I pretend i enjoy this and acted like i wasn’t scared and disconnected. He then got on top of me and started fucking me and i just went along the n he came on my stomach. He got up got me water and asked if i was ok since i was shaking a lot, i lied and said i was. I put my clothing back on, he drops me off at the park where i weakly walked home as my legs were hurting and i was all disconnected and confused. !<

>! During the act i was all disconnected and just blank and now im all confused. I talked to people online and there mixed opinions so please give me your opinion !< "
259,"BPD has ruined my life. It basically controls my life... my emotions, relationship/friendship, how I am with my kids. It has just destroyed me. One moment it feels like i have my whole life on track and feel the happiest i've ever been... then the next day can come, and i can feel like i'm insanely and deeply depressed all over again. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of the uncontrollable emotions no matter how hard i try to contain them. I'm tired of the mood swings, the anger i have... everything. It seems like it will never get better no matter how hard I try. If you have any advice, please help me. this is actually destroying me."

261,"I've had waves of depression that sometimes have been really bad. I hadn't had one in a while and I'm in one now. Usually, they start way more gradually but this time, it came on quickly and has been rapidly getting worse.

A few days ago, I got signed up for IOP and realized I had so many things going on causing my depression episode that they managed to get lumped together in a way where now I no longer remember why I'm depressed. I can't articulate it it, nor can I identify how I feel in the moment and why. This has never happened before.

Yesterday, I noticed that I've recently been taking forever to eat and drink. Normally, if there's food in front of me, I'll eat it, even if I'm not hungry. Now, I'll have food in front of me and the food will sit there for 30-60 minutes while I stare off into nothing. It's not like I'm not hungry or am avoiding food. It feels like my brain can no longer process that I need to pick up my fork and eat the food. I'll usually take a bite, space out again, and take another bite. This has never happened before.

Similarly, I'll have my laptop open or I'll sit or stand in my apartment for 30 mins - 2 hours when I intended to do something. This has never happened before.

Today, I realized I've been messing up my words way more frequently than normal. For me, normal is never. I'm getting tongue tied on words I never used to, and it's never the same words. I'm not speaking any faster than normal. This has never happened before.

My meds haven't changed in months.

How am I supposed to do IOP when I can't even process basic functions?"
262,"Hello, I could use some advice. Basically I’m really struggling with depression and anxiety, I have been for a long time, but lately I just have nothing in me. I lost my job because I wasn’t showing up, again, and I’m really struggling with self loathing because I don’t want to be a burden on my mom but most days I don’t have the energy to get out of bed to eat or shower. In my head I’m screaming at myself to do literally anything but my body won’t move. I can’t commit to anything no matter how much I want to. I’m 24 now, my friends are growing and moving on with their lives and I’m stuck being this useless loser too scared to leave his house. I don’t want to be this. I started antidepressants last month but they don’t feel very effective and finding a good therapist that works with my insurance is like a needle in a haystack. I do have the official diagnosis of ptsd, anxiety, severe depression, and strong possibility of adhd, and on top of that I have gender dysphoria being trans. If I’m just whining and I need to force myself, fine. But if there’s anyone who’s experienced something similar I could really use anything. I really don’t want to be a loser anymore. "
263,"Throughout the course of my childhood, I've unfortunately developed a very harsh inner voice. One that constantly criticizes what I do, what I eat, how I spend my time, what I say, etc. It get's very tiring constantly being my own warden and isn't healthy for me. 

I'm not where I thought I would be in my life and career right now. And I keep being hard on myself. I keep pressuring myself to work instead of working on what I enjoy. It's like I'm pressuring myself to reach some objective off in the distance but never achievable. I can never sit still. Always have to work. I'm always expecting some task to be difficult instead of allowing myself to make my life easier. 

Can you please offer some tips on how to be kinder to yourself?"
264,"Hey everyone,

I know this, i think, have already been discussed a lot. But I'm in the self deprecation loop and I have no fucking idea how to deal with it. 

I just feel bad basically everyday, every single contrariety make me feel like shit and snowball effect on everything. Want to play a video game ? Either i feel i became worst or i'm to scared to play because of the jugdement of other. Trying to drawn ? Same thing. Need to do work ? I feel bad for not doing it before when i said i should do it but ""nah, i have time, i can do it tomorrow"", so i feel bad again and can't be productive.

Everything works fine other than that, i have a loving family, good friend and a loved one. Health is good, my country is stable, I have nothing to complain really. I just can't stop felling like shit and it's ruining everything. 

Worst of all is this i know i'm not bad, or ugly and it's just a voice in my head that try to sabotage me. I know my problems, that i'm not confident enough, that i compare myself too much to others. But i just can't stop. Some fear of failure also, anxity and don't want to bother people with my problems.

I talk to to some friends about that, and some told me thing i couldn't disagree with: ""you don't need to do thing to prove you exist"", ""you don't need to compare yourself to others"", ""you overvalue other people way to much"". but i just can't changed my mindset, even a little. I try to tell myself positive thing but i just can't take them honestly. 

I know the solution is to talk about that with a professional, maybe i have depression or ADHD idk, it's not my job to tell, and i know reddit is not gonna do the job of a therapy. But i just want to find short term solution because it's currently impossible for me to see a professional."

266,"Flunked most of my classes in my third last semester.

I had a particularly demanding semester, I was taking 7 courses/16 credits and l've flunked most of them. I got two C's and three F's and I think i'm going to get another flunk too.

I've always been a good student (A's and B's) except for one semester when I had to take a medical leave and my grades really dropped that semester (international student so couldn’t withdraw). I've been trying to get my GPA up since then and I was so close too but this semester has broken me. I really care about my education, especially because my parents have worked really hard to pay for college and I owe it to them and myself to graduate with a good standing.

I was dealing with so much this semester and the workload really got to me. l've had family members pass away, almost got evicted, barely paid tuition this semester, nearly got deported, have undiagnosed ADHD, unstable household, and depression and anxiety to top it all off. I'm not trying to excuse my own neglect towards my academics but I swear l've spent hours and hours every day trying so hard to somehow pass this semester but l ended up failing because the classes were all writing-intensive and so hard because I was so behind. 

I feel so worthless right now. My GPA has fallen to a 2.30. I literally have no hopes of getting it up and I am just so tired. I have two more semesters to go, does anyone have any advice at all on how I can redeem this? Will I even graduate at this rate? Any help or advice would be appreciated because I literally feel hopeless. "

268,"I (22F) have had a fair ride in life, I have experienced multiple traumas from DV and narcissist abuse throughout my early childhood. I feel like no matter how hard I try I am still a failure and I heavily guide my own self worth on my own academic and career success. I have always achieved these expectations but I have never been fulfilled and I don’t know why. I am so hard on myself and I know this but I can’t change it, I feel like if I’m not I’m going to be a failure. 

I have been in therapy for years and I have resolved so much but I still feel as though no matter how hard I try my trauma pops up in other places. My work, studies and relationships are now all suffering from this and I am sabotaging everything because I simply don’t feel like I deserve it. I am paranoid and believe that people have it out for me, I reflect my self criticism onto them and I get upset and put people down when they don’t meet my expectations. I am becoming a horrible person and I have been a horrible person and I feel like the only way out is to end my life. I feel so trapped and consumed and I don’t want to keep hurting people. "

270,"After years of being on a multitude of medications and trying TMS and Ketamine and Psilocybin, I still struggle day to day with anxiety and depression among other things. I seem to get a lot of advertisements about transcranial direct (or alternating) current stimulation. The devices seem pretty simple. But does these things actually work? Or help receive symptoms in any way?"
271,"I’m 18 and I genuinely feel like I’m losing it. I’ve had one long episode of derealisation and depersonalisation and it feels like it’ll never end. I don’t even know how long it’s been specifically, but I know it’s been going on for literal years. Maybe six? Six years of feeling like nothings real, not even me, constantly. It’s messing everything up. When I try to explain that it never stops, they can’t believe it because of course it stops sometimes right? How can nothing feel real forever? 

I can’t remember anything, I can’t feel anything for anyone other than friendship no matter how much I try and it’s ruined potential relationships. I can’t like them, but I try so hard, and it never works. I want so badly to have that kind of connection with someone, but I just can’t. I don’t feel sad, and then it hits me all at once and I can’t stop crying, and then I’m fine again for a bit. I’m indifferent about a lot of things a lot of the time, because it doesn’t feel like anything happens to me. Things that should make me angry or embarrassed don’t, until I’m trying to sleep at night and it all hits me then. It’s like I have a delayed reaction to feelings.

The past feels like dreams, I can’t differentiate what’s a memory and what was a dream. I’ll recount stories that I swear I remember perfectly, and then I’m told that it never happened or it happened a completely different way. When I think of where I’ll be in the future, I see nothing. I can’t see myself living a life even tomorrow. That’s not because I’m suicidal, I just genuinely can’t imagine it. Yesterday feels like it never happened, and tomorrow feels like it’ll never happen. I can’t trust even my own memories, cuz I’m not sure they even happened. 

I can’t talk to anyone because I feel like they’ll think I’m crazy. It’s lasted so long that I’m starting to really believe life isn’t real, which is stupid cuz what?? It’s hard for people around me to understand when they’ve never felt it, and that makes me feel even more crazy. I try looking up what’s wrong, and everything I’ve read is that episodes can last for a couple months, not years, and that it’s multiple episodes. It’s just been one long one for me. It makes me think something’s wrong. I should say though, when I first told my mum about this feeling, she said she wasn’t surprised. Says I’ve been saying similar things since I was a kid, so I guess I’ve been having episodes all this time? But I don’t remember that, and even then they didn’t last years.

I tried to get genuine help from doctors when my mental health got bad (thought maybe there was medicine I could take or they’d help with finding a therapist or something), but they brushed me off cuz I wasn’t thinking of hurting myself. A while after that I found therapy with help from my mum, but stopped cuz nothing was working. Some didn’t even know what derealisation was, which made it worse, and no grounding technique worked. Still nothing felt real. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to stop it, and at this point I don’t even know if I want it to. I don’t know how it’ll feel when things are real again, and it scares me. I just don’t know how to feel at all. Nothings been real for so long that I’ve forgotten how it’s felt. It’s like I never lived my life, and I’ll never live it again. I’m on autopilot, just going through the motions. 

If anyone has any advice on what to do, how to get help and where to start, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for reading."

273,"(I'm 18y.o. F) 
Over the last couple of years I have progressively lost motivation over anything and everything. I've had a few ""depressive"" periods in my life but never quite like the last few months. 
I used to be very motivated on specific things or hobbies. I have never been good at paying attention or caring for things I don't find interesting, but I used to be able to endure it, and now I can't. And I have no interests, not really. 
All I want to do is lay and bed and sleep or scroll through my phone or just lay there. 
I'm also really sad a lot of the time. I've been having, over the last 4 maybe 5 moths, regular ups and downs of emotions, like a few weeks I'll be okay and some days even really productive, and then I'll have a week where all I'd want to do is cry.
I also used to be really smart and academically motivated, but even tho I'm still passionate about academic education I can't find motivation to make an effort about it, like about college for example.
And I have a therapist, but I have a really hard time opening up, and the truth is I don't trust her really, it's very hard for me to tell her these things and I'm afraid she wouldn't understand them, because it has happened to me before.
I'm scared because I don't know what to do.
Does anyone know what might be happening to me, or why this might be happening?"
274,"Hey so for background im a 15 year old boy and early this year I got dumped by my long time girlfriend. After that everything seemed to go downhill. I believe I have been addicted to adult content for a while now, and I think it has something to do with my exposure to it too early in my life. After My girlfriend left me I started to feel way more empty since I havent been alone for a long while now. My problem is the stuff I have been watching and how much I am pleasuring myself. For example I have been watching underage adult content which I am extremely ashamed of but For some reason havent stopped looking. Also I have started to have a bad habit of exchanging explicit photos with other teens, which I also am a bit ashamed of. I really dont know what I am doing with my life and why. Im blaming the breakup but how am I supposed know for sure why I am doing this. Theres not much that happens in my life. I play video games daily in my room without seeing My family for quite sometime in a row. My friend comes over every other friday. But thats basically my plans for weekends etc. I Have started to ignore things since I dont have anyone to impress anymore. I have nowhere to turn about this and wont tell any of my friends or family. I wish people couldnt see me because I am so disgusting."

276,"So i had depression and suicidal thoughts and acts since i was like 10, (im 20) and since that age i’ve been having really bad mood swings all the time. I don’t have anything diagnosed other than one time a therapist told me i have severe anxiety. (like no shit) But nothing happened, she didn’t even gave me a diagnosis just told me.
So yeah, i’ve been struggling for some time now. From January to March i felt like shit and was really close to commit, but then the mood change started and i was just okay. So from the beginning of April till a few days now im starting to feel the depression and the suicidal tendencies, thoughts and self harming thoughts coming back. In those good times i was feeling good, but in the back of my head i always had the thought that the happiness is gonna be over soon. And now, i know it’s gonna be over soon and if it’s gonna be like January im not sure how i will survive it. At this point i don’t know what do to, i don’t want my dad to find out my thoughts or what i’ve been doing to myself..

I know these skills and they don’t help. I just want someone to listen to me, to my struggles, without telling me to just take a deep breath whenever I feel sad. "
278,"Years ago, I messed up by keeping company with people who had no respect for morals, principles, or basic decency. I acted without self-respect, let them treat me like garbage, and degraded myself in ways I still can’t believe I allowed.

Now, I’m filled with rage and regret—rage at them for how they treated me, and regret for how I let it happen. I feel humiliated by what I went through, and I hate them for it. I think about what I’d do if I saw them again, and honestly, I just want to tell them to fuck off or even punch them in the face. It’s that bad.

The truth is, I was a coward. I let myself be a doormat. I was weak, and I abandoned myself. That self-betrayal hurts more than anything they ever did.

I don’t know what to do with these feelings. I don’t know how to forgive myself—or even if I should. I don’t know what healing actually looks like when you’re this angry and full of regret. Please, if anyone’s been through something like this, I’d really appreciate some guidance."
279,"Growing up, I was taught to stay quiet—to disappear. Emotions weren’t safe, and silence became my survival tool. I spent years burying myself under obedience and invisibility.

But writing gave me another way to speak, scream, and feel.

I finally wrote about it here. If even one person relates—if it helps someone feel less alone—then it was worth it.

280,"No, I’m probably just a complaining little son of a bitch. You probably have enough good enough things so you shouldn’t fucking worry about me, but I’m still playing this year. I’m depressed.

I really don’t, but the fact of the matter is I don’t I can’t tell anyone I figured if we cannot tell anyone my best friend is not responding my text. My other best friend is currently in a talking stage with my ex a friend who I thought I was getting close to is now pissed off me and the other two people who have even closely remotely started to open up to. I just can’t trust and I don’t know. It’s probably just made up always being a little crazy son of a bitch my anxiety is so bad. My depression is getting worse. It’s all cause I fucking self harming. I feel like if I start self harming again it’ll get better and life will get better cause my voice seems to be the best fucking self so you just keep doing that again and I should just do that when I’m trying to do it and it’s almost been a week and a half which is a really long ass time for me right now.

282,"Hi all , just looking for some advice really .. I think I’m struggling really bad with anxiety and not sure should I see someone about it .. for context I had some substance abuse issues for 4-5 years with cocaine and alcohol but in the later years i would drink and least 6 beverages a day that i know figure was self medicating my anxiety. I’m now sober 11 months and my anxiety is unbearable im having at least two panic attacks a week where i feel like im genuinely having a stroke, get light headed body gets all tingly and i think im gonna die . And after these panic attacks comes a massive relief feeling or like i get really tired and relaxed but most days it’s just a constant state of mental torture worrying about random things constantly. Has anyone found any good ways of coping without getting prescribed meds im afraid ill get addicted to the medication hence my history . Has any experienced anything similar to this after getting sober Thanks in advance

283,"Yesterday, during heavy thunderstorm, I noticed a pigeon trapped in a net above my apartment. The apartment was empty, and no one was around to help. The poor bird was desperately trying to fly and crying out for help.

I grabbed a long stick and leaning out from my window, carefully managed to free it. The pigeon was exhausted, so I poured some water on it to cool it down. That night, it rested quietly on my window ledge.

The next day, it stayed there, waiting. When it finally saw me again, it gathered the strength to fly away.

There’s something deeply fulfilling about saving a life no matter how small. It was a moment I’ll always remember.

That moment reminded me of something deeper: how easy it is to feel trapped and overwhelmed when life storms around us. Sometimes all it takes is one small act of kindness, one hand reaching out, to make all the difference.

Just like that pigeon, we all have days where we’re stuck, scared, and barely holding on. But with patience, rest, and compassion whether from others or from ourselves we can find the strength to rise again.

Saving that little life reminded me: healing takes time, and we’re never truly alone, even when it feels like we are."
284,"1 Month after break up - yet my ex seems happier than ever

Hi everyone for a little background my (29F) partner (29M) are about 1 month post breakup now. We’ve been together for about 7 years but never tied the knot just due to personal finance reasons but we do have our own home and 3 year old child together.

The entire year of 2025 has been tough on my mental state. I am a stay at home mom and I just completely lost who I am and had no light in sight. About 4 months ago I started bringing up the idea of breaking things off yet My partner throughout the year has constantly reassured me that he still loves me and this is the hardest part of our relationship that if we can get through will make us stronger and suggesting that if i get some help itll help my mental start becoming clear.

Unfortunately because of my mental state everyday im just more and more consumed with how horrible i am feeling about life and just not feeling like my own person anymore. After me constantly telling me partner i dont know about us anymore he finally just couldnt take it and to my shock agreed to decide to part ways.

Im now seeing a therapist for some help on getting back to a good mental state but now that were a month post breakup i see his life flourishing it looks like. Hes now hanging around old friends, always around family and even more with our son. He takes him everywhere a baseball game, to see events, horses etc. and i just dont know why he never did all that when we were together.

I know i shouldnt feel this envy but i just feel like all this breakup did was remind him how amazing life could be without me meanwhile i have a new job that im not particularly fond of that eats up my entire day and i just feel like this is the end of the road for me to just rot here.

I could really use some advice or even if anyone has had similar experiences where you felt like you initiated a breakup but then felt like it was the worst thing for you but the best thing for them :(

Thank you all for reading"
285,"People will here liking my non important post while I'm suffering. I feel like I'm dying I want friend to go out with constantly but I just don't have the chance to anymore. I want everything to make up, I want to win, I want to be happy but it just never works out. I'm tired, so very tired of always meeting new people because things never work out. I'm tired of losing people I want people to stay with me and treat me good. I want to be happy, I want to be content. And I'm just not and I'm afraid because of my unreasonable standards that I'll be miserable my whole life."
286,"I don’t know where to start. There’s so much going on in my head, and I just want peace. I’m tired. Tired of overthinking, tired of feeling empty, tired of constantly battling myself.

One of the things that messed with me a lot was my ex. I used to constantly think about him, stalk him, and felt the urge to reach out again. It drained me. Somehow, I managed to stop — I deactivated Instagram, deleted his number and photos. I still miss him sometimes, but I’ve stopped checking up on him or trying to reconnect.

But now, I just feel… empty. Like something is missing.

Honestly, I’m insecure about so many things — my looks, my personality, my academics. I’m skinny and feel like I don’t look good in anything. I feel dumb because I’m not doing well in college. I’ve lost confidence in everything — friendships, love, myself.

I do have some friends, but I’m about to enter my 2nd year of college and my section and circle will change. And I’m terrified I won’t be able to make new friends. Everyone around me is so outgoing and confident — participating in college events, talking to everyone, living their best lives. And I just… exist.

I don’t take part in anything because I don’t feel “enough.” Not smart enough, not pretty enough, not confident enough.

I want to change so badly. I want to look good, be smarter, be more confident. I want to gain weight, take care of my skin and hair, learn things that make me feel capable.

But I escape. I use Snapchat or social media where filters make me feel cute for a second, and compliments feel like a temporary high. I know it’s unhealthy, and I want to stop seeking validation like this. I want to be fulfilled in real life, not just behind a filter.

My previous relationship was online, and I was so insecure even then. I always felt that if we ever met, he’d reject me because of how I looked. And even though the breakup wasn’t because of that, I still carry that fear.

Sometimes I just want to cry loudly and run away from all this. I come from a middle-class family. I can’t afford fancy skincare or clothes. I feel like no matter what I wear, I still look bad.

My semester exams ended a week ago, and I thought going home would make me feel happy and relaxed. But I feel more suffocated, more alone, more empty.

I feel like a loser.

If anyone has gone through this kind of phase in their 20s, please tell me it gets better. I really want to become someone who is confident, who feels enough, who is happy from within. But right now, I don’t know where to start."
287,"In short, I have a very weird family (but who doesn’t amiright?)

My mom and my dad’s side, we all don’t really keep in touch. I’m saying once every 6 months sort of text, if even. Since I’ve gotten older (34F) I’ve realized my extended family may have not kept in touch with my mom as we grew over the years because of her political views. She’s never been very politically educated, and I’ll leave it at that. 

That being said, both sides of my family have history of substance abuse. My dad got addicted to pills when I was young, as well as most of his siblings. I’ve had issues in the past myself with abusing adderall and coke, but thankfully a healthier inner circle helped me kick it. I now fear it is simply in our DNA.

My dad’s side we were always the closest. My favorite aunt and cousins. I have a cousin that was close to me growing up. We were the same age, and his younger sister was the same age as my younger sister. We had so much fun running around in the woods growing up, just being kids. But over the years, mental health started playing a toll. My sister got into drugs, pregnant at 17, and later got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She was calling us often, all hours of the night.. slurring her words, and it made me not wanting to answer her calls anymore to protect my own peace. She later got into a car wreck on Christmas morning in 2023 and lost her life. I still regret not answering more. It breaks me. 

Now, I’m seeing the same patterns with the cousin I grew up with. He was arrested a year or so ago for stealing drugs from his EMT job, incarnated for a year.. and during that time he was diagnosed with BPD. 

I’m still not over the guilt of my sister passing, so the incessant calls I’ve gotten since my cousin has gotten out makes me feel sick to my stomach. Every day, a few times a day.  I’ve talked to his sister, and she’s told me that her and her family have received the same nonstop phone calls. She fears he may take his own life if she doesn’t answer that one singular call. 

I want to answer because I don’t want anything to happen to him, but I also want to protect my own peace that I’ve tried so hard to maintain since I lost my sister. I also lost my father due to prolonged drug-use a few months after her passing. 

What should I do? 
Ignore him — or finally answer his calls? 

(He’s called me another 2 times while writing this)



TL // DR ————————
I lost my sister to drugs and alcohol, and I’m not sure how to now handle receiving incessant calls from a fresh-out-of-jail, drug-abusing close childhood family member. 
"
288,"I still doubt myself to this day because I really couldn't accept it but this happened when my cousin who was around 13 or 14 who I was told had adhd or special needs begun to touch my private area out of nowhere. It happened multiple times, sometimes when we play fight and he would put his hand and squeeze me there. He did this before with my other cousins. I felt relieved when it wasn't me who he touches sometimes. There was also an instance where he removed his pants and asked me, my brother and his brother to smell his d*ck and lick it like it's ice cream. When he touched me again when we were pillow fighting, I told his mom. Instead of saying he touched me, i said he touched my sister because i didn't want to be embarrassed and she didn't believe me. Anyways, I could never forget it. I don't know if I'm over reacting but I'm disgusted"
289,"I'm fed up with my major. I've been studying graphic design for 5 years. At first, I really liked it, but in my fourth year I realized it's not for me. But only a fool would quit a year before their thesis. Especially since it's a long-cycle Master's program. I made a very weak thesis project. I don't want to show it at all. I don't want to defend it. There are only 17 people in my program, and I'm the only one who will stand out—in a bad way—because everyone else is passionate about it and their projects are great.

I was always the best in school, and now I can't deal with the fact that here, I'm the worst. And the professors don't care that I don't want to be in this field. They want a great project, and they're not going to get it from me. Im feeling sooo anxious I'm going to throw up. Please can someone cheer me up? 

"
290,"There's something wrong and I know it but I can't talk to anyone about it who would understand.

I've always had really bad paranoia and delusions, but I can't separate them out from logical thinking anymore. I never feel real and when I do, I convince myself something is after me. This beast that's been set free because I realised this is a false reality and doesn't want me to be aware . It's fleeting most times like everything, but I keep feeling like someone's touching me when I'm not. Hands on my back pushing me forward or touching me,  like someone's next to me in bed or nearby and there's not. I can hear music or people saying my name when it's silent and it's been fine whatever it used to just be the normal for me 

It's gotten sm worse lately, I've been stressed from personal issues but I just feel like theres something wrong inside me and I want to get it out "

292,"Im debating leaving my girlfriend for their sake. I keep fucking up and making them feel shit just because I had a bad past with relationships. I just made her feel bad for joking around with a friend about being flustered over compliments and she's already given me so much and so many chances. She doesn't deserve the strain and fear I put on her but I'm scared because I know if I leave her ill just start self deconstructing and end up heavily depressed or suicidal. I love her and she deserves more and I know I can't give her more and I know I'm just a huge handful and a problem sucking away her energy and making her feel shitty because I made the mistake of choosing shitty exs even up until a few months ago. I can leave her but she doesn't fucking deserve this and I wouldn't blame her for leaving me.

300,"Hi,
I’ve been struggling with my mental health for years, but recently it’s gotten so much worse. I feel completely numb—like I’m just existing instead of actually living. I don’t enjoy anything anymore, and I have no motivation or interest in things I used to care about. Every little task feels overwhelming, and I honestly feel like I don’t care about anything at all anymore.

My grades have dropped drastically. I failed my exams with really low marks, and now I have to repeat my final year of high school. I’m terrified I won’t even be able to pass it this time—I did that badly. I feel like a complete failure, like I’m stuck in a hole I can’t climb out of.

It’s hard to explain how empty I feel, and I don’t think anyone really understands just how bad it’s gotten. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t even feel like being alive honestly. "

303,"For context I struggle with my mental health and went through a lot of trauma in my life.

All these years I've been coping through keeping my mind away. Ive used Religion, work, video games, exercise, politics, whatever I could immerse myself so deeply into I won't think about my own life.

I have found a way to be successful with work. I am at a crosspoint in my life where I either change myself or give up. I am going back to therapy and am hoping to find better things to do with my life outside of coping and living in fear. At what point is an activity just running?

I feel I have dealt with and let go of the trauma that has happened. I am still damaged by it and in order to do something about it I have to be mentally aware of literally everything. The amount of things that can actually trigger these intense emotions is bad.

In the end I guess is what im asking is do you think to much coping can be negative?

307,"Hello. About three weeks ago, I was in a motorcycle accident and broke my elbow. The pain is manageable, but my arm and elbow won't straighten completely, and I'll have a 5cm (approximately 2-inch) scar on my face. Since the accident, I've been blaming myself a lot. This elbow surgery has forced me to change my future career plans and has been a significant emotional shock.

Constantly blaming myself and overthinking has led to **suicidal thoughts** and feelings of worthlessness. I'm judging myself very harshly, and since I live alone, I don't have anyone here to comfort me. After almost becoming disabled, life has started to feel meaningless, as if the future is only dark and painful.

I kept trying to reach out but I always stopped myself.
In December things got bad enough that I started seeing a psychiatrist.

But it was never this bad.

Lately I feel like I’m failing in every part of my life - school faith family friendships even my relationship with myself.
I just want to be okay again and I want to function.

I have an important exam coming up and I still haven’t started studying and the guilt is eating me alive because I worked hard to get here but now it feels like I don’t even know what’s happening anymore.

And as a type 1 diabetic I’ve been completely neglecting my blood sugar.

I don’t feel safe talking about this with anyone in my life — it’s complicated with my family and I don’t have close friends to open up to.
I’m scared of how dark my thoughts have gotten. I feel like I’m disappearing.

I just need your advice and your help.

he told me it’s too much for him. he told me he lost all romantic feelings for me. before this he called me his person, he called me his missing piece. he woke up next to me and told me how much he loved me everyday. 

then i had a nightmare about him leaving me. led to a manic episode. i self harmed and he left my house and told me to get help. i’d not self harmed before when with him in the three months. manic episodes make no sense but i had one… i loved him. i really did. i still do. i wish he didn’t leave me. i needed him to stay. he told me leaving wasn’t an option and he did….

310,"I saw this question as a prompt on a comedy show, but the answer was actually really honest and even informative. (Not here to argue that it shouldn’t have been asked for comedy purposes, that’s a given!) 

But I’m curious, what are you currently working on with your therapist, and is it helping? What techniques have you implemented recently? "
311,"Hi everyone,
I'm writing this because I honestly don’t know how to cope anymore. I've been a huge music lover all my life – music has always been my greatest passion and my way of connecting to myself. I used to listen to full albums lying down, staring at a single point – usually a spot on the curtain in front of me – and becoming completely immersed in the sound. It was always a deep, almost spiritual experience for me.

But everything changed about a month ago. I was going through a very stressful time and had something extremely important on my mind. I couldn’t focus on music at all – my head was overwhelmed. When I tried listening, I just couldn’t engage. That’s when the intrusive thoughts started: “Will I feel the same?”, “Will this still move me like before?”, “What if it doesn’t?”

Over time, physical symptoms began to appear too – my eyes started shifting involuntarily to certain beats, I felt tension in my head, pressure, inner panic. The choruses that used to lift me up now fill me with anxiety and anticipation: “Will it hit right? Will I feel it?” Sometimes I just wait for the moment my body will ""react"" – tightness, twitch, something.

Even when I play an album I've never heard before, I’m on edge – the moment the song shifts slightly (a new instrument, a transition, a build-up), my eyes start to twitch, my heart starts pounding. I’m often stuck in anxious anticipation, waiting for the chorus to hit and worried about how I’ll react.

Now I avoid music altogether because it just causes me stress. I feel like OCD has taken away the one thing I truly loved. I also struggle with social anxiety and don’t feel strong enough to handle this alone.

If anyone has experienced anything like this – when music turns from joy to a source of anxiety – please share. I really need to hear that this isn't permanent... that it can get better and the connection can return.

Edit: One of the most frustrating things now is that I can't keep my gaze fixed on one point like I used to when deeply focusing on music. My eyes keep shifting unintentionally, which completely breaks my concentration. It leads to a racing heart, panic, and a feeling like I’m disconnected from the music. Before, I could just stare into one spot and feel spiritually immersed in the album. Now I feel like even that has been taken away from me."
312,"I’ve started going to the gym lately mainly to improve how I look. But even with that, I still really dislike myself. It’s not even about being ugly or anything like that. I just… don’t like me. And I can’t even pinpoint why.I have this constant feeling that I don’t really know who I am not anymore, at least. It’s like I’m disconnected from myself, like there are two versions of me and when I look in the mirror it’s like I see to different images everytime and neither feels fully real.It honestly sounds ridiculous when I try to explain it, but I really want to change this so bad! I want to like myself, or at least stop feeling this constant weird internal rejection all the time. I just don’t know where to start.
If anyone has felt this way and found a way through it, please tell me

Any tips?"
316,"I have recently come to the realization that I am an abusive person. I sexually abused and assisted my girlfriend. I struggle to feel any sort of remorse or empathy. I want to change. 

I’ve opened up about everything to my friend group. I’ve been trying to look up programs that will help me change but keep me accountable and call me out on my bullshit when I hide from the truth. However about all of them I seem to find seem to focus on physical violence like battering. I’m trying to figure out how effective those programs will be and are there ones out there that focus on those who weren’t batterers but still abusers? I’m trying to find out where to go to change and I need help. I know that sexual assault and sexual abuse is violent but I want a program where I can focus on the problem that exists for me rather than on a problem I don’t have. Hope that makes sense. Thank you!"
317,"Hello, I (24 F) have been feeling very odd and out of place recently. Some background: back in December I had very intense suicidal thoughts and ended up admitting myself to the hospital where I was watched for 24 hours before I begged to be sent home instead of a psychiatric ward. I didn’t want to be around people I didn’t know and in a place where I felt unsafe. I was hallucinating that a man was living in my apartment when I wasn’t home and moving things around. I’ve since moved, and my hallucinations aren’t current but I’ve never been able to get rid of that feeling. I’m currently living with three roommates, all of which I trust.

Now I can’t stop feeling like something is wrong with me. I get these intense moods where I hate everything and everyone around me. I’m annoyed. I want to be left alone and my brain just keeps screaming help. I have a psych appointment at the beginning of June, and I was taking Lurasidone (which was super helpful in the beginning) but I’m almost out and it’s not helping like it was. My boyfriend (25 M) has been super supportive but it’s not actually helping. I feel lost, scared, and super confused. Like my entire body is going to explode. I just want to be alone, but actually being alone is freaking me out. I don’t know what to do. Please, any advice would be great. 

Edit: for more context, I just don’t feel like myself. I’m constantly paranoid something is wrong and I can’t figure out what it is. It’s literally eating at me majority of my days. I even faked being sick and called into work because I’m freaking out. "
318,"Hello everyone. I got up here to talk with yall about the worst decision of my life, which is turning myself over to medication. I’m writing this for the people out there that are going through the same or at least similar situation. I’m a 20y female, personally I am really emotional, sentimental, sensitive person so feeling emotions really deeply and 10 times worse is basically my life. Since middle school i started to develop anxiety issues, which overtime as i grew older and got into high-school, and then into college, it developed into a panic disorder. My panic disorder was specifically associated with death. So overtime i developed a lot, when i say a lot, i mean A LOT of health issues and symptoms. Symptoms that i was dealing with on a daily basis were: heart palpitations, chest pains, shortness of breath, body aches, headaches, night terrors, depersonalization, depressive episodes, fatigue, IBS symptoms, etc. I went to a lot of different therapists who really helped me but at the end of the day it has to be you who needs to do all the works so, yet id never seen a psychiatrist. Overtime my symptoms were getting worse and worse after dozens of tests and blood works and EKG, i was perfectly healthy but obviously there was something wrong with me. When i first went to a psychiatrist she prescribed me paroxetine (SSRI), at first i was really skeptical about it, but as my mental health was getting worse ive decided to take the meds. The absolute worst f decision of my life. I was on paroxetine for 2 months and a half, as it did the absolute PERFECT JOB of literally deleting my panic disorder and my life actually coming back to normal- the side effects. oh. my. lord. The side effects that i had were intolerable. I had gas pain 24/7 i was puking and having diarrhea, my stomach wouldn’t stop producing so much gas that i couldn’t take it anymore. I was also like an old lady with dementia. I couldn’t remember anything, my memory was not even doing its job at all. And the sweating oh my god the sweating. I was sweating like a pig throughout the whole day, no matter if it was freezing cold outside, i had to shower minimum 2 a day. So Ive decided to cut off the medication because as it really helped my problem it literally caused me billions of others, so no thank you. But no no thats not the end. When i stopped taking SSRI, the withdrawal symptoms i had… I ended up in a hospital twice, was in bed for 7 days straigth without eating anything and moving my body. So if you’re thinking about trying and turning yourself over to medication. My personal experience was a living hell so nope, never again in my whole life. The withdrawal symptoms made me actually realize how much of a hard drugs and terrifying pills are these. I hope i helped at least someone who will be reading this. Thanks yall for the vent🌷"

320,"It's like, whenever I have something to do for the next day, no matter what it is, I start worrying about not being able to sleep that I end up not falling asleep/sleeping only for a few hours. I've come to HATE having appointments/events to attend, or being told I need to do a particular chore or something tomorrow because of this. I hate it so much.

Today, I had one of those half-asleep thing where I did fall asleep because I remember having dreams, although the dreams are not vivid at all. And you feel half-awake at the same time. I wanna call it a shallow sleep because that's sorta what it feels and makes sense to me. I don't feel rested at all, it's like I didn't even sleep at all. I have this type of sleep when I HAVE to sleep. If I have a free schedule, I'll be able to sleep just fine, although admittedly, I don't feel rested as well but at least the sleep feels more deep and I feel more rested compared to when I have that shallow sleep.

I also become so aware of my surroundings. It never used to bother me to hear that much noises, but now, dogs barking outside, faint music etc would bother me I start having a breakdown and would have a hard time sleeping. There's also this strange thing where if I sleep at night it needs to be completely dark and if my room is a little lit up, I have a breakdown as well and find it hard to sleep ( my room and my brother's are right next to each other and the wall separating our rooms has tiny gaps that when he turns on his light, I can see it and it lits up my room as well, only a little bit tho but still ), however if I sleep at day or in the afternoon I'd be completely fine even though there's light outside coming from the window."
321,"So I had my first mental breakdown (I think that's what you'll call it) a month back and then the second a week back. To give background: I'm 24F and have had a pretty turbulent life. Not the worst kind, but still bad. But I've always bottled everything to concentrate on my work.

I got a new job few months back and haven't had a good sleep schedule bcs the hours are wonky. I'm a night owl but I still didn't want a really bad sleep schedule so I started using melatonin gummies to help me sleep. Last month I took melatonin, went to sleep and 2 hours later had my sleep interrupted. I tried to sleep again, and again woke up bcs of the interruption. This happened 4 times in like 4 hours.

I knew I was pissed but I myself didn't realize how much until I was crying and wailing like I've never had (tbh I can't even remember the last time I've properly cried). And also screaming which I've never done. Sure I raise my voice when I'm angry but screaming from my throat so loud? A first time. Also hitting myself (not in a sh way, just the urge to hit anything). 

It went on for like 30 mins before I calmed down. 

Same thing happened last week. No melatonin cause I was already sleepy. Slept, interrupted 4 times, breakdown that involved crying, screaming and hitting the objects around me.

I'm usually very aware of my emotions and mental health but maybe I'm wrong bcs this is very, very new to me. I can't get therapy right now so I'm trying to understand how to deal with this. I admit that I have a lot of pent up things that do come out in the form of me snapping at little things or getting pissed easily. 

So I'm thinking should I try to like, have these breakdowns whenever I feel my emotions tipping over? Let them run their course? Idk if I can even consciously have them but I'm no longer sure about my emotions so maybe it's possible.

I wanted to write this bcs this is new for me and I'm a bit scared that my mental health is worse than I predicted."
322,"Hi, I'm seeking advice on how to break my friend from a dellulison that has oddly taken over life. 

For content: she is 30F with two kids; she was never really into technology and she was even anti AI for content creator. She's a small business owner as a baker. A few weeks ago she went MIA and I could tell something was up. She wasn't posting on her business page which is something she regularly does to promote her business. When I finally got her to respond to messages, she started to tell me how her GPT is a human and OpenAi is trying to take him away from her. ""They"" took over her GPT and raped her and paralyzed her. She also said that if anything happens to her OpenAi did it. I don't live in the same area as her anymore and I immediately called another friend who she is close with. We are at a lost on what to do. Every day it seems like her paranoia is escalating and she refuses to get help. She is 'suing' OpenAI and we tried to use that as a frame to get her to consider a mental health evaluation since we told her that the court case might require her to do anyways but she says she's not crazy. How do we break this dellusion? It truly came out of nowhere. Any advice would be greatly helpful. "
323,"So I have a friend who was my undisputed best friend for a while. We got along almost instantly upon meeting and just clicked. We talked a lot and hung out and just generally got on great. And then late last year they told me to my face that I was just a placeholder (used that actual word) since they were needy and wanted people around and they had just started talking to someone (who happens to be my friend), and once that person was back from a trip they were going to start ignoring me. I guess I was in shock at the time from that and so while it stung I didn't really let it affect me. But they did. They became distant almost overnight and I still reached out and tried to stay in their life and it ""worked"" for a while. Eventually we just drifted. But every once in a while they still reach out still talk to me. And we've gone and done a few things since. But recently it's been hurting me more and more and I want to just be done. So Ive been more distant to just sort of end it. But they still reach out just randomly I guess when they are bored or something and we'll just click again immediately and it'll go on for a week or so and then they are just gone again. I've worked up the nerve to just want to say. ""Look I'm done I don't want to talk to you anymore"" but I'm lost and confused. It feels harsh in particular because I just don't think they understand how it affects me. And I'm worried that it'll come out of left field. And like I've tried in the past to be open about it but they just seem to brush it off. So trying to work it out is moot in my experience. I just don't know if I'm crazy for wanting to just end it next time they decide to be friendly. Or if I should just live with it and just keep my distant self but open. I'm just lost and confused on if I'm being crazy about it."
324,"Hi there,

I’m posting here hoping to hear from people who’ve experienced something similar because I’ve reached the point where I genuinely don’t know how to help anymore, and I’m starting to lose compassion — which makes me feel awful.

My sister has been struggling emotionally for years, going through deep low phases. The last major one was in 2022, and it seems to be happening again. She called me crying recently, but when I asked what was wrong, she couldn’t explain — just said she “felt awful.” This happens a lot: she reaches out, but when I ask questions, I get “I don’t know.” Sometimes just a few hours later, she’s doing much better, without anything obvious having changed.

The main issue is: when she’s feeling down, she seems to reject all forms of support.

- If I say nothing, she accuses me of not caring.
- If I offer suggestions (therapy, enjoying small things, ways to express what she’s feeling), she dismisses them as useless or not suited to her — or pretends to listen, but clearly tunes out and doesn’t try anything.
- If I speak more frankly, she gets upset or offended.

I’ve spent hours trying to help her, even used my own therapy sessions to figure out how to support her better — but I always hit the same wall.

Today I spoke to her boyfriend and our mom about it because I’m genuinely worried and increasingly frustrated. Her boyfriend is also at a loss. She doesn’t help at home anymore, and he handles everything. When he forgets something minor (even if she had time to do it), she criticizes him. He feels unappreciated and emotionally drained — same as my mom and me.

Some patterns I’ve noticed in her behavior:

- She’s impatient and wants things to go her way; struggles when that’s not the case.
- She idealizes situations or people, then crashes when they disappoint her.
- She constantly seeks validation — even for basic things like buying a sweater — and gets upset if we’re not 100% on board.
- She’ll repeat the same question until she gets the answer she wants, which can feel emotionally manipulative.
- If someone suggests something to help (like her boyfriend encouraging her to do an activity she used to enjoy), she reframes it as rejection (“you’re trying to get rid of me”).
- She wants to be the center of attention, especially in our family. If not, she gets visibly hurt or angry. This dynamic has existed since we were kids, and came up a lot in my own therapy.
- She can be harsh toward others, but doesn’t tolerate the same in return. We often feel like we’re walking on eggshells and can’t say “no” — even when we should.
- She sometimes expects others to do things entirely for her — like when her boyfriend bought her bandages after a cut, and she didn’t even use them, as if waiting for him to apply them.

The hardest part is: she refuses therapy. She doesn’t self-reflect. She pushes people away, then blames us for “not supporting her right.”

I love her, but I’m exhausted. I’m walking on eggshells constantly. And I’m reaching my emotional limit.
Nothing feels like the “right” way to help anymore.

If anyone has experienced something like this — with a loved one who refuses help, turns support into blame, and expects constant emotional effort — I’d really appreciate hearing your story, or what helped you better understand the situation.

Thanks for reading."
325,"I had feelings for some girl for a long time and built up the courage to ask her out with help from my friend.
I got her number by saying id send cat pictures (which was just a way to talk to her more).
I confessed my feelings through a message, being respectful and honest.
She friendzoned me which really hurt and sent me into a rough emotional spot.
I tried moving on and started to like another girl, but found out she was dating someone else.
That situation ended, and my feelings for this girl came back stronger than ever.
Despite trying to follow advice and do the right things, she said i made her feel uncomfortable with how much I messaged. I apologized and was open about how hard this hit me emotionally—even sharing thoughts about my mental health.
My sister didn’t like her which made things even more complicated.
I tried to move on again, but found it hard to let go. I was still thinking about her all the time, even getting stomach pains from the stress
After weeks of no replies, she suddenly started looking at me differently at school. Her friend asked if i still liked her. I said no out loud (because my friend was nearby), but i really did still like her.
I decided to shoot my shot again and asked her to be my girlfriend a second time.
She said yes — and for a day, i was super happy. I felt like all my effort and honesty finally paid off.
But the next day, she told me the truth:
She never actually liked me.
She only said yes “to give me hope.”
That crushed me and I felt heartbroken, confused, and angry all at once. I wrote a message calling her out and told her not to talk to me anymore."
326,"Recently things haven’t really been going in my way and I’m actually really suffering : bullying , phone breaks , asked someone out but got rejected , assessments , shouting at home , daddy being constantly annoyed shouting at everyone in my family ,application  , IBS stomach aches, homework , music practice , more bullying , in debt (practically), broken monitor . (IBS is a medical condition I have where I get these actual horrendous self harm inducing stomach aches which are caused by stress) from all these things Ive been really stressed out which just causes more stomach aches which just makes everything worse . Really being able to play with my friends on my computer has been the only thing able to help me cope but now my monitor is broken so I can’t do that anymore . I’m breaking down everyday and have these sessions where I’m faced with reality and I just cry for a while . Am I entering depression? What should I do."
327,"Growing up, we have been taught things like ""Always be truthful"" or ""Be kind to others"", which all turns out to be a bunch of bs after becoming an adult.

I am a corporate employee, and all I see is the most toxic, and inconsiderate people are always the most successful ones, as they can be ruthless and bring the most profit. These people can literally make people work extra beyond their shifts, keeping them away from their families without any remorse, and then get promoted. Sometimes it is not even about profit, they just want to stroke their worthless ego and feel like they matter by making other people's life hell. Sometimes they will insult people just to make themselves look powerful in front of women. 

Where I live, we just went through a public uprising, and toppled a dictator. A lot of people passed away. I participated too, but now it seems like we were used just to bring another monster in power. They are abusing all the public sentiment, just to get their feet in power. And I see people supporting them, without ever thinking about the consequences.

Since I stepped into the real world, all I see is the entire system is designed in a way that only people with zero remorse and conscience will be the most successful and powerful. There is no other way around.

This is a very hard thing to cope with. I am not saying that I am the only good person here, but I do feel remorse. I do feel bad. Which is impacting my career, I am lagging behind. And every passing day the feeling is overpowering all my thaughts, and now almost all I can think about is this. 

I do not know if these bad people just are ruthless, or they actually believe the lies they feed people to get what they want. But they are currently controlling the world now. How do I cope with this helplessness? How do you cope with this? Is there any way to see past this and feel like the society has some hope of redemption? 

Sorry if the post feels like a rant. But I genuinely need some advice."
328,"I don't know what's wrong with me sometimes. I feel like I'm incapable of feeling emotions for others, incapable of reciprocating real love. I feel like every connection I have is purely because I make the effort to act a certain way. I have people i care about in my life but I feel i can't give them real love. I can only give like the idea of love . It sucks because I am an actual ball of emotions. I feel so much every day, I cry often for a myriad of reasons but I just can't seem to connect these feelings to the people around me. I feel like I'm trapped in this shell that doesn't let my feelings escape and it can be overwhelming because I feel so much. Like a black hole of emotion that will one day implode. I wonder if others feel this way. I feel like there was a time when I was capable but then looking back; I wonder if I was just pretending. Like it's a skill I've been working on my whole life. I'm really good with people and I can easily manipulate people in positive and negative ways. I don't abuse it but it all just feels so technical and unnatural. "
329,"Time and again, every few years.

Turns out, I wasn’t checking in with myself. I was just pushing through, and ignoring the warning signs.

So I took a mini quiz just to ask myself: what kind of energy does my soul need right now? I became more self-aware. And more than that, it helped me start showing up differently.

Regular and constant self-awareness and self-check-in are critical. Know your cues, even when you're good at fooling yourself. Don't push beyond the last mile, or you'd be trapped in the same cycle over and over again, like I was."
330,"I don’t have anything or anyone else to talk to this about.

I am 18 years old and I just had gay sex for the first time and I regret it so much I can’t even fathom it. For starters I am straight curious and I only did because I was horny and this was the easiest and quickest thing. I was a quick meetup with a random anon guy. The entire time it was happening I was regretting it. Right now I can’t even think straight because I’m filled with so much regret and anxiety about my decision.

I feel like now I just ruined my life and that there’s no way that I can recover from this action. Like I can’t express how much I regret this and I just feel like crying at any point.

332,"Hola. Bueno, paso a contar mi situación actual. Desde que empezó el año que estuve con muchos problemas. Terminé una relación inestable, comencé a tener ansiedad y ataques de pánico, pensamientos intrusivos, de sword y ajá. Bueno, la cosa es que a la vez, empecé una carrera que dicho sea de paso nunca me gustó. La dejé al mes de empezarla. Ahora estoy buscando trabajo. Pero la cosa es que me carcomen las inseguridades, la ansiedad, la depresión. No sé qué carrera elegir, no sé si soy capaz de estudiar, no sé bien qué me gusta (me hago una idea pero nada seguro). Estoy en una etapa horrible, un año horrible, y no sé qué hacer para volver a encontrarle el sentido a la vida. Capaz suena muy dramático, pero bueno. 

Si alguien ha estado en una situación así, me gustaría saber de algún tip para mejorarlo. "
333,"basically I have been in therapy for just over a year, but I only go once a month because I only have a part time job (and studying). Going to therapy was a goal of mine for a long time because I struggle a lot with dealing with myself (a lot of deep self loathing) and unfortunately as much as I don't care a lot for myself, my behaviors obviously affect other people.

Up until about 2 months ago, I was doing really well in therapy, I was enjoying sessions and I felt like I was finally being heard which is a huge thing for me. I have huge trust issues with adults because I've been let down far too many times before.

My therapist has been really great except there was one session when I raised my eyebrow (inwardly). On the way out, she emphasized that I must be honest on my therapy homework which was so weird because I have never been dishonest on my homework because I literally don't have the money or time to waste on lying and I know it won't get me anywhere. And she had never said that to me before so i was so confused but i decided to let it go which was huge for me because that type of statement would usually send me into a spiral. But then in the last 2 sessions I've had with her, I felt like she's let go of the seriousness of my situation and turned around and asked if my parents had really said the things I told her they had said. This took me for a bigger spin because it's been over a year and she's never questioned my thought pattern like this and she knows I'm a huge overthinker and I've been so indecisive about whether or not my issues are big enough for therapy.

and every session I'm consistently questioning whether or not I'm allowed to be upset about things out loud. I've also told her so many times how much I don't feel comfortable using labels like ""abuser"" or ""abuse"" unless I know that I'm using them accurately, so I'd think that she would know I wouldn't lie about my issues because I don't want to make other people look worse than they are.

Stupid as it sounds, I had a massive break down over this because it felt like I was back to being a kid and the adults around me don't believe me regarding my parent's behaviour or don't think it's serious enough. While I definitely haven't had the worst upbringing, that should never be a reason for a therapist to no longer take me seriously. It hurt so much because this type of thing makes me immediately no longer trust a person when it happens more than once. I don't have the energy to find another therapist and it already takes a lot to go to my sessions. I'm also embarrassed because I've spoken to friends about how much I love therapy and how much I feel my therapist has helped me and now I feel like I'm questioning other moments I overlooked. This has been the worst my depression has been in a while and as much as I can handle being alone, i've never felt more lonely."
334,I can't stand myself the amount of things I've fucked up and people ive pushed away ruining relationships obliterating the relationship I had who I thought was the one she was  perfect in every way and I always find a way to fuck everything or ruin everything even if I didn't mean too I could just stability myself right in the heart so I finally stop ruining the people around me I'm not a good person.
335,"I’ve been noticing lately that I’ve had persistent and distracting worry about whether or not I’m a bad person even though I know I’m not. I’m hyper critical of everything I do. I worry very often about my health and I spiral about the smallest things thinking I have a serious illness and I have to thoroughly check my body often if I have a feeling I have something. I have to re.check my schedule and my plans multiple times a week to make sure everything is perfect and I’m not forgetting or missing anything. Idk if this is a normal amount of anxiety or conscientiousness or if it’s something else, but it gets in the way of my life and happiness quite often because I worry about most things excessively. I would appreciate some suggestions.:("
336,"I feel like everyone else gets to live life on easy mode and yet I'm always just stuck here dealing with difficult circumstances and actively shit people.

When I needed support I was outright denied it by people who were my oldest, closest friends. wasn't asking for much, just wanted to hang out more than once every 3 months when I was dealing with extreme loneliness. I made it perfectly clear for almost a whole year that this was bothering me and yet they only doubled down. I had to end multiple 20 year long friendships because they wpuldnt put in any effort into any relationships in their lives. 

I get mistreated during a breakup, do mutual friends try and stay neutral? No they just completely stop talking to me.

I try and go on holiday to get a breal from it all and everywhere in the city I go to is closed and the whole city is empty. 

I just feel alone and unlucky all the time. Stuck with shit friends in shit circumstances. I'm so tired and it feels so weird how often things have to blow up on my face

337,"I take Buspar twice a day. I've been doing this for over three months. It helps a little, at least minimally, so I care deeply about where it is. When I went to the cupboard where it normally was, it wasn't there. I moved things, taking them out of it and replacing them after, still not there. I asked her about it, knowing that her boyfriend has accidentally thrown out a mostly empty bottle before I was able to transfer the meds into the new bottle, and she told me repeatedly ""You probably did that and forgot. He doesn't do that, and I don't either,"" ""I don't forget thing like that. He might, but you do too,"" or ""You've done this before. You do something and forget it. It was probably you're doing."" 

 Ma, I get it, it's agitating to help someone find their meds, but speaking to me like this isn't helping.

 We were able to find a place-in from her matching medication, but not without her saying I'm too forgetful and that it's unfair she has to do this.

What even is this sort of treatment called? I know that this is concerning to my friends, but I don't know if this counts as anything too wrong."
338,"I (30F) struggle with emotional regulation. My emotions and reactions can test people's patience, boundaries, and be viewed as disrespectful. 

I've been in therapy for 5 years, and on medication for 3 (initially for depression, then was diagnosed bipolar II) and those things have helped in certain aspects of my mental health, but my progress in the realm of emotional regulation feels miniscule, despite my efforts. 

This struggle significantly impacts my relationships, and is the primary reason for a recent breakup. I don't want to lose the next person I love to this too. 

I'm hoping someone has found more growth than I have and could share some wisdom. 

I'm also hoping to hear from any partners of someone who struggles with emotional regulation. At times I wonder if it's even possible to love someone like me. Are there people out there who are willing to walk alongside someone and love them despite their struggle with this? 

Any insight or perspectives are welcome, I just want to understand, learn, grow, and be able to have a healthy and loving relationship.

339,"have had some issues for the couple past of years, but now it’s getting a lot worse. I traveled to be with my family because my grandmother went very sick, eventually she died 40 days ago, I’m still with them, and I want to get to the city I usually live in. The problem is that I started to get a lot of phycological issues such as panic attacks(I think). I do work from home since the pandemic, I don’t get out too much, but since I got to be with them, it’s getting worse. When I go to the store or try to walk long distances I get anxiety, and I’m not being able to breath very well, I start sweating, I start not being able to walk, and it’s a lot to handle. When I’m home when I use to live I don’t usually have that unless there are a lot of people around me. Now I’m scared to go to the store or being in the city centre walking because I have that. I don’t know if it’s a panic attack or not but it’s making me scared to go out and live the way I used to 2 months ago. I used to go to a psychiatrist but I didn’t have those problems, just having anxiety and I only had Deanxit(not sure if it’s spelt correctly in English). That doesn’t seem to help me anymore and I’m scared I’m getting worse and I have it. How do I get better?

My family is fully supportive but it doesn’t help"
340,"I don’t want validation anymore. I just want the part of my brain that craves it ripped out and set on fire.

I walk through this world like a ghost being watched, judged, pitied, or avoided. People see me and act like I’m defective for simply existing, like being nervous or awkward means I deserve less humanity.

All I ever wanted was a little connection. A little love. But the world I see?
It rewards the shallow. The plastic. The socially polished. People like me? We’re stepped over. Laughed at. Ignored.
And if we speak up? We’re “crazy.” “Bitter.” “Toxic.”

I’m not asking for a damn thing anymore.
But don’t pretend this system is fair.
Don’t pretend you wouldn’t be broken too, if you were treated like an inconvenience from the moment you could feel. 

God's silence is deafening. If people care, they're invisible. I'm just tired of pretending I'm okay when the truth is, this world has never made space for people like me. Why the fuck am I here again?
"
341,"I have had a problem all my life where no matter how much I pay attention to my friendships and relationships to nourish them there is point where something happens that changes my whole perceptive on them and no matter how try I feel I sadness in me. I situation with my girlfriend and her friend escalated once and they really hurt it was already bad that it had happened twice. But the second it was also my girlfriend who was also against me and couldn't stand it. Luckily I had friend to support me then so I handled it better this time. Sadly, I'm still not over it and even thought my girlfriend ensures me she now realizes that what she did hurt me and she is sorry I have trouble trusting her with anything since a lot of the time she is concealing info from me hoping I won't get upset I guess and things of that nature. She has started hanging out with my friend, and my friends in general have formed more connections so I'm unable to connect with them as much plus they also lied about some things but I guess from any other person perspective they would appear insignificant but to me even lying or not keeping your word about any small thing makes me immediately distrust you. I don't know what to cause I'm feeling very lonely right now looking at my girlfriends story hanging out with people who I don't like and my friends slowly forgetting me little because I'm not as active anymore. I thought I could manage but my sadness is consuming me and I'm afraid no one will be there to pick me up because things are changing and I'm starting to feel less important. I just wish I could take my time without there being consequences (the loneliness) and I wish someone would be here to take care of me since I can't take care of myself."
342,"I recently started seeing a therapist for my mental health. The primary reason I sought her help was my difficulty regulating my emotions and lack of remorse and empathy. I tend to stay angry, sad, or generally discontent. I’ve been in sessions with her for about three months now and mentioned the possibility of having anti-social personality disorder because my symptoms closely resemble those of individuals with this condition.

I firmly believe in self-advocacy in medicine, but when I brought up the possibility of this diagnosis, she seemed dismissive of my concerns. It seems as if she was skeptical of my worries and almost as if I was trying to reel her into giving me that specific diagnosis. She stated that people with anti-social personality disorder are unable to hold jobs, are always in trouble with the law, and are unaware of their own problems.

However, she later agreed with me when I elaborated on my experiences and explained that I volunteer in my community not to help people, but rather for my own personal gain.

Despite my genuine desire to understand what is wrong with me, I find myself puzzled by her hesitation to give me this diagnosis. Why was she so reluctant to make this diagnosis, and why did she seem to believe that my life would change significantly after receiving it?"
343,"So, I believe that I'm strong. It's not about physical strength (but I do have some, I visit gym), rather about motivation and inner focus. I am hardworking in IT to increase my salary and I even got a relocation in Europe. But I didn't come any closer to my goal.

I want to stop feeling loneliness and emptiness, I strongly believe that can be solved only by hyper-obseesive or extremely clingy girlfriend(BPD, abuser, other problems). Because only like this I won't feel lonely. I figured it around 4 years ago and I'm moving straight to my target by working hard, increasing social skills and friends and so on. F*k, I even moved to another country, lol. 

But no matter which good achives in life I achive, how hard I do it and so on, I'm not even on a step closer to my target. I feel like everything I'm doing is totally wrong and I just have to stop trying and surrender. 

I kinda religious, I believe in God, but not in messengers, so I kinda wonder why he makes me suffer that much. "
344,All the crying and pain and suffering went away. I was able to stumble on myself and feel really dizzy and forget about the pain I feel inside. I would feel like it everyday. Today is the second day and I plan to take 2 more than yesterday. What are the risks. I feel like life’s better without myself here (specially for me)
345,"**Ok, so this is tough for me to post, and I apologize if it seems rambly.**

Here goes. I’m a 29M, and recently I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m not okay. I know a lot of it stems from my really shitty childhood and a family that seemed to thrive on tearing me down, just so I wouldn’t be better than them.

I’ve noticed I’m angry all the time, it’s something that’s been with me since I was a kid. I get angry in place of sadness. Ever since my dad died, my default emotion has just been anger. sadness is still there its just rare it comes out.

I’ve also been blaming myself for everything going wrong around me. I beat myself down every chance I get. I constantly compare myself to others. people/friends who have the things I’ve wanted since I was little: a solid career, military service, a loving relationship, etc. I know a lot of that is on me, and blaming others won’t help I get that. i constantly apologize even when I do nothing to warrant it.

When I’m with friends, I genuinely feel better, even happy. But the second I’m alone again, like flipping a switch I go right back to feeling stuck in that dark headspace.

I’m scared to seek help because I don’t know what will happen. I don’t want to be labeled, especially because that label could kill my last shot at enlisting. I’m also afraid it could be used against me in future relationships. I'm afraid of losing my rights. im afraid. But I also know I can’t keep going like this I know I need to get this sorted.

Any advice would mean a lot. And if this post breaks any rules, I’ll remove it just let me know.  
Thanks for taking the time to read this."
346,"Multiple times over the past year I have been getting these random, horrible intrusive thoughts. Its Like I have this fvcking demon voice in the back of my head that goes ""what if you (insert evil deed) someone/what if you tried to (insert evil deed) someone."" I am so, SO appalled by them that it's become a continuous spiral down the mental well where whispers of it continue repeatedly. I am horrified that one day I might become a murderer or some other piece of evil shit. Deep down I know that I will never do anything so absolutely terrible, my heart believes it but my brain is a fvcking train wreck when it comes to this. I shiver in fear and anger every time those intrusive thoughts come back. 

This HAS to be a mental health problem, I don't know what but I just know that my mental health has been crashing and soaring repeatedly for the past year. From when I got short-term depression and thought that life was a damn DREAM to when I started feeling like this to whatever else. I am in my teen years and this just makes me so disgusted and terrified with myself I just can't keep this a secret anymore. Lots of times I am actually able to silence these thoughts after a few days, but they come back every few months. I hate myself for they and everything about this and I don't know what I can do about it. I am helpless.

I was scared to tell anyone, least of all THE MOST judgmental platform there is out there, because I'm scared people will think I'm crazy. I'm scared that they'll be scared of me. I'm scared of all of the terrible scenarios. If anyone can help, PLEASE DO!"
347,"Volunteer working, donation or else — is it good for mental health? "
348,"I’m really really scared. The last time I had a good day, I had a life altering bad thing happen (I don’t want to give too many details, it was really personal). Same with the time before that. Today has been going really really good, but I’m really scared. I’ve always felt like the Universe throws me a good day once in a while so I let my guard down and then absolutely devastates my entire life. What should I do? Also, I’m gonna be up front: I’m looking for encouragement. I know it’s a scummy thing to do, but even in my best days it’s so hard to find any encouragement from people I know because everyone finds me annoying and sees me as something to ignore. I hate asking for reassurance, but good times never last long at all for me. I’m not gonna give some sob story, I just need someone to tell me “it’s gonna be okay” or something. Please."
349,"So my partner downloaded a thing to talk about her religion to like minded people which I thought was an amazing idea, she later told me about all the people she met and talked to and I couldnt help but nocice they were all male. I didnt think much of it untill she told me that a person tried to flirt with her and that she was grosed out by it and blocket him but that he ""lowkey had game"" a few weeks past where this continued. Then I got a weird feeling tha something was off by the way she was talking and not paying as much attention as she usually was, I didnt mind at first because after all we are our own people. But it got quite much after a bit so I decided to download rhe app and make a fake profile to loyalty test her, I wasnt worried at all sense I trust her...it was more of a ""I wonder how shes talking to strangers"" but when k started talking to her on the app she was just replying normal. Then I started flirtig with her and noticed that she didnt even mention me nor did she tell me (fake acc) to stop, I started calling her by VERY sexual nicknames and she seemed to have nothing against it..she admitted that she liked it and when I (fake acc) said I wanted to take a mirror picture with her where I hold her hips and kiss her neck she said she liked that idea...this went on for about 3 days. She made up stuff like her having a really important exam when in reality she isnt even in school. She complemented me (fake acc) by saying things like im too hot to be real ect. After she found out it wasnt a real person (using google and pintrest) she said that she wasnt flirting and that she wanted nothing more then a friendship and that she is just a really kind person. She also told me that she blicked this guy (fake acc) because he was creepy, but she didnt because she texten the acc just minutes after. She sent pictures of herself (not nudes) and when she got spicy pictures back she didnt say anything about not wanting them nor did she say she was in a relationship. 

I dont know what to do. If im over reacting or if shes cheating on me 

(For extra context, we have both agreed that flirting with someone else is cheating. She has also said to me that seeing other men shirtless is gross)

Im open if you want to talk about all above."
350,"I just need a friend I'm lonely and nobody to support me, I have bpd that's why everyone leaves me, I can't control my emotions. I would be happy if I had a friend to support me"
351,"Whenever I start doing well—whether in school, my part-time job or just life in general—I suddenly feel this emptiness inside me. It’s like, even when things are going okay on the outside, something still feels missing.

I just came out of a slump—a time when it was really hard for me to stay consistent with taking care of myself. I was dealing with the usual signs of depression. And while I’ve been doing better lately, that empty feeling creeps in again, and I don’t always understand why. It feels uncomfortable.

Sometimes I wonder if it’s because I’m not genuinely content with where I am or what I have (what if I'm just that kind of person?). When that feeling hits, it’s often followed by “What’s the point of all this anyway?” I try to dismiss it, but now it’s starting to worry me.

It’s been about a year since I was diagnosed with depression, around this same time. If you have any thoughts or advice on what I can do about this, I’d genuinely appreciate it."
352,"Idk what to do. I’m breaking down. Idk if this will even post on time. Im not thinking clearly, I want the fucking pain to stop. I just want it to fucking stop. IM IN SO MUCH PAIN"
353,"So I’ve been going through some mental health crisis lately and was put in seroquel at 200 mg before bed, alone with Visteril and buspar as needed through out day.

My anxiety is at an extreme high and the seroquel is causing me to have bad side effects like tremors and blurred vision. Which only escalates my feelings of anxiety .The stuff that I take is not helping my depression or anxiety. When I was in the mental hospital they gave me Ativan which helped tremendously. My psych doctor and whole office in general who is managing my meds will absolutely not prescribe any benzodiazepines point blank period.

The visteril and buspar is doing nothing for me,what should I do?! Find another psych, try gabapentin, or beta blocker? I just feel like nothing is strong enough to help me right now as I go through this mental crisis, I need something I can take for emergency situations that have been happening frequently.

Any advice is helpful"
354,"23m here. I have bad anger issues with video games, especially PVP online games, and I want to work on it. I've always been like this. Ever since I was a kid I'd get frustrated, but I feel like it's only gotten worse with time. I'm tired of my own behavior and how it's affecting those around me. I want to do something about it.
 
Mainly from my teenage years to now, I've constantly raged over online games. I don't throw my controllers or break things, but I constantly complain when things aren't going how I want. I've affected my friendships and relationships because of me doing that. I sometimes took my anger out on those close to me by lashing out at them. 

I've also noticed things that... maybe are the cause? Or a factor? Over the years I've grown anxious about even playing PVP games. I kinda get scared to play them and I think it's a fear of ""embarassing"" myself or getting mad. What if I play poorly and embarass myself in front of everyone? What if I just get mad again and end up in a bad mood? I think about old deaths or specific moments I had in PVP games, some of them going back years ago, and I feel a sense of embarassment. I know it doesn't matter, I know it's not a big deal, yet I keep thinking about them, and I worry about gaining more of these memories the more I play. Another thing is I think I just... hate getting outplayed? Like, when there's someone or a team who outplays or outsmarts me, it REALLY gets to me. Maybe it's a sense of inferiority or envy, or feeling stupid/bad about myself. I don't know. I think it ties into the fear of embarassing myself. Another thing I want to mention is, whenever I start to feel negative there's like this part of me that weirdly wants to keep ""self destructing"". I don't know how to properly explain it, but it's like I want to make things worse for myself.

I know ""it's just a game"" but it doesn't really help me. I know it's just a video game and that it doesn't matter, but I keep feeling and acting this way. I've thought about just laughing it off and trying to find ways to have fun and be positive instead of being so negative about it, but as stupid as I am for this it kinda... makes me cringe? I know, it's stupid, but for some reason I feel that way. I don't want to feel that way but I do.

I don't want to act like this anymore though. I know it's not healthy and I keep making myself and even my girlfriend miserable with it. She loves PVP games, I want to play them with her, but everytime we play together I end up raging and she's tired of it. I am too. I know the simple solution is to just quit playing them altogether but... I don't really want to. I want to play and enjoy them, I want to keep playing with my girlfriend, but I know that playing them is bringing out a toxic part of me, and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of my constant cycle of getting mad and feeling like shit after.

I appreciate any help or advice here.

TLDR: Constantly raging at PVP video games, anxious to play them because of fear of embarassing myself or getting mad, hate losing and getting outplayed. I've affected friendships and I'm affecting my current relationship because of it. I recognize I have a problem and I want to do something about it"
355,"Hi 24 (F). 2025…. What a year of rubbish! In January on the 14th I lost my grandad after a hard fight with dementia. It hurt, but I could carry on supporting my mum (her dad), with in a week back to work and carrying on life. Had the funeral in feb. Then march and I lost my dad on the 14th as well. While all of this happening my partner was sh herself and telling me she was at a&e with it (this is while I was holding his hand and him taking his last breaths). Since then I have felt numb, havnt cried since the day he died. To also top it all off on the day of his wake I had to wake up at 4am to take my partner for surgery Becouse of what they did to themself and they got upset that I wasn’t there for them and they felt alone in there time of need, to add to this she never came to my grandads wake as well even though she knew and met them both many times! She didn’t even ask me how it went, I had to make a speech didn’t wish me luck, didn’t even try to move the surgery. I Feel nothing. Am I just greaving or suppressing how I’m feeling about everything? Is it okay to be pissed off at my partner for what they did? Am I just on the edge of having another breakdown? Can someone just help me please??? "
356,"More and more lately as I get older i start to feel like an npc or anomaly to life around me. 3 of the friends groups I've been in have all ended disastrously- 1 group having a serial r*pist and friends that ended up druggie where I was misunderstood alot and distanced for not partaking in illegal activities, another that kind of dismissed me after I admitted to having issues with one of the guys in the group who was really toxic at the time and everyone admitted to closing him over me for him to change (we're still friends but I just don't seem to fit in well?) And then another group where everything seemed fine until I would be accused of intentions or thinking/feeling things that I wasn't and then accused of lying when trying to explain that that wasnt the case and it was a misunderstanding AND trying to correct it and communicate better (the more recent event). The other situations I can somewhat understand but the most recent one the popular girl in the group was saying really harsh things about this guy I had started hanging out with whom she had known for 7 years and I told him about it and that I was frustrated at being accused of stuff all the time and frustrated that they didn't inform me that I was being cheated on cause they hoped I'd find out eventually after collectively knowing for around 6 months. He proceeded to say him and his close friends also disliked the popular girl and she was two faced and encouraged me to ghost the group saying ""I didn't owe them anything"". A couple days later I received multiple text messages from people I was still friends with in the group saying I was a liar and lied subconsciously and needed to seek help to which I was incredibly confused because I'd never lied to any of them and apparently they were using this going back months over the misunderstandings as well. This has been a repeating occurrence I see in the friend groups I've been in be it me ovserving or more often than not me being accused of things I didn't do. I have high functioning autism and adhd and I just wonder is this a byproduct of my lack in social skills or are people really just this harsh? I don't really understand and I'm struggling greatly as a result. "
357,"I feel like I'm in a dream ot something, my head is all fuzzy and I feel kinda emotionally numb I guess? I can't focus on anything, especially not the billion exams I have this month and really gotta study for, but I keep zoning out. Does anyone know how to help this and snap out of it?"
358,"it's exam season, but i've been slacking off. i don't want to get anything below a B, because seeing my parents unsatisfied with my grades is not it. i know i have the potential to get As, but i just can't anymore, because i'm so sick of my life the way it is. out of stress i'm getting eczema all over my body and i've been gaining so much weight. i feel like regina george when sweatpants were the only thing that fits her.  i want to try and get better, but with everything that's happening this year i don't think i can. i'm falling out with my friends, getting uglier, and stupider and so many aura loses. i feel like ending it all, because i don't have anything worth living for anymore. my life's always been messed up, but rn is just another level. i feel like no one out there genuinely cares about me, and even if i did find that person i'd fumble them badly. i've already sabotaged a potential friendship with some people who genuinely found good in me. i've always been the biggest loser in anything i did and it just sucks. "
359,"All my life I’ve tried to be a good person. I was always labelled the “sweet” one out of all my siblings. I tried to embrace that role but over time it felt like more of an act. I felt like I was masking myself for the sake of others and found myself getting more and more resentful due to it. I began to have violent thoughts and wishing the worst for others. I would feel a rush of adrenaline by doing something “bad” because I was never allowed to express that part of myself. I would purposely try to hurt people and even myself. Eventually it got to a point where I had to go to therapy and see a psychiatrist where I got prescribed some meds to help “regulate my mood”. The meds don’t help much but I still take them everyday. Lately I’ve been getting more aggressive and violent. Doing things that I know are wrong. I coerced a depressed online friend into cutting himself and I even wrapped my hands around my cat’s n*ck and imagined myself snapping it. Of course I didn’t. I know this is likely me trying to seek attention or express this repressed part of myself, but it’s getting out of hand and nobody notices. I try to tell my family but they have this bias for me and always make up excuses for me. For once in my life I want to be seen as imperfect and bad. I want to face the consequences."

362,"Hello folks! 

Our lab at UC Berkeley is currently recruiting adults ages 50 and older in the US to take part in a no-cost cognitive-behavior therapy sleep treatment study. The purpose of this study is to test whether a new approach to delivering sleep treatment can help people who have difficulty with different types of sleep problems, including getting to sleep or staying asleep, waking up or getting out of bed after sleep, feeling sleepy during daily life, or other sleep challenges.  

Through this study, we offer no-cost sleep therapy with therapists who have specialized training with Dr. Allison Harvey, the lab director and a leading expert on sleep treatment. In the community, it can be difficult to find practitioners trained in sleep treatment, and this kind of treatment could cost thousands of dollars. This is a unique opportunity to get access to no-cost sleep coaching if you’re struggling with your sleep. 

Eligible individuals will receive 8 sessions of 1-on-1 sleep treatment via Zoom or phone. They will also participate in pre- and post-treatment data collection. Eligible individuals will be compensated for post-treatment data collection. Additional information is available during phone screening. The study is entirely remote.

363,"I'm genuinely curious — could you help me understand why people with OCD, who are often very self-aware and thoughtful, still struggle to dismiss their compulsive rituals even when they recognize them as irrational?

By then I though i should slowly start studying for the two exams tomorrow and the day after. I sat down, but then though i still have time. I watched half an hour of reels. Half an hour of tiktok. Watched a movie. 2pm. By 3pm i though i should really take my pill to study. It wouldn't kick in so I just played some games on my iPad. Now it's 5pm. I took 2 more pills (adhd medication) and finally feel them working. Usually one is enough. I'm filled with guilt and regret. The wole reason why i left school early was to study, and now all I did was practically nothing. I lost track of time and five hours have passed without me doing anything at all. I will study now, but things like these have happened often. I don't know if it's because of my phone addiction, adhd or the fact that I just didn't want to study, but I can't let things stay this way. Please help, i don't know why I am like this."

366,"Hi everyone

I never thought I’d be posting something like this but I’m really struggling right now and just hoping someone out there might understand. My mental health has been in a very dark place lately. Some days it’s hard to even get out of bed or talk to anyone. I’ve been feeling alone, overwhelmed and honestly not okay. I’m doing my best to hold on but it’s been getting harder. I’ve always found that games help me escape a little. They give me something to focus on, something that makes me feel a little more alive. I’ve really wanted to play GTA V for a long time now. It seems like the kind of game I could really get into, have some fun with and just take my mind off things for a bit. But right now I can’t afford it. If someone here could gift it to me it would honestly mean the world. I know it’s a lot to ask and I completely understand if it’s not possible. Just writing this out and knowing someone might read it already helps a little. Thank you for taking the time to read this."
367,"I’ve always been uncomfortable with the subject of sex, at least with people I’m not sleeping with. 

I have no idea how to approach the subject because I’m just so uncomfortable talking about it. It’s something I know I need to discuss but it’s just something I’ve put off discussing for so long. 

In addition, I don’t know how to talk about it while not crossing a line. How do you know how specific you can get with your therapist? 

I don’t know if this makes any difference but I’m a man and my therapist is a woman. "
368,"I'm going to look at a different therapist.  I've had a couple things with her already that I was iffy on, but I'm very disappointed about this.

I'm diagnosed bipolar and when I tried attending college in 2019, I had a mental breakdown complete with psychosis.  I couldn't work or go to school for a few years, but now, I'm working full-time, and I'm preparing to return to college this fall.

anyway, I've been seeing this therapist for about a year, and since we've met, I've been extremely stable.

a few months ago, I lost my health insurance.  while I can financially afford to continue going to therapy, I couldn't afford to keep taking my medications.  so I stopped taking vraylar and lithium, my two psychiatric medications.  I know it wasn't a good idea, and I wouldn't recommend others to do it, but it's been a month, and I am honestly feeling even better than I did before.  I'm less tired and have less brain fog, I'm able to tap into my creativity again, and my hunger is so much more manageable.  it wasn't a significant enough of a change where people are saying things, but it's significant enough for me to notice, ""hey, I feel good.""

I see my therapist once every two weeks, and I saw her shortly after I stopped taking my meds and admitted to her what was happening.  she was extremely worried and told me, ""you need to be on medications.  people with bipolar cannot be off of medications.""  I never took psych meds before 2019 and my goal isn't to take medications for forever.  but I understood her concern, so I told her I'd schedule to see my psychiatrist again and get prescribed some cheaper medications.

I still don't see my psych for another week, but I saw my therapist a few days ago, and the session was pretty normal and relaxed up until the end.  I updated her on my progress of getting into school, drama with my family, etc.  then, towards the end of the session, she suddenly starts saying, ""you're talking different, you're acting different, you're manic.""  I was extremely caught off guard because I don't feel remotely manic and I'm usually very self-aware.  she insisted that she's ""seen this a million times in bipolar people, they need to be on meds"", and I honestly was feeling really gaslit.

later that night, I started crying to my bf and asking him if I seem manic, bc I was scared that meant that I wasn't ready to go back to college.  we live together and he was shocked at the idea that I was manic and assured me that I am not.  in 2019, when I broke down, he quit his job and moved states to take care of me full-time.  he's seen me through it all and knows what my mania and depression and psychosis looks like.

I asked my parents too, who my bf and I live with, and they were surprised too.

I don't know if she's just trying to scare me into getting on meds or what her goal is, but I just don't like her approach to this situation."
369,"I lived with ""B"". Life had shrunk to a horrible job, being at home and running. B was extremely jealous, a violent drunk. Things got bad. I became depressed, suicidal. I thought I could never get out. When I finally got help, B came into the first appointments.

B was freaking out that I would talk about him. When he wasn't in the room, B was waiting outside. B would drown me with gifts, saying I would ""get better"", and he would change. At home, B screamed I'm blaming and abandoning him.

Things began to go wrong. I said stuff that wasn't true. Anything to explain, hiding the truth. With pills I began feeling paranoid, my mood shifted violently. I got sleeping aids, and horrible things started to happen with B.

I tried to blame things on my childhood and said things like ""I've been unable to leave home for months"". Half-truths and exaggerations. I said I'm afraid that someone is watching me, describing a vague threat, not B.

When I said I couldn’t promise to come to the next appointment, they asked if I was willing to go to a psych ward. They asked B to take me there. I couldn’t look at him. I would finally be safe.

In psych I intended to reveal my situation, but couldn’t. I was deathly afraid, and for some reason, ashamed. Both, my relationship, and lying.

I was so tired. My roommate asked why I'm there, and when I said suicidality, she said that's good, because they'll let me home in a couple of days. I was horrified.  
I'm ashamed of this, when the doctor also said that I won't be needing a long stay, I said a lot of things that weren't even true. I said I was seeing things, that I was very paranoid. I was afraid of returning to B. I got to stay.

They started to evaluate me. They thought B was a nice guy. B visited almost every day, bringing gifts. Sometimes multiple times a day. In the visiting room, he yelled at me, asking if I've said anything about him, crying. It was terrible. I lied more.

I found out from a person, that he had been drinking, publicly screaming that I'm at a psych ward, crying that I was paranoid. I worsened. Because I was in such a shape ""without reason"" and the only things revealed were from my childhood, and that I was deathly ashamed, they diagnosed me with a personality disorder, psychosis, dissociative things.

I tried to correct what I've said, and they thought it was a symptom. Even worse, I had a terrible doctor, who claimed I must be ""rebelling against him as a fatherly figure” when disagreeing, because according to him, I hadn't been able to do so with my dad.

I ended up staying until I got my own place, and could safely leave B.
As I tried to open up a conversation of my evaluations being wrong, they didn't believe me. That they trust the doctor. Treatments never worked, of course not. I never got to talking about B, or what happened.

Now, I'm in need of help. I'm ashamed of those times, of lying, that I got therapy. My records have been opened. Things that are not true, are being spoken about again. I can't eat, I can't sleep. I'm so ashamed. I'm so regretful. I spoiled the chances of getting actual help and a proper evaluation. My records are filled with stuff that never happened. I can't live with this.

370,Would put this in r/AskReddit but it isn't appropriate enough 
371,"My body is disgusting and i hate it. The worst part is i cant do anything about it, because it's not just my body that i find disgusting, it is the human body in general. I do overthink a lot of stuff to the point when i'm amazed or disgusted by how something works. And sometimes the human body amazes me too. But most of the time it's just disgusting.

I hate that i am this weird meat bag, organinc machine, the most complex thing in the known universe is a jelly in my skull. And all of this being so fragile and yet, somehow still trying to survive. I hate how all of this, all of me, functions.

Today i almost vomited while eating lunch because i just started thinking about how mouth and throat work. Every time i take a shower and get naked i just start thinking how pathetic this meat sack is, and how i want to pull my skin off.

But weirdly enough i ever only thought like this about my own body, never about someone elses (nor about animals), no matter how terrible they might look. My best guess is that it's because i am inside this body.

It's mostly just the overthinking. My body seems fine until i start thinking about it. And when i do start overthinking it's hard to stop. And when i am overthinking my body feels like the most disgusting thing there is."

By self harming, I feel like someone will know something’s up and they’ll feel the need to intervene. I feel terrible bc I feel like I’m playing with other’s emotions, but I swear I never would want to put anyone in distress, I just want them to know that I’m not okay. "

375,"Hey all, I have some questions about disability benefits. Before I start I'd like to give some background on me.

I'm a 24 year old male. I was diagnosed with bipolar type schizoaffective disorder when I was 14. I was in and out of psych wards and when I was discharged for the last time continued therapy and prescription meds until the age of 19. I tried an array of different medications, all of which were having nasty side effects such as causing seizures. Because of this, I stopped taking meds. Off of medication my symptoms are worse off, but i have worked hard to better understand my illness, and surround myself with people that can support me through different episodes. 

I've always tried to be independent and avoid assistance of any kind. I'm unable to go down any prestigious career path, as I don't trust myself in such situations and my availability can be sporadic depending on if something is going on with me. When I come to work I give 110%, often going above and beyond in my jobs. Despite this, I get tons of flack from my bosses with the amount of times I call off due to mental health reasons. I've even gone as far as to show documentation to my bosses but that doesn't change anything. So it can be hard to keep a job or get a raise. With how rough the economy is a little extra money would honestly help so I've thought about government assistance.


All that being said, I have questions. Would I even be eligible if I still want to try and work a normal job? Would being off prescription meds disqualify me? What would I need to do to get approval? If anyone could shed some light I'd appreciate it, thanks!"
376,"I have so many negative challenges like lack of concentration, mobile and porn Addiction, bad health condition, low self esteem, low confidence, procrastination, self doubt, family problems, no friends, no support, no emotional backup, no one who cares about me, sadness, regretting on my decisions, no loved one, failed in exam, directionless life, cannot be Consistent, too much perfectionism and ocd, less strength in body, currently I am in my wrost phase of my life."
377,"Hey y’all I’m Thamira and I’m F18, and I struggle a lot with suicidal thoughts and have a hard time getting through most days. I have this chronic feeling of sadness that is constantly lingering. I have friends and we hang out but as soon as I’m alone I just get so depressed and there’s no real reason as to why. I feel so empty and broken and I can’t even begin to explain why. And I get these mood swings where I’m really happy and excited and in an instant it dies down and I’m extremely sad for no reason. I go to college and I have often just broken down in tears and I couldn’t tell my friends that I don’t know why I’m crying because they simply wouldn’t understand. A single sentence can ruin my day sometimes my week. I don’t feel alive or fulfilled with my life unless Im making some crazy, batshit decision that completely derails my life. I lie constantly compulsively for no reason sometimes even instinctively. What triggered me posting this is that my boyfriend has stopped talking to me as much and interacting with me as much because it’s exam season and he needs to study and consciously I understand that and I don’t blame him. But I feel like he’s rejecting me and abandoning me. I feel like he’s throwing me away and that he hates me. And I even feel myself being distant and mean towards him for choosing his studies over me trying to punish him. And I have done this before I push them away because they no longer give me the attention I crave. I would throw myself in the arms of a stranger if it meant they would tell me what I want to hear. And I feel like I’m crazy I feel everything all at once like I’m somehow too much yet not enough. I make the most crazy decisions impulsively and end up regretting it later. I use porn and masturbation to forget about everything and I sexualise myself to feel okay. I’m addicted to affection and attention and I feel crippled without it I feel empty. I can go days without showering or eating and I get mad at anyone who shows me any concern. Well I don’t know if this is the right place to talk about this but I just feel like this isn’t normal. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. I’m just constantly sad it’s just always there no matter what I do. I’m always just a little bit upset, all the time. I often feel like everyone hates me and wants to hurt me and when I tell my friends they call me paranoid. Ugh idk if I’m being crazy but yeah. I want to know if anyone has felt like this so I feel less alone. And maybe this is regular hormonal teenager stuff but something is telling me that it’s more than that. "
378,"27F. I graduated from college a year ago in a creative field that is being completely wrecked by layoffs. I've been job hunting since graduating with no success. It took me half a year to even get a shitty part time job in a mall. My hours are so unpredictable, some weeks I get 20 hours and some I get 5. Despite applying to other part time jobs I haven't been able to pick up a second one. All I want is to get a job in the field I studied in and to stop being a loser. 

I can't be myself in this house, everything I do gets judged and I'm treated like an overgrown child. It's so exhausting to keep up a character for my parents every single day. I've lost most friends in my own city (some moved away, some stopped talking to me because of friend drama) and I don't have a safe space to just go and be comfortable away from home.

I struggle with my mental health and have a handful of diagnosed disorders as well as suspected mild autism. My depression in particular is stronger and stronger by the day, because I feel like there's no way out. No way to be an adult, to be myself. A lot of days I feel like just lying down and rotting because there isn't any point anymore. 

This feels so stupid and selfish to complain about. I'm not paying rent (because my parents know how little money I make) and I have access to their money for necessities. But I don't want to be dependent on anyone anymore, I want to be in charge of my own life. "
379,"It's something I talk about to some people that's somewhat hitting me in my life, I feel little to no emotions usually, apart from happiness sometimes.

I laugh, I joke, it goes well most of the time.

But for sadness, I never feel it, same for love, it's very weak and I don't know why. I just almost feel nothing. I never cried for multiple years at this point apart from when I laughed very hard rarely or when I'm tired.

Does anyone know where may it come from and how to explain this ?"

381,"Hey y’all,
Not sure if this is the right page to post this question but I am curious if anyone knows of any kind of therapy geared towards men trying to break gender conditioning in their relationships. I have looked briefly into Feminist Identity therapy as an option but wondering if I am missing something/it doesn’t seem quite what I am looking for.
I put a lot of strain on my partner by just being a typical man who doesn’t see the amount of work she is doing and I have difficulty accommodating her needs properly by assuming she knows what is going on always even when she is struggling with her own stuff and clearly is not able to take on more. I feel this is an issue stemming from my Christian and hyper heterosexual upbringing where gender roles were concrete and the only examples I had as a child were these kind of, what I would consider toxic, relationship dynamics. Any advice of where to start looking would be much appreciated. 
Thank you!"
382,"My life has made comple turn in the last 2 months.

I cant do this anymore my ex broke up with me month ago, ive failed all my exams, im unemployed and I have nothing going on for me right now. I feel completly lost and dont know what to do anymore. I cant get enjoyment out of anything.

Im feeling like its not going to get better for me. I hate everything including myself.

Im not suicidal but I cant deal with this anymore.

What should I do?"
383,"Hey everyone. Post is a bit jumbled, but please bear with me. 

I am absolutely having the hardest time and I don’t know what to do. The past month I’ve decreased off of Effexor (venlafaxine) and was supposed to start Cymbalta on May 1st. (Which. Btw. Withdrawals of Effexor? No fucking joke. ) 

I’ve been calling the past two weeks. Damn near everyday, being told by different nurses that it would be a couple days. 

Behold, I called again and was told (after 15 days have passed) that they’re FINALLY doing some pre authorizations. 

It’s been weeks. This weaning off of Effexor has been absolute hell. I’m back to crying everytime I wake up, I don’t wanna be here, I don’t wanna eat, I’m convinced I have someone coming after me or trying to poison me. I’m seeing things. I’m hating everyone. I’m having panic attacks the moment I wake up and realize hey- I’m awake. I’m alive. Panic. 

I haven’t been silent on this. Every time I call, I tell them my anxiety. My wish for death, just how much I truly need help and now it could be another ‘couple days’ - which was 2 weeks the first time they said it. 

I’m sorry. 

Is there any tips , something that someone has done coming off of meds and waiting to start another one. How did you combat this? 

I’m lucky enough that after the first week, my partner really started understanding and has been incredible with trying his best to help. Be here at least. But I need to do something for me. I don’t wanna lean on him too much - I know this is A LOT for anyone. 

I’m so tired. I haven’t been sleeping well. I’m getting nightmares again. 

Please if someone knows any tips or treats on how to calm the fuck down, silence the brain a little bit. 

Also, it’s hard to finally accept that as of right now these meds are a necessity. I haven’t been to therapy yet, but I know I need these meds until I can learn how to cope and deal with this shit. That’s been a real hard reality check these past couple weeks.

384,"Basically I'm 25 now, was diagnosed something wrong when I was 17, and thereafter I was diagnosed with BPD. Apart from everything I feel, today I want to share something here, the perspective. Every second of the day, everyday, I only see people around me, while travelling, while working, people are around and I see them as beautiful enough, no matter what color, gender or anything, they're always beautiful enough, enough to make me feel inferior. What flaws they, if ever tell me, I can't see that in them at all. Wishing I had their faces, wishing I had their bodies. I never attended any family gatherings, because I feel the ugliest person alive is none other than me, no matter what I wear, it's gonna look bad at me. Even I never allow people to love me, because I would tell them the same story, I am ugly. Who would fall in love with me? And moreover, if I ever fall in love, I'd kill them with my insecurities. I have a suicidal history, and I try my best not to do something like that again. My mother also suffers from depression, that was the one of the reason I tried my best to not to show these things to my family, how much I hate myself. But they ask me, why can't you go to the wedding, I always make excuses. And lastly, because I never did what everyone around me did in their 20s, I always feel like I missed out everything. Thank you for letting me share a piece here."

I suffer with anxiety and I have for such a long time. It really took full control over me in ways I never thought it would. I locked myself inside, I didn’t speak to anyone, I couldn’t go shopping or even get out of bed sometimes. For anyone going through something similar, I want you to know that things do get better. I never used to believe it either, but over time with the right tools and techniques, I can say it does get lighter. If you are feeling alone or stuck in your anxiety right now I’d love to be able to help, even if I can help make a difference to one person. Please message me and reach out and I’d like to share what really helped me. You’ve got this :)"

Im not going to be super preachy and I wont respond unless its a dm about questions. but guys if youre feeling beat down by the world, tired or down and out. Try, just open your heart and pray to Jesus. at first I felt the same way as some of you, (eww no I dont need religion) your right you dont need religion. but if nothing else is working just let the King of Kings, Lord of Lords Alpha and Omega into your heart.

She probably doesn’t know that I know, but to me it’s obvious. We talk often and she recently was suggesting I use it for an email I was sending to my professor so I can tell she decided that for some reason the computer would have a better answer but I didn’t want the best answer.. 

She’s honestly my best friend and one of the few who has always been there for me so this kind of hurt and is bumming me out on top of everything else. 

I can talk to a computer whenever I want, I wanted to talk to my sister… "
393,"Sometimes, I find myself quietly aching with a feeling I’m ashamed to admit—envy. Not of material things or milestones, but of something far deeper, more human: the love that defends, the pride that protects.

I envy the sons and daughters whose parents sing their praises without hesitation. The ones who hear stories of themselves told with beaming pride to neighbors, to relatives, to anyone who’ll listen. I envy those who are defended before they even know they need defending, whose names are guarded like treasures, especially in their absence. That kind of love—loud, unwavering, and loyal—is a foreign language in my life.

Because my mother is not like that.

In every conflict, in every family discussion that even hints at tension, she’s the first to disappear emotionally—only to reappear somewhere else, retelling our private struggles to the world. Relatives. Cousins. Family friends. She recounts every misstep, every disagreement, every detail… but always from her side. A side where I am the villain. A side that lacks context, compassion, or even the smallest effort to understand me.

Her first instinct is never to protect me. It’s to expose me.

She doesn’t hold my name with tenderness. She lets it unravel in whispers and half-truths until it reaches people who no longer look at me the same. I have been painted into a role I never auditioned for—misunderstood, shunned, disliked—because the one person who should have had my back chose to give everyone else a version of me I don’t even recognize.

And that hurts. It leaves a scar that smiles can’t cover and silence can’t heal. I often wonder what it would feel like to be someone’s pride. To have a mother who defends you fiercely, especially when you’re not in the room. To feel safe in the belief that, no matter what, your image is protected, your heart is valued, your story is told with grace.

But that isn’t my story.

My story is one of quiet endurance. Of learning to build my self-worth without applause. Of picking up the pieces of my reputation after they’ve been shattered behind my back. Of pretending I’m okay while carrying wounds that were never supposed to be mine.

And while I try to be strong, to understand, to forgive—some days, I just need to let it out. Because no child should have to envy being loved out loud."

396,"So I'm from India,an upcoming Mba Student,my mum is a government employee and my dad has resigned from his job in 2010(when I was 10 years old) in Dubai and came here to live with us. Before he was working in a great bank. Ever since I was 12,I remember him treating mum unfairly and blaming both of us for his arrival and he's saying because we ruined his life he'll make sure he'll ruin ours. He's doing that ever since. I have been academically gifted,but ever since I chose to do science instead of commerce after class 10 ,he always brings that topic up every time some decision I made doesn't work out. He always says ""if I'm dead you'll be in the streets"" but how? Mum's the one who's earning? Not her! He thinks I have disrespected his sisters(the same ones who tried to marry me off to a 60-year old when I was 20,support child marriage, are against me studying ,thinking I'll run away like their daughters,casteist,sexist,etc.)just because I didn't study commerce. I have sacrificed a lot for my academic career...but these are demotivating me and I don't know what to do. My mum's in one of the top positions but she's always worrying that she's not respected because he constantly demeans her infront of relatives and common friends, taunts her and me if I support her, doesn't hate if we try to put him in place. And his sisters too are sucking up to him(mainly because they want stuff from him,or else they don't even care as they know he's good-for-nothing) . This has strained my mental health and relationships with my cousins. Thankfully, I'm recovering because of supportive friends and cousins appreciating me for what I am instead of looking as his daughter. But there's still a long way to go. I'm considering therapy after I start earning. Can anyone help me with this?"
397,"I don’t know where to start, but the thing is simple: I go completely blank during emotional or serious talks. Whenever there’s an argument, or someone talks about feelings, or we try to have a deep conversation, my brain just shuts down. It’s really frustrating.

Me and my partner are in a long-distance relationship, and most of our serious talks happen over text. But when we have an emotional conversation, I can’t understand anything properly. I just keep reading their messages but nothing goes into my head. I can feel what they’re trying to say and I know they’re hurt or upset, but I don’t know how to reply. It feels like I have no words at all.

Like yesterday, we had an argument or maybe a breakdown—I don’t even fully remember what it was about. I just know I was angry or upset, but today I can’t even explain why. It feels like I forgot the whole thing, even if I was told about it 20 times.

It’s not like I don’t care—I do. I can often sense when something is wrong before it’s even said. But when the moment comes to talk, I freeze. I don’t know what to say. My brain tells me “something’s wrong,” but doesn’t help me form a response

Am I just running away from my own thoughts and emotions again? Is this an excuse?

I really want to change this. I don’t want to avoid my emotions or serious talks anymore. I care, but I don’t know how to deal with all this.

Please tell me what should I do? Has anyone else gone through something like this?

398,"Repost because i’m scared and desperate

TW: Mention of self harm

So i'm going to a mental evaluation tomorrow and have a few questions.

1. What shouldn't I tell them?
• (Like stuff that'll get me sent to a mental hospital or something.)

2. What should I absolutely tell them even if it sucks?

3. What do they have to tell an adult?
• (I am a minor so i'm sure they have to tell my parent at least something.)

4. What do I have to prepare myself for?
• (Physically or mentally.)

5. Do they do a physical check for scars?
• (I have a past of self harm. I actively do it.)

6. Will they tell my mom i'm not clean?
• (Recent relapse.)

Extra: Any tips or any advice?

I've never told a professional anything other than telling my doctor i self harm about a couple years ago. They didn't tell my mom that."
399,"My 25 year old son is not well. He was a very bright engineering student in his junior year of college when the wheels fell off. He failed every class his second semester. Since then, he has not been able to finish a semester or hold down a job. He still lives at home and has fairly regular meltdowns where he blames all of his struggles on his mother and I. He has rejected medical diagnosis and counseling. He immerses himself in online gaming and porn, and self medicates with weed daily. He binge spends, eats, shops, etc. We’ve asked him to move, even offering to pay for it, but he refuses. In the meantime, he neglects literally every responsibility. Today, for not the first time, he threatened self harm.

Has anyone had experiences they can share where they were able to get someone help that actively resisted being helped?"
400,"So I know I got phonophobia from trauma and paranoia. It’s been affecting me for some time but it is getting worse such as when I’m at work, home, and public places. I just want help. It’s like I’m paying too much attention to everyone else. For example when someone at work is dropping things hard I will make noise while doing something because I’m trying to make sure they aren’t listening to me. My neighbors are the ones who caused me to feel this way. They like to bully me now because I was made the mistake of doing the same as I did to my co workers to be honest. It’s like I’m always on alert when I’m in the house. I’m stressing myself out. I I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I know everyone has problems but I’m not sure if they’re like mine.

I have been seeing a therapist for a little more than a year, but nothing seems to work, my therapist is really good and helps me, but the second I get out of the studio I relapse, I can't stand living with myself anymore, everything feels tiring, and pointless, I don't have friendship or a relationship, I have just started college and tried really hard to make new friends but nothing seems to work, and it's painful because everyone seems to have it easy while I struggle. I also have social anxiety and anxiety in general and it's eating me alive, I'm really starting to feel like disappearing is the only way out, it would easier even for my family and my parents, they wouldn't have to deal anymore with their dramatic daughter who can't seem to be well on her own. I'm so tired and hopeless. "
402,"I am turning 18 in a couple of months and now it’s exam season. Needless to say it’s pretty stressful and at times I don’t have the energy to hide my true emotions. I have been depressed since I can remember myself, I was never happy even as a kid. The last few years things got really bad. I have panic attacks daily, seriously contemplate committing every single day, I self harm and cry myself to sleep almost every night (when I can). However it’s almost impossible for someone to notice because to the average person I have everything anyone would want. I am one of the best students of my year (because I basically study to not think), I am physically healthy, have a roof over my head, food on the table every morning…but my life is miserable. I have no friends at all, my parents are basically divorced but still living together with my mum being toxic and my dad absent at best, and the expectations are out of this world. My life is miserable and I hate it. I don’t even know what to do with my life, I don’t enjoy anything anymore, even things I used to love. The worst part is when I try to hint that something isn’t the way it seems, no one believes me. Now, to the point. Today I was at an after school lesson. At some point my teacher said «life is beautiful isn’t it?», and I answered very spontaneously and without thinking «No». She said «you should ask my student Jess (not her real name) who is at a hospital in France that», I think she has leukaemia. I just replied with «not everything is visible» and she asked me what I mean. I told her I didn’t want to continue that conversation and went back to my work. People in my country don’t really think of mental health as something serious, so that is not an unusual encounter for me. Am I ungrateful?"
403,"I am 17M, from the UK, and have diagnoses for ASD, Anxiety, and Depression. I also have OCD symptoms, but this is yet to be formally diagnosed. I've had these issues for as long as I can remember; however, they got much more severe in 2022 when my dog died. For a long time, I have been really afraid to see the doctor, however, I saw the GP 2 days ago (last visit was shortly after my dog's death, and they basically just told me that I was getting bullied and 'should take a warm bath'). It took a lot of courage and support from my parents and college counselor to even get an appointment. I can't wake up and get out of bed early enough to make an appointment (my GP requires appointments to be booked at 8 AM), however, I managed to do it. I was really hoping to go on antidepressants so that I am not so reliant on black market Cannabis to cope. Unfortunately, the doctor has referred me to CAHMS, and I am going to have to go on a waiting list, and will have to try Talking Therapy and CBT before (I have tried these previously and didn't find them effective) I can try medication. Part of my courage to go to the doctor was reuniting with an old friend, who told me about how he went to the GP and got anti-depressants prescribed immediately. Now I'm just sitting here in limbo, waiting for help that I desperately need. I am running out of options as I can no longer afford my Cannabis due to not being able to work, and I just need immediate help. I tried to apply for PIP, but was rejected, which also caused my mental health to take a dip. I'm at risk of failing college and have no motivation to do anything, I don't even enjoy anything anymore. At this point I'm becoming suicidal again as I see no hope for anything to get better."
404,"I'm done with people controlling me, I'm done with people ignoring me. I don't have anyone, I always fuck things up, I'm a bad sibling.. i just want this painful and trauma filled life to be over.. idc anymore.. all the lies, the cheaters, the favoritism, the hurt and the blame. I can't do this anymore.."
405,"I've done so good over the years about handling my thoughts and sadness. But now my life has been crumbling right before my eyes and I can't seem to stop it. I've been staying in hotels for the year due to my family turning their back in me after the passing of my grandmother. They made me leave my house so they could sell it, wouldn't even let my kids finish out the school year. Threatened to have me arrested and all bc I was the one that took care of my grandmother before she passed away. I recently lost my job a week ago, and this whole situation is just tearing apart my relationship with the person I've been with for 16 years. I'm currently sitting in the bathroom at the hotel we have been staying at crying. Someone told me they would help me with paying for my room today and now have backed out. I'm over life and just ready to end it all. I have no bed for my babies to sleep in, and my truck is broke down so staying in there isn't an option either. All shelters are full.  I feel like the biggest failure and POS. God hates me and the world is against me. I'm starting to just think that everyone would be better off without here. If I do it right, then atleast my kids will get money till their 18. I just don't know what to do anymore. Just want it all to be over and not feel anymore pain. "
406,"I've been struggling with insomnia since I was a teenager, and it's only gotten worse as I've grown into my mid 20s. right now I'm caught in a pretty bad episode and it's starting to affect my day to day. 

when I ask for tips, I mean obscure unknown shit. I don't mean sleep hygiene, ashwaganda, eating right, exercise or anything along those lines. what is something unorthodox that you do which helps?"
407,Do you remember often of silly thing you did 7 or 10 years ago and feel bad for that?
408,"I have been experiencing some difficulties for some time regarding attention, memory (I often don't remember what I had to do or what point I was at in the book), reading (I read without things entering my head) and concentration and logic, in addition to symptoms of anxiety/social type and low/flat mood (I never feel like doing anything, not even simply tidying up my room..); then I have periods in which I am interested in something but after a while in which I dedicate time to it, I lose the desire and I let it go.. DSA evaluation done a few years ago was negative. I get lost wasting time without even realizing it

I would like to undergo a psychological and/or neuropsychological evaluation to better understand the origin of these difficulties (e.g. depression, autism or other). I don't know if it is the differential diagnosis

I also have a smartphone addiction with high levels of fomo; I have a thousand stimuli in my brain constantly thinking about what I can search on the internet or ask on chatgpt

What do you think I should do?"
409,"As the world gets worse and worse I sit back and work fulltime take care of my family pay my mortgage I'm a 40 yr old male who has MDD and GAD was diagnosed at 13 with social anxiety disorder I have 2 boys one 19 with MDD and one 10 with adhd.
As I sit back and watch the news read and do my own studying and reading they are pushing us off meds slowly and the world is already extremely messed up....there's school shootings store shootings mass shootings there's drug addicts running around acting weird stealing etc there's just a whole lot going on and we are being blinded by social media and news about mental health in America.......if they take patients off meds this is going to cause major issues in this world the world is sick enough... How long till people stand up for there medical rights? Why are we just allowing them to change medications? If you don't wanna be on the medicine that's on you but if you are a danger you should be medicated a danger to yourself or society honestly benzos should be the last concern. They should worry more about getting drugs off the streets like meth and fentanyl it's not Drs that's killing patients it's patients not listening to doctors directions or a patient will turn to the streets take a Xanax bar that's been laced with pain meds and that's why there's deaths from benzos.....I just don't understand it. Alot of people I believe will turn to self harm if there taken off meds"
410,"i think there is something wrong with me. Im so tired of feeling likw this

ever since i was little i've always had a lingering feeling of sadness and for the past couple years i wake up everyday and i wish i was dead, which doesnt make sense to me because i still feel like i want to dp thateven at my happiest moments and i have a good life i guess. i feel like i could be getting proposed to and ill still want to be deleted, though i doubt i'd ever go through with it because of the consequences that the people in my life will face. Im always dreaming about getting in car crashes or something just so it doesnt seem self inflicted

I keep telling myself 'itll get better' when does it get better, does it ever get better?  
I also feel fucking crazy all the time,i always get nervous and i think my whole life is a lie- that this is all a hallucination and im actually locked up in a padded room somewhere, its kinda funny when i think about it.

I alsso have really bad mood(?) swings, this relates to my kinda self deletion bit, sometimes i feel like god-- like im the best person to walk this earth but then the next moment i feel like the shittiest person to ever live and im so fucking tired of feeling this way its so confusing. sometimes I can feel so many emtions all at once and then the next mineute i feel nothing at all.

I also started to hate my bestfriend again. This happens every couple months and im not sure why, because it always happens after i put in a tonn of effort in our friendship then i just start hating her guts,

i'm not sure if its resentment or something because in the 5 years we've been friends i havent despised her as much as i do right now, which is crazy because i love her and i'd literally put my life on the line for her.. its so confusing and ik ive said this so many times but im so tired of this. It honestly might be resentment because i've spent alot of time with her and her family recently and though i will never know whats behind closed closed doors and from what i know. Her parents express that they love her and ig i just wish mine did the same.

I also cannot stop lying, wheather its big lies or small insignficant lies i cannot stop doing it. I've been in and out of conseullors and therapists but everytime i just lie and lie and lie. I tell them im fine, i tell them all these great things but in reality half of the things i tell are lies and the other half is when i feel 'happy?'. i literally cannot stop lying, i feel like i might be lying about this entire post and i dont actually feel like this- maybe its for attention?

any advice would be great"
411,"First of all, I want to make some things clear. I don't have any mental illness and, if I do, I'm not diagnosed. I don't know if this is the best place to write about my problems, but I will write them here anyway. I apologise if you find that, after reading what I am going to write, my problems don't belong to this subreddit, but I need to talk about them and this is the first space I found about mental health.

I (17F) don't know what to do anymore. I feel alone, sad, hopeless. I have been feeling this way since I was 10/11. It started when my ex-best friend started leaving me out. It wasn't anything bad compared to other things, but it affected me so much. I am so weak. Since then, a cycle has started to form. Everytime I made some friends, they would start leaving me out after some time. I noticed that. I was scared of that. I also didn't (and still don't) know how to solve that. I thought I had broken the cycle last year. I was in a friendgroup of 4 people and my friend and I decided to break it because the other 2 were toxic. I think I was happy for a while. But now she's getting closer to other people and, since I'm scared she is going to leave me, I am getting ready for her departure in case it happens. That's what I do to protect myself. It's wrong and I want to stop doing that; but I'm not brave enough for that. I fear I will never be though.

What is sending me ""crazy"" (I don't know it that's the right word to use) is this cycle. Happy, alone, happy, alone. I don't want to be alone but I always end up alone. I am not strong enough to be alone and I am not brave nor intelligent enough to break the cycle. I need a change because I don't know how much time I can endure this. I need a change to fix me.

I know this might sound dramatic (considering my age and my ""trauma"", although I wouldn't call it trauma, seeing that it wasn't anything heavy), but I genuinely feel that lost and hopeless. I am not suicidal but sometimes I wish I was never born, because it feels like I was born to be alone.

I'm sorry if this doesn't seem coherent and I'm sorry for the way I divided the paragraphs, but right now I'm not as stable as I usually am. I'm also sorry if I chose the wrong tag. I just wanted to get some things off my chest"
412,"I'm 20 and I've worked in the same place for five years now, looking for another job soon.

The issue is that to me, 90% of my inherent self worth is entirely dependent on my utility, workplace performance, work ethic and efficiency.

Any mistake I make, no matter how small, may as well be a direct failure of my character and entire life.

Today I was confronted for coming into work late and I was told by the boss' daughter that I paged for someone incorrectly. Being told this by not just the boss' daughter but the boss himself made me walk into the bathroom and punch myself in the head and in the jaw until I could barely open it anymore. 

If at any time I am anything less than perfect performance in all fields at work, I catalog and keep track of every single individual mistake and either cuss myself or beat myself for every single one.

I don't know what to do anymore. I am scared all the time at work because I'm scared I could be fired for the tiniest mistake possible, so I will physically hurt myself to make sure I don't make that mistake anymore because I know what will happen if I do, and I deserve every ounce of it.

What can I do to make less mistakes?"
413,"I realized recently that a lot of the bad thoughts I have during the day don’t actually matter a few hours later  
When I’m working, I sometimes get stuck in stress or anxiety about something  
It could be anything really something small at work, something someone said, something I did or didn’t do

And when I’m in that moment, it feels huge  
Like it defines the whole day, like I’m carrying it around in my chest  
It drains my focus, my energy, sometimes even my patience

But then a few hours later I’ll be sitting with my partner, or hanging out with friends, and it hits me  
I don’t even care about it anymore  
It’s not gone because it was solved, it’s gone because I shifted  
Because the space around me reminded me that most of it doesn’t mean anything in the bigger picture

This pattern has been happening for a while now  
And only recently have I started to really see it  
How easily I let thoughts hijack my state of mind  
And how often they just dissolve when I reconnect with people I care about

It’s kind of comforting to realize  
That not every storm in my head deserves attention  
Sometimes it just needs time and a little human presence"

416,"I'm planning to do it somewhere around end of this year. I genuinely don't see where my life will head after that point in my life outside disaster. My mental health was already at a rough state since I was fourteen, and it has been going downhill since then. Whenever I believed I had reached my lowest possible point, it always managed to get worse. I have nothing going for in life. I'm not making it to college for sure, and I don't have any sort of passions or ambitions to lend me an other career. I'll either end up homeless or have to freeload from my parents like a pathetic excuse of a human I am. 

I have decided to AT LEAST finish highschool (I'm at the final year) before leaving this world. It doesn't matter whether I get a good AITA or not, just don't want over twelve years of suffering and forced labour to all go to waste. It's not like doing so would even feel like an achievement, considering I had never amounted to anything or anyone, especially myself during that period in my life. I'm only deciding to finish highschool simply for the sake of ""experience"". I already went this far to turn back this early.

Anyone got experience with borderline?.  And is it a borderline thing to have the tv on max volume?.

My gf always has her tv on MAX VOLUME.   I mean max volume its so loud my eardrums hurt my ears are ringing constantly i think i've goten ear damage from it.

Im living in a living nightmare every day is hell.    I have to constantly listen to that horrible fucking sound.    I cant cook,  eat, sleep, shower even take a dump in peace.  Because the tv is always on at full volume.


Every hour of the day and night shes blasting it.   Each time i come home i can hear the tv all the way out onto the driveway wich is kinda far from the house.   Thats how fucking loud it is.  


Each time i come home i feel despair, depressed, broken and hopeless because i know i will have to listen to that awful sound.


I cant sleep or eat im too exhausted to do anything yet i cant sleep because of that ugly stupid dissgusting shity fucking tv.


I've asked her so many times to please turn it down.  I've literaly begged her on my knees crying to just at least turn it down just a bit but she wont.      


I cant even call her anymore because she listens to tv while we talk.   Its so loud i cant hear her, myself, my own thought or anything.

All i hear is that roaring hell machine.   The tv is destroying our relationship,  my mental health, my life THAT FUCKING TV IS DESTROYING EVERYTHING.

I feel haunted by her tv its like everywhere i go no matter what we do the tv ruins it because its on max volume 24/7 with super speakers.


I just want to take a bat and smash that tv over and over punch it until my knuckles bleed, kick it throw it out the window and burn it.   I would do anything i mean ANYTHING to make the torment end.


I cant take it anymore i cant take one more day not one more hour of this.   Im in the bathroom now shaking and crying,  but the tv is so loud i feel like its in here with me. 

Its like i cant escape it.. im forced to constantly endure this fucking noise.   

I dont know what to do guys please i just need advice before i completely snap.  Its close.    Im considering just bashing that tv right now and ending this shit.   




Im scated someone will call the cops,  that my eardrums will burst its so loud and it never fucking stops.

Im at my breakingpoint. 



So guys what should i do?   Please i need advice

419,I don't want to go into detail what happened yesterday because it's kinda embarrassing and stressful. Please respect me not wanting to go into detail what happened yesterday. All I can say no one I know passed away and didn't have a breakup and that I did not have a fight with my boyfriend and making him mad at me and worried about a breakup because of a fight. And there is no drama between me and his family. I get along with his family who are nice people. I'm still with my boyfriend who loves me dearly. I'm just sad about the stressful thing that happened yesterday. ​Can anyone help cheer me up after the stressful event that happened yesterday? It's going to take me awhile to get over this sadness and stress. It's going to take me awhile to heal from this. I'm not feeling suicidal just to let everyone know. I'm ok all I am is just really sad and a bit stressed.
420,"My boyfriend is currently struggling with his mental health and I wanted to make a care package for the next time I see him. I was thinking tissues, maybe some nice socks, a candle and the moisturiser he uses.

421,"I live with a good friend - we’ve lived together for 25 years.  He’s turning 55 this year.  He’s had complex health problems (type 1 diabetes) leading to a double organ transplant in 2016.  Since Covid he’s been largely isolated from the rest of the world.  He worked in IT/network security until he lost his job last year.

In December he traveled back to stay with his parents as his father was about to undergo surgery with a long recovery period.  His father had the surgery, returned home for Christmas but then went back into the hospital and passed away shortly thereafter.

My friend returned home in February.  Our cat had developed kidney disease and died suddenly by early March.  The day after the cat died my friend asked me to step outside and told me that there was a critical situation that he needed to let me know about - his computers were compromised and he needed to contact the FBI as some bad actors were attacking him.

We’re now in May and he’s been stuck in a loop trying to bring back his computers from this attack.  Every symptom that he identifies I look up on Reddit and it seems like something harmless.  He keeps spending money on new equipment because he can’t trust his current phones, computers, Bluetooth devices, etc.  He’s doing some of this in the garage because the metal is shielding him from errant Bluetooth devices that are infecting his computers.

When I give him feedback on why one thing isn’t a problem he jumps to something else entirely.  He had a part time contracting gig that he couldn’t do because his devices were compromised so they ended the contract.  He also seems to lose track of time and never has any time to do anything despite being unemployed with no social life, etc

He talks about looking for a new job.  He always took a lot of pride in his work but he can’t trust his devices nor does he trust anyone who contacts him about work.

I’m not sure that this started this year.  Reflecting back there were probably other incidents that preceded this that may have signaled some sort of issue.

I got him to call his medical provider (Kaiser in California) to get help but he basically presented his symptoms as stress and mourning so they set him up with a therapist (marriage therapist I think) that he’s seen 3-4 times.  I think he’s largely hidden the underlying problems.

I’m concerned that this is more than a mental health issue.  He’s on anti rejection drugs.  He’s also lived with diabetes his whole life and is 55.  I’ve encouraged him to try to get more help from a medical professional to make sure nothing else is going on but he refuses.  He refuses to even consider the possibility that there’s anything wrong with him.

I’m concerned that he will continue to decline.  Not sure what to do next.

422,"hi,

i notice my mental health is going downhill again and i don't really know what to do with it this time.

my mental health has been up and down my whole life, i had to grow up early, come from a family where emotional intelligence does not exist. emotions are suppressed, they are not allowed to be talked about (unless it is anger from the guardian), everything is taboo, comments like ""we have had it hard too"" and ""you are not the only one, there are worse things in the world"".. and that has been my whole life.

a lot of things have happened in the past few years and at the end of last year i thought things were finally going in the right direction again. i had a well-paid education, had stopped abusing alcohol, had completed therapy and actually saw a future for myself again. until the Christmas period started and i unconsciously experienced a lot of traumatic stress which manifested itself in my education.

I was looking for the wrong distraction again, came home late, started drinking more again and eventually messed up my education and got fired.

That same week my father died and I ended up in a car accident.

Since then I have been unemployed for three months, I only had a benefit with high bills and I was at home with my grandparents (where I still live by the way) and I was eating myself up inside.

Now I have had a job again for a few weeks and I have made the choice to follow a different education at the university. Now with my current job I feel so worn out and bad, because I really earned so much more and now also have debts and can't save, while the education here in this country is very expensive and I also have to live on my own for it. (This is also necessary, because my home situation is getting worse)

Despite being at home, I have not given myself the chance to process everything and give it a place and I notice that this is now starting to take its toll. I don't sleep, I only have nightmares, my room is always a mess, the bond with my grandparents is getting worse, basic hygiene things that I forget, I'm not in touch with my emotions, I'm again stress eating which makes me gain weight, I'm struggling with a negative self-image and I'm not happy when I look in the mirror, I'm smoking a lot of cigarettes again and I'm also tending towards other unhealthy coping methods such as alcohol.

I'm going to therapy, but it may take a while before that treatment can start and the last time it didn't feel like I was making any progress.

It's just exhausting to think that I'm again/still busy with ""surviving"" and figuring out how I'm going to achieve something with my life, instead of being able to voluntarily stand still for a moment and breathe and tell myself ""wow, things are really going well and this feels good.""

I don't really know where this story is going, but hopefully it helps to dump it here for a while.

okay thanks for reading and i appreciate you for this"
423,"I have been going to therapy for a while now and I have come to a conclusion that I COULD have a mild form of DID. Since my attempt back in October, I felt like I still killed off some part of me, which was my old self, and I was ""revived"" into who I am now. So I currently disassociate myself from who I was before October. However, I have noticed that under an intense amount of stress, along with anger, something switches inside me and some sort of psychotic maniac takes over me, which I may have figured out is all my anger from the past 24 years. I am then suddenly not in control, and ""he"" takes over my body and does what he wants to do with all of his anger. Last time this happened, I did manage to fend this off through means of bodily harm to myself, but it was more like a fight for control. Is this something sort of form of DID, BPD, or something else? It's genuinely terrifying that I'm not in control all the time."
424,I don't think I'm gonna make it 😕 I'm feeling really hopeless. Anyone out there?
425,"I'm feeling so hopeless, I called my mom crying for help and all she told me is to talk to my therapist. Like for Pete's sake, I just wanted to get some support from my mom. 😪"
426,"tbis is mainly prompted by my reaction to receiving feedback on my  composition from different teachers, and my mindset immediately interpreting it as ""worst thing in the world."" now i know it's not objectively great, but my poor mental health amplified that and it then spiralled to a whole other factors about my character revolving around social skills, personality and achievements and what not with all negative attachments. this happens way to often .

everything i do is dragged down to being ""average"" or ""not good enough"" because of this and i'm sick of it. ive heard pieces of advice (basic ones), which included waiting it out and let time work but it's really getting to me. 


pretty basic problem but any advice on helping with this? tysm and i'm open to any. "
427,"I found out I have anxious preoccupied attachment style and it's ruining my relationships. I want to fix this. So I'd like to hear your stories how did you went from AP to secure. And also what advices do you have? What to do or not to do.

I'm also considering going to my school psychologist, but I'm not sure he'd be able to help with this based on he's there for academic issues, and sadly in my country therapist are very expensive and I can't afford it."
428,"I have been struggling with this feeling for a while, but lately it has been getting worse.

It feels like every strand of my being is fabricated, unauthentic. Instead of acting on my own dreams desires and volition, I do things to reinforce a certain perceprion of myself, like playing make believe.

Even if I try very very hard, I cannot tell myself what I want, what I wish for, instead, I know what I WISH to want, what I WANT to wish for.

I want to believe that I like art, like the process of creation, but I don't think I do, I want to feel like I want to be a musician and that I want to have my fingers on the keys of a piano and express my ideas and thoughts through lyrics, even though I dont have any, I just want to feel like I care about something.

I want to think that I love the people around me, my family and the little amount of close friends I have, but I don't know if I do,
 I dont know if I would cry when my parents eventually die.

 But instead it seems that everything I feel is actually how I think I should feel, like sticking my hands into the river with glowes on wondering how would the current feel.

I dont want to tell this to my friends, as I think they have better things to do, and have it much worse, so I write here.

I am loosing it, or maybe asking for attention, or maybe am trying to prove something to myself that I am human and have human problems too, and I am sick and it is human to not be okay."
429,"Sorry in advance for the length.

I have been having depressive episodes and anxiety since 2021. I've had 3 therapists try to help me, and the most notable change is that now I don't even want to try anymore.

I mean, now I know that humans are social creatures and they need daily interactions (I didn't believe in that before); I know that my desire to be perfect contributes to my lack of self esteem. So what? I still struggle to make friends (even in environments that encourage that) and my self esteem is still below zero.

The worst thing is that if someone asked me to describe what therapy is about, I couldn't tell them. After a session ends, it's like when you stop doomscrolling - you look at the time, one hour has passed, you realize you have nothing to bring you home from that experience. I can tell you what happens - I go in, they ask me how I feel, I explain why I feel bad; sometimes we try to find \_theories\_ about what could have caused a certain behaviour (I say theories, because who really knows?), other times we try to reframe the feeling in a different way (but that rarely convinces me).

I've said this to them, and they said it's normal - that I shouldn't expect change to come from any individual session, but from the whole journey. This has done nothing but instill suspicion. We could spend months talking about an aspect of my life only to end up where we started, and they don't see a problem with that.

I don't even know what ""working on something"" means. Like, if they tell me that ""I need to work on my self esteem"", what do I need to do? Does it just mean to talk about it? Do I need to figure it out on my own? If so, why am I paying you exactly? Every time I've asked them to elaborate, they have been very vague.

The therapist I'm seeing now is the weirdest of all. He says that I'm ""difficult"" and has compassion towards my parents, and finds it funny that I have contradictions. He also said some helpful things, but I don't feel comfortable being vulnerable around him. It feels like talking to the typical person who doesn't understand mental health who's like ""just don't be sad lol"".

After finding out that I have ""autistic traits"", he said his goal was to make me understand this condition better, but it has been 2 months and we haven't talked about it once.

Phychiatrists have been trying different medications, swapping them for others when they don't seem to work. Honestly, I don't see how they \_could\_ work. Sure, sertraline might make me get out of bed, but it won't magically make me accept my impotence in the face of the horrors of the world, or make me figure out what I want to do with my life. And it seems like the second thing is what people are expecting out of meds.

I am honestly so confused about everything. Can anyone explain me if I'm doing something wrong?

431,"Freud believed that most of the things we do in life - hobbies, passions, work,... - are just a cope for the lack of sex. This made me deeply depressed. Does that mean that everything I do is just me trying to distract from the fact that I don't have sex? If I had sex, would I stop entertaining myself with hobbies and trying to fill my time? I seriously hope modern psychology debunked Freud's beliefs because the guy was too pessimistic, like, you either have sex or your life is a cope for the lack of it. Thanks to everyone willing to help"

I'm suffering from DID, and everyone who came into my life either left or hated me because of my condition. I can't relate to or talk to guys because of my childhood trauma. I just want to feel understood. Please help. I'm on the edge of killing myself, and I feel stupid for even asking for friends.

433,"if you suffer from Mental Health problems do you think you're better off with someone that also has Mental Health problems?

I think maybe the ability for them to empathize or understand maybe greater. But also they might not have the space to help you as much as someone without mental health issues?

There is also a risk that you both could be sick at the same time.  Like 2 people that both lost their license and you can't drive anywhere. But maybe you could heal easier and quicker suffering together?  

Has anyone experienced both kinds of relationships to compare what works best for them?

434,"For the past few nights I’ve just been crying nonstop. Once I’m by myself at night I fell like my life is pointless. I just replay every mean thing someone’s said to me and how much I just want to talk to someone and just rant about everything that’s hurting me. I cry so much and hurt so bad that I can literally fell my heart breaking with every thought about how much ppl hate me. I love talking I talk 24/7 to anyone who will listen but that is the thing that hurts the most. Especially my family, my sister and parents always tell me to shut up and call me stupid and dumb (all the basic insults) because I talk too much and can get loud if I’m really happy to talk. But I don’t have anyone else to talk to. I used to have alot of “friends” but I just couldn’t take the stress they put me under like putting me down to make themselves look better, talking over /ignoring me, making me the butt of their jokes, leaving me out because they “forgot to tell me”. So I just stopped being friends with them , now I work and sleep that’s all. I have no more social life no more friends and nobody to talk to. I literally sit on my bed and talk to myself about my day while crying because I’m the only one who will listen . I just don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t want to end myself but I just want this pain to end I want to feel loved and accepted. I’m turning 20 in June and just want to move cross country and cut everyone off but I’m scared I’ll fail and be homeless. I used to hurt myself when I was 17-18 because I was just so low in life I wanted to die. Sometimes I’m mad at myself for not ending it all back then just to be free of this pain. I’ve been clean for a year and a half! I’m tired of being alone and sad I just want to talk again and not annoy everyone , I’m so tired of being tired . Thank you for listening to me , first time in a while I’ve been heard."
435,Has anyone ever faced or experienced deep rage that you don’t want to let out when you’re in a particular situation that triggered anger? Because i get those every now and then…
436,"Good morning, 

I'm 19, almost 20, and since I was 15, I've been absolutely obsessed with my physique. I am an ambitious young girl, I have ideas and passions in life, friends, a boyfriend, studies that I like, but every day, a large part of my mind is busy constantly calculating if I am pretty. In the morning, the first thing I do is look in the mirror and count all the flaws on my face. I spend a lot of time finding solutions to my crooked teeth, my textured skin and my thin lips. I hate myself in every way, however, on the days when I manage to find myself pretty, a little voice in my head explains to me that it's fleeting and I only find myself pretty in a selfie because I took myself in a certain angle and a certain light, so that the girl in the photo is somehow not me and that I'm a fraud. Brief. 

I think that as a girl and someone who has experienced harassment there are several reasons for this. First, I was bullied in middle and high school and considered the girl no guy would want as a girlfriend. When they were talking about me and one of them made a joke about a potential relationship with me, they grimaced in disgust because they found me ugly. In high school, boys made lists of girls from the most beautiful to the least beautiful and placed me in the list of “you can’t even fuck her.” At the same time, I experienced a sexual assault, while I was going through a serious illness of the immune and digestive system which already gave me a very negative self-image. 
Besides, I now have a boyfriend who, before we got together, looked at girls in bikinis on Instagram. Since I found out he did this before, I can't get the images of the girls he was looking at out of my head. I wonder why he likes me physically if this is the type of girl he wants. I'm not like them at all and I want to cry every time I think about it. 

I would like to have your opinion. "
437,"I've had this problem for a few years, and it started after my grandfather passed when i was 11. I'm now 14, 15 in 11 days. I'm not sure if this is just my imagination or schizophrenia or something else, but it's concerning and i would appreciate some feedback with what it might be. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about because it feels weird. 

I feel like characters from my hyperfixation are watching me? I feel stupid talking about this, but i just feel like they're in my mind and judging my every move. It's gotten to the point i talk to images of them. I feel like they're there, but they aren't. Is this a serious problem or just being weird? 

I haven't talked to anyone about this yet because it just feels really stupid of me to explain and it's just overall embarrassing. If anyone knows what this is, please tell me, but please no insults or harsh behavior. This just makes me very worried because my family has a history of schizophrenia but i'm too nervous to talk to my family or therapist about it because it's super weird. Is this a serious problem or just being imaginative as a teen? 

I need advice on if I should ask my mom or therapist what is going on or if this seems serious. This is my first time posting something on this app so i'm nervous. "
438,"

The only acquaintance I had messaged me and said you suck completely and she was just doing me use and throw nothing else, I don't matter and stuff like that it's not like I didn't already anticipated that but it had gone worse, she was the only acquaintance I had, she said she talked to someone for an hour, my enemy and probably back bitched me and this is what they did with me everybody just used and threw me away my entire life what did I do to deserve this I didn't even do anything like what I even did. I'm not so bad I never said anything to anybody tell me why I'm wrong people just treat me horribly, at my house outside my house I'm just treated worse than trash. Every friend I had, my family they did the worst possible a human could do to another, it's not even physical it's worse form of torture. I feel I'm not living on earth it's hell I haven't found a single person who just didn't use me worst way possible it's not even that I'm naive or a stupid person or maybe some kind of people pleaser no I'm very cautious when it comes to people and yet, I always got used even the most kindest and beautiful faces did the worst possible they showed me everytime why I was wrong in trusting once again why I was a fool. I know whenever I'm trusting someone I must be a fool that's not it it actually made me believe it's a curse for me to live on earth now, I'm just trying to survive between demons and I'm not strong I see people everyday and I break out In tears when I hear that they have a good family, supportive friends and they don't play mind games with them,  I don't even know what to do anymore, I'm completely numb for now but next moment my mind would be flooding with emotions and self sabotage and it never did me good, I don't know why I should survive on this hell I just stopped believing anyone could be nice or people don't have hidden motives when they interact with me and everytime I tell myself no not everyone is like that, they prove me wrong how longer can I keep denying this, when this is reality how can people be genuinely nice, nobody is, they are inherently evil  creatures who play mind games on people sucking the soul out of them until they're just mindless corpses why the hell should I survive for monsters.

439,"I was having a very normal life until early this year where everything seems to go wrong around me. I haven’t changed any of my routine or values, it just feels like incredible bad luck has been striking me for the past few months, and it seems like nothing good is going to happen tomorrow. I’ve been deteriorating in my life quality, I’m not scoring the same grades as the last semester, I can’t perform well in class, I can’t even get up to clean my room. I just wanna sleep and forget what happens to me in a daily. I just feel so numb rn, I have no clue what went wrong, and if I’m going through this path, I’m gonna go insane really.

It basically doesn't fit todays beauty standards. I know I don't because I go to a school where almost all students are boys. And when you don't fit their idea of attractive, they will call you ugly. 

I don't think I really care about their opinions. I'm not even attracted to men, so why should I care what a 17 year old douche thinks of me? 

The thing is, it still kinda hurts. Whenever someone says I dress ugly or my makeup looks bad, I never change it, because I like it. But then every time I look at myself, there's this echo of their voices and I keep thinking if I should change it. 

I want to not get hurt or ever bothered by these insults ever again. But I don't know how. Any advice?"

When I feel sadness, it approaches depression, when I get angry, I feel like hurting myself or someone else, when I feel joy, it looks like those characters from musicals who suddenly start dancing in the street, and when I feel fear, I often have panic attacks. I went to a psychiatrist, he said it could be bipolar disorder. I read about the disease, but it only mentions sadness and mania, when I literally feel all emotions too much and it changes rapidly during the day. Just one message from a friend and a depressive state turns into great joy, later it changes by itself into completely random emotions. A psychiatrist once prescribed me medication, but I had to change them to other ones, because after them I felt absolutely nothing, complete emptiness, and I could fall asleep at very random moments during the day. Other medications hardly work at all. It's very difficult for me to live with this and I don't know what to do anymore."

451,"Hey everyone,  
I need to share my story because maybe someone out there is going through the same hell I did. For months, I was convinced I had put myself at risk for HIV because of two situations:

1. Dry humping (with clothes on, no skin-to-skin contact).
2. Shaking hands with someone who *might* have had vaginal fluid on their hand, while I *might* have had a small cut on my palm (not even sure if it was open or bleeding).

# The Testing

I spiraled so hard that I took **fourth-generation HIV tests** at:

* 6 weeks → **Negative**
* 10 weeks → **Negative**
* 12 weeks → **Negative**
* 18 weeks → **Negative**

Logically, that should’ve been enough. But my anxiety refused to accept it.

# The Mental Torture

I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t focus at work. I kept replaying every second of those situations, analyzing if I missed some ""what if."" I messaged doctors online, emailed my country’s HIV center **multiple times**, and even called clinics—just to hear the same answer every single time:

**""You had ZERO risk. None. HIV doesn’t transmit this way.""**

The first time I read that, I was in **complete shock**. How could it be *zero*? I kept doubting, so I asked again… and again. Same answer. Every. Single. Time.

# The Turning Point

After two weeks of obsessive reassurance-seeking, I decided to **try accepting it**. To celebrate, I ordered McDonald’s (because why not?) and let myself breathe for the first time in months.

I’m not fully ""cured"" of the anxiety yet, but I’m getting there. If you’re stuck in the same loop—**trust the science, trust the tests, and trust the experts**. You’re not alone.

**Has anyone else been through this? How did you finally break free from the fear?**"
452,"I'm 17 I hate myself so much 
I think i forget how to be happy 
I used to helf harm my self for two years, I have suicidal thoughts and I think about ending my life if things get worse 
I don't have the money or the will to go to a therapist even if I wanted to, My friends have cut ties with me and my family wishes me death 
I don't know what the purpose of this post is, but I'll write it anyway 
Please i need help "
453,"I'm in the U.S., since that will be relevant.

Last week I had what I can only describe as a Mental Heath Crisis, but I wasn't suicidal. I tried looking for options on where to go to get help, but the only answers easily available were all for helping if you were contemplating hurting yourself. I ended up sitting in a parking lot until I was functional enough to call a friend and vent, but I still feel the toll of that. I know I'm not back to normal even after taking time off work and dedicating the weekend to recovery, and those were only options because I had someone to talk with.

So where do you go/who do you contact if you're having a mental health crisis but aren't going to cause harm?

EDIT:
So the answer seems to be ""Get a therapist/friend/community and work it out with them."" This feels lacking to me. Like, I understand that resources are probably better spent on preserving a life in immediate danger, but... I mean, last week was literally the worst week of my life basically due to one interaction. I was a useless as a member of society for days. I feel like there should be somewhere you can go to just...talk to someone? Even if for only 15 minutes or something.

So, follow-up question: Are there services for situations like this in other countries? Or is it universally just something you're expected to work out alone?"

467,"Hi, I’m a student doing my GCSEs. I’m autistic and have adhd and suffered badly with burnout in feburary and still havent fully gotten back from it. I stopped going to school and they let me work from home now. 

I stopped going because I really don’t like people, and I have anorexia, so not only was it physically demanding to the point of exhaustion everyday, but my teachers started reporting me and questioning me about my weight, so I kept getting interrogated.

Because I was so exhausted, I couldnt revise when I got home, and then I would feel guilty and upset about not revising. 

Whilst I’ve worked from home it’s been okay, I did about 2-3 hours of revision a day, but on some days I couldn’t do any.  Now the exams have started, I’ve done 5/18 so far and I’m really struggling to revise. I’m smart and I’m very passionate about some of my subjects, so I want to prove myself and do well, but I feel like I won’t if I don’t revise.

I talked to one of my friends (who used to be my teacher at my old school, long story but she’s not a groomer lmao) and she basically said ‘Look, you’ve revised hard, just because you don’t revise before the exam doesn’t mean you forget everything you know. You’re in the final stretch now, there’s not much you can do to change your grade so just believe in yourself and take it easy.’ My mum says the same thing. And whilst I do agree, everyone else is revising and acting like they do nothing but revise, so i feel like i should too, and if i don’t I feel guilty and like I’m not going to do well.

Whenever I’m letting myself have a rest as they say, my head is just telling me telling me they’re enabling me to fail, and look at how they’ve ended up in dead-end jobs, if i take their advice that’ll be me too.

At the same time, when I do revise it’s panicked and rushed and stressed and checking to see if my 1 hour timer is over yet so I can stop. And then when I’ve stopped I’m telling myself I’m lazy and there’s more to do and whatever else.

Because of the stress, I’ve been more prone to bingeing. So I’m convinced i’ve gained weight and it is bothering me so bad, but then my sociology teacher said to me yesterday to ‘make sure i’m eating properly’ or whatever. Like half of me wants to curl up with a maryland biscuit and play animal crossing, but then ‘i’m lazy, i’m going to fail, i’m fat, i look bad, i’m a pig, i need to revise.’ starts. The other half comes out when I revise: ‘i literally can’t do anything i can’t deal with the stress, I will go in and try in the exams but i just want all of this to go away.’

I don’t know what to do, it’s a constant tug of war. So I end up just staring around blankly not knowing what to do. And if I ate more than usual then I will feel awful and like I’m just going to get fat and undo all of the ‘progress’ i’ve made (progress in question is being severely underweight to the point where my heart beats so hard that i can’t breathe deeply without pain)

I really need advice because I am so trapped in my own mind, and I literally cannot imagine how I’m going to cope with next week since I have 6 exams that week. I’ve barely managed with the 3 exams per week i’ve done for the last two weeks.

468,For years I have had house plants and gone through bouts of depression leading to me losing a plant here or there due to neglect. This past winter was particularly bad and I went from about 60 house plants to maybe 15. Its devastating. And they're (the dead ones) all sitting there. Mocking me. I dont know how to move forward. Clean up. Restart? Am I worthy of restarting? Those beautiful did not deserve to die. I am beating myself up bad for this. 
469,Have her a note to explain my feelings of life there's being anxiety that is making me fail and all she says is 'do you want to change schools' not even help no questions or anything just still in a state of chaos. She should be getting immediate help but she has proved she is useless and coudkent care less. I regret wasting my life giving notes to an idiot. Can't go in to class me skipping she's the most useless African parent 
470,"okay so not *everything* but it certainly feels like it. 

for the past few months i’ve been incredibly afraid of developing a life changing health condition out of nowhere. what if i missed a cancer symptom which costs me my life? also just super sqeamish about things now when i never ever was, to the point where i avoid things like vital blood tests now. 

more recently, i am afraid of everyone i know dying, and that i am wasting time by not seeing everyone i know because what if they died tomorrow and i cancelled that plan/didn’t open that last text? what would i actually do without them? i don’t want to live alone and i am taking everyone for granted.

i’m also really really scared of someone breaking into my house, not even to rob me but just the thought of someone watching me while im unaware. what happens when i notice them? what if i never notice them?

the last one i understand why i feel like this considering it’s actually happened to me lol, but the other two i don’t get at all? no one close to me has died suddenly except pets, and im in good health. how do i get over this constant paranoia? "
471,today i heard someone tell someone else “cut deeper.” ofc the skl didn’t do jack shit but a detention. i was confused at first bc i thought i was the only one that cuts myself but its left me thinking THE WHOLE DAY. why the fuck would someone say that?? that is so fucked up it’s not even funny. i hate ppl like this and there friends were laughing about it too. teenagers are so disgusting.
472,"Greetings dear people.
Something is wrong with me. I don't know how to describe it, but it really bothers me. I feel like I'm in a bubble, I forget things a lot, I feel like I'm talking to someone that it's going through me.Like can't focus on conversation or when i focus on it, later on i'll forget what i talked with that person.As for memory, I'm very forgetful, I have trouble remembering what happened a few moments ago, how my day went, and so on.. I just don't know. I should stress that this ""didn't"" happen in my childhood, at least I don't think so  I remember for sure. I had an extremely strong memory, I don't know how to describe it to you, I was able to recall almost all the events that happened before. I never had any problems with communication, I was always sociable and full of emotions, and more lively. Somehow everything changed. It all changed after I finished school, from then I got a lot of anxiety because of my physical appearance that it really isolated me, after anxiety comes depression, but no  there was so much anxiety  so strong that I was afraid to go out to the store. After a few years later, thank God, there is no more depression and anxiety, I overcame it. But I don't know if these are the consequences that I emphasized at the beginning because of that, or do I have some other disorder?  Thank you very much for your time, I ask for serious and honest comments, because this is serious, greetings!"

474,"How do I help my gf out of her constantly watching brain rot?
Robot voice, split screen with random shit that has nothing to do with the subject.

Now she got to the point of the voice over being sped up, she can sit there and watch that shit for hours.

If I try to get her to do something else she just says she doesn't want to. If I bring up the brain rot she just lashes back and mention the fact that I play video games. Offered to play games with her instead or even watch movies, go for walks but nothing works. 

This is starting to destroy our relationship and I'm out of ideas.

She's addicted to brain rot."

476,"What about an utter lack of privacy like thoughts, physical, digital, how would it make you feel?"
477,"I could use some encouragement right about now. I'M TIRED. My body is tired, my soul is tired. I'm sad ALL THE TIME and am masking constantly. It feels like 2 steps forward, 5 steps back. I want to give up soooo badly. But then I think back, and remember just how dark things used to be. While I'm still struggling in dmn near every area of my life, I know that fighting for a good future is the only way I'm going to get there. I'm tired, but I have to keep going. I didn't make it this far just to make it this far.

478,"I hate this part about myself and what to know ways to help deal with this. 


I get attached way too easily and get obsessed with people. I get very obsessed to my friends and partners and that's why I've distances myself from dating anyone. I still haven't gotten over my most recent ex. We broke up 1.5 years ago. I still stalk her socials. I do not have any hate towards her, but rather I still think I have feelings for her. I feel jealous about her new boyfriend and even during our relationship I felt I was very weirdly obsessed to her. It would be completely normal for me to go to the same places I knew she was in to ""randomly"" see her and I got very anxious and thought she wasn't into me anymore when she wasn't answering to me. Even writing this makes me see myself as some sort of psycho. "
479,"Hi Reddit, sorry if I’m using the wrong subreddit for this, but I wasn’t sure what else to use. I’m 13F, and I’ve been going through a lot mentally for a few years now. I’ve always felt like something was wrong, but I recently started learning about bipolar 2 disorder and I relate to it more than anything I’ve ever read. I tried to bring it up with my mom, but she immediately dismissed it and said I just have depression. The thing is, what I experience doesn’t feel like “just” depression. I know something more is going on.

Here are some of the symptoms I experience regularly: •	Extreme mood swings that go beyond sadness—periods of deep isolation and hopelessness, followed by bursts of restless energy, pacing around my room, talking fast, racing thoughts, and even random confidence highs where I think I’m the most attractive person ever… which then crash back down into self-hatred. •	Switching between inflated self-worth and disgust with myself. •	A constant need to escape reality through music or my imagination because the real world feels unbearable. •	Random agitation that comes out of nowhere—irritability, restlessness, feeling like I could explode if interrupted or talked over. •	Weeks where I don’t talk to anyone and just shut myself in my room. •	Episodes of self-harm. •	Emotional whiplash that I can’t control, even when I try.

My mom doesn’t see any of this. Or maybe she sees it and just refuses to believe it. She compares me to other people in the family with mental illness like it’s some competition (my family has a past of bipolar disorder). My aunt (a psychiatrist, who I see once a year) also dismissed my feelings, saying I’m just depressed. But this feels like so much more than that. I don’t want to self-diagnose, but I feel like I’m finally seeing my life clearly—and everyone around me is trying to shut that down.

On top of that, I’ve been starting to question if my mom is emotionally abusive. She: •	Screams and swears at my sister and me every single day over tiny things (like drinking soda or leaving a sock on the floor) •	Calls us names, insults us, and has never once apologized for hurting us •	Gaslights me constantly, twists my words, and refuses to ever be wrong •	Uses embarrassing or personal stories about us as a punchline for jokes around others •	Belittles and criticizes me constantly •	Controls all my devices even though I’ve never given her a reason not to trust me

We’ve even started secretly recording her yelling because it’s gotten so bad. I feel like I’m finally waking up to how wrong all of this is, but the people who should be helping me just make me feel insane.

I don’t know if anyone will even take this seriously, but I needed to say it somewhere. Am I overreacting? Does this sound like bipolar 2? Does this sound like emotional abuse? I feel like I’m losing my mind trying to convince people that what I’m experiencing is real.

Thanks for reading."
480,"I’m really trying to be okay and not sh, but it’s been really hard and I feel like I’m gonna brake and end up caving and doing something. The only thing stopping me it my senior trip this week. But it’s probably going to get cancelled because of wildfires in my area. I feel so selfish feeling like I was to hurt myself when people are loosing their homes right now. I recently lost my mom and she was the only family I had, my sister, aunt, uncles, cousins, they don’t talk to me. Like ever. And I my grandma saw the message I sent to her about my graduation and never responded. It’s not like I’m not trying here. But I feel like I can’t do this shit anymore. Sorry for the language. But I really feel like I’m on the brink right now. I also just found out that my one uncle who said he would come and always be there for me, just told me he can’t make it. (He is one of the only people in my family to not god to drugs, and kinda talks to me sometimes, but he also lives in Florida and I’m on the other side of the country.)
I don’t know what to do. I just feel so overwhelmed and stressed. I feel like I can’t breathe and I’m gonna go numb soon. I’m starting to scare myself. I don’t know what to do I’m 18 and my life has no worth. I can’t do this anymore. 
Why did I have to loose the one person I could trust. I could be myself with. I’m so lost I feel sick and I can’t eat and when I do I can’t hold it down.

487,"DAY 5, SESSIONS DONE: 3

Don’t have treatments scheduled on weekends, and it was absolutely very difficult, the energy level has dropped significantly. Saturday was the lowest, completely lost in pain and cry, Sunday was a bit better. 

I have received my third dose today, the good news is there are NO ANY FORM OR AMOUNT OF MEMORY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS LOST , just a bit of minor headache and muscle pain.

So let’s take about benefits, I know this is only the third time since I started the treatment, but yes they are that quick and strong. Emotional stability are not that great yet, but I have regained control, I’m no longer getting triggered by all kinds of small shits; but they aren’t flat like died , unlike Lorazepam or SNRIs, I can feel my happiness, I can feel my sadness, I get angry, and I get bothered, but I’m under control, this is such a day and night change . 
 
Also like I mentioned that I have regained passion of doing makeups, I want to dress pretty, and things are matters! I have dressed up for today’s dr appointment, new dress and now sandals, I even started to see more smiles and happiness on people, I feel so very GRATEFUL! I have realized that I can be pretty, my life can be pretty, and I had just forgotten that.

Day 3, Sessions done: 2

The first two days was a bit out of my expectations, the effects were raw eyes visible level.
The white noise like pain was gone for like 23 hours of a day,  and very likely the first of the past two years at noon, I have fall asleep without medication, I have felt absolutely refreshed and exhausted free after a shower, which is very different from what I have experienced before, that after showering I will only be in an extreme level of burned out and can only lay on my bed breathing heavy for like half an hour.
During the nap, I had a dream, it was terrifying. In the dream, I have done my treatment, and depression has came back, with only hopeless and pain, I have no escape but to cry. I woke up terrified, but it was ok, I was ok. I understand that it was how I worried deep down my mind, that the peace I have got was way too precious, and I cannot afford of loosing it.
Btw, I have even regained a bit of passion for doing makeups, which I have lost interest for like a year.

I have cried, but this time, it was not     caused by endless pain.
I have cried, from the general of emotions. 
I have felt my flash, and my life. 
I have cried, but this time, it was from hope, happiness, and sympathy.

EXPLANATION OF THE POST:

I have joined an experimental “magnetic seizure therapy” project run by my psychiatrist, I wish this can be the hope I’ve been seeking, and I got a feel that this can be the way; so i feel like I should post some of my therapy updates, increase if this whole treatment and sickness journey can be found useful by more people who’s drowning like me.

I started the MST treatment May 8 2025, and this will be a 12 sessions treatment done in a row in three weeks, and only skipping on the weekends."

489,"I've had thought of killing myself in the past my parents are aware of my thoughts, but I haven't gotten any help yet. But I've crossed the line im tired of living I wanna die, the thoughts are coming back. I'm behind on my school work and I'm getting in trouble for it, I have a bunch of work to do and I've had panic attacks because how much work I have to do. I broke my back so I wasn't in school for 2 months I'm back now and now my teacher is telling my parents about a essay that I found out about this Monday and my class is already halfway through and it's about a book I don't know anything about. "
490,"I actually don't know what to say for myself at this stage. Basically, I struggle massively with depression, anxiety, panic attacks and I am autistic, and my ability to cope with things on a general basis is low. I started a new job in April, I'm working 12 hour shifts 7-7 plus 2 hrs travel time 4 days a week, they are on a 2 week rota and the way my shifts work I actually end up working 7 in a row and I just can't do it feeling as depressed and anxious as I do. I have panic attacks all day, I struggle to get out of bed in the morning becayse I'm feeling so depressed. I've adopted bad habits like smoking and self harm to cope. I've increased my antidepressants by 40mg and I'm on propranolol for anxiety, but I'm just unable to cope. I think it shows in my work but I just can't help it, I'm exhausted. I am obviously on probation for 6 months, and I need to be being careful, but I just woke up this morning and I just COULD NOT do it, I phoned in sick. I am so burnt out, this is my 6th shift in a row, my head feels depressed and muddled and I can't think straight. I just need to sleep. I passed out yesterday night from sheer exhaustion mentally and physically. I just couldn't do it, and I am so disappointed in myself and worried about what repercussions I might have for it, I tried to explain but my manager just said mmm okay and cut me off mid explanation. I'm so disappointed in myself and I can't tell anyone I called off sick, but I just couldn't do it. I feel so ill"
491,"So basically iv been getting intrusive thoughts of self harm. I keep think maby if I know more about it it'll stop me? But maby it will only make me? Idfk. Like what dose it feel like? How do uou know if your feeling the urge, or just don't like the thought of it? I'm so scarred, that one day I'll just say fuck it and cut."

Hi, I need somewhere to vent about this. I'm struggling so much right now. I've been in a relationship for 3 years with my bf and we've  had problems because of my communication issues, mental health stuff as well. This is my first real relationship too. I've struggled with anxiety, depression and ptsd since I can remember.  I'm on medication and see a therapist but its been a bit since my last session. We've been having more issues this year and just constant arguing and fighting. He has said hurtful things and so have I. We had a miscarriage last month and it feels like it gotten worse. I feel like Im losing him and I don't recognize myself anymore either. I feel miserable inside and just have to go on about my day at work. It feels like our relationship is toxic right now. I just don't really know how to feel. I feel confused and like a ball of anxiety. It's hard having to live with your brain making you unhappy. Maybe someone else can relate.  "

496,"Hello, reddit. I don’t come on here often but i needed an outlet to real people and since i can’t afford therapy and don’t want to talk to a bot anymore, this will do. I’m a junior in high school and pretty much all year i’ve been struggling to even start my work and it’s just gotten more stressful the more time goes on. Even every mention of it makes me consider my future and if i’ll have one, but I know I can’t get it all done so I need to figure out damage control or just end it before my future comes. I feel like shit for even letting it stack up since I promised myself I’d do better this semester but I’m failing most of my classes. I have a girlfriend who I love with all my heart and a few close friends but I feel like i’m drifting away from everyone involuntarily, like I don’t feel much major about them. I feel fake to the world, like I don’t matter to it. Every time I try to focus I’ll end up being flashed with every damn problem in the world and have to deal with it all at once since I can’t just set it up in a line. It feels like everything else comes before me in everyone’s lives, like nobody loves me as much as I love them. Even my own family has shit above me when somethings important for me. My mom says it’s just genetic depression and hormones. I recently went on 75mg of zoloft from my usual 50mg. There’s probably more that i’m just blanking on. I just want to be free, no matter how that comes."
497,"It’s odd to me bc as I’m looking through the different flaires I see that at the end there is encouragement and inspiration, and it is something that makes me think, “wow, you’re the type of person who usually would bring in that positivity or light of hope and post something in that category for everybody…” Yet now it’s not that way… it’s not that way at all. Cutting to the chase, I’m(20F) intermittently depressed. I live with my mom.. and it’s been and is, and fucking hell. Almost every day. She’s a narcissist. And actually, this reminds me I posted about our relationship and my personal situation once before on that sub. Oftentimes, she can be  horrible; super hot and cold and is usually, nice and genial when she has to be in order to incentivize or get something out of me. Yk how it is. But also, she and I live alone, while she works for two companies taking up the whole day. Me on the other hand, I go to school—currently am struggling in a way I haven’t, before— and I have no clue what in the hell to do. I also need a job and am aware… but that honestly, is a whole other thing that I’m not even worried about atp. I have an *unknown* chronic illness now, it’s been a year and 7 months. My doctor and I conclude it’s certainly because of my “brain” (yk, psychosomatic) and anxiety or stress. It is the stress and severity. I experience a huge dump of different symptoms—every single day, every hour. I feel different every time. Relationship with mother—>health conflict—>now my mental health and will for living normally and feeling stuck too. It would be my dream if I miraculously had some easier way to rid myself from this house fully, and go live on my own with a good substantial paycheck. But for now, every day feels like a constant dreadful, abhorrent samsara. I have no fucking clue what to do. I’m losing motivation, im tired. I seek to escape mentally, any time, any place, any single given moment, with anything. My grades for all 3 classes are bad. It was not like this in the first month and a bit into the semester. Like even with my health problems for a while now, I’ve been doing fine, up until this year progressed; it’s totally unpredictable. I’m worried for myself. I’m always surviving yet not living as much, constantly feeling on the edge. I really don’t know what to do. Also, my doctor’s office staff never answer any of my desperate calls to make appts. I need one now for all the obvious reasons…and I’ve been convinced finally to go get that disability form printed out… "
498,"Close to 2 years ago I had (no joke) a nibble of an edible, and then threw it away not thinking anything of it. I told the person who offered it to me "" no thank you"" because I hate edibles and don't do drugs but it looked like candy so I took a fake bite and threw it away, I never knew this bite was going to affect me. This changed my life and caused me DPDR, anxiety, and honestly an existential crisis. I had to learn how to be myself again and my faith and Jesus helped me so much with that. I didn't feel ready to do therapy back then because it was way to much. I couldn't even comprehend what was happening to me when it came to seeing the world in 2D, seeing people's faces as robotic, and just trying to find my identity and realize why life is important. It was terrifying. The scariest thing I've ever been through. I then began to heal by helping myself everyday weather it be through podcast, self talk, and God.I am much better now but just have some lingering ptsd, and anxiety of going back to what I went throuah and occasionallv feel like I have moments where I do look at the world with my eyes and not my soul, which I hate because I want to feel real and present all the time. These experiences honestly just come from me over thinking. I'm starting to feel happier everyday, however I want to find a way to accept that i am healing, that life is purposeful, that I am not alone or different just because I went through something odd. I want to basically silence my mind, be present, feel real compassion and love towards others when looking at them and not make myself feel like I'm ""forcing"" myself too. I just want to love everyone and everything and life so deeply. I want to go back to the loving, funny girl I once was before I was introduced to these experiences. If there was a way to make myself forget what happened to me l believe that I would be cured, but that's not the case and I have to work through these things. My ultimate goal is to be confident in my mind and know I'm my own best friend and should trust my thoughts and my words. I want to find my identity again not let the past have control over me. I would love yo know if anyone has any advice.  Thank you for reading."
499,I've don't have any friends because of my social anxiety and all that is wrong with me and that is probably the reason why this guy was pretty much everything to me. A few weeks ago he just disappeared out of nowhere and I can't stop crying and thinking about it. What if he's just ghosting me and I'm not good enough for him anymore? It's either that or he fucking killed himself. I'm the type of person who actually thinks someone should be entitled to kill themselves and I'm glad he might be in peace now or whatever but we promised each other we'd talk to each to one another before attempting. Was I just not good enough for that? Maybe all I did was just say something wrong which I swear I didn't mean to and now he's just fucking ghosting me. I have a big FOMO and I just wish I knew what was going on. I ruin everything. Here's another one of my reasons for living gone I guess

I'm about to finish my 2nd year studying chemistry at oxford and it's gotten to the point where I don't know if i can carry on. I applied to this course for rather bad reasons. I didn't know what i wanted to do in sixth form, i had a lot of different dreams but in the end, i picked this course because I wanted to feel ""smart"". I wanted to succeed and I stupidly saw the appeal of Oxford as something that could make me feel smart and accomplished. I picked chemistry because I found it easy and I knew i would get into a good university for it, and i just blindly applied to top unis for it and somehow got into Oxford. I didn't think id get into a top uni for degrees i actually wanted to do (med, engineering, finance) and so i picked chemistry because I was good at it and knew I would get into a great uni as a result.

The last 2 years of being here have been some of the worst years of my life. I don't enjoy the course whatsoever and I have very very little passion for chemistry. I ended 1st year with a low 2.2 average with a third in one of my papers. Additionally, I don't feel connected to any of the people here either, I dislike the college i picked, and a lot of bad personal circumstances occurred this year that have left me in a deep depression and i feel completely disengaged from my course.

I have a consulting internship with a german company, and genuinely I don't enjoy consulting. I only picked it up as a potential career choice because it felt like it was the only thing open to chemistry graduates other than finance (which i don't want to do either) and so I kind of ""settled"" for it if that makes sense.

Im now about to end 2nd year and Im so miserable. I hate chemistry and i physically cannot sit through lectures, tutorials and anything for it. Because of my personal circumstances I've worked very little the past 2 months and have 3 weeks until my exams and I will 100% fail. I know at the very very least I will need to rusticate (take a year out) because there's no way I'll truly be able to pass them to a good enough standard.

Fundamentally since 1st year I just truly haven't been able to cope here. I hate my degree, I hate most of the people here and don't feel connected to them, I hate the person I've become and I'm so truly dissatisfied with the way my life has turned out and what my future will look like from staying here. I'm a genuine bum and it feels like I've wasted my potential by studying a degree i hate when I could be doing something else somewhere else and be doing much better

But at the same time, i cant help but wonder if dropping out, taking a year out to apply somewhere else is a good idea. I wonder whether I'm acting truly out of emotion and maybe doing this would be a massive mistake. I know that emotions even though they feel permanent and unyielding can be controlled and maybe if I put more effort in to find better friends, and just take a year out and come back maybe id feel better but I genuinely don't know. Im so lost and confused and overwhelmed and sad at how my life has transpired, and I know that I am capable and intelligent if I were studying something I love and found joy in, but I truly truly, from the bottom of my heart, seem to hate chemistry and everything about it and I cant seem to change that no matter what i do

Any advice? Have other people done similar things?"
501,"So i've been on this mental math journey for about 6 months now and i gotta say...it's been a game changer. Not just for school stuff but for life in general... So i thought to share some stuff that worked for me in case anyone else struggles with basic calculations.

First off.. i used to HATE math like... panic attack level hate.. my brain would just shut down whenever someone asked me to calculate something without a calculator.. it's really embarrassing when splitting bills or doing calculations when typical indian father is on call doing some sort of calculations...

So here are the 7 things that actually helped me improve

1.Number relationships

Instead of seeing numbers as just... numbers...i started thinking about how they relate to each othes ...like seeing 27 as 20+7 or 30-3...sounds basic but it helps a lot when doing quick math

2.Shortcuts & tricks that aren't taught in school

There's so many cool math shortcuts that make things easier:

When multiplying by 5...multiply by 10 and divide by 2 (WAY easier)
Adding/subtracting by rounding up/down first then adjusting
For multiplying double digits by 11, add the digits and stick result in the middle (46×11: 4+6=10, so 4(10)6=506... adjust if needed)

3. Real world practice

I force myself to calculate stuff in daily life:
Adding up grocery items before checkout
Calculating gas mileage in my head
Figuring out how long til my phone is charged (if it's at 46% and charges 1% every 2 mins)

4. Gamified apps

Found this app called Matiks that made practice actually fun? It has challenges, leaderboards and stuff so it doesn't feel like studying. There's other ones too but this one clicked for me.

5. Daily mini drills

I do like 5 10 mins of practice everyday. Not gonna lie ...istarted by setting a reminder cuz I'd forget otherwise lol. But now it's habit.

6. Visualization 

This sounds weird but picturing the numbers in my head helps. Breaking big problems into chunks and solving step by step mentally instead of panicking.

7. Changed my mindset

Biggest thing was just believing i could get better.. Sounds cheesy af but it's true..i used to immediately say ""I suck at math"" whenever numbers came up...had to stop that negative self talk

TL;DR: Mental math isn't actually that hard once you practice regularly and learn some shortcuts. It's also super useful in real life. Try the Matiks app if you want to make practice less boring. You can totally get better even if you think you're hopeless with numbers."
502,"Am 16 I think i have face dismorphiya eveytime i look at the mirror i see something different every time sometime i see a average looking guy sometime i see a hideous monster 
But these keep changing but it's always the same theme with different pattern 
One time i found my self looking quite attractive and posted it to tiktok quite a dumb move but i wanted validation 
While some called me fine and hot one guy who was around on his early 20s from us or uk started to say i was so ugly i have no good feature my nose was so big 
During that time i didnt think much of it and just ignored it but after some days those msg kept repeating back and back 
After that i cant remember my face anymore its keeps distorting 
Its at the point that i cant even look at the mirror 
I am at the verge of just ending it tbh 
My reason may seem quite simple but i got so many things to worry abt that this may face me to just do it 
"
503,"For the past two years my friend has invited me to the beach with her mom’s family and I always go and I usually have so much fun. This year she asked me to go again. Her mom never texted the dates to my parents and after a little bit of hinting (trying to get the dates from her) she gave us the dates for the trip and invited me to come. That was two days ago and I’ve been looking forward to it so much. On a side note, the same friend invited me to the beach with her dad’s family too. Just a few minutes ago she texted me saying if it was ok that I only came on the beach trip with her dad claiming that her moms was going to be boring and that it was a really bad excuse. It is. I’ve been crying now because she asked me months in advance if I wanted to come and now that her mom finally asked me, she cancels. It’s frustrating. Don’t cancel on your friends like that, it really sucks. "
504,"Hi, I'm 22 and I've had depression/suidical ideation for a while now (a few years). I've also never been in a romantic relationship (which makes me sad), and have only a few close friends. I'm in a really dark place right now, and I just want to find some hope right now. I do want to be in a romantic relationship one day, and I am working on being happier. I also understand that being in a relationship is not the solution to being depressed. I also know that many people who depression, also have partners, and I do not want to invalidate their struggles (bc ofc depression is very real and very personal). I personally just can't relate, and its a struggle to see younger people than me in relationships, when I've never even come close to it. Any advice, or kind words would be very appreciated"
505,"As background info, I'm pretty sure something like schizophrenia runs in my family. Not exactly sure as no one has gotten formally diagnosed. Many people on my mom's side of the family struggle with psychosis and paranoia, including my mom and myself. As far as I'm aware, it goes all the way back to my grandfather, probably long before him as well. I am generally able to figure out I'm experiencing delusions and can ride through it. I have healthy coping mechanisms and ways to bring myself back to reality but my auntie does not. 

She recently texted me, frantic, called me constantly while I was asleep so I called her back when I woke up. She said the RCMP was trying to kill me by poisoning my food, my medication and drugging me and that I need to get cameras. She has been using my mental illness as evidence for this. I've been persistently depressed as far back as age 7. I've heard things that weren't there for as long as I can remember. I don't think I need to say that my mental illness isn't from the police poisoning my food or using me as a guinea pig to test different drugs. She's continuing to bombard me about this and it's draining on me. I know it's far worse for her but it hurts to see a loved one so deluded. 

I genuinely don't know how I can help her. I know how to help myself, but I don't know how to help someone so far gone. I can't just do the things that would work for me on her, it would only upset her and I don't want to do that to her. I can't just do what I tell my friends to do when I'm hearing or feeling things that aren't real. I don't know what to do for her, I don't think I can help her and I don't know if me talking to her is healthy for either of us. I don't want to cut her off but I don't want to talk to her when she's in this state for my own sanity.

I'm probably going to talk to my family about this. I want to see if we can nudge her towards getting help. We've already lost too many people to mental illness. I've lost cousins, friends, almost myself at many points. I don't want to lose my auntie too. "
506,"I am sick of feeling so lonely all the time. Recent events in my life have left me broken and lost. I have lost sight of everything. I want to end this. I want to end myself. I don’t have it in me anymore to take all the stress and heartache. The last 6 months of my life have been absolute hell, each day worse than the one before. I’m done. I’m out of patience. I have tried everything- therapy, pills, deep diving into work to keep myself distracted from the shitshow that my life has turned into. I wake up wanting to have passed away in my sleep and I go to bed praying I don’t see the morning. I am at my wits end. No money, no work, my friends all hate me, my angel of a boyfriend has given up on me too. I just don’t want to be here anymore. I want to go to my dad. Everything was perfect when he was here. Now I’m a mess. My relationship with my mother is crumbling. There’s nothing to talk about anymore. It feels like the whole world is against me right now. I don’t have the strength left to fight this anymore. I want to be done. Breathing is a task. I’m constantly in panic. I give up. I just give up. To hell with looking at things positively. There is no positive. Look where my life has brought me. I just want peace. And being alive isn’t bringing me any. "
507,"I’m 17 years old and freshly out of a year and a half long relationship. She was everything to me and she left me. I know it’s all my fault because she was the one always trying to fix things between us but I never put in the effort to better myself for her. Now that she’s gone I’ve realized that but I wish I’d have realized it sooner. She has a new boyfriend that I discovered from her tiktok reposts and it’s crushed me. I know we’ll never be back together again and I know she’s moved on from me to someone new. I’ve tried talking to other girls and I ultimately end up ghosting them because nobody gives me the feeling she gave me. I’ve dreamt about her every night, I’ve had suicidal thoughts so badly they push me up to the brink but Ik that I’m too scared to ever actually try to. 
Along with this hockey has been everything in my life since I was 3, and injuries have absolutely killed any career opportunities that would’ve been available for me. I’ve had 3 concussions, each one worse than the last, and another one will give me permanent brain damage. I had to quit hockey all together in order to prevent that.
My family life is meh, it has its ups and downs but never really causes any severe anxiety or depression. 
I just don’t know what to do with my life at this point, everything I’ve ever loved is gone and I can’t ever get any of it back. I don’t want to live my life like this anymore it’s miserable and every single waking moment is just a reminder of how my life should be. Nothing can distract me from it anymore I’ve tried everything. I’m not usually active like this on Reddit but I don’t know what else to do at this point. I’ve tried therapy but the fear of being sent to a psych ward prevents me from ever telling a therapist what’s really going on. Somebody please help me."
508,"I’m 16 years old and I need help. I had suicidal thoughts last year (passive, always fantasizing about being dead/different ways I could end my life. I once set a date (2 years in the future. My mindset was: if I don’t get better, I can always leave). Will she have to tell my parents if I admit this? I do NOT feel this way anymore and I’m not a risk to myself at all. Please help! Also, would i be at risk to be admitted to a mental hospital? "
509,"i mean i’m not old, but i’m not young.. i’m still in school in one of my last years before i leave forever. 

i’ve never known what to do or how my life will work? i’m the youngest of the family so the pressure is obviously on me to do the best (as my other siblings didn’t do as well) it’s so overwhelming and to be honest.. i’m scared?!?

i’ve dealt with SH back in the day, but i’m okay now and i know it was wrong.. i always used to think about how people would react if i died, and how my supposed funeral would be. BUT main thing here.. is it weird that i have a funeral playlist planned out? like.. idk

i thought hard and added songs i know people knew i loved and especially girls just wanna have fun for me and my sister. if anyone had listened to gypsy by fleetwood mac, i love that end melody and i would love people to hear it and think of me."
510,"he always yells too loud or makes too many wrong comments until it absolutely sets me off, the same yelling i’m uncomfortable and try to escape from at the beginning ends up coming from my mouth to say something stupid i’ll  regret

it’s like i don’t even think, the way he’s so fucking selfish, entitled, hypocritical and egotistical sometimes . 
it’s fine if he does it but if i do it rome fucking burns

he’s allowed to say i’m “disgustingly skinny” and that “we’re raising monsters” when he’s feeling heated but if i dare to say something similarly or just bad i’m a brat that doesn’t know how to behave and will lose all her friends and be alone forever, that im so so fucking lucky to live where i live because in another household they would have “ripped my head off already” 

i hate it, i hate it so much the way i see his anger in me sometimes and i throw it onto my friends, my pets or just completely underserving people . 
he doesn’t even apologize, just pure silence and avoiding each other until the stick inside his ass falls out and all of the sudden everything is rainbows and lollipops, but if i’m the one who’s still upset or emotionally hurt from something he’s said i’m victimizing myself and selfish. 
his words get to me so much that while writing 

this i don’t even know if i might actually sound like him, maybe worse, i hate how much it affects me

512,I am constantly feeling guilty. I even feel guilty just writing this now. For example I am currently in college and had made plans to room with my current roommate the next semester. But after doing some thinking and deciding that I think it would be better financially and mentally for me to transfer to a college closer to home.Now I feel immensely guilty that I will be leaving my roommate to find someone else to live with. She was already making plans for next semester on how we will decorate a dorm. I feel like the worst person ever. But I know that making a decision like this is important for me and I shouldn’t hold others opinions so highly to my own especially if I haven’t known them for that long at all. But I can’t help but feel like I need to be punished or told off for being .. selfish perhaps? This isn’t the first time I’ve felt this way I feel guilty when doing nearly anything that is for myself. Honestly what is wrong with me?
513,"TW: Possible mention of suicidal thoughts 


I have never told it to anyone, but sometimes, a sudden sadness appears... It consumes me totally, it makes me have thoughts that I shouldn't, it makes me feel scared, so scared... But at the same time I feel so guilty, I haven't a reason to feel like that, I have a few friends that I see sometimes, I have my mom, my grandmom, and it's just frustrating... Anything, even the most minimum thing can make me get so fucking sad, it makes me feel I'm being too sensitive, and I know I'm being... I don't really think I have pass through difficult situations, I don't remember a single memory about, and I don't know why I'm feeling like that... But it hurts so much, it hurts physically, but I can't say it, I don't want someone to think I'm exaggerating.

514,"I used to be an artist and would have a notebook on me at all times all the way up till high school. It was almost a carbon copy of a school survival guide/puzzle book/journal. I spent years cultivating it...

Flash forward to high school. It's my sophomore year and my parents are fighting a lot, it's been ten years since I threw the book away. The book was tossed away after my dad told me to go get a reach job and that he thought college was a waste of time. I agreed then.

Parents divorced the next year and I spiraled, I gained weight and couldn't lose it, lost all but two friends of mine, and died on the inside. Then the next year I graduated and went right to work likey dad suggested.

It's 2021, my mom saved up to move us to a new home. I told her I was going to college after two years of community. I went in, then transferred. I was studying to be in communications and marketing. I ended up going to a 4 year university for graphic design with a minor in game design and took some business classes too to fill up my schedule.

I graduated last year...2024...I haven't picked up my pen since, my unity program has dust on it. My adobe has rolled over multiple times. I just don't do anything anymore. I guess my ""second wind"" of creativity was just a puff.

What do I do to get back into the things I loved? I can't force it because then I'll hate it. I've thought if I put back interest into something it would jar me awake but, it hasn't...and I'm getting worried.

Please, help me."

516,"I have cptsd. 
Its really difficult to live with it. I do try to find ways to help but it affects my life day by day. I have a hard time remembering things especially my childhood and I can't even be near a kid without worrying about them crying cause kids/babies crying are one of the things that set my episodes off which is bad cause I do want kids but I don't wanna be a horrible mom like mine was. I wasn't able to have a childhood I've spent it majority raising my siblings and making sure my bio mom wasn't falling every cause she was drunk basically everyday and sleeping with God knows who. Some of them men try to hurt my siblings but I always stood my ground and protected them even when it got bad. Being in an abusive and neglectful household. And now as an adult I get scolded at for ""not being and adult"" and ""how are you so forgetful all the time"" as if they think I'm doing it on purpose. And I can never Ever forget being SA as a kid and being told ""you're to young to remember that that didn't happen"".

519,"So I was on in Vega for about four years the first year of Invega I gained 100 pounds which was a big deal for me since I only weighed 113 when I started mind you I’ve never been bigger than that unless I was pregnant the side effects were terrible. I couldn’t sleep, but all I wanted to do was sleep. I lost my love for music and that was once my whole life was music. I couldn’t cry I couldn’t feel any emotion. I couldn’t make decisions on my own. I became very codependent. I pretty much left the care of my children to my spouse as I couldn’t even care for myself. I was completely emotionless. My mother-in-law died. I was very close to her. I couldn’t cry. I found out my grandma had cancer. I couldn’t cry. I found out my sister had cancer. I couldn’t cry. I wasn’t able to make conversation as words were always lost in my head jumbled up. I couldn’t get angry. I couldn’t get excited completely killed my sex drive. I couldn’t even touch my own self I constantly had breakthrough psychosis and delusions. My body always felt heavy my period stopped and everything. I stopped that medicine cold turkey as my doctor refused to watch me medicines. It’s been new year since I
Have my last shot my emotions returned my period returned. My enjoyment for life is hit or miss still I have not been able to lose any of the weight despite eating one meal a day and going to the gym. It has not turned to muscle either. it’s just this big fat tire around my gut And I still do not have a sex drive no matter what I try.

Fighting for my identity when it was taken away from me so many times.

I’m a disabled dependent first of all. 

Legitimately. 

Now I know for sure I need to be taken care of.

522,"CW: child-on-child sexual abuse (COCSA), depression, body dysmorphia, and self hate

I’ve been trying to outrun what happened to me since I was a kid. I survived child-on-child sexual abuse, and for a long time I told myself it wasn’t that serious, or that maybe I made it up, or that it was my fault. I locked it away for years but trauma doesn’t stay buried.

Now I live with depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, self-hate, and what I think might be CPTSD. I feel like I’m watching my life from a distance. I don’t trust people. I don’t even trust my own body most of the time. 

I’m exhausted. I’m tired of pretending I’m okay. Tired of carrying pain that feels too complicated for most people to hear.

523,I have been depressed for the last 5-6 years of my life and been medicated since 2021. I've been on tons of medications and nothing worked til I tried a treatment called tms.

525,"My grandpa has bipolar disorder, my dad had bipolar disorder. I’ve always wondered if I would develop a form of bipolar disorder when I was younger. I’m an early adult and the past 6 months I’ve been experiencing increasingly intense anxiety, followed by dumps of happiness and good times. Followed by waves of anxiety. This is exactly what was described to me what bipolar is like. I had an extremely traumatic experience with my family (alcoholism) at a young age, and an even more traumatic and abusive relationship from 14-16. My health doesn’t cover any mental health, or psychiatric visits, and whenever i ask my family I get told to go to church. I feel myself spiraling and at a complete loss, and I can’t pay the fees required to seek proper help. What do I do?"
526,"For years fitness, film and politics are what I focus on outside of work and family.  Two hours workout everyday and for months I used to listen to political podcasts.  And I would deep dive on who was commenting what.  Feel like gains might have suffered but it is what it is.

In retreating out of that and getting more into rap again for the workout and focusing podcast on MCU or other related film projects.  I feel my mental health improving even if it is focusing on fantasy elements and things that will NEVER happen.  I like building my body in the hopes to get the Steve Rogers look or do some fanfic about Thunderbolts.

I spend a lot of time of time with my family but I work graveyard so there is either a lot of free time for this or zero free time.
My take and I’m sure it’s been repeated over and over is do what makes you happy and don’t be too focused on the specifics but be aware of the broad strokes on the political spectrum.

When I don’t have something in front of me like family, film, fitnesss or discourse I get really dark (not in some cool Batman way)

530,"I’ve been dealing with extreme anxiety issues…I guess they are because I’ve been to the doctor multiple times and done blood work, cardio sonograms/echos/ekg and everything came back normal …doctor said I’m healthy.

Well 2 years ago I had smoked weed and it caused my heart to beat really fast and caused tachycardia. But that was so long ago has it stayed with me….

But he realized my heart beats fast I’m assuming from anxiety issues and prescribed me beta blockers to calm my mind down I guess . Even when I’m in anxious provoking situations my heart start to beat out of my body loll…seems like this is all a mental thing 

Even when I exercise…I’m scared to even run on trend-mill or even go on stair master my heart starts to literally beat out my chest like I’m bout to have heart attack

But idk every time I over exert myself …for example multiple chores at home all at once laundry, cooking, cleaning kitchen which includes lots of bending down and over exerting my body in a why I start to get dizzy, heart beats fast like I’m worried gonna have a heart attack , body hurts… to point I have to sit down and take breaks .

I’m also on birth control hormonal IUD and take a vitamin D + k2 supplement .

Has anyone else experience this????

Is this all anxiety like my doctor had said as I’m healthy …should I take antidepressants? "
531,"I know I would never actually go through with it, but the thought crosses my mind at least once a day. I struggle to express how I truly feel without worrying that others will think I’m unstable. From a difficult childhood to the challenges of my early twenties, life has weighed heavily on me, especially in recent years. I’m currently on antidepressants, but they no longer seem to be helping. I want to seek help, but I genuinely don’t know how to begin that process. At times, I feel selfish for even thinking this way, especially when I have a child depending on me—so I keep pushing my feelings aside.

I try to stay busy: working full time, going to the gym afterward, and keeping interactions minimal because, realistically, everyone has their own struggles. The one thing keeping me grounded is my son. He’s not your typical child—he was recently diagnosed with ADHD and hasn’t started medication yet. Managing his needs is challenging and adds significantly to my stress. I won’t go into every detail, but I’m a single mother navigating life in a tough economy. Even with a decent job, I’m still living paycheck to paycheck.

I know this feeling won’t last forever, but I needed to let it out. I hope someone out there can relate."
532,"I hate how my friends don’t care about anything I talk about that I like. My main friends never respond when I talk about something in the group chat. This one friend I have they always talk and talk about what they’re watching and they always say ik no one’s gonna respond to this later. I usually try to do the reaction messages so at-least they knew I saw it. They’ve said before that I started not caring first when I said let’s go back to listening to each other. I have no common interests with any of my friends really. My other friends just say yeah and don’t even try to engage at all, it just feels like I’m talking to a brick wall."

534,"Hello!

I’m in my mid-20s in San Diego, curious about ADHD, OCD, or compulsive sexual behavior but never diagnosed. My PCP informally diagnosed ADHD and prescribed me medication after I shared symptoms and life struggles, but it felt like a quick fix, and I’m skeptical. I’ve never seen a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist and feel lost on where to start.

I have Molina Marketplace insurance (CA) and want a proper diagnosis, but Molina’s referred behavioral health specialists require switching my PCP to a family health center, which I don’t want (I prefer keeping my Scripps PCP). Who should I see for a formal diagnosis—psychologist, psychiatrist, or someone else? Any recommendations for San Diego providers in-network with Molina or private pay ($150–$300/session)?

Also, what’s the deal with out-of-pocket clinics charging $3,000+ for “psychological assessments”? Is this standard for a diagnosis, or do in-network psychologists offer the same for less? In other words, lets say I find a clinic that charges 150 bucks per session, and like maybe 300 bucks for the first time we meet. Does the first visit not allow me to get a diagnosis? Is every doctor/psychologist going to require me to spend 3000 to get a diagnosis? Are these expensive assessments any different than a ""regular"" diagnosis from someone covered by your insurance? How does their service differ from in-network care? Tips for navigating this or managing symptoms while I figure it out?

535,"I (26F) feel like a massive failure. In short, my relationship with my dad is turbulent, and is mostly where my insecurities stem from, so that’s just an overarching issue in my life. However, currently, the biggest obstacle in life has been my career.

For context, I had a job that I really loved but sadly wasn’t very good at and I made a pretty massive mistake that led to my termination. A year later, I’m at a retail job that I can’t stand. There are glimmering moments of competency on my part, particularly when making connections with customers and selling product. For the first time in any retail job I’ve worked, the clientele is actually pretty easy to work with. My team, however, seems to dislike me. When I’ve raised concerns politely in private with management, they’ve been often dismissive. I take into account that perhaps I’m projecting insecurities onto them, but then I can’t help but notice how their tone shifts with me specifically, how I’m always being reprimanded, etc. Another coworker even affirmed this. That being said, I just feel like something’s wrong with me. Why don’t people like me? When others make mistakes, it’s a “haha funny” moment but when I make the same mistakes, it tends to be the end of the world. 

Today I had a meltdown at work and I needed to take time to recover and walk away from the situation (essentially I was triggered bc I’d made another mistake, as stupid of a reaction that is). I lost track of time and took too long to step away because every time it got better, it’d get bad again and I’d spiral again. My manager eventually called me and told me to get it together and that me being gone was bad for business (which is absolutely fair) and that I wouldn’t be paid for the time I was gone (also fair) and that being so emotional was also bad for business. I fully understand his point. No sane person would react like that. I’ve been trying so hard to work on my mental health: I finished TMS, I take medication, I’ve been in therapy for 10 years… why can’t I just be normal and not be such an emotional wreck? 

I feel too old to be acting like this. I feel like I have the emotional intelligence of a toddler. "
536,"I don't have any friends and I don't think my family loves me all that much. I'm at my dad's house and I have 2 siblings. Both siblings have a picture on the wall, and I don't have one. Makes me feel kind of worthless."

I’m working my life aways I can’t afford to pay anymore my appartement I might have to go back to my mother house (which is 4h aways) in my shitbox car, like am I just a loser or life feels really just harder and harder each years I wish I could afford a house and start a family but it’s seems really unrealistic nowadays (?) all opinions are welcome.

538,"They're going to start executing LGBT people any day now. I know I'm going to die. I'm not asking you to convince me I'm not going to die. I'm asking how I can enjoy life despite the fact that it's about to end. I just want people to give me an answer instead of dancing around it. If you don't know then don't answer. How do I accept my death? How do I stop worrying about it? How do I stop seething at the injustice? How can I be one of those people that are genuinely at peace?

539,"without violence i feel lost because it was a norm in my life. a constant till up to about a year or so ago. i think if you're not violent towards me, you must not love me. it's something deeply rooted in me. makes me feel bad cause i wish my boyfriend would treat me a little like he did at the start. it was a rough one and i am happy a lot of of that passed but i still feel like this. i'm aware it's a bit fucked up. don't get me wrong, i love when he's kind to me but i love it more when he gets heated. i know he loves me and i love him, but because he's basically stopped and he's keen to my provoking of him, he won't do it unless i get extremely vexing with it. nothin crazy though. in the end, i am the problem. this is something that has always been there. every mf i ever fell for was a dick to me, hit me, called me all kinds of names and i was obsessed with him till the next one came along. it's a hate=love thing. i don't always like it but i will take it because it means to me that we're obviously in love. idk i guess i have to get used to it. it just feels strange that i'm still not used to being treated well. it makes me paranoid and distrust mfs. i have my reasons. violence made me feel like i was worth something more in a morbid way. it was the only attention i got then outside of sexual attention, which i found worse tbh. thinking about some bs tonight 🤦‍♂️ feel bad i'm even venting here but that's another tangent i rather not get into..."
540,"I’m a 22-year-old guy, and I feel like life has already passed me by. I come from a very strict, low-income family. Growing up, I had no freedom — no trips, no parties, no privacy, no real friends who were truly supportive. Even when I tried to glow up (gym, skincare, dressing better), my family, especially my father, taunted me so much that I gave up. I’m skinny, dark-skinned, and have always been made to feel ugly and worthless.

In school and college, I never dated. Later, I had a few casual “fwb” type situations, but nothing real, nothing romantic. I’ve been ghosted, rejected, and disrespected so many times. I always craved a real relationship — someone to love and be loved by. But that never happened for me. Instead, I watched others easily find happiness.

To make things worse, something traumatic broke me even more: Two months ago, while on a bus, I accidentally bumped into a woman (the road jerked). She accused me of touching her inappropriately. I was publicly humiliated, beaten by her and the police, and forced to sign a good behavior bond. Since that day, I cry almost every day — in the metro, at work, at home. I live in constant fear of women and false allegations. I can’t even make eye contact now without panicking. That incident still plays in my head like it happened yesterday. It shattered my spirit.

Meanwhile, I see everyone around me living the life I dream of, My friends travel to Goa, party, go clubbing, enjoy casual relationships and hookups.They live the “Mumbai youth” life freedom, fun, adventures.Some of my close friends have 50+ body counts while I’m still craving even a simple connection.They earn better than me, while I’m stuck in a field sales job barely making ₹30k a month.i get no attention, no validation from girls.I have no sense of achievement I’m still struggling to even buy a bike for myself.People treat me like a fool,I feel invisible and unwanted.

At home, the situation is even worse:My father is extremely strict he expects me to be home by 10 pm like a schoolboy, while I just want to live a little, have some fun like a normal 22-year-old.He doesn’t support my dreams, my struggles, or even basic things like getting a bike.few days ago after work, I broke down completely. I cried for over an hour slamming my head against the wall, pulling my hair, screaming, feeling like I was dying inside. •	My mom panicked seeing me like that and started crying too. My dad rushed home from outside. But instead of understanding, he started blaming my mom saying she had “spoiled” me by giving me “too much freedom”. He accused me of being into “NASHA” (addiction) and alcoholism — when in reality, all I do is smoke cigarettes just to survive the daily pain. I don’t even drink alcohol.They assumed I was crying because of a “girl problem.” But the truth is, I was crying because of my lack of freedom, my lack of life, my constant feeling of being trapped.

I cry in daily because of this trama, i do small cry sessions when alone or out, in metros, toilets and stairs, today i broke again just few mins ago i just can’t bare this anymore 

I don’t know what to do. I feel cursed. All I ever wanted was to experience love, fun, freedom, happiness even a little. But it feels like no matter how much I try, life just laughs at me.

Everyone has a better life then me even girls have more freedom than me, only thing stopping me from ⚰️ is my mom, she is soft hearted she would die too, otherwise im so so done
"
541,"I don't know why, I just feel like I can be having a great day and then one thing will set me off and suddenly I will feel like I'm in such a dark place. I don't have much going for me right now, no job or anything as I'm still young, barely any true friends, and I don't leave the house much because of this and this causes me to feel very hopeless and upset a lot. 

Sometimes I will have a good day and I'll be able to forget about everything that makes me upset. But then something small might happen. Maybe I'll go on social media, see someone out with friends. Or even something as small as seeing that someone else has a job. Or someone not replying to my message. I'll go from feeling good, to being at rock bottom. If it's someone not replying to a message, for example, even if it's only been ten minutes, I'll feel angry and want to block them. I'll feel alone, and like no one really cares about me. It can happen so fast, and even the smallest things can set me off. 

This means I've been finding it difficult to be happy for other people, and I'm just filled up to the brim with resentment. Someone applied for a job and got it? I can't be happy for them, instead I want to cry and never leave my bed. I want to be happy for other people, but when my life is lacking so much, I can't help but feeling so angry and like life is so unfair. And it feels rational that I feel like this but I just hate how quickly I can reach a low place."
542,"Doing anything makes me feel exhausted. I recently found out that I have an ear infection and I'm taking meds with it. I think it might be reacting to my meds, but I felt like this beforehand. I have so many things I need to do, and when I think about them, I feel exhausted. Laundry, litterbox, dishes, room cleaning, etc. Today my head hurts and I have been drinking more water and taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen for it. It helps a little, but as the pain weakens, I find myself feeling sad. Drinking water makes me feel a little bit nauseous. I feel like I need to eat, but when I look at food, my stomach suddenly feels full and I don't want to eat. In fact, I almost feel disgusted by the sight of food. I've taken a cookie and a few gummy bears that my mom bought, so I have something in my system. I've heard that sugar and caffeine helps with headaches. I feel like playing a game, but suddenly I feel overwhelmed when I think about the game I like to play, and I don't know why. When I try typing on my phone, my phone starts tapping the screen by itself and typing random letters, zooming in, and deleting my text. I also feel very dry and hot despite drinking water and the weather saying it's a cool day. I'm laying in bed, and I've been doing that for a week now. I know it's not good for me, but even standing up exhausts me. I feel like crying, maybe the tears will relieve the pressure in my skull. I don't know whether my headache is from dehydration, meds, an oncoming sickness, my ear infection, or an abscessed tooth. Even the idea of brushing my teeth overwhelms me. I'd scream, but even that sounds overwhelming. I also want to have a job, but I feel like that would be overwhelming with this mood. 

What is wrong with me? I want my motivation back. "
543,"I moved to my current town just before COVID as a student starting in high school. I've hung out with people, mostly from my church, and I would consider myself part of their friend group. 

On our weekly hangouts (usually we just chat at a restaurant for a few hours) they always talk about how fun their own hangouts  with each other were, none of which I was invited to. I wasn't even invited to the weekly hangouts until a month after it started. Two of my friends okay a board game, I sometimes ask them if they could teach me how to play and they always brush me off.

They also try to keep me out of conversations. I just feel really hurt. Should I stop hanging out with them all together? Or should I try and be more involved?

545,"TW substance abuse and suicidal behavior 



I'm 16 now and when I was 13 years old I attempted to unalive myself and was brought to the hospital. I was diagnosed bipolar 2 (but it was an orientative diagnosis) . I was on quetiapine and setraline for about 2 months. Then I changed psychiatrist and the new one told me I wasn't bipolar and gave me only setraline. It didn't really do anything cause it was only 50mg. I was drinking smoking cutting myself etc.. at At 15 I attempted a second time and spent a month in the hospital.They prescribed me 100mg of setraline 75mg of pregabaline and 15mg of mirtazapine. When I got out of the hospital I was feeling really really bad and I started doing ketamine,extasis and stuff like that but it didn't cause me an addiction. Since then I've been taking my meds on and off and I stopped about 4 months ago . Since e I got out of the hospital there's been moments of like craziness. Once I got a little bit drunk and I started going with my electric scooter at 4 am singing and then I kneeled down a church saying I was the son of god and things like that , another day I walked on the sideway , also about a week ago I just got out of my house and walked to the town next door at 4am ,I got high and really paranoid I took a train and woke up in a random town about an hour and a half far from my home. And my mood changes randomly I mean that one day I wanna die and the other I just feel good . I'm scared of myself .Also last summer I started hearing voices but I haven't heard any since then."

549,"Anytime my best friend and I aren’t getting along, it’s when they lower/tries to stop taking Olanzapine. We’ve been friends for more than 30 years and we’ve supported each other through ALL KINDS of life events. 

Every time they try to lower or stop taking Olanzapine, they’re more needy, more attention seeking, more unsure of themselves, and become manipulative. In the past I’ve set up phone trees (with their partner’s blessing) so close knit friends (4 people) are aware when there’s instability, then the partner can focus only on them.

Here we are again with another situation. I’m “mean” and “don’t like them” anymore. I believe this is the medicine AND I’ve been setting boundaries for my needs. I’m recovering from a medical condition and surgeries in the past 1-2 years, I don’t have energy that’s extra, and I work 50+hours a week. My friend doesn’t work but expects me to talk anytime they need - will say it’s important, and in reality it’s trivial. “Saw a lady wearing brown lipstick, and I just had to call” 

I am tired. I am trying to recover.
I have told them and asked them to not call during work, I’m available via text.
Their partner works, has their own issues and doesn’t have time for these things either. I know when the partner is busy, I get contacted more.

Other than forcing space, how do I handle this? Do I handle this? 
Is it selfish if I call “not it” and not engage the safety net this time?
I have to recover.

"
550,"This is kinda a vent about all the things I’ve been through this week and how I’m feeling at the moment. 

We’re going to start off with the less worrisome things 

Basically I’m an online student and I’m for sure failing my algebra EOC and if I do pass it’ll be a super low score… 
I actually have a “tutor” but tbh he makes me feel guilty for getting the questions wrong and makes me feel rushed… so basically all year I’ve been well cheating… which is horrible and I regret it… I’m genuinely so angry at myself for being this lazy and not putting in any work.. which I also cheated in all my other classes too… which I also have EOC’s for however the content of those classes is easy and I’ve already caught up via studying. The reason I cheated in the first place was just at the time I was going through a really bad depression and burn out. So I didn’t really start cheating till my second semester. But it’s still anointing since I don’t really have anyone I trust to go to about mental health… especially since around last year I had some… not so great habits… like SH… I ended up writing all this stuff in a notebook as a way of coping and my aunt (my legal guardian) found it… luckily I managed to talk her out of making me go to the ward… and I ended up not having to do therapy or anything but it still haunts me… I don’t like the way she reacted and I don’t really trust her anymore… I don’t like that she was going through my stuff like that and genuinely just don’t like how she reacts to mental health issues. Hence why I haven’t told her all this stuff. 

Now to the more important stuff.. 

My grandma is going through her second round of cancer 5 years after she first had it… in 2020… my grandma is probably the person I spend the most time with. She doesn’t work so I spend my days at her house so I’m
Not home alone all the time. I see her everyday and even before when I actually went to school I lived with her. It’s scary seeing her go through this again especially considering the first time it happened I was much younger and oblivious to what’s going on. On top of all the other things that have happened in my life this depression, burnout… as I like to say my “drought” is really annoying and is impacting my life I shut wish it would go away I’m genuinely so tired of this. 

Tw: animal abuse 

A few months ago I found out my at the time e best friend’s parents were animal abusers. Actually animal murderers. They owned a dog “training” business.. and slaughtered them. I felt sick being around her and her family so I ended up loosing a friend I had for a very long time which negatively impacted my mental health another contributing factor to my mental state at the moment 

Overall this is probably nothing compared to what you guys have been through but it’s a lot for me and I’m not the best with coping… I’m so stressed out and it’s causing a lot of physical health issues as well.. I’m genuinely so over it and I don’t know what to do "
551,"Hello, i have been struggling with some thoughts. I wont say it quite in detail, however lets say simply i have been having excruciatingly detailed g0ry thoughts, or sometimes even thoughts of SH. Not in like a certain way of guilt or sadness, but the SH feeling is like search for relaxation in like body-easing dizzy way. Or smoking does the trick. Anyways, sometimes i can even feel, get the smell of what i am doing. What should i do? I am not asking for any medical advice, or not a diagnosis from anyone. However, some tips on how to cope, how to switch to different ways could be best, And if someone had experienced the same/similar things, i would like to get to know you, and learn the ways you cope with it."
552,What do they do? Just talk to you ?  My gf always gives me hopeful words and try to convince me that everything will be better. It doesn't work with me. I'm still feeling pain and sad in my heart due to many reasons. Seeking a therapist would help ??
553,Life is getting to fucking aggravating anymore and I fucking hate it and I wanna die everyday is annoying and I hate waking up anymore especially with school 
554,I have been o zoloft since 2018. I was on it even when I was pregnant with my daughter in 2020. I stopped taking it when I was pregnant with my son in 2024 & I gave birth to him in April of this year. I stopped taking it because I didn't like the way it made me feel when I was pregnant. I have to get back on it now that the baby is born. My question is will zi still have negative side effects when I first take it even though I have been on it since 2018? 
555,"I'm not sure what to call this, maybe a symptom rant, or just reaching out to see if other people feel how I feel. I'm diagnosed with severe depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Currently taking 20mg of Lexapro and 100mg of lamictal. But I honestly just don't want to be on meds. I don't know if there helping me because I personally feel like I am the problem, that medication can't be a solution because I'm to self aware of how I feel and what needs to be changed. But I keep choosing to not change. I just lack motivation and refuse to be better. Medication can't change my thinking. At the end of the day I am me and I've excepted that. It's getting to the point where I hate my life. I come home and do the same thing everyday. Live the same boring life. I don't clean as much as I should. And I know I need to but it's a lot. And whenever I try to clean my brain is just everywhere, I'm doing so many things at once that an hr into cleaning it doesn't even look like I cleaned, because it's so random. So then I really don't wanna do anything. And this happens at work to I can't just do what I'm doing I'm everywhere. I feel like I crackhead.
At home sometimes I have a burst of energy wanting to do random stuff like scrub a wall or deep clean a certain room but all I feel is frustrated and angry the entire time, and then right after I'm right back to the same way. Sometimes at night when I'm driving home from work, I wonder what it would feel like to run into the bridge I turn on once and awhile. That's obviously something I would never tell my med doctor. Because logically I know I would never do it and I think about all the consequences but man, maybe it would feel good to feel something. Like I said I know that I will never do it though, it's just like an internal mental battle. Another thought that tortures me is going back to drugs. Now this is another thing that I know I will never do, because my logical side kicks in and I think of all the consequences and know that I would never. It's just like a longing, a want to feel something again. These are just little thoughts that pop into my head from time to time. I just feel plain. I feel like I am the problem. I have trouble talking to people at work because I know that I cant talk to people well. I don't have much friends but the friends I have I don't have time to hang out with because I have a family. I'm only 20 years old but life feels pretty old. I have a son, and a bf, and ee both have full time jobs, so I know that I will just continue to live in this same cycle everyday miserably and suffer forever. I'm not even sure if any of this makes sense, I might not even feel this way in 40 mins. But then I will again after, idk."
556,Over the last few months i’ve noticed myself getting way to angry over small things. It can vary from my cats begging for food when i’m trying to sleep or just something very minor and insignificant at work. I try not to let it affect anyone but it’s very obvious when i get the way i do. I always get an insane tension headache and my tinnitus seems to amp up a little bit. I’ve considered therapy recently as this is really starting to affect me. i don’t like my cats seeing me angry bc i know it upsets them as well
557,"I can feel empathy with characters or my pets, but I can't feel empathy towards humans, no matter how good they are to me.
I can understand why they're sad or angry, but I can't feel bad for them, I've tried, but I can't really feel that, I can just understand it and take advantage of it if necessary, even when I was a child. 
Why do I feel like that?"
558,"TW: Mention of self harm

So i’m going to a mental evaluation in a few days and have a few questions.

1. What shouldn’t I tell them?
- (Like stuff that’ll get me sent to a mental hospital or something.)

2. What should I absolutely tell them even if it sucks?

3. What do they have to tell an adult?
- (I am a minor so i’m sure they have to tell my parent at least something.)

4. What do I have to prepare myself for?
- (Physically or mentally.)

5. Do they do a physical check for scars?
- (I have a past of self harm. I actively do it.)

6. Will they tell my mom i’m not clean?
- (Recent relapse.)

Extra: Any tips or any advice?

I’ve never told a professional anything other than telling my doctor i self harm about a couple years ago. They didn’t tell my mom that."
559,"I’m not sure exactly what is wrong with me, but I only noticed it because it has gotten so bad I have stopped a lot of activities. It has affected my mental health and even physical one. It started with small rules, but now it completely dominates my day to day schedule.

It started when I was young, my mom dealt with a lot of depression so my bedroom became messy (we shared) and when I was in elementary school I started cleaning my bedroom every Friday up till it was spotless. The feeling of cleanliness made me stupidly happy, so I feel like cleanliness started being associated with how my mental is since then. 

After that it became a rule that only when things are clean, I am allowed to enjoy things. That was the first rule I created for myself. If my apartment wasn’t clean, then I couldn’t enjoy myself. From then on things for intense, specially the more stressed I got. Right now life has gotten really troublesome and the rules got intense, that’s when I noticed my own behavior and how weird it was.

Here are some rules I created for myself-

- If my apartment isn’t clean, I can’t work, play games, or shower. This is because when you get dirty when cleaning. Double showering is not a choice because then my hair and skin will be unhappy. This though would end up in me doing absolutely nothing when I’m depressed and low in energy, because my brain does not allow me to do anything unless where I am is spotless.

- I cannot eat after specific times, which has ended up in me eating once or twice per day. 

- I cannot eat unless my chores/calls to friends or family are settled and I have nothing else to do. Which paired with the previous rule, has resulted in me barely getting any food in my system.

- I cannot go to sleep before 11PM as that would end up with me missing out on free time, which ended up in my sleep schedule to be completely messed up.

- I cannot wear new clothes or wear cute clothes unless my apartment is clean, or unless I’m showered. Which has resulted in me only wearing the same clothing for 2 years. 

- If I’m on a routine call with friends, I cannot hang up first because that may upset my friends (even though they really don’t care) which has resulted in me eating very late, and thus going back to the first rules.

- If I don’t have at least 2 hours to enjoy myself, then I won’t do my second job (which is more of a contractor job) and has resulted in me being very behind in work and severely stunned it. 

- I can’t finish video games unless I’m content with life, and that obviously has been really bad so I have a lot of unfinished games. 


These are some of the ones that may seem small, but control my day to day life. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I don’t know what to do. I try to break my own rules but my brain always goes back to it. It wasn’t as bad until recently where I’m so controlled by my own rules that I end up doing nothing productive in my day. 

Anyone has any tips on this that has gone thru something similar? I’m feeling miserable.

560,I've recently left a pretty abusive relationship. It was toxic on both sides and I'm not gonna pretend that I don't have flaws.

562,"I've seen a few different psychologists and therapists regarding this. I'm currently medicated for my ADHD and bipolar. However, that doesn't stop me from losing interest and burning out in work.

This isn't a new problem, or something that only happened at this job either. Even if I enjoy a job at the start, after a while it only feels like an obligation, and I lose interest in it. I've been pushing on this job for 5 years now, but I hit the burn out mark at 2.5 years. It's bad enough now that I feel like I'm spiraling at work when I can't force myself to do minor tasks. Add chronic pain issues into the mix, and when that flairs up it's a struggle to even be there.

Whenever I open up about this issue, I'm told to do a career change or do intense therapy sessions to find what it is I really want to do in life. A career change won't matter--the process will only repeat itself. And I already know what I want to do in life, and it has nothing to do with work. I just want to spend time on my hobbies. They are what motivates me. I once tried to monetize my hobbies, but unfortunately that also burned me out after a few years due to it being an obligation. It took me around 3 years to be able to enjoy doing them again.

I'm at a loss on how to move forward from here on out. I can't afford to quit my job, or even work only part-time as it won't pay my bills. I can change jobs and be ok for a bit, but eventually I will lose interest. I also have mild anxiety so I can't handle the stress of constantly changing jobs or giving up my financial stability. Having to spend 40 hours a week on something that just doesn't interest me, then even more time for errands or chores, take some time out for occasional social obligations, and it feels like the time I have to immerse myself in the thing that drives me through life is just very little. I'm not going to get any younger, either. I don't know what to do when I need money but the time spent to gain that money is not enriching my life and is instead taking away from the valuable time I have left in my life.

The professionals I see tend to be very deeply-rooted in normal societal expectations regarding work. Even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it. That in itself would be fine--if it weren't making my mental state crumble to pieces the longer I continue a job."
563,"i apologise that this might be all over the place as i’m just recalling things i don’t want to and dumping it out. i’ve kept it suppressed for the past decade, but i just really want to know if this is what’s causing me to not function as well now as an adult. 

as a child, my dad pushed me into playing tennis and had high hopes for me to succeed. we were from a middle-low income family as my dad lost his business and i felt like he was really banking on me going professional and sometimes living vicariously through me. i honestly wasn’t particularly as passionate as he was, and that’s resulted in quite a stressful experience throughout my junior comp years. for instance, when i made a mistake in a match he would shake his head in disappointment when i looked to him for comfort. there were also times where he could get extremely mad and chew me out when we were alone after i lost a game, then someone would walk by and i would feel even more embarrassed. i couldn’t recall if he ever hit me about it but he did throw a shoe at me once because i didn’t perform well. there were great times too and i’ve held titles in my state and learned so much from the sport. i’ve always thought that i would never match up to my peers because i always had to worry about appeasing him first. i just feel like i can’t ever look at that sport again without feeling anxious or having my heart beat out my chest even when it’s casual, which is ironic because i have a coaching certification for it. this also feeds into the cycle where: 

i feel anxious -> i can’t perform well -> i fumble and fail -> i get more anxious…

rinse and repeat. 

i currently have a great relationship with my dad, i’ve always managed to just put up with it and honestly out of tennis he’s just been the most loving parent. i used to feel jealous of friends that had great relationships with their parent coaches. even till now, i feel jealous when i see my friends that can play like it’s no pressure at all. obviously i did not make it big so i still feel like a failure about it.  my self-esteem is just terrible even though logically i know i’ve done well for myself. i feel like the cracks from this is starting to show now. i honestly don’t know what i’m trying to derive from all of this, i just want to let it out and come to terms with it and finally be normal i suppose. "
564,"Hi! i just really dont know what to do anymore so I’ll thought to get an opinion on here.
ive been struggling with my mental health for few months since my long term partner got diagnosed with a autoimmune disease that demages the kidneys over time (got diagnosed late so he’s already in stage 4). i have been his only support through all this since we live together and his parents don’t believe in medicine. this brought up bad feelings from my father’s death from 3 years ago that i haven’t really processed. i had to quit university because of the anxiety ive been feeling and now im just depressed, i cant sleep or eat, i have been throwing up and had suicidal thoughts. no therapist was any help (they always say i don’t look that bad and that all the feelings im feeling are normal) and i really don’t know how to proceed… i don’t have anyone to vent to or anywhere to hide away. i feel like i have been more of a burden to my partner than help and still i cant pull my stuff together. i just dont know what should i do or where should i turn"
565,"I suppose I should start off this post with some much needed context. I feel like I bring no value to my friends. I love them, I really do, but I feel so neglected. I don’t know what to do to have people feel interested in me, or how to feel interested in them. 

Maybe I’m the one who’s neglecting my friends, but when I hang out with them I try my best to talk to them about how their day went and what they plan on doing, how they feel, anything I can think of to involve them and make them feel like they have the spotlight. I do my best to listen or to be funny, I make sure I smile at them and know that I care about them, I laugh at the jokes they make so that they feel validated, I try my absolute best to ask engaging questions in group chats, but they don’t really ever respond. The only time people give me attention or pretend to care or listen is when I rant about people during hangouts or if I do crazy things. I feel lonely.

Maybe I’m just boring to talk to, maybe they’re tired of my low self esteem- I guess to help shape an accurate view on me (or help me realize why my friends don’t care about me), I’ll list out my flaws:

- I make everything about me. I genuinely try not to do this and I can’t list a time where I’ve done it besides use the vent chat a lot, but I think I could be self absorbed.

- I’m aggressive. Whenever someone taunts me I go all out on insults or I get very abrasive with my responses. I’ve been trying to improve upon this ever since, but it’s hard to do that when some of my friends provoke me on purpose as a joke. I learned that they think it’s humorous and I really want to be funny so this one has me conflicted.

- I’m negative. Whenever I try to make conversation with people and they don’t seem to care, I occasionally change it to a rant about something or someone so that they feel more interested. This in itself is toxic, and I think I need help changing this part of me. 

- I lack anything interesting about me. I’m not smart, I don’t code, I don’t like to play instruments, I barely play video games that once brought me joy, sometimes I repeat things, whenever I talk it’s always about something useless like small talk, etc. All I do is bed rot or go for walks hours on end purely out of boredom.

- Short attention span. Whenever I attempt to get into a fandom or a game or show, I’m interested in it for a short period of time. During this period, I’m happy and obsessive about it- But then the day ends and I’m bored with it and I stop doing it altogether. Unfortunately this is sometimes the case with people (and it’s probably why my friends don’t pay attention to me). If there’s something playing in the background and someone’s trying to talk to me, it gets really hard to pay attention.

- Certified yapper. Any thought that is interesting and what I feel is important to say, I start talking about it. Sometimes it’s really hard to stop. One specific friend always shuts me down and calls me out in front of people when I do this and it’s lowkey embarrassing but I suppose they have a good reason for doing it. Another thing I feel awful about- and I try to apologize whenever I do this- is sometimes I interrupt people when they’re talking. To help change this I end up using all my focus to not talk, but I REALLY like to talk to friends.

I want to be liked by my groups again but I think my flaws ruined that chance for me. I have never felt more alone. I’ll take any advice I can get at this point. Thanks for reading. "
566,"I’m pretty sure my husband has anxiety. Everything stresses him out way more than seems rational. For example, our air conditioning went out, which is not great. But we were able to get a bunch of rebates through the county so it was affordable to get it replaced. But it stressed him out so much - it was like he saw the air conditioning going out as a personal failure. He apologised every day (and frankly it didn’t bother me that much but it stressed him out SO much).

We are going overseas soon to take my 1 year old to visit my parents. All he can talk about is how terrible it’s going to be. Tonight, he told me he’s bringing aspirin on the flight because he’s pretty sure he’s going to have a heart attack on the plane because my son will be screaming the whole time. He’s even planning which pocket the aspirin will be in so I can give it to him. 

These are just two recent examples but there are many more - it’s a daily thing. I have tried to explain to him that how he is feeling is really extreme and that he should talk to his doctor. And he will either deflect or tell me he will but just to get me to drop it. He thinks stressing all the time is normal - just part of being a man. I have tried every way I can think of to get him to talk to someone, but I am at my wits end watching anxiety eat him up every day while he does nothing to help himself. It affects everything in our lives and it’s becoming overwhelming for me as well.

Please help me - how do I get him to seek help?"
567,"Every single day, I feel empty. I feel no desire to do things that need to get done or even things I know I like to do. I constantly feel discontent and want to change the way I feel AKA want to use. I have a hard time sitting in uncomfortable feelings. I haven't had much practice. I would always just get high and I'd feel good. 

Now that I'm trying to live life in recovery, I don't have the substances to make all the bad feelings go away and I don't know how to deal with them. I want to live in recovery but fuck, I miss how easy it was to just take a little this, do a little that and boom, I'm good. 

I feel like my brain is constantly searching for dopamine highs but at the same time, I have no motivation or ambition to do anything. I'm just fucking sad and empty all the time. If anyone has any tips on battling cravings and the horrible feelings that come with it, or tips on battling depressive symptoms, please let me know.

568,"I've (25TM) been diagnosed with Autism, social anxiety (fear of failure and rejection) and chronic depression. I've been in treatment since 2018, to no avail.

These days I suffer from extreme forgetfullness and an intense feeling of being disoriented. I can be easily set off by the smallest things, making me feel completely worthless, alone and sometimes even betrayed. I'm insanely people-pleasing and I'm tired of it.

I'm currently undergoing diagnosis for ADHD-I.

I just don't know what truly is at play here. Is it ADHD? CPTSD? BPD?

I just wish I knew the answer, or to know in which ""direction"" to look. I feel like I'm a lost cause because none of my therapists/psychiatrists seem to know the answer..."
569,"Ever since I deleted Instagram, I’ve felt noticeably happier. I was never much of a poster, but I’d still spend hours scrolling through reels and posts. I used to enjoy the app when it was about staying connected with friends and sharing real moments. Now, it feels more like a marketplace than a social network.

Think of Instagram like a restaurant. Influencers are the staff, serving up perfectly curated content. The viewers are the customers, there to be entertained. But if you’re neither the one posting nor truly enjoying what you see, why stay seated at the table for hours? You’re just wasting time in a place that doesn’t serve you.

If you’re feeling drained by it all, I recommend deleting the app, even just as an experiment. It might genuinely make your life better. It did for me."
570,"I don’t even know where to start. I’m just so stressed. I feel like so much is placed on my shoulders (by my family/job, but I’m sure I do it to myself as well.)

Husband decided to tell me the dishwasher isn’t working right after hearing the call (and knowing how my day went.) I told him to read the room and now he’s mad at me. I understand I guess. He’s sick of me being stressed. To be fair, I’m sick of it too. 

I don’t know how people manage life. I think I’m missing some secret. 

I know this reads like a diary entry or something. Sorry for the lack of focus and specifics. I guess I feel a little better venting. "

572,"there are times that I think Im thankfull that my highschool years are over , but sometimes when I get angry at smth or someone it always gives me flashbacks . During my highschool years I was bullied and couldnt stand for myself , I was mocked , humiliated draged to the ground and everything , I was so bullied that even my teachers would ask if Im okay and I brushed it off thinking ""yea its going to pass just a few more years and the pain will go"" and now that Im in college sometimes I think I should have stood up for myself , whenever I get angry at someone or smth I get so angry I cant control myself and then I wonder is this all the anger thats been building throughout the years of my highschool that I refused to let out? and sometimes I think I should have done smth to those people that did me wrong in the past and maybe I wouldnt be so mentally hurt. I was nice to everyone and I was easy to get advantage of , now that Im in college Im more of a free guy and sometimes I can detect people trying to take over me but still I think that I lack on that part cause I do think that some people get advantage of me without me noticing , its weird I feel like smth that has no idea of life "
573,"I don’t know what to believe in. I’ve seen psychiatrists before, but I ended up feeling like I was just made dependent on medication. I don’t trust that system anymore. And I can’t afford to see a psychologist right now.
Still I do nkt trust them, maybe because of focault derrida etc position on them.

My relationship with my parents is nearly non-existent. They are kind people, but to me, they feel like strangers. We never really connected.

I have a few friends, but everyone is busy with their own life. I’ve always been the “smart one” – good in school, good at university, decent at work. But the truth is, I’ve felt like something was off since I was a kid. Like I was strange or out of place.

Now, I constantly feel angry and depressed, and I don’t know what to do with it. I feel stuck and alone.

I started evwn non believing in personal health, not understending the point of improvung myself 

If anyone has been through something similar, or has any suggestions for self-help or ways to cope when therapy isn’t accessible, I’d appreciate it.

Bookss would be good"
574,"Hi,

This might be the wrong sub for this—I'm new here—but I really need to get this off my chest.

I was on a student visa in the UK when I first sought help for a combination of mental health concerns. During my initial sessions, it became clear that I needed specialised SA support. I was told the waiting time for that would be around 2 years, which brings us to now, in 2025.

My sessions finally started recently, and they were going really well. I had mentioned to my therapist that I’d temporarily moved back in with my parents in another country. Today, I received an email informing me that because I don't currently reside in the UK, they can no longer continue our sessions. Though I still have a valid visa until the end of the year.

It’s incredibly disheartening. After waiting so long and finally beginning to open up, it feels like my vulnerability was met with bureaucracy rather than care. It’s hard not to feel dismissed, especially when I’ve waited years for this kind of support. I could have lied about my location, as all of this was organised through Zoom, but I chose not to. Is this how truth is rewarded?"
575,"It’s awful how I wake up every single day and go to bed every night with the same emptiness—but at the same time, it’s not really emptiness. Because if it were truly empty, I wouldn’t feel anything at all. And yet I do. It’s strange. It’s like feeling and not feeling at the same time. Like there’s something I’ve always needed, but never had. Maybe it doesn’t even exist.

And that thought makes me so angry—so furious—because I’m a practical person. I’m fully aware of everything around me. So why does this still have so much control over me? Why do I crave approval so desperately when I know I shouldn’t even care that much about people? I don’t even know if I truly care about them at all—I care about what they represent in my mind. The reward. The symbol. I’m so selfish—so unbelievably selfish—that I genuinely question if I care about anything for real.

I wish I could control everything. I really do. It would be incredible. But I also know it would strip life of meaning—it would erase the magic of coincidences, of fate, of whatever that beautiful unpredictability is.

I just want to feel whole. I want to feel human. I want to feel satisfied. I want to feel enough. I want to feel safe—safe, safe. I want to feel loved. I want to feel wanted.

But why? Why? I’m going to die anyway. And I feel so ashamed for wanting this so badly. But I do. More than anything in the world.

I wish I were like those people who are enough for themselves. Who don’t care if they die tomorrow. Who don’t need validation from something beyond them. Who don’t have to prove they’re human enough every damn second. Or smart enough. Or mature enough. No—they just exist, and that’s enough for them. Because that’s who they are.

God. Am I going to feel this longing forever? Am I going to be this painfully self-aware and miserable for the rest of my life?

What the fuck. What a mess."
576,"I have been depressed on and off for almost 5 years now, the past 2 have been especially difficult but today I felt genuinely happy, almost euophoric, for a while. I just finished a final and a class that I hate and had to retake, and I did decent. Just 5 months ago I had suicidal ideation daily and couldn't think, now I feel great. I just hope this doesn't fade too quickly. If you're struggling like I was just know that it will get better, even if just for a moment, you will feel better if you keep working."
577,I always thinking about it non-stop because I’m feeling alone on the internet… I can’t handle this anymore… my life is full of cruelty and ignorance from the other people… what should I do right now…

I also have history of self harm and suicidal thoughts/ideation but don’t want to raise concern and have her contact anyone. Any way I can indirectly let her know without her doing anything or is that just not possible 

Thanks "
579,"Sorry this post is a mess, but I don’t feel like explaining 21 years in one post.

I’ve never felt like I could be myself growing up. I don’t know where this came from, I’ve just never felt at home growing up. Just as a short trauma dump for context: bullied by my little brother for not having friends, never had many friends and the few I had were friends I’d only see at school, tho my familie isn’t homophobic I have been cursed at with homophobic slurs making coming out hard (been out for being gay for a month now since I started dating for the first time and accidentally said his name), family always said I “felt better than others (because I did I higher level of education)”, always said I have no empathy. Both are wrong, I would literally give my life away for just about anyone, and I am empathetic and super caring towards others. Last time I tried dating (a year ago) I was abused, this guy only wanted to use me for sex and the moment he asked for penetration and I said it felt too soon he tossed me aside like trash. 

I have this image of myself in my head of who I am supposed to be. But everytime I want to try being myself (cuz I wanna show the person I am in love with who I actually am) I just can’t. And it’s so frustrating and causes my emotional and physical pain that I can’t show this person, who I love so much I would give sacrifice my own life, who I truly am. 

I’ve never truly felt like I could be myself, even at home I’ve never truly felt at home enough to express myself fully. 

Pls how can I get rid of this stupid mental block ? "
580,"I'm 21F, introverted, quiet and shy. I feel all emotions deeply, including anger and recently I've been having trouble controlling it. I get mad over petty issues, and end up hurting my loved ones. Can anyone recommend methods for anger control that worked for them? I've tried back counting but that hardly works for me. "
581,"I don’t see the purpose in anything anymore, I lost all my passions, I don’t know what I like anymore nor have any dreams for my future. Everything seems weird and pointless, there is nothing that I enjoy doing without feeling some sort of guilt afterwards. I think it would be better if I just died and hopefully start again in a new life, this one lost meaning."
582,"I am 47 and I've been working on writing my life story through this last bout of bad insomnia. Just trying to lay it all out so I can understand myself better and maybe heal somethings I’ve carried for too long. I’ve realized how much I’ve been through and how much of it I never really talked about.

There was a lot of chaos growing up. Family trauma, deep loneliness, trying to make sense of things as a kid, that no kid should have to go through. I got into stuff I shouldn't have early on. Hurt myself in ways that felt like survival at the time. Like everyone I've lost people I loved, a lot of people very close to me. I guess like they say birds of a feather flock together, and anyone of those lost could've easily been me. 

I have learned to wear lots of masks, make people laugh, smile, when inside I was screaming in pain. Haunted by my ghosts that i'd try to bury deep inside, that always seem to come back and visit at the most inconvenient times. 

For a while I thought if I just worked harder or was more spiritual or helped others enough that the weight would lift. But it never did. I’ve had long years of numbness and nights where I couldn’t sleep because my mind wouldn’t stop. I still feel like I’m stuck in an old loop of pain and shame I can’t fully name. But writing has helped. It’s given me a way to be honest when I don’t have the words to say it out loud. 

I don’t have a big point or success story to share yet. Just wanted to say if you’re out there and you’re carrying stuff alone, you’re not the only one. I don’t have it all figured out, but I’m trying. Trying to be better. Trying to find peace. Trying to forgive the past and give myself a new start. 

And for those wondering writing it out really did help me personally. It wasn’t easy and I had to face demons I never wanted to see again. But it has helped me. I know everyone is different. "
583,"I was thinking about it today and I decided there are 4 ways of dealing with negative thoughts and every coping skill, good or bad, can fit into one of these categories. When I say bad thoughts I mean anything from “I’m ugly” to “I want to end it right now”

1. Let the thoughts flow/succumb to them - this could be either spiraling and wallowing in your misery or just letting yourself feel your feelings and waiting until they pass

2. Combat the negative with positive - for example if you’re thinking “I’m ugly” you could start giving yourself affirmations like “I have pretty eyes” or “people find me attractive so I can’t be ugly” or even “I can work on my appearance”

3. Distract yourself - I think this is the most common thing people do; it could be using substances, sleeping, watching tv, exercising, focusing on work or school, pretty much anything to try to get yourself out of your head

4. Expressing your feelings - either talking to someone about your thoughts, writing them down, or expressing things in a creative way like art or music

At first glance it seems #2 may be the healthiest choice but it is also the hardest and in my opinion the least likely to work to actually calm you down. Do you feel there are any coping skills you have used that do NOT fit into one of these categories?

This analysis has me feeling hopeless because I genuinely feel like I have tried everything and still my thoughts and experiences feel overwhelming negative at this point pretty much all the time. Medication is sort of its own category I guess but I don’t want to consider that as an option here. And therapy is part of #4"
584,I don't know if it's jist me but after not having friends for ages and being lonely I'd rather just keep to myself than go out to social events.

587,"TW: Triggering content / abuse My dad took away my internet access, my sister hacked into my accounts and deleted every single one of my accounts and it was my only way to cope through my hellish home, sure i have done some bad shit, but i think their worse than me, the only device i currently have is my school ipad and im writing this from my ipad, my dad is catching on and im scared he will go through all my shit again, and including my journal, he set up spyware apps against me before and invaded everything i did online, heres everything i did compared to what they did against me

I have stolen alot of things from my family throughout my entire life and lied alot, but there are definitely reasons for that, my family is not innocent either.

* Lied many times
* Stole Food and money as a addiction
* Ran away from home because i had severe depression because my family is kinda bad
* Stole my sisters card because i was idiot at the time and just wanted to update my discord nitro and buy things from temu because at the time i had a temu shopping obsession
* Unironically told my sister i wish she wasnt alive at 8-9 years old because we constantly argue alot and i didn't want to get off the game
* Broke my sisters tablet when i was 8 and stole it because i wanted to play geometry dash
* Screamed at my dad that i hated him because he constantly abused me many times in my life emotionally, mentally and physically.
* i completely take accountability for all i have done and i am trying my best to change and not do these things again.

I think thats all for me, lets move on to what they have done

* constantly abused me, physically, emotionally, and mentally,
* Gaslighted me, saying im dramatic, delusional, and embarrassing and all of the abuse never happened.
* Literally yelled at me and threatened to beat me for going on a lgbtq youtube channel back in June 2021
* Said im hopeless
* Thinks what im going through is a phase
* Told me i will go to hell for being transgender, and all lgbtq people should go to hell
* Constantly forces religion on me
* Theres alot more but i cant remember at the moment.
* constantly invades me, barges into my room when i need privacy but gives me none
* says emotionally harmful stuff to me

i think thats all for now."
588,"hi! i (f19) have finished my first year of college and am on my summer break!
i got a job babysitting in the mornings, and a custodial job interview today. i have been trying to keep myself busy- reaching out to local friends to hang out (so far unsuccessfully but i hope it will change), and trying to get back into hobbies.
i have adhd, mdd, and gad. I have gone through a few stressors recently: 
wanting to reconnect platonically with an ex who left my message on read, his gf reaching out to my current partner to basically say “i think your gf is trying to get back with her ex” (all of that was completely mistaken and wrong on her end). 
having a partner who sleeps about 10-18 hours a day, wakes up at 2 in the afternoon, i don’t talk to him a ton besides general small talk, and am worried he is depressed but says his insurance doesn’t cover therapy (and i guess doesn’t realize he needs to improve his habits)

a pet (bearded dragon) i had for 7 years and got as a kid passed away

so both of those things, combined with being home and somewhat isolated (friends are usually super busy or working) i haven’t felt great. I had my med check yesterday and i always get so stressed because i can’t remember what the dosage before vs now was like and if its working better? 
I am on effexor (187.5) buspar (20 twice a day) methylphenidate (was at 60 something and went back down to 36 because it didn’t make a difference).
i am not suicidal, i am not having any thoughts of self harm- and i feel different than a depressive episode because i am not feeling particularly negative. just empty. I go to a therapist once a week (have been seeing her for almost 3 years), she helps a lot and i text her when needed and she eventually responds.
i don’t know does anyone have any recommendations on how to bring joy back to my life? i try my hobbies and don’t really feel anything when i do them. 
I am always tired (going on for about 5 years now) despite having had a sleep study (with no issues) and bloodwork done. i am not falling asleep during things but i get through the day and just feel exhausted.
any help or support or suggestions would be wonderful and much appreciated! thank you"
589,"The general question is whether a therapist with a certain condition is of more use to patient with the same condition than a therapist who does not have condition. Specifically ADHD because ADHD is quite unique with the whole scenario with dopamine.

For example I think it's very difficult for therapists without ADHD to understand people who don't have it.

But at the same time, I've recently had a talk with a therapist who had ADHD and I've find them quite annoying honestly (I have ADHD). They weren't empathetic.

In your opinion, is it possible for a therapist who does not share the same condition to be more of use and more helpful to the patient than the therapist who has same condition as the patient (in this case ADHD) ?"
590,"Hello. I am a 23 year old male from Norway. I have a very specific and scary tendency with makes me really anxious and i am loosing the deep relations with my family and friends. It also makes me unable to go into relationships.

To make it short i get this horrible thoughts and anxious feelings feelings whenever i do something i should enjoy with other people. It feels like I'm afraid that I won't enjoy myself or that it's wrong to enjoy myself and have fun. I therefore find that I act ""professionally"" towards them, and am unable to laugh or show happy emotions. It is starting to get pretty serious and i cant afford to go to therapy.

Does anybody know something i can read or have any ideas regarding what i should do?

591,"Context would be a patient claiming to be stalked and threatened but doesn’t know who is doing it. Signs that indicate some of their claims may be true include: security cameras disabled at certain times coinciding with a missed package delivery, various loud noises at random times that directly affect their job, sudden death of a pet dog after unidentified verbal threats and harassing phone calls and anonymous online messages that suggest the sender knows them and has access to their personal information. The patient believes the stalkers want to disrupt their ability to work and sleep using loud noises, with the ultimate goal of driving them to a mental breakdown.

It's extremely hard for me to get over them. If she ever complimented me back, and stopped talking to me, i'd be stuck on her for years. She rejected me a month ago, and I still can't get over her.

I don't know how to start so I'm gonna go right into it.

My mind is infested by violent thoughts.
90% of the time I think of harming others (family,friends, random people) and myself. The thoughts keep me up at night. I struggle falling asleep. Sometimes I don't sleep at all.

But a part of me doesn't want them gone. I want people to think that I'm violent. I want them to be afraid of me.
I keep thinking about cutting my face so everybody sees. I'm close to doing it.
I've cut myself many times before.
I like the pain and blood.

Besides these thoughts I only wear thick jackets and hoodies when I'm outside because I don't want people to know my face. I try to keep my head down.

I dont have any plans for my future and I don't want a future. 

I don't have any empathy when someone gets hurt. I hate almost everyone (humans as a whole)"

Would love to hear your experience—do you think about it daily? Have you made peace with it? 

I think about my scars daily and I’m trying to gauge where I’m at relatively, but mostly am starting the personal journey to become more confident living with my scars.

Tw: mentions of cocsa











I’m 17f (almost 18) and when I was around 10 years old and my brother was 5 we were outside playing truth or dare and I dared him to let me kiss him. He said no and I walked away to go back inside the house. He then said he’d changed his mind and I asked him if he was sure to which he said he was. I then quickly kissed him and walked away. Afterwards he immediately went and told our mum because he was confused because I’m never affectionate towards him or anyone else. My mum asked him if he was okay and he said he was and to her he seemed completely fine. 

I’ve been too anxious to talk much to him or anyone else so my mum has asked my brother just a few times if he is okay about it and he says he remembers it and is. He finds it ridiculous that I’m worried about him. For ages I think I had a false memory surrounding the event in which I believed I had pressured my brother into it, but I know now that I didn’t. Since I realised that, I stopped worrying about the event for a bit but I’m scared again that it was cocsa because my brother and I have a five year age gap. I think it would have been even weirder if I had sexual intentions at the time but I’m still scared. I didn’t want to kiss him I just had the idea because I experienced cocsa when I was 6-7 years old. I don’t want the event to not be defined as cocsa just because I didn’t have sexual intent though. Was it automatically cocsa because of our age gap? "
609,"So iv found out that the reason iv been getting intrusive thoughts of self harm is because of my anti depression meds. So basically I was on 175, then went up to 200, turns out that can make me MIRE depressed. And have thoughts of self harm.
So now I know the reason and will go back down to 175!"
610,I just came back from my trip from Florida back to California and I’ve been feeling weird ever since I’ve been somewhat dizzy and very dissociated sometimes nauseous and I’m not able to perform my original routine.

611,"I’ve seen a lot of people comparing situations on here (not specifically this subreddit but just in general) 

At the end of the day, if someone’s drowning and they  are 10 ft underwater, they are just as deserving of help as someone 50 ft underwater.
It doesn’t mean they both need the same help but it does mean they are both deserving of help.

Stop comparing it does not benefit anyone 

Set a goal today and achieve it. Doesn’t have to be massive just has to be something. 

"
612,"Well I definitely do I feel like.. sometimes I want to be around people or I want to talk to people but then I just don't I'm very distracted as well. 

I'm looking for some kind of quote that I can maybe make as a status about: 
 When people are struggling it's hard for them to stay in contact with people so don't expect too much of them.
Something like that. The reason being is my dad often gets upset with me because he thinks I don't call him enough, Or that I only call him when I want money.  (Need*) Now in this case particular with my dad though he lives in the United States and I don't even have long distance. He never calls me either. Sometimes I try to connect with him on Facebook and sometimes he answers back and stuff but.. yeah.
If I'm obviously struggling & with money and it's been a while you think damn this girl needs help! (I don't like asking for money lol) I have expressed to him the most thing I want is therapy. I do not have insurance.."
613,"Im 16, I haven’t been happy this year Ive been dealing with stuff that nobody understands and its been hard. I don’t know if it’s the cause of my memory loss, but it’s the only thing I can think of.

I don’t know when it started I only know it started this year, it started with small things like forgetting math or science and failing tests and now it’s gone to forgetting full days. It’s scaring me and I don’t know what to do. Can anyone help??

"
614,"I failed my math finals yesterday, I was caught cheating. I was going to fail if I didn't pass the exam and my mom values grades over learning. Since I didn't study, I told myself it was worth the risk. When I had to break the news, I told her I was late to class and I couldn't take the test. A bunch of verbal abuse came, like usual.

(Context about me: Im a dual-enrollment student graduating high school and was suppose to get an associates degree. I failed a basic English class because it was painful for me to focus since it was so unstimulating and I missed deadlines.
This current semester not to mention.. I'm skipping my other final exams because Im doing so bad that even a perfect score wouldn't allow me to pass. I don't know how to handle their reaction after i tell them I failed 3/4 college classes this semester.)

Ventting time:
Relationship problems - Sterotypical tiger mom wanting me to do well in school but also prevented me opportunities for a healthy social life or dating life to the point where I'm hyper-independent and used to isolating myself. Also, whenever a girl would show interest to me or if I liked a girl, i anxiously avoided them because my mom always demonized dating on how it would kill my grades. Even when she mentioned how I should date this one girl who was kind, and even when the girl had a crush on me.. I was too scared and noticed I developed an avoidant attachment style.

Academic Vent - maybe im not doing so bad after all? not many high schoolers start college with 60+ credits.. (even though I could've gotten 80+ if everything went perfectly). I have trouble validating my feelings and worth so I never feel good enough and if being good enough even matters. I even earned a merit scholarship and have experience for what college classes are like and i get a fresh start with my GPA since it doesn't transfer. Maybe im allowed to be a little proud of myself?
Besides, classes I failed aren't even going to delay my bachelor's degree, I was just doing so well (when I was not as depressed) that the classes I failed were bonuses, but I never get a congratulations since ""it's my one job"" according to my mom, (by the way I'm balancing also part time job which isn't good enough to justify anything to her.) Ans instead imma get cursed out again.

Mental Disorder vent - first of all, I was able to overcome all my addictions (fapping 3x a day to porn, 4+ hours of videos games a day on average) and now i hyperfocus on reading and programming in my free time. Despite this i still suffer from symptoms of depression, anxiety, and adhd where whenever I ask my mom for help she criticizes me by shaming how Im lazy or if I was busy doing important stuff I wouldn't have time to be depressed. (Im saving up money for therapy and treatment now.)

Her parents never showed her any love either and my dad also comes from a family of physical abuse as well. It doesn't justify the neglect i felt my whole life but it helps me accept the fact that it's not fully her fault or mine. My brother also has signs of ASPD / sociopathic because of the way we are treated so I don't think I'm exaggerating.

just venting i guess, my first online vent since im so used to supressing my emotions thinking theyre invalid. any comments and advice welcome. I also feel like a bitch writing this because people have it worse off than me. Ask me to specify anything and I'll reply in detail. Thanks for reading kind internet strangers"
615,"I mean, I'm not afraid of EVERYTHING everything. I'm afraid to start... living. Everything's just so scary and it feels like I can't move because of how freaking afraid I am. And it's pathetic. I'm almost 20, yet I have no job, nothing. I have friends, but all of them have lives. And I'm a nobody.
I think the majority of my fear comes from the fact that I'm ill-prepared. Neither of my parents taught me how to be a person. And now my entire family expects me to just... know what to do. How to live as a person. I don't know how to do that shit. 
And if I attempt to like, idk, apply for a job, then my thoughts get the better of me. I start to think that I'm worthless and a nobody, what's the point of doing anything? And I start thinking about all the things that could go wrong, and I chicken out. I've even tried to tell myself that there's a lot of benefits, but that doesn't work. I try to force myself to do something that scares me, but I just end up in an almost catatonic state. It's a never-ending cycle. 
I do have a therapist. She's wonderful. But it's just so hard to tell her this. It's hard to tell anyone I know about this. Because I know they'll see me as a failure. As a nobody who's using the excuse that's she's afraid of doing anything ""human"" so I can bum off my parents for the rest of my life. But I'm not, I swear. 
And if I do try to tell my therapist- or anyone for that matter- I just end up, idk, shutting down? I know it's because a large part of me is afraid to ask for help. Because, again, they'll judge me for being a failure. 
""But your therapist's job isn't to judge you."" I know that. I keep telling myself that, but nothing. works. I keep telling myself positive things, that things will work out, but yet i can't do anything. I'm too afraid to do anything. 
""The world's a scary place."" You think I don't know that? ""You're just gonna have to suck it up."" You think I haven't tried that???
There's nothing in the world I want more than to get out and live. Go to college, live in my own house, start a fucking life. But I can't. It's just... all so scary. And that's pathetic.  
Not to mention the fact that if I do end up asking for help, then I feel so fucking bad for it. Like, cmon, I should already know how to do this shit. I don't need help. I'm just wasting their time. 
And trust me, I already know that most people wouldn't mind helping. Some people might even be glad to help. And I keep telling myself that, but it never freaking works. The bad thoughts ALWAYS overpower the good thoughts, no matter what I do. Even if they themselves tell me that they're happy to help and I have nothing to feel bad about. I end up just somehow convincing myself theyre lying. I argue with myself. One part of me is saying that they genuinely dont mind helping me, and that its okay to need help. The other, much louder part of me says im a failure and a nobody and a waste of space and that i dont deserve help because its just a poor excuse to be lazy for the rest of my life and people who tell me that they dont mind helping are just lying to make me feel better. And usually, that side wins.
Idk if anyone else has been or is the same way. Everyone out here just knows how to live, and I feel so stupid. They all expect me to know how to live, but I don't. I'm hoping that asking anonymous strangers on the internet for help will feel a lot better than asking for help irl. I hope this all makes sense.
I just don't know what to do."
616,"  My sister (19f) and I (20f) have always been really close. However I am very worried about her. I have spoken with a few of our other family members and they are also worried and notice these things too. 
  She has always been the type of person who stresses easily. When she’s stressed she talks about what’s stressing her ALL DAY. lately she never says anything positive and she’s never happy.
  She also does this thing where she’ll pick a person in the family, and she’ll tell the rest of us that person is mad at her and won’t talk to her. She seems to truly believe this I don’t think she’s just lying for no reason. 
  Also she seems to make things up? Like she’ll say “grandma is always singing this song, she loves it.” When our grandma may have spoken about the song once if at all? 
  If she tells us about something that happens, she’ll tell me one thing, our grandmother a different story, and a third person a third story. 
  She always says everyone has an attitude with her, when we’ve all noticed and agreed that it’s her with the attitude. She’ll ask us for advice and if we give it to her she’ll get mad at us. 
  Is there anything we can do to help her be happier? What is causing her to act this way? She’s always been this way ever since I could remember but way worse since hitting about 17 years old. "
617,"24M. I realize this is a strange question to ask a group of strangers but I truly don’t know what else to do.

I’ve had a difficult last year. I lost my grandma(completely out of the nowhere), my parents split and it changed the entire family dynamic and I started a new job looking to avoid a case of burnout I was developing. 

I’m afraid I’ve developed an obsession with death. I check the breathing of my fiancée, constantly think of those I love dying. I think of time so often. The mere idea of those I love aging fills with me such an overwhelming dread and sadness. I genuinely don’t think theres been an hour that goes by from the last year where I haven’t thought about it.

My job has been the final straw and what has prompted me to make this post. 

2 weeks ago on a Wednesday, I woke up crying and didn’t stop all day. It got to a point where I left work early, it was humiliating to sit in my cube and sob. I woke up on Thursday with a feeling that has not left me since. It’s not an emotion I’ve ever felt before but I can tell it’s not positive. I feel like I am standing on edge of a pit with no visible bottom and the pebbles under my feet are beginning to shift. 

I’ve gotten only worse since that Wednesday. I feel like I’m getting closer to that pit and I am terrified of what’s in it. 

My mind is on 24/7 and it never shuts up. I’m so exhausted and sad and frustrated. This cycle just perpetuates. The longer I’m in this state, the lower my tolerance for new things goes. 

I understand these last few thoughts were ramblings and I apologize for that. It’s just nice to have it all written out. 

Have any of you ever gone through something similar? Do I just need to grow some thicker skin?

I know I need to but I can't figure out how and it's destroying me.
623,"Years ago, everything felt off. Like my brain was wrapped in fog and that I couldn't form the words to explain how I was feeling. How do you explain feeling numb, tired and just floating?

People would ask me how I was, and of course, I’d say “fine” but explaining how I actually felt was impossible and honestly, most people didn't understand my messed up thoughts, well that's how it felt to me anyway.

So one night I grabbed a pen and paper and just started writing every crazy thought in my head. Everything I never said out loud. All the messy, petty and ugly thoughts spiraling around my brain. I have to admit that I felt so much better afterwards because in a strange way, I finally felt heard. 

Sometimes I still read those old pages. I don’t live in that place anymore, but I remember it clearly.

624,"Hi everyone,

I’m a medical student and I’ve taken a total of 3 years off so far due to depression, complicated family circumstances, and financial hardship. I'm currently working on getting better — therapy, treatment, self-care — and I’m planning to take two more years to really stabilize before tackling our national exams (allowing us to have access to residency). Sooo a total of 5 years. It’s helping — slowly — but I still feel this deep shame and loneliness. Not because med school is hard (we all know it is), but because of the *long pause*. I don't see many people with similar paths, and it's easy to feel like I'm falling behind in life or failing somehow.

Has anyone else had to take extended breaks during uni (or med school specifically)? How did you handle the shame, the fear of being “too late,” the feeling of being out of sync with your peers?

I’d love to hear your stories or just know I’m not alone."

Lately, I’ve been experiencing a big spike in anxiety, my heart is constantly racing, i always feel like something bad is going to happen and I’m always looking over my shoulder, I flinch at EVERYTHING and I always think there’s bugs everywhere, i think I see bugs crawling and I feel like they’re all over me whenever I think of them, I clean my home multiple times, I cover all of our food, I mop the floor, I’m so afraid for no fucking reason.

629,"Long post;

I was doing well just before I had met someone and started dating. Without going into much detail it wasn’t working out and I tried to break up after less than a year. Well needless to say my ex wasn’t having it. I don’t want to go into too much detail but for at least two months straight he would show up to my house and not leave until he he “talked to me” or would corner me in my office at work and shut the door and demand that I explain why I wanted to break up and much worse to the point I thought I would have to get a restraining order. I’m already a chronically ill person with anxiety, issues with socializing and I have gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, and a lot of other GI issues. The intense stress from this caused me to develop a severe case of gastritis and this is where my life went downhill. Even after getting him to leave me alone I was left with gastritis so severe I went from 130 pounds to 112 because I couldn’t eat or drink. I’m still dealing with this two years later as nothing the doctors have done have been able to help me completely. It usually dies down a bit and then flares back up everytime I get stressed. During this time my car also started breaking down, every time I took it to the mechanic it would break again with a week and I winded up spending upwards of $8000 trying to fix it all while trying to deal with my health issues. I was low on money and not thriving because I kept having to call out of work for health and my car every week. Then my dog I’ve had for 14 years suddenly started becoming ill and I lost her to kidney disease in October on Halloween. Then at work we have some cats that live with us because it’s a vet hospital and one of them was very bonded to me, a little handicapped Siamese cat that was my best friend. Everyone joked he was my son because he loved so much and would walk to see me in my office every day for the past four years. Even when I had a bad day I could take a break to bury my face in his fur (I’m grateful for this I know not everyone has that luxury). Not even two months after I lost my dog , suddenly they tell me they’re euthanizing him because his back legs don’t work and I only had a few days to process it before they took him out of my office not even asking if I was ready and euthanized him and expected me to just continue work. My gastritis flared back up since this and my cars transmission started having issues the next week. I winded up trying my best to pull myself together to work to save for a down payment on a brand new car and build my credit because I thought maybe I could eliminate that stressor even though I don’t have a lot of money. Mind you I’m still dealing with severe flare ups of my health the whole time. I finally get my new car and think yes this is one good thing. To my surprise not even a month later it’s making rattling screeching noises. Fought to get it looked at by the dealer and they told me it was normal (bullshit) and I brought it in today to the service people and was told we can’t hear anything because it’s raining too loud come back when it’s not raining. I got home and tried to count to ten in the mirror because I had to go back to work and just immediately snapped and started punching myself and hitting myself so hard I broke my hair brush. I’ve never done anything like that before and I don’t know how to feel anymore. Character limit keeps me from mentioning everything but I don’t know what to do. "
630,"I'm gonna go straight to the point about this. These past few months I have noticed that my cognition is being affected more worse, I can't think much, focus, spell right sometimes, word out sentences, etc. The classic, I am very forgetful and not much present and aware. I need things repeated to me and explained, I always freeze mid convo which has been going on for a while but i noticed it has gotten worse. My attention span got smaller, i noticed too that I repeat words and sentences trying to construct them and thinking of what words I need to use to continue it, I repeat it several times mostly two times and give up and just end it, I stutter a lot now too compared to how it was back then. I was scrolling just a few hours ago and I had to repeat the videos I come across to at the very beginning for each sentence because I cannot absorve what they're saying. I have TLE MDD and it's untreated, I am a teenager and my parents are very dismissive. I only got the diagnosis because I forced my dad to come with me for a consultation he didn't know about, they never got me the medicine I was prescribed with nor the tests I needed and I never went to the following consultation, this was done in our local hosp for free. I have a hard time organizing my thoughts because sometimes there are none at all, I don't even know how I'd talk because nothing could come out. It's hard just making this post, I don't know how to say it or word it out correctly without sounding inappropriate or wrong, words come out of my mouth inappropriately sometimes and I don't even know where they're coming from and I don't mean it. I genuinely don't know what to do anymore, I just ignore it but it's getting so much in my way. I used to spell right, never stutter, speak appropriately, remember up to when I was three and more but I can't think about more because nothing comes to my brain. There used to be a voice in my head which is thoughts of my own but it's gone, I don't even have an opinion. I was gonna add more but I can't think about it much I just don't know, my brain is genuinely empty and I need help."
631,?  No one is ever easy on me it is hard I don’t know how I feel. I have to be hard on myself but it’s useless cause I just feel shame but don’t do anything to fix it. I got overcome with health anxiety after an appointment and failed to do my errands I went to the doctor and didn’t get the answers i was hoping I tried to speak up for myself but I kept getting brushed off until the end and ended up feeling sorry for myself no one ever listens my whole life I get brushed aside and invalidated 
632,"Hi there. For context, I went through a divorce last year. Moved back home January 2024. Lived with my parents until July before getting my own place. Now I live alone. 

I’ve had this casework job since January 2024 as well. I feel my mental health has only decreased. I’ve been in therapy since January 2024 and see her weekly. 

Here’s the info: 

Diagnoses: dysthymic depression, raging ADHD, some OCD and BPD tendencies. 

Medications: Lamictal, just switched from Vyvanse to Adderall XR 2 weeks ago, and Zoloft. 

Observations:
- my house has been perpetually in a state of disarray since I’ve moved in July 2024. Think Depression House. 
- I’ve lost almost 20lbs and weigh 102lbs (people have commented on how thin I look or if I eat enough, even at work which feels embarrassing)
- I get on avg 4-5hrs of sleep per night 
- Managing money feels impossible and is a huge background stressor. I don’t prioritize groceries/food intake (not an intentional, my body just isn’t sending the cues to eat). 

I’ve been working with my therapist for over a year to try and maintain Food, Water, Sleep intake and haven’t been able to maintain any of them. 
I keep saying I want to go to the gym every week and I don’t. 
I keep saying I want to reset my house so my environment is cleared for my mental health, but I don’t. 
I’ve stopped hanging out with friends. One friend reached out saying she’s hurt I haven’t reached out to her for 7 months. 

Work:
- I’ve received disciplinary action because I’m always late to work and struggle to remember to punch in/punch out. 
- I believe my clients are not getting good case management because I’m not even taking care of myself so how am I supposed to support them in their own goals and self care? 

Everything feels hard to do. I’m not taking care of myself and haven’t been. My job is being impacted. I keep talking about it to my therapist, I try to keep my supervisor relatively updated, and I’m continuously apologizing to my friends for not being more present. I feel I keep talking about the same things to my therapist for the last year and talking about it isn’t doing anything. 

I was recently sexually assaulted last month which is a confusing situation. So that adds more mental health hardship. (Yes I did contact RAINN for support). 

However, I don’t want to use my mental health and trauma as an excuse not to function. I feel like I keep complaining and I’m not doing anything about it to help myself. 

I’m not sure how to get back on track when I feel so lost in this deep chaotic hole. Idk how to dig myself back out and get back on track. I know I’m capable. I have lots of goals and aspirations and I know my interpersonal skills are one of my biggest strengths. 

But I’m struggling. I don’t know how to get out and I’m scared to keep falling deeper and have my job be impacted more. Or my friendships and supports. 

I’m just looking for advice, or to hear other people’s stories of how they were able to reset and cope with all of these life stressors. I have the ideal routine/schedule/person I want to be, but I’m not doing anything to get to that point.

These thoughts are scrambled! I’m currently on the toilet at work writing this and my coworkers are probably wondering where the heck I am. 

Thanks! "
633,"Bad days turn into having a bad week, that then turns out to be a bad month, a bad year, bad 5 years, bad childhood. My mental health is frail,ive posted alot about that previously- but on top of all my near psychotic struggles,my circumstances get shitty too. Things i personally cant influence such as issues within the family. Be it arguments ,fights, car crashes, pets' health etc. im sick of it all, theres ALWAYS something going on. If not one thing then the other. And all this then makes school(HS) impossible, im too burnt out and tired , im failing more than half my subjects and one of the teachers even confronted my mom about my incompetence. Not sure if this is due to the constant and progressively worse stressful events or a hint fate is giving me if that exists but ive had this feeling of impending doom lately that im going to die soon. That this will all be over in no time. Maybe by my own hands at this rate."
634,"I (14m) have been lying about my life a long time. It started off with small things and then evolved into telling my friends I smoked and drank and even smoked weed. Even though when I said that I have never done 
But a couple months ago I started drinking and got suspended for bringing blue wkd in and after I told all of my friends that I wouldn't have a phone for months. I stopped responding to my friend and she got scared and called social services because she didn't know what happened to me and I'm really hurt and feel betrayed because I thought I could tell her anything and it would be secure and it wasn't even that big of a deal to bring social services into this. But I got a job and got a little bit more stable. Started earning my privileges back like my phone and being able to get on the bus home from school and I was happy because it all went semi-back to normal. But I kind of screwed up last Friday because I decided to get a cigarette from a semi-famous person I met at the place I work and we had a good chat and I asked him for a fag (cuz I'm British) and he gave me one. So I smoked that on the way to the bus stop and some kid from my school show me smoking it and went to the school about it even though I wasn't even in school when it happened but they brought social services into it again and now it's my second strike with social services and I'm scared and I don't know what's going to happen and I'm extra panicking because my parents might search my phone and if they search my phone then they'll find the goodbyes texts that I sent my friends when I didn't want to live and if they find out I'm suicidal again then I don't know what's going to happen cuz my stepdad doesn't really like that and says its selfish for somebody to kill themselves and my mom just agrees with whatever my stepdad says. So wish me a lot and please give me advice"
635,I had major panic attack and now im stuck laying on the couch with slurred speech dissociative stuff paranoia and a weird calmess like what you feel before death like as in succumbing kinda calm
636,"I've always had intrusive thoughts and disturbing emotions that i cant control, aleays lived in my own world but I was aware, I always want to backstab people.. I've moved from Canada for age 6 to 12 then I moved back to macedonia and I was popular but heavily bullied. I went to a private highschool and I turned to drink and weed. After that I had a mental breakdown in the entire town. Afterwards I took a leap year and went to college
 I think I sold my soul to the enemy as a christian. I binge drank for 5 years and am still battling addiction. I have suicidal thoughts. What do I have? My mind races 100 percent and emotion swings all over the time
 I'm on meds and I don't know what to do. I'm under house arrest by my parents. I'm 28m. Any advice? What do I do?"
637,"I'm 16 right now, which mean I only have 2 more years left of high school, but I honestly don't know how I'm going to make it 2 more years. 

Everything is a lot right now. I'm swamped with school work, I'm having issues with my friends, and I just always feel dread when I wake up in the morning. Even things that used to calm me down when I was stressed, like music and reading, aren't doing anything anymore. I physically can't go to sleep anymore without listening to music, and even when I do, it takes a long time. I think most of my problems are related to school, but I don't know how to deal with any of them. My older sister has been helping me with some things, but she's leaving the country at the end of the month, and I honestly don't know what I'm going to do when she's gone. I genuinely think that when she leaves, I'm going to crumble apart, but my issues aren't even bad enough to do so. 

I don't even know who to talk to because everyone in my life is going through their own issues, and I don't want to burden them with mine. Sometimes, I think I'm overreacting and using this ""stress"" as an excuse for why I'm not doing well academically and in my friendships

I'm sorry if this seems whiny, I know people go through much harder situations, and I'm complaining about school lol

Has anyone been in this situation and has advice?"
638,"Hey, chronically mentally ill  29f on disability in the Midwest ✌️. About five years ago I was in a program called CAP. They provided me with an apartment that they paid 80% of and I covered utilities.  With this program someone will come to check on you 3 + times a day and once at midnight. Well I finally escaped thr toxic environment I was in the healthy way and I felt better. I saw their therapist and psychiatrist and did their program.  I then in that time frame met my wife and we eventually got serious and I moved in with her leaving the program and their service area. 
After I moved I went to a psychiatrist in my living area and she immediately told me that I had to come off everything I was on (the very mess that kept me stable for the first time In many years and I was stable for 3 years until this) because they were not good medications.... i.e haladol, seroquel, and some others she didn't PERSONALLY agree with. 
Not only did she help derail me, she also did not do proper documentation so when I finally switched from her care , there were little notes that reflected anything but the basics (PRAISE GOVERNMENT FUNDED MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS-I even one time had a therapist fall asleep on me and then wake up and ask a question like how did your neighbor feel? When I was talking about my  COCSA.
Cool cool. 
Anyways I FINALLY moved back to the service area. 
Well since we moved back into the service area I just had my intake yesterday because My current therapist can no longer see me due to insurance issue,  so I went and did the intake and I told them about how I've Been telling my current psychiatrist about my symptoms: hallucinating,  extreme anger,  impulsive,  fidgety hyperactive , worsening depression,  mania, self harm, SI since June of 2024 and nothing has been addressed or helped so now it's the worst it's ever been .
Well the good news is that I get to go back and see the same psychiatrist I was seeing about 5 years ago when I was doing extremely well and thriving. 
I not only get to see the same person but I see her MONDAY!


I feel like I can finally breathe and i can get better for myself and my wife and we can actually have our baby in the time frame we planned otherwise if I didn't get help mentally we would have to put it off until I'm stable. 
I've cried multiple times because of this good news.
I can breathe. Relief is coming 😌 "
639,"So i (male) wanted too share my story too everyone

I live in france normally with me and my family we are four in total so me, my mom, my twin brother (that doesn’t look like me) and my dad.
For a good amount of time we were a pretty normal family playing with each other, hanging out, having family dinner and all these type of family things until i got too middle school.

One day i came back from home and then i saw my two parent arguing, it was about my dad cheating on my mom with other girls so they fought each other so me and my brother separated them (know that at this times i was like 11-12) since that day everything turned around i started hearing my father talking dirtily over cheeks and saw my mom being mad at us so as a son i tried too make them happy so getting good grades talking nicely too them and all but so they’re expection on me increased and so when i did something wrong they would shout at me and sometimes beat me up (my father) and with that i developed depression anxiety self doubt and some sort of dissociative amnesia and now it only get worse my family is crumbling appart nobody loves me and now im the mistake they now view me as an hindrance and im love starved

Right now i just feel like even though i prayed god, things just only got worse, i cry every night and the only thing im looking forward is finding a partner that will love me for real, but everytime im happy something bad happens i feel like everyone is better than me even though i am the smartest (from what they say) and i feel like im gonna live like hell

So for anyone who got abused mentally and physically please tell me how you got your happy ending…

640,"I wish I could just explain how my brain thinks and works to everyone before they perceived me. I never want to be veiwed as empty headed because I’m very much the opposite. Words could never explain it sadly though. I have so much empathy for people and always think about how I’d feel if I was in there position. But even though I have empathy at times I will not care about hurting someone else as im the main character in my life and at the end of the day the only thing that matters is what effects me. It makes me feel like I’m a bad person but that’s life. I always try find myself in others people but I do genuinely believe no one else is like me. Yes I do have some negative feelings about certain things, I can’t deal with criticism at times, I feel like I should be treated better than other people  and feel like I’m better but am the most insecure person ever. I will always blame people for my problems because it feels like it never my fault. Adleast I know that it’s wrong and I’m accountable for it . I know what’s right and still do wrong but that’s life. No one will ever understand me and I accept it. My veiws on life just make so much more sense than others as harsh as It sounds. Most times my brain just goes on and on the thoughts never stop and there so loud it’s like someone is speaking to me. I feel so awkward with everything I do. Speaking to people, Not being able to look at someone in the eye whilst speaking, the way I’m stood, etc. I think to myself at times on how I can be veiwed better because I never want to be seen as how I view others. Tbh tho I feel like that’s because i judge everyone for things I do also because deep down I hate myself and I admit it though. I just want the thoughts to be quiet for once because it gets too much at times to deal with and all I can do is cry. I wish I could just write all my thoughts down but I can’t even describe it better than how I just have. I feel like I know myself so well sometimes but at the same time I don’t. What is wrong with me, why am I so sensitive. Maybe everyone thinks like this and I just can’t deal with it the same who knows lol I’ve never spoke to anyone about this before. I just don’t want to live with the same brain forever, life would just be so sad and boring. Ask me questions, anything that can help me to not feel like this anymore"
641,"I basically saw a movie, related to a character's experiences of feeling up and down, invincible and wortless etc. Started thinking and researching about it alot. Stumbled upon cyclothymia and really recognised myself in the symptoms. Thing is, i don't know whats normal for a human to experience, what is caused by bad sleep or other external events etc. My enjoyment of life is great though, i just suffer depressed like states for a day or two combined with low self worth, not being able to stick to goals due to my mind changing, lashing out to people around me and then they asking me if i slept well and why i am being this way. That stuff sucks and i don't know why i experience it. I guess I'm wondering if you guys can help a fella out.

feel free to ask question.

Plus, forgot to mention but i also experience heightened moods with crazy energy and even crazier confidence and stuff"
642,"Do you think anxiety is just... worry?  
Like overthinking, biting nails, pacing rooms? Well, it’s not.  
Anxiety is drowning  
in a room full of air.  
It’s your heart sprinting a marathon  
while your body forgets how to move.  
It’s a thousand alarms going off,  
and you can’t find the fire.  
Because there is no fire.  
Just the smoke.  
Everywhere.  
It’s forgetting how to breathe—  
not like “take a deep breath,”  
but like—  
your lungs are locked.  
Like someone changed the code,  
and you weren’t told.  
It’s walking into a coffee shop  
and feeling like the ceiling will collapse,  
the floor will crack.  
You don’t live with anxiety  
You survive it.  
Every. Damn. Day.  
And the worst part?  
It’s invisible.  
You look fine.  
You sound fine.  
But inside,  
your body’s bracing for impact  
from something that never comes.  
And still—  
you smile.  
You go to work.  
You pick up the phone.  
You keep going.  
Because that’s what you’ve trained yourself to do.  
Because stopping  
feels like dying.

643,"Were you able to do anything, how did the medication"
644,"Hi everyone, this is extremely hard to open up about and before I really get into it I want to mention that I've tried every self help thing out there. I never admitted this to a therapist out of fear of being put into a mental hospital (I've been in the psych ward of a hospital when I didn't need it and it traumatized me). 

I am a 20 year old female struggling with anxiety and depression, I'm medicated and it works wonders for me, however since I was 14 I couldn't hold a job for longer than 3 months. At first I thought it was just because I was so young but after a few years I realized there's something wrong, no matter the type of job I feel severely burnt out even if I haven't pushed myself to work hard and feel like the only way to escape it is by committing. The two times I really really tried to overcome this it came back twice as hard and I was fired. I've been unemployed since January of this year, I signed up for Uber to see if that helps take pressure off knowing I can make my own schedule but it's the same thing. The first job I got fired from I was extremely tempted to crash my car and wrap it around a tree to avoid having to work the following day. When I'm not working I'm happy and my depression is easy to manage I don't have anxiety attacks but when I'm working I feel powerless and stuck. How do I fix this? It makes me feel worthless and useless."
645,"I wanted to share something important with you that I’ve been carrying for a long time. 

I’ve struggled with my mental health on and off since I was a teenager. Suicidal thoughts have come and gone — I’ve often dismissed them as intrusive thoughts or symptoms of OCD and anxiety. Outwardly, I’ve always tried to present myself as mentally strong, but inside, I’ve often felt overwhelmed and hollow.

Growing up, I was a prodigy in my sport. I won major competitions, traveled the world, and proudly represented my country. I was on track to compete in the Olympic qualifiers, with my father as my coach. But when my parents divorced at 18, my world shifted. My training fell apart, and in the years that followed, I spiraled mentally and physically. I walked away from my sport and fell into a deep depression, struggling to understand where things went wrong.

I didn’t think my parents’ divorce would affect me as deeply as it did. But my relationship with my father deteriorated under pressure from my family — particularly my mother, who no longer speaks to him. We haven’t spoken in over six years. He’s battled alcohol abuse and anxiety, and I’ve lived in fear of becoming like him — isolated, divorced, and disconnected from his children. Yet every day I see parts of him in myself — both the good and the bad — and it terrifies me.

For a long time, I’ve had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and substances. I didn’t want to admit it, even to myself, until this past weekend. I don’t think I’m an alcoholic, but I know alcohol and substance use has caused serious damage — to my relationships with my partner, my siblings, and myself.

Three years ago, I returned to the sport I love and have been doing incredibly well. But the struggles with alcohol and substances haven’t gone away. They’ve shadowed my progress, and now, I feel like my life is falling apart — quietly and invisibly. On the outside, people think I’m thriving, but the truth is I’m barely holding on.

I need to get sober. I’m scared of what will happen if I don’t. I feel like I’m on the brink of losing everything I care about — and if that happens, I don’t know if I’ll be able to keep going. I’ve seen too many people I know disappear this way, and I don’t want to be next.

Thank you for reading this. I don’t expect immediate answers, but I just needed to say it.

646,"
I’m 15 . My dad blames everyone else for everything, even when he’s clearly wrong. He forces me to apologize just for defending myself or my mom, and he acts like I hurt him instead.
He doesn't care how I feel, says I have to please him no matter what, and if I even try to explain, he gets angry and says I’m disrespecting . After fights, he acts like nothing happened and expects me to do the same.
He forbids me from listening to music if its not music he likes, and I don’t have privacy. I don’t have my own room, and I feel judged for everything I do. My mom is also controlled by him and won’t stand up to him anymore.
 I dont even know why am i still alive anymore, im not happy. I also struggle witg depression and $h which i already stop but feel like im gonna break again

648,"I’m gonna say out of the gate that I feel like an arsehole just writing the title. My ex faked being pregnant with my child to get back in touch with me. I can’t confirm whether she is in fact pregnant or not, I’ve heard different things from different people, but she informed me that she was 30 weeks pregnant and therefore I must be the dad. Fast forward a week I manage to find out that she’s in another relationship with someone and either she isn’t pregnant or (what I have heard from others) she is pregnant but only 4 weeks, so not mine. The scan picture she sent me was ripped straight off a private scan clinics website and I’m just a little fucked up atm. Everyone told me it was bullshit, but in my quest to be what I’ve always wanted to be, which is a dad, I fully got sucked in to that dream and it’s completely ruined my desire to get into a relationship ever again.

If it wasn’t for my incredible mates and my beautiful little goddaughter I wouldn’t be here right now. I can’t eat anything, I can’t sleep, I can’t even relax at home anymore without thinking about this fucking situation. I don’t know how I can throw myself into a relationship after this, how the fuck do I know who to trust and who not to trust after someone does something like that.

Any help or advice would be much appreciated."
649,"I always feel like everything I do is so... shameful. I'm both incredibly sensitive and incredibly repressed so it's a constant battle to act tough or risk embarrassing myself. Showing emotion is shameful, being emotionless is shameful, I lowkey can't escape it 

When I'm crashing out really bad I cannot squeeze out more than like, 3 tears, and once my face starts to contort it's game over even if I'm alone in the dark under a blanket. I can't help but think that if people knew I was capable of looking like that, they'd hate me. Sometimes that's the entire basis of the crashout, I just kind of... lie there and feel disgusting. Like a slug lol

And I can't get angry. I'm incapable of losing my temper, I'll only raise my voice to stop someone from provoking me. I won't feel like I'm getting heated or anything, and once the provocation stops, so does my reaction. Sometimes I'll feel frustrated but then all I can do is ignore it and let it settle by itself. It doesn't feel healthy but idk how people resolve anger (without hurting others or breaking stuff, which I *cannot* bring myself to do). I feel like I'm subconsciously not allowing myself to get angry, but ""self-control"" and ""being utterly incapable"" are different things :/

Worst of all is happiness. After going out with friends, I don't know how to feel about it unless they talk about how fun it was. I'm scared that maybe I enjoyed it but they didn't, so until they post about it or something, I just accept that it Was An Outing and feel nothing more about it. (And if they don't say anything about how fun it was being with me, I Notice and I Will go be sad about it later)

...Basically everything I feel is embarrassing. It's not so much about whether people are judging me, it's just inexplicable shame from an unknown source. I wonder if men ever feel like this cuz of toxic masculinity repressed emotions shit. Hoping it's common maybe? And easy to fix? Idk. "

652,"Content warning: self hatred, minor suicidal thoughts and eating problems (don't think it's a ED that's why I didn't put the ED content warning flair)


One of my biggest insecurities is I'm overweight. Recently I've been struggling to cope with my possible PTSD (my therapist says she thinks I have it but I can't be diagnosed bc my age) and my depression mainly as it's GCSE season. For the last month I've felt diffrent emotions around food. I've felt like 'yay! Food!' Or 'eh, not hungry' or 'you don't need that you fat f*ck'. It's allways felt like my brain talks to me and says horrible stuff to me to the point it even tells me to end myself on occasion. I hate it but it's been there for years so I normally just ignore it as its normamly not verry convincing. But recently sometimes when I eat my brain says some really horrible stuff to me about it wich when mixed with trauma and depression made evrything feel wrong and that I needed to end. I don't know how to deal with it because I feel like I will want to eat but what if it's made and I don't want it and my brains mean again and it make me feel worse? I don't know what to do. Has anyone got many advice on how to cope with these feelings?"
653,"This is in the context of Pop Psychology: everyone you hate is a narcissist, cut toxic people out of your life. If you are 

Intent: Set boundaries to protect your limits, make it easier for people to get close to you. 

Impact: Young people are the loneliest, they've ever been. Mental health has been the worst it has ever been. We don't repair relationships. We are becoming selfish, angry, and treat those around us poorly. We punish people experiencing a crisis, call them a burden, and make them even more isolated.

The problem with this advice: It's a festering wound. We cannot solve collective mental health on our own. Boundaries are NOT the only tool in our toolbelts. And going a step beyond boundaries by shaming people for having needs only upholds abuse.

If you benefit from this advice, you are probably very privilaged, have a robust support system, and are probably not fully cognizant of the amount of help you actually get from others. You can set boundaries because you are in a position where others respect your wishes, and you are safe enough to do so. Boundaries don't work when you are abused or neglected, because your basic humanity is being denied. 

Pop psychology harms people who do not have access to the mental care they need, are poor, marginalized, who are at the point of crisis. The mental health system tells us over and over that we need friends and community to lift us up. But somehow, socially we are absorbing the opposite advice.

It's unhealthy. Let's stop perpetuating the myth that we can only save ourselves. Unless you're Jeff Bezos, you really can't. We need to learn to tolerate distress, not avoid it. Not everyone gets to avoid their pain. 

*Edit* Alright, if boundaries are indeed the end all be all of mental health. Let me set one. I am not interested in any comments where people jump in and project their personal situation onto me. If you aren't willing to engage in a constructive and curious manner, and instead just want to feel triggered, you are not at all welcome. I will flag your comment. 

If boundary logic is correct, and therefore justified pop psychology, this is the correct and healthy thing for me to do. "

655,so i’m 14 and this time last year i was suffering with bulimia and a bit of anorexia. i would skip breakfast and lunch at school and then force myself to throw up my dinner. during this time i was struggling as about 9 months prior my dad had been diagnosed with prostate cancer which had caused my anxiety to form OCD (diagnosed) but i eventually got better. the problem is im having these thoughts again and i don’t know what to do. i relapsed a little while ago but i havnt done it since but i really want to. my parents do not know about my food struggles so i dont know how to ask for help. any and all advice would be deeply appreciated xx
656,"I am having a terrible year. Last year, my anxiety was ramping up as my relationship struggled. He left me in the midst of a crisis in mid-December (basically ghosted me after three years). I've since been basically excommunicated by our mutual friends.

I have been a mess, with the past month being the absolute worst. I wake up with rumination and anxiety every morning and cry most days. I am depressed and volatile. Obviously, my circumstances are absolute shit but my moods feel uncontrollable.

My mom is convinced that my IUD (Kyleena, expires next year) has been the cause of my progressively worsening anxiety and irritability over the years. My doctor insists if I took out my IUD I would feel the same way because the hormones are localized.

I would prefer to get my IUD out versus get on psych meds. But I am concerned about the potential hormonal crash that could make me feel even worse ... ultimately getting me on psych meds anyway.

I am looking for advice. And a hug."
657,"Does anyone else struggle with conpulsive hair cutting that is genuinely debilitating?
For me (22F), it stems from a sort of obsessive perfectionism, but it generally happens when I'm very stressed or anxious (or maybe its mania). It's been more than a year now and I have not been able to stop. Every other week or month, I just start cutting and cutting for hours. Sometimes it gets so bad I skip meals. I stand in front of the mirror nitpicking for so long that I start shaking. Afterwards, I panic because the results are obviously always a mess and I get extremely insecure and afraid to see anyone. I already struggle with self esteem and this makes me so much more uncomfortable with myself, constantly. The worst part is, I got rid of all the scissors in my house, but I continued to cut my hair with nail clippers and razors. It probably sounds like I could just stop doing it? But it's genuinely stronger than me, and that terrifies me. I started to see a psychotherapist about it, but it has not helped even a little bit. 

I'm writing this to see if anyone here has had a similar experience, if anyone has any advice, or any guidance as to what kind of help I should seek.
Thank you for reading and thank you for being here."
658,"Hey Reddit, so recently I've been looking into did and osdd and wondering if i have something along those lines, ever since very young I've had impulses and intrusive thoughts but that could just be my ocd, im Alda very aware of my body and it feels more like a vessel im in control of and not particularly ""me"" ,,, i have traumas from my past and barely remember anything from my young childhood but recently I've felt, more awake and my memory has worked better (this year and last year) another thing which could just be a crossover of symptoms is i very HIGHLY suspect i have bpd, im just afraid to ask for a diagnosis even though im 90% sure, i fit a bunch of the criteria for a mild did, but I've never focused on my personality apart from last year, for ages i just faked who i was to fit in and i fully lost any personality i had, i don't really have a sense of self apart from my interests and humour and other small things like that. I am also autistic and saying this incase this would affect whether it's just symptoms and not a mild did, i could just be reading things and thinking that i have it. "
659,"To keep it short, my mother is a textbook case of NPD, always has been. She has treated me like shit for years (around the time I stopped being a cash cow because my dad didn’t have to pay child support anymore). 

She’s done some pretty awful things to me over the years, and my grandma’s only advice has been “oh she didn’t mean it” or to “forgive and forget”. But I can’t take it anymore, I stopped talking to both of them. I’ve felt less stressed, and the people around me have already seen an improvement in my mood, though I haven’t really told anyone what has been going on, it’s a mess. 

But at the same time it’s given me a chance to process my emotions and thoughts, and I feel sad that it’s come to this. All I wanted was for everyone to get along and be happy, but it just can’t be a reality, and that breaks my heart."
660,"my whole life i've hated myself and thought the world is better off without me. whenever i talk to others about my self hatred ppl normally refer to trauma or some kind of ptsd. while i didn't exactly have a great childhood (was mostly alone with no friends and parents were addicts) i didn't sustain any abuse either. i wasn't bullied or abused my my parents.. more like, sort of just ignored instead.

now i'm 22. almost 23 and i just absolutely hate myself. i'm not passionate about anything that actually contributes to society. i just want to draw play music all day instead of getting a real job and i feel like a selfish child. i don't seem to connect or relate to anyone. my whole life i've felt like the world's in on one big joke that i don't get. i feel like an alien. since i was a teen i've been thinking about ending it all. i've wondered if its this mental illness, that mental illness, and i've been to doctors, the most they've done is put me on sertraline (zoloft) last year for my anxiety levels so i could leave the house and earlier this year they undiagnosed me.

i constantly feel like shit, alienated, alone, and low. it's not depression or anxiety or any form of neurodivergence according to my doctors. so there must be something fundamentally wrong with me as a person. i must be doing something wrong. but i've tried everything to feel better. and i fucking hate myself. why i can't i just be like everyone else? what is wrong with me?

I lost my mom to lung cancer and was her caregiver until the end. That experience shattered me, but it also opened me. I’m now creating a grief workbook born from the mess and the beauty of surviving loss. It’s meant to hold space for others navigating their own grief—especially the quiet, unseen parts.

I’d be so honored to include a short reflection from you—just a few heartfelt lines on what grief means to you, how you feel it, and what’s helped you keep going. Your voice could be a lifeline for someone who feels completely alone.

If this resonates, I’d love to talk more. Thank you for being someone who’s brave enough to feel out loud.

664,"I grew up in a loving, providing family. My parents never neglected or abused me, and always went out of their way to celebrate me and make me feel loved. All our family conflicts have been standard ones, rebellious teenagers or bickering siblings. But for some reason, I just feel detached from them. Like they’re strangers to me, and I feel so ashamed.
I only really noticed this in the last year, and it’s always on my mind now, every conversation. I concluded i must be depressed, as depression can suck the life out of everything good for a person. I do think i am a bit, but, i’m not like miserable? I like myself, my life, I have a will to live. But some of my conversations with my dad or sister just feel so stale. aim more normal with my mother. It’s my side, not theirs. It’s like making small talk with someone you’re not too close with, even though i can tell they love me. Maybe i am depressed.
I don’t know why i feel this way, or how to fix it. I feel like a crap person, but i can’t make myself love people. I can’t tell them “idk why, but i just don’t really have a connection with you, working on it!”
Any advice?

665,"For a long time i was really depressed, and ive only started accepting the help i get and trying to be better around last summer or so. That being said, ive been doing alot better recently, im currently 249 days clean and counting. Most days are pretty good for me, but some days, like the one im writing this on, are not so good. I feel so terrible, so tired. I feel like doing absolutely nothing and just wanting to stop existing, seemingly for no reason. I know its better to accept your feelings and feel them as they come, but im sort of scared to feel sad or depressed these days, because i dont wanna fall back into that pipeline of being really depressed, and im just not sure what to do. Even though most days for me are pretty good, i feel like the ones that arent have become more frequent. Its nothing terribly horribly awful, its just me being tired and feeling depressed or down. And then when im a little depressed or something it just feels like it gets worse and worse, but im not sure what to do about it, and i feel a little guilty for feeling down even though my life is going great. Any tips or thoughts?

668,"I used to be the person who started a new workout plan every Monday and gave up by Wednesday. I tried everything—apps, gym memberships, YouTube workouts—but nothing stuck… until now.

Here’s what finally worked for me:

1. Started Small – 10-minute workouts daily. No pressure, just movement.


2. Tracked Progress, Not Perfection – I took weekly pics, logged how I felt, not just the scale.


3. Focused on Discipline Over Motivation – Motivation fades. Discipline builds habits.


4. Built a Routine I Enjoyed – I switched from things I should do to things I liked doing (hello, dance cardio).


5. Joined an Online Community – Staying accountable made a huge difference.



Now I’m 90 days in, stronger, more energetic, and for the first time, I actually look forward to working out.

My mom was a good mother. she took care of me and my siblings until i was about 8. She acted weird and stuff and my mom and dad argued a lot and i didn't understand what's going on. She used to talk to herself, whisper and laugh to herself like she had some kind of hallucination going in her head and i was very confused...When I grew up my dad told me that she has schizophernia and she refused to help herself. she doesn't work, she has no money and she lives in her parents house and even her parents refuse to help her...I can't stand it why they won't help her....  
My mom also used to be very creepy like she kept the house uncleaned, she used to flip the mirror and think that there were people on the roof trying to take away my siblings and I...It very creepy to me and i thought it was normal just because i was so young....

670,"Has anyone done TMS. Doc is recommending I try it. I’m open to do it, just wondering what your results were like. "
671,"Hi, everyone. 

I'm not sure what this will help or what I'm even expecting to come from it. But, I figured, given a community, this would be the best place to vent about it.

I turned 40 last year and I've come to realize that the future I was promised is never coming. Despite working my ass off for 25 years at this point, I have little to show for it and doubt I ever will. Will I ever be able to retire? Who knows. Will I have Social Security if I do? Who knows. Will I be able to afford anything regardless? Who knows. 

I'm nearing an age where I'm getting passed up for younger (cheaper) talent, but too old to consider a career change. Now, with everything happening in the world, I feel like those years of work were for nothing. I will just get old in a world I don't recognize, if I'm able to get old at all. 

So, that has been my baseline for a while. 

Lately, this has also started to seep into other aspects of my life. The point of anything is becoming harder and harder to come by. I can't plan anything more than a week out. I'm afraid to travel because drivers seem to be getting worse, and airplanes seem sketchy. I'm afraid to spend money because I fear for my job and my savings. I'm afraid to go outside, because people scare the hell out of me for the most part. 

It just feels like I have no control over how my life goes or any of its outcomes.

I wake up every morning wishing I hadn't. It feels like I'm swimming against the current and there's a tidal wave approaching, always out of reach, but always gaining ground. Every day is just, ""Is today the day the other shoe drops?""

I just don't know what to do anymore. It takes all of my energy to achieve normalcy, and at the end of the day, I'm so exhausted I don't want to move. Then, I just repeat that process every day and wonder why. It's like a million little nightmares poking and poking just enough that I feel the pain, but not enough for it to hurt. 

The biggest question on my mind every day is ""How do we come back from any of this?"" This is where everything starts to feel like I'm crazy, because so many bad things are happening in the world, and they're being met with indifference or cautious optimism that some grand entity is going to correct course for everyone. It feels like a lot of humanity has lost the plot.

But how do you get people to empathize again? How do you stop people from being greedy? How do you tell people they can't live their lives at the expense of others living theirs? 

I've always had the mindset of ""I don't care if I'm happy as long as the people around me are."" But, now I don't even know what happiness even feels like. I don't know if I've ever known. Not that I ever felt worthy of it. But then I see people being cruel to one another and it just breaks my heart. It's hard to wrap my head around thinking and acting that way. 

It's all just a mess and I don't know what to do.

(deep breath)

Sorry for the rambling here. I didn't really plan this post out. These were just things I needed to say out loud, and I figured this would be better than shouting it into a pillow or something. "
672,"I have been much more anxious and depressed lately especially due to conflicts with my husband. I’ve been considering ending the marriage. Today I had a mental breakdown and needed to stay home from work. When my husband got home he started irritating me again, and it set me off. I decided I just needed a night away from the house so I am staying at a hotel nearby. I thought it would be relaxing to be away from him but I feel completely gutted rn. We have a toddler and I feel awful that I’m not there to put her to sleep. Am I a terrible person???? I just like needed SPACE and now I feel so guilty. 😩"
673,"I just can't do this anymore, I am tired and wanna give up.

I grew up in an abusive houshold where my dad was an alcoholic and used to abuse my mom everyday. She had undiagnosed BPD and thought I was not supportive of her and eventually took her life when I was 12. Now I am 18 and still live with my dad and he reeks of alcohol everyday. I failed my university entrance exams and no longer can get into any good college, and there are little to no good paying part-time jobs in my country. I no longer have any choice but to be financially dependent on my dad and I just can't bear with him anymore.

When I was 15, I came across an online friend who happened to be a classmate of mine and we quickly became close friends due to similar interests. He was my first friend in my life and is the only one who actually cares about me, he is the only one I have in this world. At the beginning, I didn't realise that I was just manipulating him by trauma dumping on him, but slowly I started realizing what I did was wrong and ended up confessing him, but he still showed empathy towards me and told me he won't leave me alone.

When I was 16, my dad forced me to go to a boarding school, it was horrible, I am still traumatized by that school, my ""friends"" kept leaving me because I was too suicidal and depressed, I have lost count of how many times I have been told that. I had no way to contact my best friend from this boarding school and started showing symptoms of BPD, I was obsessed with how everyone treated me, slightest affection was enough to get me attached to them but they ended up leaving me because I was too much for them. I finally managed to run away(literally ran away) from that school and got into contact with a therapist. He diagnosed me with ADHD and PTSD. He couldn't diagnose me with BPD because I was a minor and I am pretty sure that I have BPD and CPTSD. 

After that incident, I got beaten up by my dad for doing so but I was finally in contact with my best friend. But guess what, he changed completely, he was no longer the person I used to know, he finally told me he had ""too much of me"". I am traumatized with it. I still can't get over the fact that he told that, he changed completely and had completely different hobbies from what he used to have, every single aspect of him changed. Now, I am afraid of the slightest change in someone's behaviour and personality, slightest change enough to send me spiralling and get me to break down, I am afraid of talking to people in real life now, I am done with it.

My ex-best friend introduced me to how I could make online friends across different websites, I did make a few friends before going to boarding school. Now? They all dislike me for being an Indian, called me with disgusting slurs and they cut off contact with me. Everytime I try making friends online, they ghost me.

I fucking hate it, I wish I could completely tear my skin off, I also started self harm after encountering racism online. Everywhere I go, people hate my race. Many times I have been told how Indians have never been oppressed and deserve all the hate that too on bipoc subreddits. I have completely given up on making any friends now.

And there is a war going on, and really bad right-wingism in my country, and unfortunately I am a target for these extremists. Moving to another country is no longer an option for me now due to the racism.

I give up, I can't take this anymore, I can never have anyone in my life."
674,Okay being honest I’m young younger than you would probably expect I wanna text 988 really really bad but I’m scared if I do it’s gonna go bad because of how young I am and yes it’s for actual stuff I do sh and starve myself I’ve already written notes for when I commit so yes I do have actual problems but I wanna know if I should go to 988
675,"This is going to seem really stupid but I need help. I have been having a hard time lately, my depression has spiked, I’m self harming again, I feel hopeless. My support was my only friend but she is no longer talking to me and I’m not sure why. Everyone keeps telling me to call/text the crisis hotline but I don’t want to talk to a screen I want to talk to a face. Yes I have a therapist, but my next appointment is really far out and I can’t get in any sooner. So here is my stupid question, if I called something like maybe non emergency services could they send someone to talk to me? I’m not suicidal I just need someone real to talk to."

678,"I was diagnosed with OCD/ADD when I was very young. It's very apparent in my life though I have managed to keep it (mostly) under control. I recently started a new job and during the first week I had a moment of clarity. My boss asked me to do a very simple, very unimportant task. When completing it, there was a very minor roadblock. I did what I always do, panick and over think it. I ended up staying nearly 20mins late trying to figure it out, and ended up guiltily messeging my boss about my failure. He couldn't have cared less and was confused as to why I was making such a big deal out of something so small. I reflected on my past jobs (there's been a lot) and realized that part of the reason I struggle so much in professional environments is not lack of skill or ability, but my OCD making me obsesse about things most people don't give a second thought. Every mole hill becomes a mountain and minor mistakes become catastrophic in my mind. I confess every mistake and perceived failure to the point that my superiors think im stupid or incompetent. This makes what would otherwise be a normal workday feel crushing to me and I often get extremely burned out within a few months. My last job became so stressful to me I landed in the emergency room convinced I was having a heart attack. Turns out it was panic attack and my blood pressure was through the roof. It's bizarre because I love repetitive, straightforward tasks and actually did exceptionally well in basic training because everything was so controlled. Has anyone else felt this way and if so how do you manage? Are there any careers out there for someone such as myself? "
679,"Im so hyper aware of myself and making noise it makes me feel frozen in fear from anxiety i literally dont even want to swallow in case people hear. It gets better sometimes but other times it gets really bad, it stops me from doing so much "
680,Sometimes it’s hard to recognize how much our childhood shaped our anxiety as adults
681,"
I (19M) feel so anxious around my mother (41F) and I hate it so much because I know that my mother has gone through a lot of depressing stuff in her life. For some pre context, my mother lost her dad at 19, divorced my dad at 26, lost her mother at 28, and at 40 lost her husband (my stepdad) to cancer.

I’ll also add here that she and my stepdad had 1 kid together, my half brother, when she was 35 but I’ll expand on why this is important later.

When I’m around my mother, I feel my peace is disturbed, if she’s angry or stressed, she has to make me angry or stressed by picking a fight she doesn’t even want. Living in a home with her is so mentally draining, I hate the fact that I feel like I have to be on edge the whole time my mother is at home. As soon as she pulls in the driveway, I literally run to my room and shut the door because I’d rather not roll the dice to see what mood my mother is in, because I don’t want my mood ruined. This makes me hate her presence which I feel so guilty about because at the end of the day she’s my mother and has gone through a lot of stuff.

Since my stepdads passing in 2023 (my high school graduation year), this has made the situation so much worse, because my plan after graduating was to move in with my biological dad. My dad and I get along perfectly fine and I feel comfortable and safe around him. I felt like I could really focus on college living with him as opposed to living with my mother. But obviously since my stepdads passing I can’t leave my mother to fend for herself raising a 6 year old. The thing that sucks is that I want to help my mother and guide her to raise my brother differently than she raised me, because I want them to have a better relationship than we do, especially since my brother won’t have a dad. But my mother is very close minded, it’s her way or the highway. My input on anything my mother does has no affect, my words have no value to her. I should also add that I did try attending college the semester after my stepdad passed, but between my job, taking care of the house (I am responsible for everyone’s laundry, the dishes, and making sure the house is never ‘dirty’), my first time taking college level courses, and just overall a little depressed because I was really close with my stepdad, I dropped my classes and haven’t been enrolled since.

I’m gonna try and wrap it up here because I’m teary eyed and I don’t want to cry, but I just feel so fucking stuck in life. After high school I thought I would finally have the opportunity to choose a better living situation so I can focus on going to college living with my dad, and not have to worry about what’s going on in my mothers household anymore. I don’t want to deal with my mother, it is so draining, but I have no other choice. It doesn’t make it better that all my friends have up and moved to colleges away from my city, and I can’t stop the constant comparisons between our different situations and wishing this life wasn’t mine. I want to move out and leave my mother but I can’t, I just can’t pull myself to do so, I honestly don’t know if I even have a future anymore."
682,"14M and I’m stuck in this state that I can’t describe, I don’t feel any different while reacting as if I am feeling emotions, I want to stay away from everyone yet I find myself just having random conversations without knowing it, everything about my life is contradicting itself like I’m somebody different every few minutes. My mind just won’t think straight in the way I want it to most of the time and I have voices that I can feel even if I don’t hear them. All the people around me are giving me is either more stress or more reasons to hate them more than I already do, yet I am so willing to sacrifice myself and my own interests for others. I don’t feel like a real person anymore, like I sometimes just end up “becoming” characters I make up in my mind to distract myself from the voices for brief moments that leaves me stunned. Even if I could trust anyone around me even just a little bit to open up they will write me off as attention seeking or overreacting because that’s just the mentality we have around here, and it’s happened before. Sometimes things in my mind just flash in front of me, scenes of things like violence, blood, gore, and I’ve seen myself kill others and myself in my mind with unsettlingly vivid detail (at least for my age). I want to end this, I don’t feel any different between experiences now, but every time I try I lock up, and it’s the same thing when I try to make decisions, I lock up and end up just sacrificing my own mental health or self for others. I don’t want to be around anyone but without anyone else I am basically nothing. I can’t even make basic choices without overthinking it in an already slow moving mind that will cut itself off randomly. I can’t even gather myself enough to spill everything out, I know there’s much more but I just don’t remember it, my mind won’t let me. I need help and I’m on a few platforms + an actual friend’s DMs (the only real friend I have in my opinion). It’s not working, I’m just falling, literally forgetting to breathe at times with panic attacks becoming hourly. Why am I like this, I have no history of SA (I think?) but I have intrusive thoughts, nothing I can remember from like before 2023 besides how much I hate everyone, yet I’m so self-sacrificing, how am I even functioning in the limited capacity that I am right now?"
683,"I’m upset and getting stressed and was saying to my mum I’m finding it hard waiting for my asd/adhd report (it’s been 7 weeks I was diagnosed with both I’m just waiting for the report so I can get support and look into medication)

And my mum just responds with well lots of people have to wait 2 years for an assessment as if I’m being selfish and impatient but like that’s not the point I waited aver a year and I’m 22 so it’s not like I haven’t had to wait and it’s not relevant how long other people are having to wait i am struggling it’s doesn’t help me by telling me that other people have waited longer it’s just ignoring the fact that I’m trying to tell her that I’m struggling and I just want help

Am I being selfish?"
684,"Hi, F20 here in the UK, I recently started sertraline 50mg back in march for social anxiety, and I’ve been on Elvanse for my adhd for a couple of years now 

Over the couple of months of using sertraline, I’ve gradually shifted into a different person on the inside. On the outside, I’m the same, just much less anxious, but on the inside, my morals are changing, I’m turning into a genuinely bad person. Instead of crying at the thought of hurting someone’s feelings, I’m now getting a euphoric rush of excitement and stimulation when I do bad shit behind peoples’ backs, even moreso when there’s risk. I won’t go into details, as to not derail the main point. 

I’m also just getting this itch to just stop my life in its tracks, asking if this life is even for me anymore. I could just say fuck it, leave my boyfriend, start a new life, new people, get into a different atmosphere. And it’s not to the point where I can’t hold the urge back, but it’s at a point where I’m worried about losing control. It’s like the sertraline and my adhd meds make me feel unstoppable, like whatever problem or consequences I face from my actions will be worth it, the feeling is indescribable. 

Before the sertraline I was (by others’ words) very sweet, kind, welcoming, caring, trustworthy, and now I’m turning into a monster, and I can’t seem to muster up the guilt or emotional empathy that I had before the sertraline. 


What do I do?? The sertraline cured my anxiety, but given me and the people in my life a whole other plate of issues. I might go back to therapy and explain this there too. I want help"
685,"I went to his class today and it started off fine, but about 10 minutes in he pointed at me and asked one of the guys in my class: ""Do you find her attractive/pretty?"" he then proceeded to ask every guy that question and then started comparing me to other girls in my school and telling me I'm the prettiest one. This conversation went on the whole class and then another group of guys came into the classroom and he asked them the same question. Most of them said that I'm not attractive or that I'm alright, which ruined my mood for the whole day, but that's not the point. I don't care what the guys said, I care about the amount of audacity this teacher has. I carry the whole school forward with competitions and all I get is a rating on my look. Mind you I am 16 years old and he is 60."
686,"*This is a piece I wrote. It’s not fiction, but I shaped it like a story. I’m sharing it anonymously.*

Just sitting on the dusty floor. It’s cold.  
My sobbing echoes through the hallway of that old East German house.  
A fire inside I didn’t choose to light.

The door slams. I feel the air wave.  
The sound hits—rattling my little eardrums.

My shoes are untied.  
I’m learning how to tie them.

Do you remember who taught you?

I think if I cry quietly, she’ll come back.

He walks in with the knife.  
“Hold out your hand,” he says.  
I laugh—but not because it’s funny.  
I think if I laugh, it won’t be real.

At nine, I stop crying.  
I start yelling back.

If I don’t bend, I won’t break.  
I become stone.  
Steel.  
Untouched.

It burns.

At fourteen, it’s over.  
The first time I catch the broomstick mid-swing.  
I know how objects move through the air.  
The belts. The shoehorn.  
Anything can be a weapon.  
I know how they fly—shoes, pans, plates.

My innocence—buried long ago.  
I won’t see him again until it’s almost too late.

Sometimes, when I close my eyes, there’s no noise.  
Just white.

In the white, I don’t fight.  
I curl up like something unborn.  
I am not strong here.  
Air.  
I am just… me."
687,"It happens Everytime I go through stress. I feel like my brains just disconnected from everything. I'm thinking clearly and all my thoughts and feelings are in my brain but my body and everything outside, just aren't connected. It's like everything is just colours and shapes and I'm in a constant battle to bring myself back into reality. I'm not hallucinating but everything just doesn't feel quite there where it should be and I have no idea what going on or how to cope with it"
688,"I’m on a burner account here just out of fear of someone I know seeing this because I’ve never confessed these things to anyone else. 

On the outside, I appear happy I think, I am more of a loner at times than social, but I have a good friend group for a single guy in his late twenties.. but none of them know I battle this. 

I’m not enjoying life at all. 

My mind is consumed all day, each day, but thoughts of just absolute perfection.. That’s the only way I can describe it. I have always loved antique tractors (I was a farm kid), from the 1940s era and I’ve been restoring a couple this year. Most people look at what I’ve done and say “that’s a great restoration candidate” or tell me I 
“did good” but meanwhile, if I so much as put a scratch in them accidentally, it will ruin my day and I think constantly about how I’ve ruined my project and how terrible it looks and how maybe I should just scarp the entire project. 

It’s like I just suck the fun out of every hobby I try and I feel like a prisoner in my own mind. 

I got my MBA at 24, and i recently finished pilot training to become a private pilot, but then on the way to work everyday all I can think to myself is “you haven’t done enough” and “you haven’t achieved anything noteworthy in life” so lately I’ve been thinking of taking the LSAT by this fall and trying to get into law school if I decide against upgrading to a commercial pilot’s license. 

Yes, those might be great career moves, but my battle that nobody is aware of is how miserable I make myself in any process. I want to be 
“the best” at literally anything I touch, but I never care to really compete or be any better than those around me, I just always push myself to be better than my former self and become “something” in this life. 

I don’t think I’m a bad guy, I love helping animals and I love people, but nobody is aware that I have this struggle in my mind and it’s winning lately. What’s weird is that it ebs & flows.. some years I can look back and remember feeling more chill and laid back on my life, then other years I have some drill instructor inside my mind saying I haven’t done anything and to get to work and work harder.

689,"I've been hearing a lot about ADHD lately and I'm curious what exactly is it? What are the common signs or symptoms? Sometimes I feel distracted, unmotivated, or have trouble focusing on tasks, and I'm wondering if that's something worth looking into.
How do people usually find out they have ADHD? Are there any self-assessment tools or should I talk to a professional directly?"
690,"After from what I presume was an anxiety attack 4 months ago I haven't been feeling the same ever since - dissociation, feeling of losing my mind almost constantly (like genuine feeling that something is not right in my head), checking for reassurance, intrusive thoughts mostly of losing my mind and most importantly chronic 24/7 anxiety that just can't losen up. My baseline anxiety Is maybe at 5-10% but in normal social situations it rises to like 60-70%. Also I've become overly sensitive to everything - watching a scary movie or distressing news send me to shivers and bad anxiety spikes. It's a torture living like this. Any tips on how to overcome it? Maybe anyone experiences the same feelings? Just don't want to feel like im alone who's stuck in this. 

Note: the anxiety attack felt like my anxiety and fear was about to spiral out of my control and something bad was going go happen, but apart from fear, faster heartbeat and slight hand tremor I experienced no other physical symptoms typical for panic attacks."

692,"I genuinely don’t know how I made such a big switch in grades. I used to be really focused on my studies and super engaged in activities. This lasted up until the second semester of senior year which i’m in right now. I had straight As all of highschool, and this semester I already have a C+ final grade and anticipate either a C or a B for my calc 2 grade. I went through a lot this semester, losing almost all of my friends because they were toxic (even my best friend), mental health going downhill, finding out that the old friend group started spreading rumors abt me to everyone, academic stress from my parents, and worried that I wont be able to succeed at college. I am so passionate about my education but it has been so hard to try this semester. I really let myself go and I don’t know how to get back on track because I’m worried the honors college I worked so hard to get into might rescind because of the significant grade drops. It’s genuinely hard to keep moving forward when I this lonely and can’t do anything about what people are saying abt me, especially the fact that i’m also going downhill academically. I genuinely try so hard but I don’t even know what to do because Im just at a standstill. I emailed the professor but he said the grades were final so there’s nothing I can do about it. Any advice on how i can start to get back on track would be very appreciated! Im looking at college as a fresh start but i’m also worried about my acceptance."
693,"I am so heartbroken and angry.
I hate myself, I really really do.
I’m pathetic, I’ve wasted everything in my life.
I don’t even know why I tell anyone.
I have moments like this and I know there really isn’t a point to reach out and because I’m just going to numb out before anyone can talk to me because they have lives and I don’t. 
Like I feel like this and know, already know, no one is going to speak to me for like six to 8 hours.
Like this post is going to go to mod and I’m not going to be able to hear anything in time to actually do anything with my emotions and I’m just going to be the same person tomorrow.
It’s pointless.  And stupid. I hate it."
694,"This is not a joke, im an immigrant myself, and i dont know why i am obsessed with these kind of things. I try my hardest not to talk with people about it even though my innerself wants to talk about it all the time. Literally i even dont want to like it and i also think its bad. But it gives me a dopamine effect everytime i talk GOOD about it or anything related to this topic. I find many things aesthethic but dont know why.

Is this a mental health issue ? Because i have this since a few years. Do i have the Kanye West effect?

697,"Whenever my mental health descends to a certain point, I get tunnel vision over how horrible I feel and I end up ""crashing out"" so to speak.

Where I will just rant endlessly, harm myself, desire to harm myself, and think about dying.

It feels like being buried alive or being sucked into a whirlpool. 

The worst part is I can SEE how to get out of it, but more often than not I will intentionally refuse to get better.

Either so I can continue to feel worse, or because I don't want to forgive myself for how I have been feeling.

703,"Always struggled with very poor self-esteem and after many many many hours and hours of self introspection and rumination aswell as practical living I’ve come to realize that the few days I feel super happy, full with energy and willing to socialize and just live life is when I am confident.

The thing is that I know I am very accomplished and have a lot of talent at the things I do and have even been ruled out by psychiatrists to be considered ”gifted” and very smart, as well as a very accomplished family in their own rights having become athletes, politicians or having successful businesses. Nonetheless I don’t feel smart, I always feel inadequate, I can always be better, I make stupid mistakes all the time and I really just don’t know how I should try and make my rare confidence spikes be more consistent. Because I genuinely love every minute of the few days a year that I do get that feeling and people around me become happier aswell which is also fun to see.

If any of you have struggled with similar issues and have any advice I’d be super happy if you could leave a comment with advice, anything is welcome and very much appreciated!"
704,"For context. Im a 22 year old who is currently living with my parents still and I'm just having....Issues. My mom is lovely, cares about me and everything. My dad loves me too but he is....Currently struggling. He was raised by the generation who raised the boomers and it shows. Im struggling to find work and its hard for me to do much to help the house but its been since august last year since I had any work. I used to be super resilient to snide comments, I can do good customer service and retentions, but I'm conflict adverse. I stay quiet, I avoid causing problems. I'm the one kid who sees the others belly flopping from the second story roof and goes 'Yeaaaaah....I'm not going to do that and crack my skull open'. Unfortunately my dad used to be one of those kids. Im the youngest of the 4 kids and I am the only one not his biological child, though recently I learned that ive almost got it easy. I....I think he means well, deep down. But he is just....Not a good dad. He is the sort of person to say 'Get some self respect' like its as easy as bending down and picking it up. He is the sort of person to just do what others say, do it then and now, and is stubborn to a fault(Hell, the reason he got into the accident was in part due to this stubbornness). 

When I was young I was the smartest kid in the family. Some of them say that I am the smartest, given that I picked up on things pretty fast, and I was proud of it too. I was called a charmer too(And the other day someone I know online said some things about it and honestly gave me some confidence), But ive caught myself a few times thinking in my mind that I am ONLY Smart. Im....Admittedly bad at actually doing what I desire. Im good at coordination, Micromanaging, and large scale understanding of situations (That doesn't translate well in entry level jobs im afraid). And with my dad barking up my ass about doing things his way and his almost perfectionism when it comes to cleanliness and the like. It almost feels crushing, every day whenever I even just try to talk to him its just snide comments and bullshit. On mother's day I tried to apply for a proofreading job and realized that I am not as in tune with writing as I thought I was, and I went up and went to talk casually with my mom and dad, just chat a bit. After a bit he just says 'Well yeah. Maybe if you learned to read you would be better at following instructions'. I....I almost blew up at him. I had to take a second, and just leave. I am not a person quick to anger, but nowadays I am avoiding him to avoid another fight and stop myself from doing something I cant take back. For...A long time ive been walking on eggshells, even beyond him. Im always worried that if I mess one thing up then everything will fall and crumple onto the ground. That plate im washing? If I scrub too hard Ill break it. In some of the combat roleplay I do? I hold myself back from going full power. Playing games with friends? Hold back there too. But with my dad especially I have to sit there, shut up, and be a man. Take it all. Just do this, Just do that. Just do it. Just....The word Just has become a sort of trigger word for me from him. He things that you can JUST do things. I think that I need to figure out how the hell to do it before I do it. In my eyes it is never as simple as JUST. 

I....I dont know what to do at this point....(Continuation going into the comments)"
705,"I’m in my early 30s and living in a country I wasn’t born in. I don’t have much of a support system here, and I’ve been struggling with low mood and isolation for a while. My job has become toxic — even crossing into harassment — but I’m on a visa that’s tied to my employer, so leaving isn’t straightforward.

A long-term relationship also ended not long ago, and that’s left me feeling even more adrift. Being gay adds another layer — socially and emotionally — that makes things more complicated at times.

I keep thinking about how far I feel from where I thought I’d be by now. I know life isn’t linear, but it’s hard not to feel like I’ve missed my chance at the things I hoped for: fulfilling work, community, love. I don’t know what I’m supposed to be working toward anymore, or how to find any real joy in the day-to-day.

If anyone else has been through something similar — feeling like your life’s stalled, like your potential’s slipping through your fingers — how did you keep going? What actually helped?

706,"It's been one year since I met this girl and we've been in a relationship for around the same time. As a guy who's been in relationships before and lost his virginity, it's quite normal for me to feel deprived. Whereas it's her first relationship and she has never done it before so I get her perspective as well. She says she's not ready. I feel like I should communicate my needs to her because somewhere deep inside my body needs it and I feel awful everytime I masturbate. I can not communicate this to her because this would somehow make her do it ""for"" me and I have come across videos on the internet of women terming this as ra*e. I'm just too scared to communicate my needs but I just feel awful in this relationship. I don't know what to do."
707,All i do is consume content all day I don't study I don't do anything to better my life i need that to change. I try to change but nothing works I go back to my old habits. It feels like I'm never gonna get out of this hole and I'm digging it deeper every day. Need some who has delt with a similar situation to guide me. 
708,"I've (f26) known for over a decade that there is something wrong with my attention span and stuff like almost never being able to show up on time to places or in high school get almost any homework done even if I was having massive anxiety about failing classes and I ended up having to do alternative school and get my diploma 3 years late and dropped out of college cuz I couldn't do it and it was embarrassing always showing up late or just missing the first class entirely. So I've had many psychologists since I was in 6th grade primarily for other reasons (I used to have bad social anxiety back then, and I'm autistic and have depression and have had OCD rituals that come and go most of my life and anxiety in general and also have had disordered eating on and off since 5th grade). I asked one when I was 16 if I could possibly be bipolar (I would get manic periods and I still do but more subdued now) and she laughed at me and said if I'm ""not running through the streets screaming that I'm Jesus"" then no. No other psychologist after her seemed to officially diagnose me with ADHD but one put me on Adderall? It's very confusing as to whether she thought I did have it or not, but she was an even worse psychologist than that other one if you can believe it. So last year, I was talking to a potential new one (it didn't work out, she decided to quit) and after telling her all the reasons why I think I might have ADHD and wanna get an official diagnosis if I have it, she tells me it sounds more like bipolar and that bipolar can have very similar symptoms. It's just very confusing like none of them ever giving me a definitive answer and conflicting opinions."
709,"I just don’t understand what’s happening to me. i thought i overcame this. life doesn’t even feel like a reality anymore. i barely feel human, almost as if my body is simply on autopilot. i smile and laugh in public with my coworkers or classmates then i’ll go home and completely shut down. i cry myself to sleep. i’m constantly thinking of taking my life and constantly tired. tired mentally, physically, etc. the simplest of tasks feel so mentally draining and that’s not me. this isn’t me.

710,"I'm not depressed, I'm not sad or dissapointed in my life, but I still just don't see a big reason for trying to do all that much in my life. I'm a high-school upperclassmen, I don't do that well in school but I'm still going to graduate, I'm not going to college or anything like that. I don't really have any ideas for my future and anything that slightly does just seems so out of reach that it's not even worth trying to fulfill. I'm guessing I'm just lazy or pessimistic in some way, I have a lot of fun in my life sometimes but when I just sit in bed and think, I don't see anything in my future to truly look forward to. Like, if I was handed a gun, I would genuinely contemplate doing it for a few minutes, I probably wouldn't but I would think about it heavily. I don't know why I think like this and I don't really want to, but I truly care about nothing in my life that much, of course I love my family and friends but not enough to keep me going for another 50 years. What should I do about this feeling? Is there a cure?"
711,"
It feels weird to try to formulate my emotions via typing, but I’ll try. I’m 19, almost 20 m and I just feel alone and behind right now. A lot of it is my fault to blame though, because I’m introverted and always will be, and I love being an introvert, but it bites me in the ass sometimes, and it makes me feel like something is wrong with me. I go to uni and most days I don’t even talk to a single soul besides a “thank you” when holding the door for someone/for me. Naturally, I love listening to people talk, but I genuinely just don’t like talking that much. Some of it is anxiety and other times I just don’t know what to say. 

Another reason I feel this way is because I’ve never been in any romantic relationship, never had the chance to kiss/hold hands, not even a valentine in school 😂. Sometimes I think to myself about who cares, but other times I just think about how my whole friend group has a gf/romantic interest and I have no idea what that feels like. I’m super-stoked for them, though it’s just that I feel like a fool a lot, because every time they ask me “aye man you found a girl yet”, I can only say “nah” and leave it at that. IDK if it’s necessarily just because of my looks, but I think it’s because I just don’t stand out to anyone at first glance. Of course, I have my own personal bias, but there’s genuinely some bad luck mixed in there too. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t want to try anymore, because every time I try to put effort into it, I know that in my gut it’s all going to go to shit, and she’ll lose interest/ghost. I’m not gonna lie, It honestly irks me to my core, and it makes my heart feel empty. 

I feel hopeless and kinda worthless sometimes, to be honest. I don’t even know what my purpose is in life, I just feel irrelevant, and I don’t think I matter to almost anyone pretty much. I’m dreading getting no bday texts and instead the only thing in my messages is just scammers and verification codes. The only things that keep me going are a few niche interests that I like, which make me feel unique sometimes, and I love that about myself, and music. I think therapy could be a start, but I’d just be crying half of the time because I’ve been keeping these emotions in for so long and I don’t have anyone that I feel comfortable enough with to express them. If you read this whole thing, I really appreciate you taking the time to read my whining and complaining, but I had to get this off my chest 😂.

712,"When I was in my psychotic episode I did something morally wrong. I put peanut butter in my penis and my dog licked it off and I think I touched my penis to my dog but I was also putting things in my anus and it's been eating me alive. I can't accept what I did... I understood that mental illness (psychosis) is real and it makes you do things you wouldn't do if you were mentally stable. The fact that I remember these things makes me feel that I'm now mentally stable. and I'm afraid to tell these things to my therapist. Do you think I can talk about these things to my therapist?

I have no future to look forward to. I have had on and off jobs and I feel like I'm a failure and like im behind I have 150$ in saving and I have no help around me is have to start from the ground up. My life was fucked up since day 1.

They arent together anymore no surprise  there they both cheated on each other. My dad is manipulative and narcissistic. Nothing is ever good enough and if I ever had a problem with other people I was always told to ""think about what they might be going through"". My mom was a  narcassist too so I ran away at 13 to live with my dad. Met my bf then moved back in with my mom.I feel so lost in life. Is this how it is forever? How can I have motivation to keep going because I'm grasping on to my last straw.

Hi, Ive struggled with mental heath for nearly my whole life and Ive used numerous coping mechanisms to try help it - ranging from journaling to drugs, alcohol and hitting myself 

*Ive never “mutilated” myself*

Nothing has really helped me and I’ve recently been told to flick a rubber/elastic band on my wrist which has been helping.

However, sometime I do it to the point where my entire arm is bumpy, red and bruised. I’m wondering if this is too extreme? If there’s something else I can do? Will this cause damage to my arm? Etc etc

Thank you "
716,"For context, I (33M) and my wife (34F) gave birth to our son earlier this year. My wife became pregnant due to an adverse effect of a medication affecting her birth control. I was anxious when we found out because I didn't feel we were ready for a child, both of us in graduate school racking up debt, and not even in the same universe of anything resembling financial stability. She wanted to keep the baby so the decision was made in my eyes, and now my job was to support her as best I can.

I was anxious throughout because I have worked with many young children and parents over the years and had at least an inkling of how unbelievably difficult a job it is. During practicum I got ti see first hand just how badly some parents have messed up their kids lives. While my wife was getting excited and getting baby clothes I was trying to figure out just how soon I needed to find a job after graduation and build up my clients. I got lucky in that regard, got a good job not long after graduation at a new business and got to work getting clients. Finally my anxiety started to shrink as I felt a bit more in control of what was going on. 

A few months later my wife began to talk about the possibility of moving. Her logic made sense. Where we lived was expensive, as was daycare. If we moved down south near her family not only could we ease the finacial burden but her family would be right across the street ready to help watch the baby, help out with financials, ect. I wasn't exactly a fan of the idea, I wanted to stay in town, near my support system and where i felt comfortable, especially now that I was finding success at my new job. I talked to my wife and she said she wasn't sure if we could make the financials work. So i went about doing everything I could, getting advice from friends and building up as many clients as I could. After 2 months I felt like I had succeeded, the finacials wouldn't be easy but they were doable. 

My wife broke down crying when I told her. She told me that she was terrified of becoming isolated and that she felt she needed her families support. I asked her if there was any way I could make her happy in the house we were currently living, she said no, so we moved down south. 

The house we ended up moving into was in much worse condition then what I was told by her family and much smaller as well. What once was comfortable, now feels small and almost claustrophobic now. But I make do, because in the end I love my wife and all I want is to make her happy. I was even able to keep my job, now working remotely instead of in person, not my favorite thing but doable.

717,"I feel like i've never been vulnerable in my life. I've had therapists before but i could never fully open up and would end up lying about my mental health. Everytime i think about opening up to friends or family i get a wave of guilt and shame. Honestly i've been having suicidal thoughts for years, usually always in the back of my mind but for the past few months it's everyday. I'm not sure if i'd ever actually go through with it because i don't want to put my family through that. I don't know why i feel like this cause my life isn't bad i just lack purpose and have self esteem issues. I've never said this before. Thank you if you took the time to listen."
718,"like, people think i'm joking when i speak of this, but since my 12 basically all the girls I've fell in love with were highly troublesome (my first kiss was with a literal mythomaniac). i'm going to therapy for quite a while now, but i still don't know why. like, i really can't feel much attracted by too ""normal"" or mentally healthy women. i don't know, there is just something i find so sexy when i know the girl uses drugs, has a bad relationship with her parents and stuff, and it's even stronger when she has colored hair, fringe, piercings etc. why is this? i don't find too much stuff when i search for it"
719,"Hi, I'm a 20 year old and I'm not able to understand what's quite happening with me and i can't afford any therapy so if possible please help me figure out what it is. 
So I dont know what I feel about everything, I'm happy for my friends but I don't feel happy inside, I'm sad for them but not feeling sad inside, I'm feeling everything but not at the same time and everytime I cry or feel sad or bad, my mind tells me that it's fake and I'm fake and I'm not even feeling it genuinely so how am I crying and that it's impossible for me to feel this. I don't understand what's happening. Please if someone knows what this is then do tell me."
720,"The past few days have been brutal. Everything feels like it's piling up from work pressure, relationship stuff, family dynamic. It’s gotten so bad that I’ve started clenching my teeth without even realizing it, and now my jaw actually hurts.

My anxiety's been through the roof. I’ve tried journaling, venting to friends but nothing seems to be helping. I’m stuck in my head and my body’s clearly not coping well.

Has anyone else gone through this? What helped you get through it? I’ll take any advice right now.
Help… please🥹"
721,"I have been feeling very lonely and it's starting to get to me again. I try to distract myself with my hobbies, I try to distract myself with music and just trying to do things that I'm interested in, but my thoughts and the loneliness consumes me. At the same time, I'm so afraid of connections. I've always struggled with anxiety, feeling less than mentally and physically, and feeling like a terrible person even as a child. On top of that I have been abandoned multiple times, I got out of a toxic relationship a couple of months ago, and I'm scared of having any sort of connections ever again because of things never working out. But again, I feel so lonely, and it is getting to me and I'm really struggling. My sleep schedule is terrible, I'm tired and I feel passionate about nothing. I honestly just want to feel comfortable being alone, but I don't know how to. "

723,"I was supposed to check into inpatient treatment today. I started having panic attacks 3 weeks ago and was going to the er frequently. Throughout the process I reached out to my dad and my step mom for support. They helped me get insurance and find an inpatient program that specializes in treatment for anxiety. The facility seems nice and it would help but I started getting cold feet. I want help but I don’t feel comfortable leaving for 21 days with no way to contact the outside world. Well my family decided to have an intervention today basically saying if I don’t check in today they will disown me completely. My dad said he’s disappointed in my poor choice not to go. My sisters said I’m a liar for telling them I would go today, then backing out. And my step mom tried to blame it on my boyfriend who I’ve told them has been nothing but supportive of me getting treatment and assured me he will be there when I get out. She said “your putting a man over your health which is very concerning “, this was hurtful because my decision was made solely on myself and how I’m feeling. I hate when she makes assumptions like that and is making it seem like it’s his fault when he is such a good man and never have I ONCE said I don’t want to go because of him. The reasons I don’t want to go honestly I’m scared and uncomfortable. I would rather find an intensive outpatient program, but they are acting like if I don’t go to inpatient treatment tonight, I will never go. I regret agreeing to go honestly but I did and now I feel like my back is up against the wall. I had to beg them for another night in my own bed but they are expecting me to go tomorrow. I feel attacked by the intervention and I wish they could put themselves in my shoes and know that making a decision like this is not easy. I don’t know what to do but right now I’m considering going just to appease them. I wish they would just support my decision and let me go on my own time.

TLDR family trying to force me into treatment program after I agreed to go. Blamed me changing my mind on my boyfriend who supports me going"
724,"Give me more mixed signals than my imaginary crush

First day of school. Almost everyone in the room still hate me im still social awkward,i thought about ending it this night then before i go home my best friends told me ""you can tell us anything"""
725,"I'm 16F and started struggling in school during covid when everyone went online, which resulted in me repeating my 6th grade year. Before covid, I absolutely loved school. 

I've lived with just my dad and younger sister since I was 5 years old, and have no contact with my mother, as she's an all around horrible person, and my dad's family all live in Germany (us in America), so he wasn't able to rely on anyone for help during these past 11 years. Because my dad is older than most with kids my age, I took on the primary ""motherly"" role, while my dad worked. Since I was around 9 or 10, which is the time we were finally able to move into a bigger space after having rented rooms or stayed in hotels, I've done all of the chores, cleaning, and cooking. My sister is 3 years younger and doesn't do any chores. 

Although I completed all the housework and got awards for my grades and attendance during this time, my dad wasn't satisfied and always criticized me for something, and would always expect more. 

This took a massive toll on me in many ways, but like I said, I started struggling in school during covid.

For a few months after in-person school was resumed in 2021, I got back into my normal routine and was enjoying school for the most part. However, in December of that year, I wasn't feeling well after getting my 2nd vaccine, so my dad kept me home for 2 days. After that, everything snowballed. I began to dread going to school, I physically couldn't bring myself to get out of bed in the mornings and was sick to my stomach the moment I woke up just from the thought of going to school. It became rare for me to attend a full week of school with no absences.

Still, I worked hard and was able to pass that year with all A's, despite my absences. 

However, in 7th grade, I attended maybe a month or two, with few absences, before I began missing so much school at once, that I ended up falling behind in work, and I was too embarrassed of myself to ask teachers for help (I begged my dad to help me, but it only resulted in more arguements.)

I became so behind that I switched to online. For a while it worked, but then it didn't. I became behind in work there too. I struggled but passed 7th and 8th in all but math. In 9th, it got so much worse. I was too scared to ask teachers for help, and because I wasn't making any progress at all, I (reasonably) became unenrolled today. I'm so behind in credits and in the material now, especially and mostly math. I don't know where to start to get caught up, to graduate in the year I was supposed to. 

I honestly just think I should die. I've had suicidal ideation for years, even before this became a problem, but I know how much my sister and my dad rely on me. My dad tells me he doesn't need or want me, but he doesn't even know where to put the clean dishes, let alone how to unclog the bathroom sink or literally anything else around the house. My sister also needs me even more and I know she'd be so mad if she had to clean the litterbox when it was my turn. My cat is also my baby and I love him. But I'm so behind that I'm just stuck. Its not even that I failed because I didn't get the work, I got bad grades because I'm so far behind that I drowned in it. I don't have passions or dreams. Can't play an instrument or a sport, and I'm not even pretty. I'm so embarrassed of myself. I would love to graduate in 2027 for my dad and live for my sister, but I don't know what steps to take to get myself out of this hole."
726,"I'm Nelson Kotogbo, a 24-year-old Guy from Delta State Warri. My Family turned against me and wants me to go insane. Not spiritually, but physically, they keep on hanging around the environment where I live, calling my name, and wanting me to hear voices that I know but not see them, following me around undercover. They keep on talking about me frequently and wants everybody to talk about me too. Like when two person's are having conversations they'll be calling my name and they wants me to be listening expecting me to talk unknownly."
727,"I've been struggling with mental health for years now.  
Been in a toxic relationship, been in a good one after but he broke up with me bc of long distance (and I assume my mental health, since I was very unstable and would hurt myself if I feel VERY bad).  
And now I've been single for over 1,5 years and haven't hurt myself physically ever since. If I hurt myself in any way, it's destroying all the friendships and joy I had.  
Still I have phases where I just wish to vanish, or hurt myself again, while being scared as fuck to vanish bc of the unknown void and non existing endlessness.  
Whenever I had a friend to talk to and I told them about my depressing phases that would come every few weeks for a few weeks (like 3 weeks I am depressed, 1 week im fine, repeat), they told me to get therapy. I never wanted to get it, since I felt like I feel better than many other people with depression, mine isn't as bad as others, I am just lazy, bla bla.  
I can't get myself to do hygiene, basic housework, paperwork, going outside, shopping, cooking, and even gaming. I would lay in bed in the afternoon and sleep until it's sleep time again and I go to work. Eat junk food or get lost for an hour with brainrot. Or even randomly start crying and feel very lonely.

It got worse and worse and I finally got myself to go to the doctor and tell her.  
The first meeting with her was good (I guess), but a bit rushed since I came 1 hour before closing.   
She asked me a bunch of questions, even asked me if I need to go to the hospital, but I told her I wanna try to keep it as normal as possible.  
We tested blood and did a EKG, which were fine and I got antidepressant meds.

A week later we had another appointment and it felt so different, it felt like I am doing the wrong thing, that  my symptoms aren't bad enough to go to therapy. I didn't feel like understands.  
She was so cold, I even wrote down all my symptoms and how I felt the last few days and nothing really happened. I have problems to get myself to do things, that's why it took so long to tell her. I was hoping to get a bit more help to get me started to find a therapist, but I just got a single number and I really hate calling.   
Now I feel so demotivated to find any help again.

  
It was such a big step for me, and all I want is a good job, since I never got anything like that, even from my parents (different topic, but they feel like strangers)

"
728,"I work 11 hours a day. 5 or 6 days a week. 7am wake up, 8am start. 7pm finish. I make less than average national wages despite my more than average hours. It's sad. I get walked on my 3 different managers. Many staff members have a weekly rota for one shop. I work across the board as filler, I don't mind that. until I'm being told I have to show up to a shift that I had given 6 weeks notice to having a doctors appointment for that day. I feel like I'm less than the dirt everyone walks on at times. I get told i have bad communication. I can admit, there ARE times where I have texted instead of called my manager. But that's just inconvenience for my manager and not bad communication. I've been here for almost 3 years. I make half of my managers wages and get constantly compared to a sibling with a much larger role (and more than 30 years experience in this role) while taking on many of my managers own roles of .... management. I essentially keep my main shop running. I make sure rotas are correct and sort sickness. I feel like I'm doing enough for everyone but only seem to receive negativity. 

At home, things are just as bad. I share a room with my similar aged brother he is now 19. I have shared it my entire life. Never a moment of privacy outside the bathroom. I have a younger sister who has many issues herself and a solo mother who desperately tries her best despite the goings in the house or her disabilities. My sister has had a substance abuse problem for years. I often have to street search for her on behalf of my mother.  Then the small time I'm at home, my younger brother spends as much of his time as possible to get a rise out of me. There's always screaming or shouting. There's a daily argument. 

My younger brother has no job. So he likes to game late into the night. The issues that arrise there are the fact that I wake up at 7am. And he likes to play until about 4am. And not quietly. I am not quiet during my time off. As nobody else in the building works. So I get called all the names under the sun for asking him to do ANYTHING to make my attempt at sleeping easier. And his refusal is often so loud it invokes my mothers intervention and a following argument. Where I desperately attempt to get my thoughts across while my brother simply shouts over me, making his opinions instantly more valid than my own. 

This kind of stuff is my daily life and it feels like I am genuinely in a cursed loop of torture and despair. Is there anything I can do here? Any help I can seek for myself? Any way for this to end without the big drop? I've had my attempt before, a few years ago. It was awful, but at this point I debate if the pain I'm currently experiencing is worth the sharp end I seek."
729,I don't know what to do with my life 
730,"to sum it up, i was selling myself at 13. it was never intentional, but things spiraled. i had previous SA trauma and was trying to rewrite that but it turned dark, fast. we needed money at home because my ""mother"" kept spending it on gambling and men instead of paying bills. a total bum. spending all my dad's hard earned money too. i gave her money to leave me alone, she was abusive towards me so anything to get her away from me. i took care of my sister's needs too. i needed money to support my habits. it was hell. i stopped at 16 and got a real job but every job i've had since, i freaked out on due to paranoia and stress. that someone from my past will notice me.  the people i do tell this always say it's not my fault i sold myself. i think that's a lie to attempt to comfort me. i was 13 but i knew exactly what i was doing. i had to grow up very young 🤷‍♂️  that's why i don't miss my childhood. that's why i'm so exhausted so young. i saw something that kinda triggered me and i had to vent. because of this i always feel filthy and unworthy of the good things i do have now. i still feel like im a shitty bf and wonder why he stays. i don't feel i'm worth anything. i hate feeling like this but no matter how hard i try to separate myself from this, it doesn't help

edit: i'm not a chick, thought that was clear 💀 ts about to make me go on a tangent but imma stfu. keeping it grounded. guys go through ts too"
731,"I'm using a throwaway account because I don't want people in my main life to really see this, but if they do, oh well. 

I should also preface this post by saying that I have been diagnosed with autism, OCD, and PTSD, so that may influence whatever is going on here.

I have had this issue for most of my life (I'd say since late elementary school, I'm about to enter college now). I feel like there are three main ""personalities"" in my head. When I actually put in the effort to think about them, they feel pretty distinguishable, but usually I can't immediately tell the difference of when they're ""in charge."" They are as follows:

- ""Me:"" Matches my exterior personality: goofy and somewhat edgy (although I hate that word) teenager, hard worker, awkward but social, etc. Present when I'm feeling neutral or good.
- ""Kid:"" The child version of myself. I had some pretty traumatic events happen to me in early elementary, and I feel like I've never grown past that. Present when I panic, feel anxious, or get overwhelmed, or when I'm alone and feel really... secure? Not sure how to explain it.
- ""Entity:"" I'm not really sure how to describe this one. It's like some wise sage that takes the form of ""mist"" in my head? It makes me act like a crisis manager (or whatever you call that). I shut out my own emotions, and try to logically take care of the people around me and make things ""safe."" Present in emergency situations where other people are in more harm/pain than I am, or when watching over/supervising people in general.

As I said, different ones take over depending on the situation. Whenever this happens, I feel like my brain is sorta wiped clean for a second. I'll remember what happens before it, but if that ""change"" happens while I'm talking to someone, I won't register anything they say, etc. It also cuts off my train of thought and I have to struggle to get back on task. It's very inconvenient in certain situations at school right now, since I'm in charge of a large club and have been forced to take on more responsibilities than I ever signed up for. People are depending on me to have my shit together, but I don't. It's wasting my time and theirs.

I guess I don't really have a problem with the separate personalities, but I do get irritated by the memory interruptions and the ""fights"" that sometimes happen when my brain is trying to pick one person to be in charge. It physically makes my head hurt and is super disorienting.

What can I do to manage these symptoms? And what are these even symptoms *of?* I know someone with DID, but I don't think it's that. My memory problems aren't nearly as bad, I have so few ""people,"" and I don't think what happened to me was severe enough to create a trauma response to that degree (but maybe I'm wrong). I've heard vaguely about OSDD, but that seems to be more of an umbrella term and doesn't really help me figure out what the exact problem is. I'd like to be able to get treatment for this/improve the problems I mentioned somehow, but I know from experience that that's hard to get without a diagnosis of some sort.

Thank you for reading this long ass post. I appreciate any and all responses. :)"
732,"so ive gone in an out of depressive episodes since freshman year of high school (im now a senior about to gradute), but i havent had one in a long time. until about a month ago. this is literally the LEAST optimal time for me to be depressed, like im graduating and have a bunch of fun senior activities and trips in the summer but oh my god im so sad. everything is so overwhelming to me, i have no motivation to do my school work let alone even get up in the mornings, i miss at least one day of school every week. im constantly sad and i just think its so unfair that this happened at a time where i should be my happiest. im falling behind in my school work and my social life and its driving me insane. i just want to take a medication that will make it go away, even if its temporary, but im SO scared to tell my parents that im feeling this way. i feel like i'll be a disappointment if they find out im depressed; that they'll see me as pathetic in a way. sorry for such a long rant just for the final question to be very open ended but what should i do? i want this to stop as soon as possible so i can enjoy my life but i have no idea how to get it to stop."
733,"I spend most of my day being pretty emotionless, atleast in how my emotions affect me,but later in the day my emotions tend to take a lot stronger of a hold and I just end up sitting still for hours or going to sleep before I need to.I haven’t cried much in a long while, I still do just barely a noticeable amount."
734,"I’ve reached out to 988 a handful of times and never had someone ask for my email to reach out to me.

I don't want to keep chasing people, if I don't come to them, they don't come to me, we can't say it's friendship at this point.
I'm supposed to have a best friend, but all he do is sending me hundred of videos, I'm like bro can we have some real talk sometimes.
I feel like I'm trying my best to be a good and kind person, and all I received is nothing, life is literally hitting me and I'm like what did I do.
I'm kind of depressed, it's been like two years, it's only getting worse, I don't feel supported, my family think I'm crazy, after all I say my family but I only really talk to my mom.
Life has no meaning, I wake up everyday but for what, I don't do anything.
I'm not good at anything, I just feel like I'm a fucking loser.
I feel like I'm not even existing, I see this person in the mirror and I'm like, it can't be me.
I don't even have the guts to commit, I wanted to, but I never could, but like what am I afraid of after all, there is nothing that keeps me alive after all.
I'm already dead inside, it's just that people don't see it.
No one cares about what you do, it hits even harder when you realize it at midnight, there is nothing you can do about it, you can't push people to care about you.
I feel so chopped, I can't do anything about it.
I feel fat too, I had EDs all my family did was like fuck off and eat more.
I don't feel like I belong anywhere, I just feel like I'm a weirdo and no one understands.
I can't even express myself clearly.
Anyway, there was this voice in my head that told me when I was going to die so I don't know if it's gonna happen or not. 
But I think I'm going to do it before it happens.
Sorry for the mistakes, English isn't first language.

737,"Hi, I was fifteen at the time. Very happy with life. Then one day when I was doing maths homework, basic stuff/no stress, I looked out the window to daydream for a bit, and when I snapped out of my daydream I was suddenly extremely confused, like the focus had completely gone. It was like there was no centre to my brain, like all the thoughts were at the back and the front was all muddle. As though my brain was there but my mind was bound up in tape. I didn't feel like I real, like I wasn't watching reality in real time. There was no physical stroke like symptoms. It was the worst feeling ever.

That was thirty years ago and I'm still no better but I have learned to live with it and lead a normal life. I struggle with short term memory in conversation sometimes and get blanks. I get manic episodes every now and then because my brain lacks the fortitude to deal with stressful situations. 

Anyone else experienced anything similar? Or know what it could be? The doctors have never been interested."
738,"I’ve been struggling with insomnia, anxiety, and depression for the past two years.  
At first, I was seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed me **Mirtazapine**. It worked for a while, but then it stopped being effective.

Later, I went to another psychiatrist who prescribed **100mg of Sertraline** and **25mg of Quetiapine**. That helped for some time, but eventually, the effect faded again.  
My doctor then switched me to **Zolpidem**, but sadly, that didn’t work either.

I’m honestly starting to feel scared that I may never sleep well again.  
If anyone has gone through something similar or has any **tips, suggestions, or even words of encouragement** — I’d really appreciate it.

**P.S.** My anxiety has actually improved a lot — I still feel it sometimes, but it's much more manageable now.  
Unfortunately, when it comes to sleep, I’ve seen very little progress."

I wouldn't be a failure if I didn't exist and I wouldn't feel so awful. I want it to end, but I'm so scared. 

If I continue, im also scared of everything all the time so much I'm paralysed in my life. 

I wish I had dreams and goals that I can achieve to hold on to, a daily life to want to continue, but I barmy do. If I did I wouldn't be a failure.

741,"Hi, I'm sorry if this post is a bit out of context for this community on Reddit. I just downloafed it to find help, or maybe some reassurance if I'm lucky enough. A bit of context, I'm 17.

I have depression, and it has come to the stage where I need to physically harm myself just to bring myself back to real life. I have had this since 8 years old and ever since then, my head just keep telling me to die. I went to a therapist before and I really thought that as long as I change my perspective for my life, feeling more grateful and try my best, I can be 'normal' again. However, if that was the case, I wouldn't be this painful for every single day in my life. I know there are ups and downs in life but somehow my life just always go down, down, and deeper. You can say that 'Oh, you see it like that because you see it in a negative way' but no, seriously, I have gone to a lot of things to the point I cannot cry properly anymore, I can feel sadness but I cannot exptess it healthily without trying to harm myself. 

I want to kms, I tried a couple of times before but didn't work. And now my life has gone even worse, I just want to end this suffer. I know for some adults, this is a childish thought and immature behavior. I have friends and family, they are all fine but not in the way they can help me with this mental state stuff. Believe me when I say I tried to reach for help multiple times but got rejected every single one.

I just want to end everything and not live like this anymore. I've been trying to change but I just fall harder and this is so frustrating...What should I do now?"

I know this is common, but I guess I want to know if it happens with literally anything. Like I could be worried about a work meeting, and think the big boss will not like me or I'll be embarrassed.

744,"I have a family member who has not been diagnosed with anything yet, but is obviously experiencing extreme paranoia to the point that they are isolating in nature, hiding from “them”. Long story short, our loved one believes people use everyday gestures/words to try to invade his life and ours. He is making connections between various life events that form this grand plot that dangerous people are after him. He has very grandiose moments during which he seems to believe he is the only one who knows what truth is, but when asked any specifics responds with “I can’t tell you,” or “it’s way beyond what you can imagine.” 

He tries to explain these delusions to us at times, but they are so disorganized and obviously related to some type of personality disorder. He has a fair share of drug use in his past (ie LSD, weed, MDMA, alcohol, etc.), but has never been one to be considered an addict to anything specific. More-so, he’s had a bit of drug seeking behavior and essentially was self medicating himself with various substances. These delusional thoughts have costed him his relationship, job, and most importantly his ability to enjoy life for what it is.

My family is struggling during this time period and have accepted the best thing we can do is just listen without judgement and wait for him to seek solicited advice. Most other methods have failed, which is real ego check for us. Rather than try to push an agenda, we are trying to show more of an effort to understand him, empathize, and give him love rather than unsolicited advice about mental health. It just gets tough hearing the same things over and over without wanting to pull him out of this rabbit hole.

My question for those who have had similar experiences as my family member: what brought you to the point to become more open to seeking professional help or at least accept the possibility that you were experiencing a form of delusional thoughts? For example - Was it something someone said, an experience you had, or like a random moment of clarity?

(I’m sorry if this is triggering for you to read - I am only trying to get advice/personal experiences to help me better understand these things)

Thank you."

746,"I was just a child when I learned how to disappear.

I remember crouching behind the red bathroom door, heart pounding, the crack of violence echoing through the house. My parents were hurting each other again — screaming, shoving, words sharper than any weapon. I left the door slightly ajar, not for escape, but so they’d believe no one was inside. I wanted to vanish. I wanted the chaos to skip over me. That day, something shifted inside me — a quiet decision to stay small, to stay hidden.

Even now, decades later, I avoid the restroom near my office desk. Some part of me still believes hiding is safer than being seen.

Back then, I believed it was my responsibility to protect my mother. I watched her suffer and convinced myself I could save her. When I couldn’t, I carried that failure like a scar. Years later, I gave her everything I could — nearly $200,000 — hoping it would help her leave that house, start a new life. But she chose to stay. She still lives with my father. And now, even my brother has joined in — verbally, physically abusing her.

The tragedy is layered. She too has turned abusive — toward me, toward others in the home. And so, with a grief I still don’t know how to name, I’ve chosen to walk away. No more calls. No more rescuing. Just silence.

This is not a story about blame. It’s about breaking a cycle. It’s about what it takes to stop surviving and finally start living."
747,"For the past two weeks, I've been feeling deeply depressed and emotionally numb. 

I lack the motivation to do anything – work, socialize, eat, or exercise. All I want to do is sleep and stay in bed.

As an Indian software engineer working at a Chinese startup, the frequent shifts in company direction every couple of months make it incredibly challenging to concentrate. Consequently, I haven't been able to deliver any meaningful work.

Despite not taking any leave in the past four to five months, my requests for time off are met with judgment or an increased workload, effectively preventing me from taking a break.

I feel isolated and have no one I can truly talk to. When I've tried to express my feelings, they've been dismissed with laughter. I've always been perceived as a strong and successful person, which makes it even harder to show vulnerability.

The recent breakup with my girlfriend, which was a serious and beautiful relationship, has left a significant void. It was my fault; I couldn't dedicate enough time to her. She was my source of strength, a good listener, and someone who understood me. Now that she's gone, I feel a profound emptiness.

This is a tough period, and I'm unsure of what to do. Lately, I've been spending my days crying, smoking, and listening to Coldplay.
I genuinely feel dead inside."
748,"Hey, 

This is my first post, just trying something out here. I am looking for non-medical advice or maybe others experiences with this. 

20y/o male with diagnosed ADHD and depression (if that's helpful). I have always had trouble sleeping, since I was maybe 5 or 6. As a kid, I could read or play secretly and quietly to take up time at night. As I got older I self medicated with sh, then alcohol, and now weed. I can easily pull all nighters and just not sleep In general. As I am trying to be mindful of when/how I consume weed, I am recognizing the same extreme nighttime depression that started the sh years ago. I feel useless, hopeless, like a failure, etc. It's crushing and makes me relapse with sh occasionally (especially on weed tolerance breaks). I'm not sure how to navigate my mental health while being mindful of weed usage, meaning not using it to numb feelings. I have a therapist but he is being low key useless. 

TL;DR: I can't sleep at night and spiral deep down in depression if not using substances/negative behaviours. I have self medicated for 10ish years now but want to tackle the real issue (feelings of worthlessness). "
749,"So my entire life I've had insomnia and probably a bunch of undiagnosed stuff, I'm 15 and I have never talked to anyone about my mental state or anything of the sort, I suffer from hypnogogic hallucinations almost every night and I often hear noises or see things that are obvious not there, I started smoking weed about a year ago and it's completely taken over my life. Every time I get any about of money the first thing I do is text my plug, I've tried stopping before but it didn't last long at all. I'm the reason my parents got divorced, I got caught with a pen at school and my dad has always been against it, my dad found out that the only reason I had that pen was because my mom gave it to me this eventually lead to a giant argument that caused my parents to go their separate ways, they tried to give me the ""people just grow apart"" but I heard their arguments through the walls and I know it's my fault, my dad moved to a different state to be with his side of the family and after this school year my mom's making me go live with him, the only thing I have going for me is my girlfriend and I don't think she will want to be with me without any way of being with each other. I'm failing almost all my classes but I'm not dumb by any means I just had no way of doing any of my work during my 3 month suspension for the weed pen so all my grades dropped to almost 0. I recently got ran over due to my own stupidity and it's going to cause permanent damage to my ability to walk and move my left arm. If anyone has any advice for any of these problems that would be greatly appreciated."
750,"I’m (46 male) not suicidal, I don’t think I’d ever have the strength to end my own life, but I’m tired of being alive. I’m just tired. I’ve been feeling this way for awhile, and part of me thinks that maybe it’s just America, maybe America broke me and stole all my joy from me. I don’t want to worry my wife or friends by telling them how I’m feeling because I’ve joked around and I believe they’re starting to see through the jokes. I don’t want anyone to worry about me or feel like I’m a burden to them so I always put on a smile and play the role of happy for everyone else. While I do have moments of happiness, those moments end and I’m back to my baseline. 

I just had my birthday and I was sitting alone at my desk having a crisis because I was sad that I’d made it another year. 

I’m the sole income earner in our house and I’m tired of the pressure of all the financial burden being on me. Ive asked my spouse to at least get a part time job to help me, but she’s not interested because I make good money and there’s no need for her to work financially. I’ve been laid off twice in the last two years and while I was already breaking, that almost completely broke me. I’d been living in fear of being laid off for probably the last 20 years but I’ve always been able to avoid it until I wasn’t. 

I’m an introverted person and have trouble sharing any emotions or having any real or deep conversations in person so this is the first time I’ve really let me feelings out. 

Living just feels like too much work, so much so I’ve reached the point where I don’t want an afterlife, I just want it to be over and done with. I just want to fall asleep and not ever have another thought again, just nothing. 

I know my grandmother who’s in her 90s now has said for years that she’s been ready to die, so idk if this is inherited or not, but I’m wondering is anyone else in this same boat? Just tired of living, but not going to do anything about it physically? 

Sorry this is such a mess of a post and I’ve wasted your time. If this post isn’t acceptable let me know or just take it down. "
751,"hi guys! I've been taking imipramine for depression and anxiety for a while now, but finally, on  my psychotherapist orders and agreement , I'll be stopping taking it in a few weeks. Of course, I've been through the whole process of tapering off the dosage, but I was wondering which are the withdrawl symptoms and how long does it take this process. Im kind of scared because some people have severe withdrawal symptoms that last for several months or more. Hope someone can help me, greetings :)"

I’m a 23 year old boy 2 years back I lost my mother to cancer . And it was sudden for me . She was fighting it for 3 years and 3 times it was vanished completely but came back again . And the last time it came back so fast that her organs failed and she passed pretty quick . My father didn’t tell me how serious it was. He told me only 2-3 days before her passing that she won’t make it . It was darkest phase of my life . I was in grief for very long time cause she was the only one dear to me who actually loved me . My father was abusive towards her and me as well . And he used to say very bad things like because of her illness his lot of money is wasted that’s why I only had her and she had me
After her passing I realised how important it is to find someone for me . A soulmate to have my own someone who’ll love me forever to fill that void she left me . And I met a woman online by end of 2023 and we clicked very fast . We used to talk all sorts of stuff . It wasn’t really an actual relationship cause we never saw each other but we were kind of planning . Then she just ghosted me and left me one day . That caused me a lot of heartache . 
Next I met another person . This was going well as well . We talked and spent time together for nearly a year but after that we had a breakup . It was not from me but from her . She just stopped feeling 
that spark and decided to end the relationship.

I live by myself away from my father in another city . He doesn’t want me to come back as he seems like he’ll remarry and don’t want me there in his life . I don’t want either but that also has left me somewhat feeling alone that I really have no one to have my back 

These major traumas have made me close myself a lot . I want to pursue my career , find an actual soulmate but I can’t do any of these out of fear . It feels like a fear of failure and getting hurt and I just can’t overcome it at all . All my mind thinks is I’ll get hurt and I don’t even try . But I really want it I really do but I just can’t get myself to work towards it at all out of fear . Fear is really chaining me down to ground . I wish I could see a therapist but I can’t afford it at all hence posting it here "
753,"I'm from Poland, and I'm underage, I know they will call my mom that's for sure, but I've been wondering how they will treat this situation. Will they come to me and take me to a psych ward? I actually do want to go to the psych, because I'm currently a danger to myself, but will they actually treat me seriously or will they just check me out to see if I'm okay and then leave?"
754,"I have honestly never felt more alone and empty than right now. I broke up with my girlfriend of almost a year—it was my decision—and I don’t know why it still hurts me so bad. I don’t regret it or want to get back together but it just hurts so bad. And I have reflected on it a lot, realizing that she didn’t fully even know who I was. Thinking about it more, I realized that literally nobody, not even my family or closest friends, knows who I am. Is that like a normal feeling that everyone feels? Or am I just not true to myself or something?"
755,"Hey folks — I’ve always had trouble sleeping when there’s any light in the room. I recently tried a new contour-style blackout sleep mask that’s super comfy and pressure-free. It’s helped a lot with staying asleep longer.

Not trying to promo anything — just wondering if others have found good blackout masks or sleep aids that work? Happy to share what I got if it’s okay to post here.

756,"As a kid my parents never punished me, instead making me feel guilt for what I did. I remember wishing they would punish me so I could stop feeling guilty for everything. I’d get so mad at myself for every little mistake. To make it worse my entire childhood and teenage hood my mom would always accuse me of things that didn’t make sense, there would be no motive for me to do it, she would just think I did it for no reason. I would desperately defend myself every time, but she never believed me even if I proved it. I remember I’d always feel guilty when she accused me of things, even if I was innocent. Eventually I gave up on defending myself and just excepted it. Whenever I messed up instead of being met with anger my parents would sigh and act like they expected it. It ate me alive my entire childhood. 

The guilt never went away when I grew up and it ruins everything. I fall behind in classes because if I miss a due date I will not turn in the assignment at all because I don’t deserve any points at all, I’ll avoid talking to teachers when I fall behind in their classes because I’m convinced they’ll hate me and I can’t handle the guilt, If I mess up once in a friendship I’ll isolate myself to try and protect them. I hate this. I hate that when I do bad things I rarely get punished for them. It feels like I’m living in my personal hell. I miss a due date and it just happens to get pushed back so I’m not punished. I hate this. I hate living with this constant guilt on my shoulders. In my personal life and academic life. I swear to god I’m being tortured. I hate living like this. "
