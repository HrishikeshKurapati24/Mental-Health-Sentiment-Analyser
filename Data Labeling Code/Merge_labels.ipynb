      "Text: paranoia? yes, i can definitely identify with this problem. i just read the \"paranoid phenomena and pathological narcissism\" link and this sentence particularly resonated with me: \"tragically, being gripped by the paranoid condition and its manifest delusional system is the only kind of security that the paranoid patient knows.\" i would indeed feel lost without my paranoia because i have become so accustomed to it as a form of self-defence and self-preservation. i was bullied and ostracized at school and i became paranoid and defensive in response to the repeated rejections from my peers. i would trust people were my friends and then hear from other people they were being two-faced and didn't really like me etc. it feels much safer to assume the worst in everybody in case i am let down yet again. this is why i also find myself very uncomfortable when somebody appears to genuinely take a liking to me because, for one, i don't believe i am worthy or deserving of positive treatment, and secondly, i eagerly anticipate the inevitable moment they will turn on me. it is a vicious cycle, a self-fulfilling prophecy, where i am uptight and defensive, avoid eye contact, avoid any kind of commitment to anybody through fear of the uncertainty of how they will treat me in the future. and of course, this gives people a negative impression - i am \"aloof\" and \"disinterested\" etc, etc. and then people's negative response to me just goes to confirm the paranoia which governs all of my negative non-verbal signals towards others! i have - high functioning autism, ocd (episodic), social anxiety and depersonalization/derealization disorder expect i may have - avoidant/schizoid personality disorder or traits\n",

how much of a factor was therapy in improving your anger problems? gave it some more thought, and for me it gets redirected inwardly more so than being absent. in low moods i can bicker more than seems helpful, but it feels more like tension than anger (or just lower on the spectrum). i'm the direct cause of my own shame - which i guess flips on itself, after a while - so have no problem in understanding the dickhead side to my nature alongside more positive feedback when the addiction energy is redispersed. we've all got a dickhead in us. for an addict, the relationship with him needs to be as realistic as possible. covertunsure wrote: this is one npd trait that doesn't resonate with me almost at all. envy doesn't consume a significant part of my life. i do believe others are jealous sometimes, which is probably narcissistic, but it doesn't seem to affect my life to a significant degree, which means it's not pathological. jealousy had a function in keeping tribes together, so probably weirder to experience none than a little. men are mostly just apes with flashy peacock feathers: if another one starts doing his dance in front of your girl, the \"jealousy\" motivating wedging him away needn't be the emotional kind (or hostile). i think \"healthy jealousy\" comes from protection; unhealthy from insecurity. envy seems more like jealousy doubled over by selfishness or greed - has expressions in virtue-coveting, object attachments, pessimism where there can be optimism; jealousy is less desire-based, more based on maintaining the most 'evolutionarily desireable' thing available to us (love, sex) once connection with a partner has been attained. nothing wrong with that if you ask me. assuming others are envious of you based on little information probably is narcissistic; nevertheless situations occur where the thought will have obvious validity - and that too becomes excessively narcissistic (i guess it's possible to be excessively excessive? lol) if the observation becomes something of a focus. i reckon you can be just as narcissistic about the truth as you can with bs - and both seem to invite the same kind of response. in theory, i think this would be classified as extremely healthy self-esteem or maybe cockiness, not narcissism, but i think almost anyone who's obsessed with themselves likely has narcissistic traits. i don't think there is an adaptive reason to be totally obsessed with yourself. it liikely means you constantly want to feel superior to others, which is narcissistic. is that just a technicality though? i reckon most people see self-involved cockiness as narcissistic. but say it's sub-npd and there's some awareness of the outer repugnancy - like it's kind of being 'weaponised' to see what the effect will be - would you say that's primarily narcissism, or something like \"depersonalised mischief\" ? i don't know how important insecurity is to npd, but it's not explicitly one of the diagnostic criteria, fwiw. i think it's far more important in vulnerable narcissism, which overlaps significantly with bpd, which is almost by definition a disorder of insecurity (in attachment, identity, self-esteem, emotions, etc.) insecurity seems more specific to certain traits or situations, but i'm sure they overlap. isn't there a sentiment out there that certain npds can be highly secure in themselves (without being psycopathic), and have a high - or maybe excessively high - self-esteem? hardly applies to me though: had bad gad in my late teens and developed an ocd/bpd type insecurity about sexual performance while sober (takes a while for some addicts to get back in the groove), and doing the freud thing, it's pretty obvious that's mostly what my \"narcissism\" is compensating for (alongside the general futility that comes with being a chronic addict). sex is fundamental to our nature, so lacking confidence means you'll lack something overall - if there's surplus energy (like bipolar-addicts tend to have), you'll eventually seem creepy. ironically, doubt it would've developed that way without initially having the other qualities my attention drifts towards, in order to make up for it. if someone seems vain or full of themselves, i interpret their vanity as a direct personal affront and attack to me and my self-esteem/self-image; i feel they are trying to make me feel inferior. i do then devalue them in my head, but it's not very effective and i tend to launch into full-out anger or even rage at how they're \"treating\" me. is that because they're effectively objectifying you? not only are they acting superior: they're disrespecting/disregarding your own virtues, by focusing on their own. you aren't getting the respect you deserve; therefore they are being disrespectful. objectively, they are being anti-social towards you. the more i think about it, the more obvious it should be, to not behave this way. i think competitiveness gets unhealthy when it results in maladaptive aggression toward the competitor. for example, if a businessman can't beat his competitor in business, he might try to blackmail him or set his factory on fire because he can't stand the idea of losing (a narcissistic injury), or simply because he's a psychopath and wants to win at any and all costs. if people react differently according to a scale between acceptable etiquette and their own insecurity, from what you're saying, much more empathy is involved in the healthier kind. i've read some of your other posts - are you a diagnosed npd? i relate quite a bit a few things you've written about, but without meaning to compare, i might unconsciously be doing a cbt/vipassana-mindfulness thing to avoid the kind of reactionism/personal offense thing you describe. what's been your experience with those kinds of tools?\n",

      "Text: npd/did as aprophet says, i think the false self/true self dichotomy might make npd or pathological narcissism seem somewhat like did, because grandiosity is projected onto the false self and the \"host\" acts accordingly. but if that grandiosity is fragile (i.e. vulnerable narcissism) and the false self is therefore not robust, one can pendulum-swing to the other side, the deflated \"true self\", but since the true self isn't fully developed or fleshed out, it is really just an approximation of a person with no real sense of worth, identity, or self-esteem. at least, that's how it plays out for me, but i apparently have more identity issues than most with pure npd (i also have borderline traits). i do feel like i have two different \"personalities.\" one is \"everything-is-great-and-everyone-loves-me covertunsure\" and the other is \"i hate everyone and everything and myself covertunsure.\" maybe jekyll and hyde is more accurate. the shift into the latter is precipitated by a perceived rejection, slight, or narcissistic injury. but my default state these days is the latter. perhaps it's a safety net to avoid further disappointment. the most frustrating part of vulnerable narcissism/borderline disorders is the inability to self-soothe and having nothing to fall back on. there is simply no true self-esteem, so in effect your personality is dictated by those around you and you are at their mercy, which just makes everything all the more unbearable. akuma wrote: jebby0209 wrote: just wondering if there's anyone here that has had a series of events and evidence come forward that they don't remember doing it thinking about (even sexual). i've had so many things come to light that i'm thinking i have did. is it possible to be completely confused as to how you could have possibly thought that way or done something so horrible and completely not remember any part of it? is this the time to make a joke about not abusing alcohol? jokes aside though the anxiety you have about it isnt typical for did nor npd. if you feel you are getting unstabel though it is best to see a professional about it. couldn't jebby's \"anxiety\" be a masked form of shame? i think shame and anxiety go hand in hand. if shame is the reaction, e.g. \"i'm not good enough/i did something that risks me being rejected from the social group,\" anxiety might be a natural subsequent sequelae: \"i need to do something to remedy this.\" are you then saying npd doesn't involve significant amounts of shame?\n",

      "Text: destructive label sorry selfserf i have no idea what you were trying to say. i'm just going to ramble a bit, maybe i hit some contact-point somewhere. the true self/false self dichotomy is ultimately about how true you are to your impulses, needs and desires - i've probably said this in the past already, it was \"invented\" by donald winnicott to describe alienation from children from their aliveness by the rules and limitations set by their parents. its not used a lot in the context of npd, so i never know what to make of it when it appears here on the forum, especially since it doesn't have a lot of concretely descriptive value when people use it, since its too abstract. if such a thing exists in \"spirituality\" depends a lot on what branch you are looking at. if you are looking at advaita-vedanta of course you will find the atma-brahma nonduality and this ideas about some sort of primordial consciousness with everything else being maya or the play of ishvara... its a hard philosophical problem for the adherents of that school to show how such nonduality would be possible and how you can realize it if its nondual though. in buddhism in comparison no such thing as a true self exists at all (anatman doctrine) and enlightenment to a large degree realizing this, thereby destroying the 12 links of dependent arising by uprooting avidya (believing there is a true self). i think its important to make a clear distinction between these concepts, as they are not only different philosophical entities but \"working\" with them also is pretty different and has different goals and implications. as to demonic possession... its hard for me to see what you are getting at. if you hear voices after waking up it could be hypnopompic hallucinations. but if you experience your own minds contents as objects (read out there) more often, that per definition is in the psychotic range. but interpreting experience of course is also done on the basis of beliefs. having grown up in a very fundamentalist {the apocalypse comes soon] christian sect, i can understand that deconnecting yourself from childish ideas about demons might be a problem, even when you are not having some schizophrenia spectrum illness. but it can also just be a way to delegate responsibility for your well-being or for the multi-facetted nature of your mind to some \"evil beings\" so you dont have to deal with that, or so you dont feel guilty. dx: spd\n",

(again, there is no doubt that my beliefs growing up probably had something to do with it). sadly, of course after recovering from it, i still was somewhat dumbfounded and was back to my old self. the ways of interacting with the world did not change in the very least (being all i know, essentially). but that hour or two there was a regression to that age i emotionally froze at. that emotional age (which bioenergitcally occupies only a tiny portion in my chest) i designated as the true self. which, obviously as you elucidated, is not the correct designation. ‚Äúshould i kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?‚Äù camus\n",

      "Text: emotion, intimacy and personality at this point i must also reiterate my opinion that, communication does occur via perception of personality and appearance etc - yes; but at least equally in terms of \"waves\" - sensing each others wave patterns and emission. waves waves waves. can sense it almost in terms of a \"pulse\" - certainly when the emotion runs strong. a strong cumulative depolarization of the nervous system in some capacity. what's peculiar is, of course nerve regulation throughout the body stems from the central nervous system, which governs nerve activity through other areas. with the strong emotional depolarization, that pulse - what i get myself is, it almost seems to resonate most acutely through the mid-thoracic cavity; i.e. through the heart. obviously the heart being composed of an array of concentrated musculoskeletal nerve fibres, so we actually physically feel the nerve activity. i guess that's why historically sayings regarding emotion and love, they use the \"heart\" as a reference. \"broke my heart\" - etc etc. that emotional depolarization simply seems to be felt most acutely through that region. gut-brain axis also, like when you're at the discotheque and some really cute chick you were gonna hit on starts making out with some other guy right in front of you. this is exclusively emotional, but it actually feels like someone has kicked you in the stomach. so currently some investigators are focusing on gut microbiome as next-gen mental illness treatment, understanding the brain-gut connection. bottom line is, outwardly we've historically characterized our wave structure as our \"personality\", but i would say it's more accurately characterized as what it is. it's our wave structure.\n",

(of course, who *wouldn't* want to be seen as the most attractive person in the world? it's flattering, but not a reality for almost anyone.) regarding your question, instinctively, i feel the answer is no, i never consciously constructed a diversion, just that i simply must feel good about myself before engaging in relationships. but you might be onto something, i'm just not sure how to tell; perhaps it's subconscious. how do you think i might go about finding that out?\n",

      "Text: fantasies & other possible narcissistic traits when alone, i fantasize success about anything and everything. if i'm listening to a good song i'll picture myself performing it on stage and doing it better than anyone's ever done it. especially when watching movies - i put myself in the movie and how i'd do things better or be more successful than the main character. i also fantasize a lot about serial killing or just generally going around causing havoc and destruction. the latter fantasy was especially strong in jail. my fantasies involve having fame/infamy, power, and/or success. nothing to do with being seen in a good light or as good - just different and special. these fantasies are in the moment and thinking about them in my head satisfies the desire and makes me feel like i accomplished something. moving on, wherever i am, i have a need to come off as different from everyone else around me. this manifests as \"having\" different opinions than others and being antagonistic to other's views just for the sake of debating and have no problem effectively arguing both sides of any discussion and winning(at least in my head i always win). i'll openly disrespect authority if everyone else is a follower or the reverse, speak good on an \"enemy\" of the group. i'll also alter personality traits like in jail developing a more formal, thoughtful persona to separate me from the more brash, loud, and low intelligence criminals. or the opposite, behaving more like a fun jerk while in a group of polite people. whatever happens, i need to win. i place personal power above everything else; especially in interpersonal relationships. i use calculated aggression to make sure i get my way or at least change the terms so i get some level of control and yeah that's still a win. not always possible to control a situation but if i can't then oh well move on. having a person escape my metaphorical chains is one of the few ways to anger me. when that happens of course i work on getting that back into my hypnosis. though while losing something important to me will cause a flash of anger i never let emotions show because losing control is weakness, much less chase after the object. as such i come off as a rock and described as methodical. in jail fellow inmates called me a serial killer because according to them i was too calm all the time and had no feelings or emotions and that i looked like one day i would snap and beat someone to death. i certaintly do, i just don't behave like i do, because of my level of control. closest i'll be seen behaving emotionally is when i use anger to make a point or get something. i've been consistently described as every narcissistic word out there. arrogant, grandiose, egotistical, etc. i will say in my core i've always viewed myself as superior - but it doesn't manifest overtly as haughty, cocky behavior nor blindly thinking i can do anything. from my readings npd worry about other's perceptions and feel a lot of emotions i don't. i also don't seek validation the way a typical narcissist seems to. i don't like being complimented or people being kind or touchy with me. it's annoying. i don't like people getting too clingy, following me around, or looking up to me as a superior. people who try to kiss my ass are weak. so, i don't particularly chase admiration, attention, unless i'm bored but not to regulate ego. i get my kicks and gratification from controlling people actions, perceptions, and emotions. i regularly ask people to do increasingly bigger favors because i like to push boundaries. that was quite a bit of info. those with good knowledge on the core of npd, do i seem to fit in your opinions? p.s: i've been dx'ed with aspd on several occasions and never has a clinician mentioned narcissism other than one mentioning grandiosity. i don't fake it. i just make it.\n",

      "Text: self-loathing technically i would always say, self-loathing is never really in good harmony with narcissism, because narcissism is about positive investment into yourself, or about withdrawing [love] energy from the outside and plugging it into your self. personally i dont self-loathe really. i might have negative perceptions of myself and sometimes rather bad ones, but i see them more like unemotional facts. the only place where i could find self loathing is if i regard my mind/body split. there i loathe (is that a verb) a lot of my physiological reality. i loathe migraines, i have some weird new asthma-like crap that is very distracting and annoying, vertigo and other possibly psychosomatic (?) things that i really hate. so in a way i could say i find this body really crappy and with that, if you would remove the split i would of course say that i find a big part of myself crappy. but it doesnt occur to me like that. overall, while i'm more of an internalizer than an externalizer i would still think that i am much more prone to loathing reality and life itself. dx: spd\n",

      "Text: npd bf of 2 years has been seeing a man. is he gay? i'm confused and heartbroken. i've been in a rocky, on-off-on-off again relationship with a covert type, somatic narcissist. i did not diagnose him on my own, he has several times over the years told me his issues and that he suspects he is, but refuses to get treatment for it. sometimes he has periods of clarity where he doesn't seem disordered at all, but most of the time he slips into it along with all the typical somatic behaviors that come with it. i've been working on myself to erect boundaries and extract myself from the relationship and i'm in a much better position than i was before, but i still slip up and get involved with him again. the entire two years we've been \"together\" (i say that loosely because we could barely go 3 months without him vanishing without a trace, before resurfacing again several weeks later.) he would triangulate me with three specific women. i never met these women, nor did i know them, but he would give me context clues such as where they lived, what they did for a living, etc. whenever he and i were on the \"outs\", he'd invariably let it be known to me that he was with one of these women. he is a businessman and splits his time pretty equally between 3 cities. long story short, and unfortunately i can't give all the details here because they are too specific, but i accidentally found out, unexpectedly, that all 3 of these \"women\" he's been talking about are actually all the same person, and that person is a gay man. there is a plethora of information about this person available online. this person also lives in, works in, and regularly travels to the exact same cities that my ex-bf spends time in for work. in fact, they used to live less than a mile away from each other. all the details match, age, career(s) (he has more than one and they all match each of these mythical women he's told me about), living and working location, 100% the conclusion is that all these women he's told me about is actually just a gay male he's been seeing. further, i've drawn the conclusion that their relationship pre-dates ours and that i'm likely the \"side\" person in the equation here, and this man is his primary relationship. again, i can't go into the details without seriously risking their privacy but this nearly for certain is the case. i really don't know what to think. i'm in a state of shock. he has several gay male friends, one of his work partners is gay, he seems comfortable in his sexuality and being masculine or feminine, so i'm surprised he feels the pressure to be in the closet. i am so confused! i'm oscillating between sadness for him that he feels he has to hide this big secret, but i also wonder if this is just how pwnpd are, they don't care where supply comes from as long as it's supply? this ‚Äòother wo-man‚Äô is clearly good supply. semi - famous, intellectual, beautiful, essentially a younger v 2.0 of himself. i'm not mad. i'm not going to call him out. i‚Äôm not going to confront. but i have no idea what to do or say or think now. i spent all night bawling, partly out of sadness, partially relieved for having an answer to this weirdness, finally, but now i feel numb and i need to talk to someone about this. if i stuff this inside of me and move on without discussing this with someone, i'm afraid i'm going to end up falling into a depression of this whole charade of a relationship that i stupidly hoped would still somehow work out in the end. i just need to get this out. i haven't said anything and won't. we're not on speaking terms as of yesterday, which is also when i found out. any advice on how to proceed in a responsible manner in this situation would be appreciated.\n",

      "Text: inverted narcissistic craving hello! i'm a 24-year-old gay man in australia. i have a younger boyfriend, it's not yet apparent to me if things will work out but so far it's going okay. i read a link someone posted about inverted narcissism and am surprised to find parts that strongly apply to me. would i call myself an inverted narcissist? i don't think so... but maybe. i literally only discovered the term a day or so ago. narcissism usually seems to come from our upbringing. i've looked back on my life, early developmental years, and found interesting circumstances and things that could have shaped my current personality. childhood: it was lovely. before i hit puberty life was lovely. sometimes my parents confused me with their irregularities. in kindergarten i was nice to everyone and my classmates would ask me why i was so nice, why i'd lend things without expecting them back. and i just understood the golden rule and that was that. i was rarely ever a brat. i did, however, have a weird masochistic compulsion that made itself apparent when i was as young as ten or eleven. i don't know what caused it. i tried to make myself the butt of jokes. i actively humiliated myself and made myself out to be an idiot as a ways of entertaining other people. i feel uncomfortable to admit that. i don't understand where the pathology came from. if you believe in past lives and spirituality, there could be something there. anyway, what i did went beyond being a 'class clown', i was never one to misbehave. i encouraged people to mock and ridicule me, and i don't know why. i made myself out to be an idiot. as a teenager i had intense self-hate and depression for no reason i could understand. my family does have a history of mental illness on both sides. i continued to be a disgusting idiot, i think i degraded myself to please other people. how strange. i had a form of dysphoria about body hair and it made me disgusted by myself. anyway i think that in my late teenage years after some changes (including shaving, which had never occurred to me at the time), my self-esteem slingshotted the other way into narcissism, in some regards. i do believe the inverted narcissist can alternate as the situation allows, but perhaps only in some ways and not completely. a truly fascinating condition now that i've read into it and its counterpart. i did and do often feel that i'm extremely beautiful, sometimes the most beautiful person i've ever seen. i became deeply religious at a young age and so altruism became further embedded in my psyche. i'm not religious anymore though still have spiritual beliefs. i am, even now, realising how much my personality is truly shaped by this disorder. i'm undiagnosed. i never believed i had a disorder, until this literal moment. i'm well-functioning. i do get obsessive and delusional. wow... narcissism... inverted narcissism, a personality disorder. i was very lonely all my life and wanted nothing more than a boyfriend. i even self-harmed over it i was so depressed and despairing. it was all-pervasive, this need to have a relationship. the genetic disposition of my family, the intense depression and self-hating of my early teenage life, tendency to be stuck in mental loops and later despair over and need for dating is probably what shaped me to be this way. my first relationship lasted six months, he had anxiety that he takes medication for now. the relationship was one-sided and i was extremely attentive and doting, i believed that he needed the care because of his condition. i didn't love him and didn't care much when he broke up with me. i believe my current and former boyfriend also felt that i was in love with them just because of how i was, but the truth is i am simply very attentive and doting and enthralled by my partners. i crave someone to worship, someone who i can be their narcissistic supply. if i had to choose i'd rather date a codependent because i want stability in a relationship, certainly need it if i am to love at my strongest. i sometimes like to dominate, i certainly like to provide care, which is why i'd want a codependent. the idea of being with or worshipping a narcissist is still exciting for me to contemplate. i don't think i could give an inverted narcissist the bullying they may require. anyway... input will be highly valued by me. thanks for reading.\n",

      "Text: inverted narcissistic craving thanks for sharing. lets start with this. i could have edited your post, but on second thought there is no need for you to read your post again, you spent enough time editing, so just a sample so i can get threw to you with what i mean: \"as a teenager i had intense self-hate and depression for no reason i could understand. i always hoped for the best, tried to apply the golden rule to everyone, care about everyone, even if i didnt care about myself, didnt think i could undo the damage done to me. i never liked myself the way i was, i often drifted off into fantasy where i was better, more witty, successfull and accepted for who i am. i actively humiliated myself and made myself out to be an idiot as a ways of entertaining other people. i thoughts its ok, i liked making others laugh, maybe most of all things. i was always the class clown. i missbehaved a lot, could never fit in to societie's rulestructure. anyway i think that in my early twenties after some changes (moving out to student dorm, taking care of myself), my self-esteem slingshotted the other way into narcissism, in some regards. i became deeply atheistic at a young age and saw humanity as a kind of a \"spaceship earth\". altruism became deeply embedded im my psyche, i thought i love all people, becouse of the destiny we share on this planet. this made me often taken advantage of. im undiagnosed, but i always believed myself to be pahological. i shared this thought with my sister, who also held this belief. i was very lonely all my life, but didnt believe a girlfriend would help that. i could connect to some people in some regards, but never felt anyone truly understood me.\" my hope is to illustrate how much the disorder shapes your behavior. now about your newly aquired self-awareness (\"i posses inverted-narcissist traits\"). you must understand that this awareness does not equal the awareness of ones actions, why one does the things he does. one of the characteristics of npd is the lack of the capacity to self-reflect. this one makes sence. one couldnt be self-abusive if he understood, that he does it. you cannot know, or you might actualy stop. you say: \"wow... narcissism... inverted narcissism, a personality disorder\" yes, i faced disbelief like that, just like you did, when i first found out. now you bring up a key difference. i had many short relationships, which all failed and i just didnt believe i should make someone unhappy, by being with a pathological person like me. i thought ill just be alone, doing my things, learning about the world, an observer, living vicariously threw my intellectual and artistic pursuits. your craving to be with someone has led you on the right path to answer the questions you've always had. npd is to be primarily understood threw your relations to other people. you must be aware by now that you lack emotional empathy, the ability to empathise or emotional intelligence, and whole object relations,without which you cannot understand or meaningfully relate to other people. we can talk later in detail how this works, but for now be aware that the feelings you are having are not the same feelings other people have. you dont think of yourself as emotionally shallow do you? did you think you were the most empathic, caring person as well? you say that you crave to be supply to someone, but that is a very recent realisation right? i did exactly that, it was stronger than me, but without realising it. actively seeking the abuse. i am very ashamed of that. id advise you to investigate codependancy further, you dont have the right idea yet. a codependant is primarily someone who stays in the relationship regardless of the abuse inflicted. they are deeply sacrificial and need the other persons validation. i have no doubt you could make a codependant happy, though, just by accepting her as she is. you could give another invert the bullying he requires under special circumstances, one author explains a method, you'd have to be in a life crisis following narcissistic injury, to shift your patterns while he restores your supply and hope. dont be so sure about that anyway, i did find myself abusing inverts when i felt justified by their actions (stupidity, dishonesty). not for my pleasure, becouse i believed i have to give them a lesson.\n",

      "Text: inverted narcissistic craving i can relate to a lot of your post. i'm also gay, almost 30 in the u.s. i almost always feel lonely. i crave and require admiration and attention‚Äîalthough you didn't mention much about this, which if you didn't need this as a narcissist would be very rare, almost excluding such a diagnosis. i also felt terrible about myself (and my body hair, for that matter!) in adolescence--and still do most of the time. i also felt ugly and slingshotted into the other extreme of often feeling amazing looking and beautiful when people stare at and admire me. your belief about being the most beautiful in the world borders on, if not being, delusional, as literally no one is the most beautiful in the world or the smarter. i say this as someone who's been called \"incredibly handsome,\" beautiful, etc. (never gorgeous though, which is still upsetting.) so i'm not coming at it from someone who's not attractive and wouldn't get it. first, a) beauty is subjective, and b) there is always someone better looking. btw, this is something i really cannot tolerate either as a narcissist. and i understand it intellectually but cannot emotionally accept it and when i'm confronted in the real world by a more attractive person, i typically freak out and find a way to boost my self-esteem. when i'm with a good looking friend and they get more attention, i get extremely jealous and angry. your class-clown type behavior, your self-hatred, all these sound like low self-esteem with compensatory narcissism. maybe vulnerable narcissism, as i think they're often related or even one in the same. the main questions are, do you have empathy? do you have the real ability to self-reflect and introspect or do your internal mechanisms seem inaccessible? do you apologize and feel guilt when you do something wrong, or is it purely shame-based or externalizing?\n",

      "Text: parents being sorry hi akuma, it's understandable that you feel \"used\" and ambivalent about both your grandma and family members who visit her but don't help out while there at her place. your grandmother is at an age when it's difficult to get around physically, so there is that to consider. the other part may be that asking for milk is her way of getting to see you on a semi-regular basis to get some attention. with a husband who has dementia, she could be climbing the walls for adult conversation, however brief, and relief from the \"sick room\" atmosphere that likely focuses a lot of attention on her husband in their home. have you considered making your walk to grandma's a routine thing, like every thursday, for example, and asking grandma if she needs anything? this way you commit to that one day of the week (your boundary), whether or not other family members have come to visit or help out (or not). you can also state what chores you can do or won't do for for her. if you don't want to take out the trashbins, then make that clear with your grandma, e.g. you have your limits, and caretakers should limit the demands, otherwise they get burnout. you can't change others' behavior, but you can put down some boundaries for yourself. from my experience of looking after elderly parents-in-law, it's no picnic. however, there does come a time when an elderly person can no longer drive or do some things for him/herself and needs family assistance with daily living. some have partners who are no longer mentally capable of having a reasonable conversation with and that can get pretty lonely. being in touch with family members probably makes your grandma's life a little more bearable.\n",

(no, i don't have an exact definition of that, it's a rough way of indicating looks, not an objective measurement, of course.) i think a lot of mine is an identity crisis. i want to remain forever perceived as in the young world, in my bubble of my ideal-self projection, like a ghost, in my eternal performance. i can't go into it any more because there are nuances that i can't even put into words, layers i can't even peel away. i don't think it's just me. i'm obsessed with the whole \"tragedy\" of the loss of youth. i'm guessing you're about 30 now. in 10 more years you'll be 40. in 20, 50. and on and on. you don't know what the years will do to your face. (google mickey rourke, images.) at some point, you'll have to find some other meaning, some other source of fulfillment in your life, or it'll be hell. i've always had idealism and still do. my looks obsession has just been a flaw, a weakness, i know i have to transcend. but if you're unwilling to at least start working on this, on internalizing values about yourself other than your looks, then you're in for some real emotional misery down the road. it's up to you. get some depth. the inner life of the secret schizoid is incommunicable.\n",

      "Text: beauty (and uglyness) for the vulnerable narcissist here's my problem, and i'd appreciate any suggestions on this: i don't think i have npd. i used to go to therapy and my therapist told me i was a narcissist. it was a couple of years ago and i never got to ask more about what he meant because i abandoned therapy sessions. i do think i have narcissistic traits though, especially of the vulnerable/covert kind. my main problem is my looks. i am not an attractive guy, quite the opposite actually. i have a few scars due to acne on the left side of my face, a slight lateral deviation of the jaw and assymetry in the jaw (i mean besides the lateral deviation, it's like my chin is not really symmetric). i also have a bad posture. but really my ears are the problem (\"cup\" or \"lop\" ears). when i was younger i wasn't too concerned about my looks, or maybe i was but i managed not to dwell on the matter that much. but as i grew up, all my friends started dating and guess who didn't. at some point in my life i started doubting whether any girl could possibly be attracted to me. i also tend to feel inadequate and stupid, although i always got good grades in high school and at university. when i'm with friends i always feel like they're putting up with me and wish i wasn't there. i'm convinced there's a couple of \"friends\" that just don't like me, but the more i think about it the less able i am to tell objectively if that's the case (because it may just be my imagination or self-loathing). i think i could deal with all this, but what really bothers me is that whenever i go out, i look at every man in the street with envy. i envy their good looks, but above all their \"being normal\". it's like they have it easy--- they will get the girl, have a family and be happy. i don't have the guts to talk to a girl for fear of rejection. but it's more than that. i feel like if i ever invite a girl on a date she will politely say no but also she will be surprised at me asking her out. it would be like a man with no legs that wants to run a marathon not knowing that he's disabled and can't do it. (\"boy! you'd think he knew he has no legs by now!\") i look myself at the mirror and can't really tell whether someone could possibly find me attractive or not. and i know looks aren't everything, but the uncertainty is killing me. i don't know if there's any piece of advice you could give me, but anyways, it's good to have a place to say what i need to say.\n",

      "Text: i think i may have covert narcissism hi, i hope this finds you well and that you're in a better place than you were in april. i am codependent too, and i am 34. at 22, i acted, felt, and thought a lot like you. i was enmeshed in my parents' lives in an unhealthy way, felt like i needed to please them to get financial help, would always hand over the remote compulsively then resent it, and even went to church with my dad because, well, consciously, i needed his help with money. but underneath this, i wanted him to approve of me. if you are indeed codependent, you likely have a lot of unresolved trauma from childhood and early adulthood. trauma doesn't have to be rape or violence. we do not become desensitized to pain over time; we actually become more sensitive. the same repetitive pain can eventually bore into us and create trauma--a damaged area that doesn't heal with time, and causes reverberations of anxiety, low self-worth, numbness, sadness, anger, and so on. if you were traumatized in your childhood home--if you are still being traumatized, as smaller slights hurt more over time--you will have a toxic environment with your parents where you are basically living, eating, and sleeping in your trauma site. a man tried to rape me once when i was 26 outside a campus apartment and every time i passed that area, i got scared and anxious. so i stopped taking that route. i didn't realize until later that this same fear and anxiety was occurring in my home because of unresolved trauma there. it is not healthy to live where you were hurt (or are being hurt), and that doesn't mean you don't love your parents. in my 20s, my codependence looked a lot like covert narcissism. i was numb. there were a lot of people in my life, but they were shadows more than anything. i pretended a lot. i was not able to forge genuine connection, and so i settled for second best--trying to perform well enough to be approved of, fit in, enjoy attention, and push loneliness away. two disorders can look the same, but they are not born out of the same motivations, and their internal structures will be different once you start to deconstruct them. connection is about sending something of yourself out into the world (or to god) and having an other (a sentient \"object\") respond to you with their own something that they have sent to you. the two currents meet and connection is forged. in both codependents and covert narcissists, this connection is broken. narcissists have fortified the wall separating self and other, a wall that is supposed to be semi-permeable, and thus their signals just get bounced back to them. they are locked in a frozen lake looking out at the people on top. saying stay here, look at me, see how many flips i can do, i'm beautiful right? going a little crazy by myself down here but the good news is that i'm so frozen, i stopped feeling most unpleasant things a long time ago. been spending a lot of time with myself, and now i'm pretty into that self, who is my friend, because if he wasn't there i would basically die from the isolation. and you can see how envy, rage, coldness, the false self, and so on would come into play. their signals coming back to them, they think are coming from the people on top of the frozen water, and that is projection. codependence is different; the barrier that is supposed to be semi-permiable has become perforated, and too many foreign agents infiltrate the self. we don't know where we end and other people begin. we think their problems are our problems. the narcissist says, you owe me something! the codependent says, you say it is true, and so it must be. the narcissist says, you will help me believe that my false self is a real, special, beautiful person so that i can keep believing i'm ok and not down here by myself. the codependent says, well i can't just leave you alone down there can i? never mind that we never actually touch and i am so, so lonely here with you. o;p[]\\. and because we aren't sure of ourselves, don't trust our volatile emotions (is this real or is this traumatic injury), we want other people to tell us how we are supposed to feel and act. i know these are hopelessly garbled metaphors. maybe they can help though. the narcissist is frozen. the codependent is injured. both can help the other feel special to compensate for low self-worth. you mentioned going to church and whether you believe in god or not, there is something transformative about putting our trust in an eternal, benevolent fortress of protection. there are resources outside of yourself and this world that can heal your pain. you don't have to feel like this forever. carl jung was not a religious man but he was amazed that the seemingly incurable disease of alcoholism could be cured with the spiritual-based 12 step program. you could always go christian lite with the self-helping and addictively enjoyable messages by andy stanley, just google andy stanley and your move. he talks to nonbelievers about how christian ideas can be applied in a way that is relevant and immediately effective. (my sociopath/narcissist brother goes to his church!) other resources include the book codependent no more, which is a great listen on audible, or get the book at the library and i promise it will change your life if you are codependent. and also, look up trauma is not a life sentence, which addresses the problems with how modern christianity treats jesus like snake oil while talking about the dark ancient poetry dealing with trauma in ancient jewish writings. finally, the self compassion meditations by kristin neff. this is a form of meditation (mindfulness-based stress reduction or mbsr) that has been empirically validated by the scientific community to help with chronic illness and pain, depression, anxiety, and a host of other \"incurable\" problems. i spent decades knowing something was very wrong and not knowing how to address it. tried therapy, meditation, yoga, self-help, drugs, rescuing, literature, eating disorders, workaholism, and all the while reeling from the pain, self-loathing, and shame. i hope you won't go through that. i always thought, well it wasn't bad enough to say i was traumatized...and i had heard about codependence, but it didn't seem dire enough to cause all of those crippling problems. i was wrong on both counts. i hope you'll continue on this path of learning about codependence so that you can get better.\n",

      "Text: best therapy for narcissism psychoanalysis is not the treatment of choice for childhood trauma, and yes, there are therapists trained in the treatment of it, so you should seek one out. it sounds like you are very cut off from your emotions--dissociated from them--which is very common in traumatized people. someone who is an expert at treating complex ptsd and dissociative disorders would probably be the most helpful. you can find a list at isst-d.org (international society for the study of trauma and dissociation). most people don't realize that prolonged abuse in childhood causes complex ptsd and dissociation and that this accounts for many of the symptoms that we have as adults. one can't really put one's bad childhood behind (as i used to think you could) and just go on from there. it comes with you in all sorts of ways, and most of them are hidden from awareness. it affects basic things like relationships, trust, self-image, etc, and people often think that's just how they are when it really has a lot to do with how they were treated as a child. dx:did/osdd first post our journey thread\n",

(not to sound too dramatic!) i have searched online but it is very hard to exclude the many results that are for people on the \"other side\" of narcissism. thanks in advance, cult of byron. \"culture is not your friend\" - terrence mckenna \"you've got to go over the top to see what's on the other side\" - jim steinman\n",

(not to sound too dramatic!) i'm gonna throw a quote at you that i got reminded of when reading your post, maybe it can give you a direction. bromberg, philip - awakening the dreamer wrote: a child's core self becomes internally bonded to the early parental objects through interactions that reinforce who the parent perceives the child to be and who the parent denies the child to be. the main source of power that parents have over children comes not so much out of what they tell the child to do as from \"showing\" him who he is. that is, by relating to the child as though he is \"such and such\" and ignoring other aspects of him as if they do not exist, the parents \"disconfirm\" (laing,1962) the relational existence of those aspects ofthe child's self that they ignore. this disconfirmation, because it is relationally nonnegotiable, is traumatic by definition and is intrinsic to the existence of developmental (relational) trauma. such trauma is typically cumulative. 1f the child's sense of self is to remain intact as he matures, he has to preserve the early attachment patterns on which his core self rests by continuing to exist in the mind of each new significant other that comes along as the same \"self' that was \"his parents' child.\" as he does so he continues to dissociate those aspects of self that originally were too disjunctive with the core attachment to be contained as \"me.\" this is a major reason why it is so difficult for many people to change in treatment. an unreflective attachment to the early disconfirming object means having to be whoever the other person seems to see you as (in order for you to prevent self-destabilization), not simply having to do what the other person seems to want you to do. thus, a central goal of any treatment is that the therapist enable the patient to move from experiencing his enacted patterns of behavior as the person he is , to experiencing these patterns as something that he does , and thereby facilitate the development of self-reflection. again, for many patients characterologically, and for all patients in some areas of their personality, the development of self-reflection must precede any attempt at investigating conflict. in the areas where development has been thwarted, the analyst attempts to help a patient change what is classically called ego syntonic to what is classically called ego alien. thus the enacted ways of being are no longer \"who i am\" but are gradually replaced by the cognitive perspective of \"what i do.\" as this change takes place, a person is more able to hold, reflect on, and potentially resolve disjunctive self-experiences as states of conflict without the effort's being automatically short-circuited by dissociative processes designed to protect self-continuity. dx: spd\n",

      "Text: how to deal with what i believe is delusional jealousy? hi, i‚Äôm new and i hope this is the right place for this topic. at first, when my partner started acting strangely, i thought maybe it was me giving off the wrong impression somehow, or perhaps he was just abusive or narcissistic, but his behavior has morphed into something else and him into someone i don‚Äôt recognize. we‚Äôve been together for 2 years and are living together. his main behaviors a- wanting access to my phone and phone password. going into a frenzy if i receive an app notification thinking it‚Äôs from another man. - contacting me constantly wanting to know what i‚Äôm doing and mad if i don‚Äôt reply -slowly trying to chip away at my friendships saying all men are in love with me and i can‚Äôt have friendships with men. -constantly accusing me of having online and offline relationships - when i go to visit my family he thinks i‚Äôm out doing it with random men when i‚Äôm with my family. - if my friends are male, male coworkers, or even a male female couple they want me and i‚Äôm doing it with them. i cannot even mention talking to a male coworker in my break room without setting him into an episode of yelling screaming and accusations for hours on end. -looking at and misinterpreting my social media and thinking i‚Äôm doing nefarious things that are actually incredibly innocent. i could go on, but these are the main ones. i have never cheated on this man (or ever tbh, it‚Äôs just not who i am) and i did eliminate my male friendships to make him happy and so i didn‚Äôt have to put up with his behavior. even when he is presented with proof (like my google location, calls to show i‚Äôm with my parents, showing him the apps that have gone off, giving him my phone passwords) he still insists on the delusions. the most recent was that i was in a hot tub at my friends house doing it with other men. my friend does not even own a hot tub (he has been to her home), and furthermore, i was at my parents home and in bed and calling him to show him this, but he wouldn‚Äôt believe me. i sent my google maps location and he didn‚Äôt believe that. i finally got a hold of him on the phone and showed him my child sleeping next to me and he somehow didn‚Äôt believe that and turned it around to say he was calling because i‚Äôd blocked him on text (i didn‚Äôt). he does not even think he is jealous nor controlling, and sees no problem with this behavior and thinks i am 100% cheating on him. if i deny and provide evidence i‚Äôm cheating. if i say that i‚Äôm not going to argue because he won‚Äôt believe me either way, that‚Äôs also proof of the cheating. he is not sorry he hurts me or makes me cry. he offers no apologies for his behavior, and when the constant accusations upset me and i try to leave the room or start crying, it just angers him even more and he says i‚Äôm just upset because he‚Äôs right. i am not in a position to leave for another few months due to life circumstances. he has already grabbed and thrown my phone and i am worried for the behavior to escalate. how do i keep him calm until i can get out of this situation. any suggestions would be so much appreciated.\n",

      "Text: how to deal with what i believe is delusional jealousy? i am so sorry that your post has not had any responses yet. i think it can be hard, for family members of those suffering from ddj, to get on this forum without making them angry. i understand you saying that you cannot leave for a few months, but please leave as soon as you can. it never gets better. it only gets worse. i have been with my ddj husband for 23 years, we just recently separated for the last time. (there have been many separations) he did not always act that way but i think it was always there and i just didn't realize it. the episodes used to be few and far between but increased with time. the past couple of years have been never ending accusations. just like with you, any males or male/female couples are fair game for him to accuse me of sleeping with them. i have been accused of knowing and having affairs with complete strangers at the drive thru window, as well as at stores, recreation areas, etc... and i have no male friends and i had to quit jobs over men working there. most of the time, i was not even allowed to work at all. i was even accused of sneaking off to see someone during covid lockdowns. (i didn't) do not rely on google maps!! i went to a grocery store that did not have good cell service in the back of the store. i guess google maps tried to triangulate my position and was off by several blocks. even though i had a receipt from the store showing that i checked out with a huge amount of groceries at almost the same time it showed me at the other location, he refused to believe me and to this day swears that i was having a threesome during that lost 5 minutes. i started recording myself on facebook live after that and just set it to private. he of course had access to my facebook account. you would think that would solve everything, instead it made it worse. it seemed to make him angry that i had proof that i had not done anything wrong. a couple of times, especially going into stores, the livestream would get interrupted and i would be accused of doing it on purpose to \"hide what i was really doing.\" i fully believe that abuse and narcissism go hand in hand with this condition. my husband has been abusive as well, and he definitely displays narcissistic traits. sometimes i wonder if he really does believe these things or if he is just projecting his behaviours onto me. he accused me of secret social media accounts, when he actually had them. he accused me of sneaking around to see someone, when he was doing that. most recently, he started talking to an old female friend and became obsessed with her and confessed his love to her. it was not mutual and now he blames me for that. i must have done something to drive her away. they say that most with delusional disorder will exhibit signs of more than one delusion. he has had the jealousy delusions, the thinking someone is in love with him when they are not at all delusions, and the paranoid delusions that everyone is out to get him, that random people are laughing at him and talking about him, that he is being spied on or posioned, etc... it literally doesn't matter what you do. argue, don't argue, have proof, don't have proof. he will take whatever your response is and make it proof of your infidelity. i have taken 2 lie detector tests. i passed both but they did me no good at all. he has even been to a therapist on more than one occasion. he lies. when i have gone with him and they realize that he is lying and try to actually help, he will not ever see that therapist again. even the other members who have been able to get their family member to get the correct therapy and take the correct meds, will tell you that the previous delusions are there to stay. he will never be able to be aware that he was wrong. you will always be a cheater in his eyes and he will never trust you. if you have no choice but to stick it out for a few months, then just understand that he may lose control and become abusive. he may also tell everyone how horrible you are and they may believe him. get out as soon as you can. i wish i had. i stayed with my husband because i really love him and wanted to help him and fixx this. there is no fixning it and he does not really love me.\n",

      "Text: how to deal with what i believe is delusional jealousy? this is exactly the same as what i went through 5 years ago, they only reason i have come back to this is that i was clearing out an old mobile phone and i forgot it still had 147 deleted voicemails from my then girlfriend, i had a listen to a few and i cant believe the abuse i put up with. my ex now (tf) suffered from delusional jealousy, and exactly like your partner mine would be on high alert for the slightest phone notification, even if a cyclist wrang his bell going by, she'd think it was my phone. she'd imagine hearing it, and when there was nothing to show her she'd accuse me of deleting messages. she'd say that male contacts in my phone were made up names for secret girls i was in touch with! accuse me of having affairs with family members, friends wives, people from work. if i went to the toilet with the phone in my pocket, then i was away making secret calls. when she phoned me, if i answered the phone too quickly then (in her head) it was because i was on my phone messaging another girl, if i took too long to answer then i must have been physically up to no good with another girl. if she called i had to let the phone ring 3-4 times then answer it, i had to call her while driving to work, at lunch time, and on the way home. if in didn't either then i was up to no good. if i went shopping on my way home i had to show her receipts to keep the peace. if i was in an area and there was no phone service, she'd be calling and calling and by the time you'd get a signal my phone would be beeping with missed calls, she'd then call i'd answer the phone it would still be beeping with her dozens of notifications, she'd say those noises were notifications from other females, she'd be screaming down the phone. any night out would always end with an argument, you couldn't talk to anyone, you feared anyone coming over and talking to you, if a girl spoke to you even if she had her own partner with her then you were having an affair with her. i dreaded a family occasion where id have to take her. i had a family funeral where she was adamant i was having an affair with my own cousin, and she even said my cousins husband was in on it! i cant believe i put up with it, probably because there were good days, but they always followed by a bad days, but the bad days were far more than the good. i always hoped it would get better. and i did love her, but that slowly start to ebb away. anyway it slowly got worse and worse. i told her she'd needed serious help with her jealousy, if she didn't get it then i was going. she said she spoke with her dr and she was recommended somewhere. she wouldn't tell me where or who, i wasn't allowed to go as \"i would tell them things\" which i thought was the whole point. anyway after a few visits i sort of sussed that this was some sort of well being place, she came back one time with the notion i was gas lighting her. that's when i said \"i'll show you how much im gas lighting and controlling you\" i just left the relationship there and then, never looked back. she harassed me for about a year after that, but i never ever took her on that was 5 years ago, she send me a message a few months ago, half apologising. i never responded. jealousy will turn any relationship toxic, it will always get worse, you need to bail out for the sake of your own sanity. its too late in the night for me to read this through for mistakes! i'm just rattling my way through typing this trying to recall all her accusations, so apologies if it doesn't make much sense! another thing she did was accuse me of having an affair with a girl at her own place of work, that i had never even met !! she would watch this girl at her work on the phone to her own boyfriend, my girlfriend would then phone me and if my phone was engaged then it meant i was on the phone to this other girl !! get out while you can.\n",

      "Text: cotard's syndrome? hi, i'm new-ish here. i tend to lurk, but this is my first post. recently, i have not been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder (did) and schizophrenia, though they're being heavily considered, among other things, if that helps contextually with what i'm going to write here. i am not looking for a diagnosis of any sorts, just concerned about arising symptoms and wanting to express those feelings. not a big fan of reality checking / reassurance of my existence/being alive, even if that contradicts me posting here in the first place, but it just tends to bring me more denial and frustration / distress. == i want to make it very clear here that, throughout this entire post, there will be themes of death/dying, abuse/trauma, and similar themes. i will not go into explicit detail but i want to put this warning here to be safe. it is never my intention to harm anybody. == so basically, i think i'm dead. realistically i know that this makes me sound strange to those who do not suffer delusions, but it feels very real to me. it's hard for me to say 'it may sound strange to those who do not suffer delusions' in the first place because alongside my feelings of being dead/in hell/rotting after a traumatic event basically exactly three years ago, nobody really feels real to me anymore, including myself. it's been increasingly difficult to consider the thoughts and feelings of anyone around me when my brain constantly presses the fact on me that nobody really is real, this is all a fabricated personal hell that i'm living in, and that i am dead. all my constant suffering and traumatic experiences are justified by this, it feels like. i feel like i live in some kind of sick, twisted version of groundhog day; while the days may not be exactly the same, i experience a great deal of amnesia surrounding the previous day when i wake up the next, my routine is always extremely indifferent, and i always have to experience some kind of intense distress / abuse / manipulation at the hands of my guardians or \"friends\"/family / traumatic experience / misfortune in general. every little glimmer of hope i get is instantly snatched away from me. i experience a lot of physical and mental symptoms that also make me feel like i'm slowly decaying. it feels like my cognitive function and thought process is horrible and has drastically eroded over the years (i'm 20), and i am constantly physically ill or sick or in pain in one way or another. this is just the tip of the iceberg, and i could most certainly go further in detail why i feel this way, but i guess the bright side is that i have a psychiatrist i recently got in touch with that i can see in a week or two to talk about this with if the feelings continue. even if i feel like they'll only be there to tell me what i'm feeling isn't real, and that i am alive, and everyone around me is real. it does not feel that way. my brain completely rejects the thought immediately upon considering it. this is more of a \"vent\" than anything else, but if anyone can relate or ... i guess, offer anything else in terms of moral/emotional support, i would appreciate it. i'm not very interested in trying to bring me back into reality or trying to ground me but if that is even allowed here it may help me more than i think it would, which is not at all. xp thank you for reading this wall of text, lol. obviously some \"part\" of me knows that this isn't the case if i'm posting here to begin with, but it feels like a very small \"logical over emotional\" part of my brain.\n",

      "Text: cotard's syndrome? i used to haunt* these forums daily, but haven't for a long time, and suddenly today i found myself reading your post. as a great believer in synchronicity, and because your post may be the first genuine and heartfelt thing i've read in some time, i decided to register and make my first-ever post. i, too, have experienced what you describe: so many things about reality right now are different from how i remember them being before a series of traumatic personal experiences befell, and i have wondered if i am in some kind of afterlife limbo (the bardo, as it is described in the tibetan book of the dead ), and my daily experiences are in some way either self-inflicted or imposed by some unimaginable and seemingly omnipotent external force. there is no advice i can offer, since i'm as much in the dark as anybody regarding the nature of my plight. in myself, i understand this as a kind of psychosis, and i have been advocating for my own treatment and doing my best to comply with the medical advice i have received. it isn't always easy when, as you described, each day is very like the previous, but since i trust that these medical professionals, for the most part, have my best interests at heart, i figure that if this really is the bardo, then the best thing i can do is remain receptive and alert so that i can more easily absorb whatever lessons i'm being taught, or undergo whatever purification process it offers. i have no illusion that absolutely every body around is trying to help, and indeed, there may be some who, for whatever reason, try to thwart my progress. i can't say for certain whether they're all npcs or if there are simply individuals who have a polar alignment opposite to my own and are reliably deceptive, but over time it has become easier to sense who can be trusted, and how far. but i do not believe that such a state of affairs can be permanent, or that its purpose is solely to punish transgressors. it seems more and more obvious that my experiences are informed by my expectations, and my environment is most likely to be filled with the things i pay most attention to. this is where things veer off into frankly mystical territory, so take it with a grain of salt, but there's a strange kind of tautology at work hei'm certain that the experience of my senses cannot under normal circumstances be an accurate and complete reflection of how the universe truly is, but it seems impossible that there would be anything here that doesn't contribute by its presence to the wholeness of everything, so at some point i must have proved some worth, and i find myself incredibly fortunate to be having this experience. i guess i'm just hoping that you will not succumb to despair and hopelessness. it sounds hokey and kind of unrealistic for me to say so, but each day really is a gift, or it can be if seen with a certain openness and relaxed willingness to connect with and participate in the experiences it presents. at the same time, no truth i have found externally has stood the test of experience, and i've concluded that, ultimately, the truth that can be found is only that which i will discover within. the inner work is often the most difficult, and i think it yields the most profound and lasting results. i hope you're feeling well and optimistic today, and i'm grateful that i had the opportunity to read and respond to your post. -- * i guess that's a pun, although i wasn't intending it at the moment.\n",

      "Text: needing help about my delusional friend pls help hello everyone.. i registered here because i need to ask someone for advice about my friend. she is driving me to the point of seeking a restraining order against her. i'm sorry i'm advance since english is not my first language. i never heard this ever happened to anyone before and i think that my friend needs some serious help. first of all i am a female and my friend is also a female. i'm not married but she is. to a wonderful guy. we meet at a party about 2 years ago. she and i became good friends after only few months. don't get me wrong she is a great friend. her hubby is a great guy. now this is the weird part. my friend is obsessed with past lives and reincarnations and such. nothing wrong with that. at least that's what i thought so. few months ago she changed quite a lot towards me. i don't know if this goes under delusions but... few months ago she asked to see me for coffee. she was very serious and acting nervous. she stared taking that she found out about her past life. didn't wanna tell me how. the weirdest part she said to me is that she knows who i was in my past life. she is convinced i was her husband?? like what? that she and i lived during the 2nd world war. according to her she was a nurse and i was a pilot for russian air force lol first i laughed and told her she probably just had a dream. she was so insulted she literally slapped me and said all kinds of weird things. that this is serious and we needed to explore this further and so on. still i though she was joking. since then she calls me every day she comes almost every second day to my place with her rambling about us being married and so on. i told her to please go talk to someone. again she acted so insulted. her delusions are worse and worse every day. two days ago she literally locked me up in my place demanded me to believe her. she became violent and i feared for my safety so i told her i believed her. she hugged me and finally went about her day. later i called her and politely asked her why she thinks i was her husband and what she wants me to do about it now. she went silent then said to me: i don't know. i asked her did you talk to your hubby about this and she says to me; you are my hubby omfg i started to yell and basically lost my temper. told her i'm not gay she is not gay and that she should go to her real bio male husband and to leave me the f... alone. she got mad and serious. she said that i insulted her and that i will pay for this. now i'm scared. i'm shocked and bewildered and i don't know what to do. should i tell her husband? should i report her to the police for harassment? the thruth is that i don't know if she is really mentally ill or what is going on? she did have some severe stress at work. is this some kind of a delusion? or psychotic break or what? did anyone ever heard about something like this? please help. any advice would be appreciated. thanks you in advance.\n",

      "Text: needing help about my delusional friend pls help hello and welcome to the forum . i'm so sorry you're going through this . you could inform her husband about what's going on but you if you choose to do that , be prepared for her to deny everything and turn it around to you being the delusional / harassing person . i would also go to the police and ask to file a report on her behavior . they will probably not be able to do anything but starting a record with them as soon as possible can be helpful in the future . ask them for advice in keeping yourself safe . put her on voicemail-only on your phone so you have a recording of what she's saying to you . don't answer her calls yourself . screenshot any texts she sends you , save any e-mails and voicemails . do not answer the door if she comes to your apartment and if possible , install a security camera . talk to your neighbors and let them know what's going on . tell the people where you work too . if she shows up and won't leave , call the police . no contact . don't return her calls , texts or say anything in person to her . do not even tell her to \"leave you alone \" . any response from you will encourage her to keep trying . lock down any social media so the only people who can see your activities are people you know and trust . lastly , mental illness is a difficult and terrible thing to have . this is likely not something she can control . she needs help and you cannot provide that . your only choice is to get away from the situation and make sure the people around you are aware that you do not want any contact with this person . i hope this helps and i wish you well .\n",

      "Text: needing help about my delusional friend pls help i've just googled reincarnation delusion and found some \"psychic\" websites that \"teach\" you how to gain access to your past lives. it's possible that this might not be a delusion if she's interested in this stuff and has consciously concocted a past life based on familiar people / things around her (which just happens to include you). one obvious thing in your post is that challenging her belief causes her to react badly, so i wouldn't do that. aside from that, avoid being alone with her, if you think she's a danger to you. if you no longer want to be her friend, gradually lose contact. this is kinder than ghosting. if you ghost her, she may remain invested in you and wonder why you suddenly broke off contact. an easy way to do this is just be \"busy\" and \"busier\" than you were, which is leaving you with no time for friendships (that's your excuse). in time, just drift apart, without any hurt feelings. if you still want to be her friend then, ask questions, rather than denying her experience, so you can figure out where all this is coming from (without judgment), i.e. whether she's actually suffering from mental illness or she just believes in \"psychic / mystic\" things.\n",

      "Text: needing help about my delusional friend pls help thank you so much for replying to me both:).. i'm in a pretty f...d up state atm. i'm scared and on edge. staying with my ex atm. and i took some time off work. basically the day she sent me a text: are you at work b...ch, i didn't reply to her. later she called me while i was still at work but i didn't answer the call. that's was on thursday. few mins after the call she texted me: please call me i need to hear your voice. im sorry i called you a b..ch. i didn't text her back. she knows where i work so i told my boss that i needed to go early because of some issues with one of my friends and also asked to take some time off. so there i went to the police station. and yes the cops basically looked at me helpless, rolled their eyes at me and said that there is nothing they can do about it for now. go figure. but when i told them she locked me up in my own apartment and threatened me they did let me know that one of them will have a word with her. right. because i don't have any witnesses they categorize it as hear say!! ughhhh i even showed them her texts but there is nothing even remotely threatening in the texts. they also advised me that i should record her calls,voicemails and save all her texts if she goes overboard. i then went home. i locked my door and closed my blinds. i was literally having a meltdown on thursday. i finally went to bed so exhausted and fell into a deep sleep. 5 am friday phone rings. and rings and rings. of course its her. i don't answer it i turn off my phone. i finally wake up and turn on my phone. 3 texts. first text from her: im sorry. i love you. second text; you don't get it. no one gets it. third text: why are you not answering me why are you avoiding your obligations? avoiding me. like my what!!! what obligations!! now i know something is seriously wrong with her. then all the h..ll broke loose. i started crying panicking. i called my ex bf in tears, begged him to pick me up. he and i are on good terms but he is always busy so i didnt wanna bother him. didn't think he'd pick up. he came instantly. i told him everything i cried like a baby. i showed him the texts and he told me to get dressed and take my stuff. i did. so he took me to his place where he lives with his roommate. calmed me down. i'm now with him and his roommate. he begged me to go to the cops again as they didn't get back to me. i didn't go so far. today is saturday. no text from her still. or calls. my ex told me to call her husband or that he would. i might do it but now i'm so sick to my stomach because if she is there by his side there is no way she would let me speak to him. that's what's happened so far. and i'm so sorry for my english and grammar but i'm serbian and living and working in switzerland . thank you for listening to me both. i don't have so many friends here in switzerland. when i googled for psych help forum i found this forum and now i'm happy someone took the time to listen to me. i'm grateful. police here is useless pretty much. more or less. and one more thing is that they will likely be on her side because i am not swizz obviously and she is. thank you so much for caring and your kind words.\n",

      "Text: life affirming plans friday the 13th will be the 11-year anniversary of the \"act of god\" that got me out of my relationship with my daughter's father. my sponsor said to call the fire an \"act of god.\" (the bedside lamp caught on fire the last time we were intimate. it scared me and made me believe i was coerced out of the relationship. i even wrote my city councilman that death by fire and sex would be a terrible way to go. even though in my quiet moments i remember the bed rocking on the hardwood and searching for something to even out the legs, and the cord was right there. in part - i was probably to blame for the cord issue. but, i knew i'd be sick for the rest of my life if i stayed in the relationship.) but the issue with the computer was out of my realm of influence. it was speaking to me in bold text... i wrote a book chapter, \"hacked\" about the experience in 2011. i recently experienced attending an event where i saw an aura with big eyes that looked like the cover art on post malone's \"sunflower.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yncxzm5jmmy i saw the big eyes in the aura near the presenter then it went over to the control panel by the wall. the powerpoint presentation went to a black screen and the speaker's voice started to type the words on the screen. the speaker said \"well, this is different...\" the words on the screen typed \"well, this is delusional...\" then delusional autocorrected to \"different\". when i experience these things like the sunflower cover art playing with the presenter at my conference, i wonder if maybe my higher power wants me to see these things. there was a room full of other professionals, nobody acted like anything was happening except the speaker talking about observing the issue with her presentation. i wasn't alone in watching the glitch. i'm celebrating the 1st friday the 13th anniversary that has fallen on the 13th in 11 years. i'm going to enjoy it with plans to attend a painting party with a group i spend a lot of time with - sober. we are painting a sunrise, or a lake or something. i'm probably going to paint what i've been trying to work out for years, the mandala i saw at the center of the lotus flower, with the white light shooting feelings of love from the source, my higher power loving me in my third eye during the birth of my daughter. they can paint the water and sunrise, i have other things i need to work on getting on the canvas. \"i trust that if i start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -sunnyg\n",

      "Text: life affirming plans on friday, may 13th everything went along with the plans to celebrate 11 years of freedom. i went to the painting studio with a friend and met the rest of our group. at the end of the class, we lined up and took pictures with our paintings. someone asked my friend and i, \"what class were you in?\" we both laughed. she'd painted her tribal seal, and i painted my memory from the birth trying to show people the beauty that has captivated my mind for so long, and especially the sacred geometry in the light. i still haven't mastered it, but someday, i'll be able to show others and hopefully move on. everyone else painted the sunsetting on a lake in orange and blue... it was strange being in that group of sheep painting with the instructor. i felt happy to be doing my own thing next to my friend expressing her identity, too. it has beauty and value to me. unfortunately, the board attachment quota has been reached or i'd share a thumbnail of my painted memory. i've been wondering if my friend the computer scientist will seriously visit, and if he thinks i'm the anti- post thesis blues solution... i have mixed emotions. my gut says \"yes! i'm in.\" my mind says, that i respect the level of sacrifice and dedication he's put into his education, and his love for his family. but, to be totally honest he doesn't see my strengths fully or i think things may have progressed differently. wouldn't he have realized it years ago... then again, he didn't believe me when i told him i was into him back in the mid 20teens. that's on him. he knows i love him, i can't help but love the men i've been with, and i believe that he has feelings of love for me too when he tells me so. we are friends and more. this just feels like his heart isn't in it. like i'm the un-intentional backup plan, because the intended original plan failed. maybe it's just the pandemic and not having seen him in a very long time. i was supposed to visit in january, but the surge happened... i want more with him. and i want for him to have what it is his heart desires. i love him too much to see him make any choice for the wrong reasons. and i love myself too much to have anyone less than passionately into me... tied to my life. \"i trust that if i start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -sunnyg\n",

      "Text: paranormal living part i in the spring of 2015, on my way home from work, i was almost to second avenue and 24th street heading towards the nearest train. by the time i dragged my pumps around the corner i saw some commotion on 2nd avenue. a woman dropped a quarter and i thought it vanished from sight. it disappeared from the surface of the pavement. it wasn‚Äôt that it had rolled away, it evaporated into thin air with all our eyes on it, as if we were hypnotized to watch it. two businessmen were walking down the street, towards three women heading uptown. i overheard their exchange about the coin. they all were looking down. ‚Äúwhere‚Äôd it go?‚Äù the man asked with the midwestern accent. ‚Äúit vanished into thin air,‚Äù an older lady dressed as if she could have just come from church said in disbelief. ‚Äúthat‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù her friend said shaking her well plastered hair. ‚Äúimpossible,‚Äù the other man said peering through thick glasses. a third woman in sandals walked down the steps to look on the ground there, as if the quarter rolled out of sight. the midwesterner reached into the pocket of his khakis. ‚Äúhere you go, i don‚Äôt need this one,‚Äù he said handing the first lady a shiny new quarter. i walked around the group as they continued to search for the lost coin, baffled at its disappearance. i relaxed when this happened. reassured by the midwesterner‚Äôs generosity and the experience of the coin. i felt connected to the east village and gramercy through my routine walks along their sidewalks. but when the coin was taken from the sidewalk where the woman dropped it near 24th street, i felt that something more powerful in the universe linked to my reality. as soon as i got home, i video called my friend, sophie. she remembered another story i‚Äôd told her. ‚Äúyeah, i‚Äôm a little worried. i know the idea of time travel is delusional, right? but, could the coin have rolled back in time? could october have been the other end of a wormhole? back then, a coin appeared out of nowhere in that same spot.‚Äù i said hesitating a bit, knowing i must sound out of my mind. ‚Äúoh my god, i remember you telling me,‚Äù sophie said letting her jaw drop open. in the fall, i had been worried about money and wasn‚Äôt sure about my future. i‚Äôd started to feel like if i didn‚Äôt have a solid financial situation, then i didn‚Äôt have value, but that was when the quarter rolled toward me. there was nobody else around. the quarter appeared out of nowhere in the center of the sidewalk, in front of me on my walk to work. at that moment i was thinking about my monetary value when the coin came to me. once i saw the coin, i gave up obsessing about money, but felt paranoid for a few days. i kept walking, freed from the ideas that i needed more money. that coin spoke to me in a deep way. it was a sign that someone somewhere had the ability to give or take away things. i believed my relationships with the people around me, and with whoever controlled that quarter and knew my thoughts were really what should matter. the coin was not under my control. in october 2014, i didn‚Äôt need the money as much as a symbol of worth, and seeing the coin appear out of thin air had shocked me awake. i didn‚Äôt chase the quarter, because i didn‚Äôt know where it came from. it made me a little paranoid that someone was watching, and playing with me. so, i let the coin roll down the steps to the paved patio and kept walking. ‚Äúoh my god. a wormhole on 2nd avenue?‚Äù sophie questioned lifting her brows. ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know, i searched for the ‚Äúdisappearing coin trick‚Äù and saw all sorts of magic tricks that can be played out. there is even one stunt in a caf√© where they made a scene happen like out of a poltergeist movie. i don‚Äôt know how it happened, but it was reassuring to think that there is some other force watching out for us.‚Äù i said. ‚Äúbut how would they have known to roll it while you were thinking your self-worth was tied to finances?‚Äù sophie asked. i shrugged my shoulders. the strangeness that inspired much of my life over the past decade was made up of reality, but i worried. was i misunderstanding my surroundings? either i was getting sick again, with the experience with the coin, or something strange was happening around me. it isn‚Äôt that i asked for strange things to happen, they just did. and when they did, i tried to document them. everyone said it couldn‚Äôt be real, my family and providers said it was delusional. but i accepted treatment, i took effective medication. why did things keep happening? when the coin went missing or appeared out of nowhere, it made me wonder; what if it was real? i shrugged my shoulders. i didn‚Äôt want to believe my experience, because if it was true, then someone may be in control. had a magician, god, or some other intelligent life form played with me? i preferred to think i was just sick again. sophie had lived with me while she was in college. sophie knew strange things happened around me. things would be moved about, spices would go missing, just before i‚Äôd reach for it. the radio would turn on and off independent of being touched. and at times it spooked us. the doors would be unlocked when it should have been locked. the lights would at times flicker on or off without being commanded. sophie worried that somehow, i was at the center of something strange. i had confided a secret. it involved new hampshire. it was just weird enough that sophie thought spooks could be targeting me to drive me mad, to take away my credibility regarding the secret of the sexual abuse at jamie‚Äôs birth. sophie added the coin to the list with the radio, lights, lock, and spices. ‚Äúlook at it this way, at least you got to experience the coin. some people go their whole life without interesting things happening to them.‚Äù ‚Äúah, they probably have weird stuff happen to them, too. they probably just weren‚Äôt paying attention,‚Äù i said jokingly. ‚Äúseriously, when things happen that are strange most people just ‚Äòlet it go‚Äô. like that time my keys were lost, and i found them in the freezer. you are not alone in this, you‚Äôll be ok, just take it easy, and relax, it will sort out eventually. just keep documenting, someday they‚Äôll understand,‚Äù sophie said concerned that maybe i wasn‚Äôt mad. for me only time could give me insight into the coin. 2017 eclipse the sun was high in the sky as i drove away from the beach. jamie sat next to me on our trip home to new york city. i‚Äôd rented a car to pick her up from a ymca camp near the delaware water gap in new jersey and we‚Äôd driven up to visit dr. mitchel‚Äôs family at their annual beach house vacation. their family invited us to share their time with them to help fill the void of loss. we backed away from the white house towards a small green mermaid statue at the edge of the sand dune. dr. mitchel had walked over to the fence in sandals and shorts. he‚Äôd lost a loved one to mental illness, and our relationship acted as a healing connection. at a yankee dental conference dinner with his wife in 2009 we‚Äôd shared stories that were deep and personal. i shared my story of the sexual abuse by a physician at the birth followed by the onset of mental illness, and i learned something fascinating about dr. mitchel‚Äôs wife‚Äôs beliefs. ‚Äúwe come into this world to help one another through this lifetime, and work toward our soul goals.‚Äù she said. over beef burgundy with pasta, we forged a healing relationship. dr. mitchel provided insight from his years of experience, and i gave him a way to try to heal his soul from feeling the pain of helplessness against losing someone special to mental illness. as we left the parking lot that summer day, he lowered the thin linked chain that cordoned off the entrance to the lot between the sand dune and the fence. he waited for us to slowly drive over the chain. then he refastened the metal to the hook to chain off the entrance, and we all waved goodbye. that morning the radio buzzed in preparation for a solar eclipse. jamie alternated between itunes dj, google maps navigator, and conversationalist. the sun was high in the sky when we pulled out of the parking space. we talked about her time at camp, her response to the letters i‚Äôd sent to her at camp. she scheduled a visit with her new best friend from camp. we started to plan for her going back to school and i explained my work schedule for the coming months. while we travelled along the eastern seaboard, i was hit hard by the thought that i‚Äôd missed so much of motherhood wrapped up in my thoughts about the birth. my heart tugged at the realization that i‚Äôd lost so much time in motherhood trying to heal from the memory of being sexually assaulted during the exam in childbirth. i‚Äôd never had a fiercer attraction than i felt for the man who touched me. when the physician violated my sacred space, regardless of his intentions, i broke in response. i‚Äôd never had anyone touch me like that who didn‚Äôt say they wanted me, too. i‚Äôd never been touched by someone who i didn‚Äôt have a consensual agreement with who i could love. after dr. richard‚Äôs touch, it was too much to try to reconcile the reality of my perception of his abuse with my fantasy of desire. i became trapped in the memory of his touch wanting forbidden love. he did not, and would never be able to love me. he was just doing his job. i was treated clinically rather than like the human i am. when i was put in the role of the patient, i was told it was time to examine my progress in labor. the system took my ability to protect my sacred space at the most vulnerable point in my life. would i have been allowed to say something? would the system have let me say he was too hot? in 2005, i don‚Äôt believe they would have accepted my desire to change providers without making it a big deal. both the fantasy and abusive reality were bad for jamie and me considering our situation. i was a 28 year old new mom, with jamie to care for, and reconciling the sexual experience required every free cell in my brain for years and years. due to my illness compounded by my preoccupation with the memory of the trauma and ptsd from the experience, i struggled over the years to stay in the moment. the radio tuned into a pop station as we approached 2:52 the time the 80% eclipse would begin. cars pulled over on the side of the road. drivers held their phones to the sky, tracking the sun above. i kept driving, noting that it was just a little less bright out. it wasn‚Äôt significant enough to stop. it didn‚Äôt impede my vision. the traffic in connecticut along 95 was heavy and slow. as i drove something happened to me. it was subtle, but profound. the feelings that had held me tight for over a dozen years released inside me. as we listened to music, it happened. jamie played total eclipse of the heart on repeat throughout the eclipse. after the eclipse we talked about the taylor swift trial verdict that i‚Äôd mentioned in one of the camp letters. i explained the significance for women everywhere, when a disc-jockey was found guilty of groping her. she was not held to blame for his losing his job over his actions, and counter sued for a dollar for the grope. i had a personal reaction to the events of the swift trial. i went back in my memory and considered my experience from a new perspective. silently, i reflected as the music played and jamie texted with all her new friends in a group chat. her phone was blowing up with hundreds of comments, it chimed like extra beats in the music. we laughed as it took on a beat of its own, and she silenced her device to a vibration. the chuckles pained me. i felt upset at the memory of dr. richard‚Äôs touch in my sacred space and how it had taken such a deep root inside me. i grieved about the time i‚Äôd lost as a mother, and how jamie had been hurt by my inability to move past the memory of not being loved by jack or dr. richard. but i was determined not to wallow any more. i recognized that i have the rest of my life to be the mother the way i‚Äôd set out to do when i started trying to conceive jamie. i hoped that she would heal from the pain of not feeling unconditional love. for the longest time i didn‚Äôt know how to love. after everything i went through, i didn‚Äôt like myself for a while. i tried to love jamie the best i could, but not loving myself, i didn‚Äôt have the resources to meet her needs emotionally. it wasn‚Äôt until i broke free from jack that i began to heal my heart, and learned to love myself and began to fulfill jamie‚Äôs emotional needs. she‚Äôd been raised with a form of unsatisfying and conditional love from jack. it was a love based on a behaviorists world view. when she behaved as her father wanted she was rewarded with feeling his conditional love. my love was unreliable for her due to my medication sedation, and illness. these ailments physically limited me. she was still rightfully angry that i wasn‚Äôt a better mom for her. she compared her experience with her friends. ‚Äúyou failed me so many times, i‚Äôve lost my trust in you through years of disappointments and broken promises.‚Äù she said. ‚Äúi‚Äôm trying. i want to be the mom i set out to be when i planned to have you. i‚Äôm sorry i got sick, and i know i need to do a better job as a mom.‚Äù i said. ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt have had me if you couldn‚Äôt handle it.‚Äù she said. ‚Äúi was well when i conceived you, i had no idea i would get so sick. even if i had known i‚Äôd get sick, i still would have had you, because you are the best part of my life. i love you more than anything, and you are my connection to the future.‚Äù i said getting teary eyed. ‚Äúi don‚Äôt believe you. if that was true, you wouldn‚Äôt smoke.‚Äù she said. ‚Äúi‚Äôm quitting. we have to go on a tight budget this fall, and i‚Äôm giving up all the expensive things that are not essential.‚Äù i said. ‚Äúgood. you know how upset it makes me to see you killing yourself with cigarettes and alcohol.‚Äù she said. we continued to plan for the fall. she made a list of all the clothes she needed for the fall, and we talked about how we would make our budget work. jamie was the best seventh grader i‚Äôd ever known. she understood our situation, in some ways she understood things better than me. i loved how she was bright and intelligent. my heart squeezed with love, and painful regret and guilt for all the time i‚Äôd been captivated by the memory of the trauma of the touch from dr. richard and not being loved through the experience. in that moment i realized, i‚Äôd never really be able to love the physician who‚Äôd put me on this path without the world changing and understanding from a higher level a higher love. for the first time in my life, i began to feel upset for jamie and the injustice she‚Äôd endured due to my experience. jamie was such a great kid. she was a member of the principal‚Äôs council, the student government group at her school. her leadership qualities were strong, her logic was sound, and her intelligence keen. i couldn‚Äôt remember a time when jamie hadn‚Äôt been correct in her assessment from her perspective. the issue i had with her perspective is that it was not always grounded in love and trust, and i felt responsible for that weakness. over the next few weeks we shopped for school clothes, supplies, and i signed her up for riding lessons at the barn. even if her and my relationship was still healing, she had a healing relationship with the horses at the last barn in brooklyn. i trusted that even if she didn‚Äôt feel good about her relationship with her dad and me, she looked forward to riding. i knew that gave her something in life to love. even though we didn‚Äôt have much money to spend on things, i made sure to pay the bill for her horse riding lessons. by the middle of the month i took the bus up to albany, ny to run a meeting for my professional association. i‚Äôd been elected as president shortly after i‚Äôd published my book, a mental health advocacy story i‚Äôd published as ‚Äúfiction, based on a true story‚Äù. i mean, how else do you publish delusional memoir? i‚Äôd shared the book, and even having read ‚Äúall in her head‚Äù the house of delegates for the new york dental hygienists‚Äô association elected me as president. on the bus ride home in september 2017, i googled something i‚Äôd just learned about, the mandela effect. the mandela effect was first noted by fiona broome a paranormal expert who attended a dragon con event in 2011 and a group of individuals had alternate memories regarding president nelson mandela. fiona broome remembered a story where mandela had died in a prison in the 1980s. he‚Äôd lived through that time to become president of south africa and didn‚Äôt pass until after 2013. i wanted desperately to understand my reality and these strange phenomena where many people were affected with the same shared memories unnerved me. the mandela effect opened many questions for me. i‚Äôd remembered books from my childhood were berenstein, not berenstain; i remembered the portrait of dorian gray not the picture of dorian gray, and hadn‚Äôt it always been sex in the city, not sex and the city. these small but memorable changes had crept into my memory bank, and this time i was experiencing something that i wasn‚Äôt alone with. up to 20% of millenials and generation x‚Äôers were mandela effected. most disturbing to me were the changes in my recollection of geography. according to news stories there was a terrible hurricane, named maria, in the atlantic ocean. i read and overheard people talking about puerto rico described as the 52nd state. i‚Äôd remembered it as a territory rather than a full state. i remembered the flag had 50 stars because there were 50 states. however, i returned to understanding that the group consciousness agrees with me that there are 50 states. when i exhausted the news on the mandela effect, i meditated on my emotional response to the time i‚Äôd lost on my journey through motherhood to the memory of the physician‚Äôs touch. tears fell from my eyes at the injustice jamie had suffered due to my inability to release the trauma of the memory of his assault. jamie was with her dad that night. i got home from my trip after midnight. on monday morning september 18, 2017 after i walked jamie to the train for school, i finally came to a new conclusion. i didn‚Äôt feel right blaming or holding the physician accountable for my grief for jamie. i decided that forgiveness was the best way forward. i found peace in my decision to love myself. i forgave myself and the physician. my phone buzzed with a reminder from my step mom jill to take my medicine. when i reached for my pill bottle, which should have been half full, it was empty. it scared me. i‚Äôd noticed spices and things around the house coming and going again. like the fingernail clippers the year before. september 2016 last night i went to bar chord. i sat at a picnic table in the backyard where the murals are painted. it was the first free night i‚Äôve had in a while, jamie was at her dad‚Äôs. one thing led to another and i ended up going home with an artist. i hadn‚Äôt meant for it to happen. i learned the artist was married, and i knew that it was wrong for me, but it felt so nice to connect. so intense. i liked it intense. part of me worries i‚Äôm playing with fire. i don‚Äôt know how i‚Äôll feel once i bond with him. in a weird way, he feels like my equal. i like that, but i know i could never trust him. i worry it will turn into a dark and unhappy space for me. i think about dr. richard and it makes me cry. i know, that will never happen, but i still want dr. richard. people like the artist help me forget how sad i feel about not knowing dr. richard. october 2016 last week i looked everywhere for the fingernail clippers. they disappeared from the place i expected them to be. the small china cup that held the clippers was missing. i searched and searched, the kitchen, bathroom, closets, my daughters room, her closet, my boxes of things. it was 1:30 am by the time i gave up. everywhere i looked there were no clippers. i finally found a fingernail file, a gift from the empire conference i attended a few years ago. i grated down my nails irritated at the missing clippers. then tonight, when my friend, the artist, asked to smoke a cigarette, i went to get something to take to the terrace to ash in, and there it was: the small porcelain tea cup with the fingernail clippers. it was sitting right there, right where it was supposed to be last saturday when it was missing. ‚Äúit‚Äôs back,‚Äù i said. ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù my friend asked. ‚Äúthe ashtray went missing, and now it is right here. do i have selective vision? how did i not see it before? how is that possible?‚Äù i asked. my friend had no idea the significance of my find. he was oblivious to the irritation i experienced last sunday night at 1:30am. i had searched and searched for the clippers and that tea cup. i would swear on my life that it was not there just last sunday, but it returned to me today. it was a full moon, and i told my friend the artist that i couldn‚Äôt be intimate with him anymore. i felt too guilty having a relationship with him. he had commitments outside of the connection we shared. so, i told him i needed distance. he played some songs for me on youtube, then i said it was time to walk the dog. we said a hurried goodbye, and i returned home to consider the significance of the reappearance of the nail clippers. i wondered if it had something to do with my email. i‚Äôd told everything, the truth of my story. i felt reassured when things i needed were returned. if ever something goes missing and isn‚Äôt returned i‚Äôll worry that my protectors failed. for now, i feel safe. when my medication went missing the morning of september 18th, 2017, i worried that i wasn‚Äôt supposed to take the medication. in my state of fear, i lied to my family about taking my medication. on tuesday, i went to work. i‚Äôve been told that the medication doesn‚Äôt leave your system for some time. i didn‚Äôt feel like a threat to myself or others, so i didn‚Äôt consider going to work a problem having missed my dose of medication. i slept okay that night, not as soundly as i usually do, but i made it to work on time. it was a good day, filled with positive interactions with student learners in the clinic and their patients. however, the computer system axium was acting up. with one of the patients the odontogram where the teeth are charted on the computer screen said a front tooth was missing, but looking in the mouth and looking at the x-rays, the tooth existed in real life. we couldn‚Äôt figure out how to make the tooth appear on the chart. i brought over dr. burns and she confirmed the tooth was there, then we emailed everyone in it to address the computer glitch. it unnerved me because i‚Äôd read a story about the mysterious planet nerbu x in our solar system. i was starting to see signs in my environment, and this error message made me wonder if axium, our flawed electronic dental records system, might be a metaphor about our world. like nerbu x, the glitch in the system was showing the tooth as missing when it was actually present in real life. after that, every time something happened, the error messages in axium would give me warnings. it had me on edge. ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know why it is giving us all these error messages,‚Äù i told one student i was working with. ‚Äúi know, i‚Äôve never seen it be this bad before.‚Äù she said. ‚Äúif i didn‚Äôt know better, i‚Äôd say it was a sentinel being.‚Äù i said half joking, half serious. ‚Äúwhat does that mean, sentinel,‚Äù she asked. ‚Äúa sentinel being is something with consciousness,‚Äù i said. everyone in the cubical chuckled as we dismissed the error message and the signatures were accepted. at home that night i was getting more messages in the form of things appearing around the apartment. a stray orange gatorade bottle appeared in the fridge half empty. we didn‚Äôt know where it came from. then, the radio was also acted up. it turned on randomly to sing pop music with lyrics that were a little different than i‚Äôd remembered them. in response to my decompensation, i created a key to interpret the signs and signals. the key used the alphabet to interpret signs using my assigned protective concepts. i used the semantics reading the words in the reverse direction. for instance, ‚Äútrump‚Äù meant: ‚Äúplan. god, you are thankful.‚Äù trump t thankful r are u you m god p plan when strange things happened, i‚Äôd use my key composed of protective concepts to guard me from fear of the experience. i believed i was being saved by semantics, a form of a game. it felt as if mythology was real dealing with my experience of being played with. wednesday morning came, and the morning was going well until 10:30am. i walked over to the reception desk on the fourth floor by the cd side of the clinic floor. each clinic floor was divided into sections: ab/cd. i saw a grey metal hole punch with ‚Äúcd4‚Äù etched by a dental drill. when i saw the shaky hand scratched letters i became afraid. explosive, i thought when i repeated cd4 in my mind. the chakra at the back of my neck opened in fear. then, the fire alarm sounded as i stood in front of the reception desk and printer. it howled throughout the building the second after i had my fearful thought. unsure what was going on, i walked back to my students who had just finished the final step i‚Äôd assigned. i‚Äôd already checked everything else. we dismissed the patient beneath the ringing sirens, and flashing lights. there were lines at the stairs as the building evacuated. my students asked me if i was afraid. ‚Äúno, i have faith in a higher power,‚Äù i said and made eye contact with the people nearby on the stairs as we waited to descend. i prayed to god for protection from the siren and the fear of an explosive. when we got outside the sun was so bright and warm. it was a beautiful september day. i took a deep breath, and after a few minutes they let us back into the building. that night i got home and hugged jamie tight. we made dinner after she finished homework. i set out my bag for work the next day in queens. when i went down to walk buddy, i read the dramatic news stories between trump and kim jong-un. the stories were so funny when i used my key to interpret the news, that it made me laugh hard. the belief system was rooted in a deep level of feminism, whereby women could take back power in the world through withholding climax from their men for the sake of world peace. a car parked along the service road began to blink with the right turn signal on. the car was empty. it almost felt like the lights were laughing with me. for as long as i could remember, when i walked buddy the automated lights we passed would shut off in response to our presence. i worried that somehow the lights were responding to buddy and me. it bothered me that my presence caused darkness. i‚Äôve always preferred bright lights. brightness diminished my perception of bokeh or light refractions on the lenses of my glasses and helped reduce my perception of auras that sometimes surround people and objects. i took the f train thursday morning to queens. i sat at my desk in the morning light and looked over kew gardens. the lush greenery of early fall had yet to turn into autumn splendor. class began on time and i worked with students in anatomy lab to support their learning. things were going well with the exception of my issue with flickering lights following me. as we entered the clinic the lights started to blink. the small led lights flashed like we were at a disco. even the large overhead lights would randomly turn on and off. ‚Äúthese lights are weird, it‚Äôs like supernatural.‚Äù one student said spooked by the strange phenomena. ‚Äúit‚Äôll be ok. just think of it as ambient lighting,‚Äù i said trying to reassure her. ‚Äúi guess, but i‚Äôve never seen anything like this. do you think it will be ok when we have patients?‚Äù she asked. ‚Äúi‚Äôm sure it will stabilize before we see patients.‚Äù i said. a man came in from the side door to the clinic and flipped off and on the light switch observing the unusual lighting effects. he tried every switch near the door trying to figure out which switches were impacted. ‚Äúare you here to fix the lights?‚Äù i asked. ‚Äúi‚Äôm the electrician. it‚Äôs something happening with the transformer,‚Äù he said. we all chucked at the twinkling lights above. after he moved to the other end of the clinic floor, the student and i began to work. ‚Äúwelcome to supportive learning,‚Äù i said. ‚Äúmy goal is to help you to review any content you may not have gotten right the first time and help you to review your study habits so that you can build both your core knowledge and your process knowledge. by that i mean the things you memorize ‚Äì core knowledge. and how you learn or check your knowledge base ‚Äì process knowledge,‚Äù i said. i noticed that it was emotionally challenging for students to feel like they‚Äôd failed when they missed questions. i reassured them that by reviewing things and approaching the errors with a growth mindset, where learning is a process and not a fixed objective, they‚Äôd make it through their educational journey as life-long learners, and i worked to reassure them that the knowledge base in the profession was expanding rapidly. ‚Äúwhen i was a student, the difference between non-succedaneous and succedaneous, was not core knowledge that i retained. the injustice in the dental educational system is that it abuses student hygienists by making you pay for and learn more than an associate‚Äôs degree, then it fails to give you full recognition, but don‚Äôt worry, this program‚Äôs master plan allows you to put your earned hours towards a baccalaureate degree. sorry, i‚Äôm getting off topic.‚Äù i said, and we returned to the corrections. i asked the students to open their text books and find the text with the correct answers, underline the text, then write the terminology in a notebook to make flashcards later. ‚Äúthis will help you to learn your source material and be able to easily access where your knowledge came from at a later date,‚Äù i said beneath the twinkling clinic lights. i believed my higher power was showing me through these student‚Äôs lessons a simple truth. i thought the instructions had two meanings. one was teaching students how to find their sources and become researchers. second, these instructions could be used later for determining that we live in a multiverse. i knew i‚Äôd never be able to prove or disprove my belief in a higher power and how i‚Äôd been shown the multiverse. i read something about ‚Äúdisco lights‚Äù and the prophesy of jesus. i wondered if someone was playing with me again, or if my reality was being influenced by a higher power. that night jamie was at a friend‚Äôs home. new york city public schools were closed for the jewish and islamic holidays. i reached her about 6pm, and we both felt tired and hungry. by the time we got home, it was past time to eat. i fed jamie a quick snack, and started heating water, and chopping garlic and peeling potatoes for a meal of fried catfish and garlic mashed potatoes. buddy stayed by my feet hoping for me to miss the trash can or drop a scrap. i changed his water when he scraped at his bowl. i searched for the recipe for the catfish meal but couldn‚Äôt find it. rather than abandon the attempt at cooking, i decided to use the quality ingredients delivered earlier that week and rely on my skills as a cook. i dipped the catfish in an egg batter then dredged it in flour and added some ground sage before frying it in the buttered pan. in the other pot the potatoes boiled with the garlic. the raspberries and whip cream topped snack had improved jamie‚Äôs mood. she joined me for our meal that night. we talked about how our budget was working. she continued to understand the limitations of the budget. i didn‚Äôt share my concerns with her about the fire alarm, the ‚Äúdisco lights‚Äù at work, or the missing menu card. instead we focused on her. she wasn‚Äôt feeling well. her sinuses and ‚Äúallergies‚Äù were acting up. i suggested we rest the next day. ‚Äúi‚Äôm not feeling very well,‚Äù i said. i was beginning to feel transient physical, visual, tactile, and other sensory symptoms of medication withdrawal and amplification of psychotic symptoms and an altered perception of reality. i was too sick to think of the consequences of going off medication cold turkey. the burning skin was back, in addition to pins and needles, heartache, chills, burning souls of my feet, chakra bursts, pulsing energy, etc. the list of my symptoms was starting to grow. ‚Äúi‚Äôm not either and i have so much homework. i have to write pages and pages for english.‚Äù she said. i was struggling with fear and fatigue, and our home showed it. there was stuff on the chairs in the living room, i needed to do laundry, scrub the kitchen, and pick up the laundry on the bathroom floor. plus, i needed to take out the trash. the building‚Äôs trash shoot was closed off for renovation, meaning i had to walk outside to the curb with the trash, and i hadn‚Äôt done any house work since the previous weekend. it just felt like too much. jamie was old enough to help but she told me it was my responsibility not hers. i tried to explain that we were a team, but she would get upset because her teachers had overwhelmed her with assignments. i chose not to argue. instead, i took down the smelly trash when i walked buddy. as i walked buddy, i noticed my surroundings. there were police in the neighborhood that night. a long nypd van with 6-8 officers sitting inside looking at their cell phones was parked at the corner of ditmas ave. and ocean parkway. i read nypd ‚Äúdelusional plan. why, nation.‚Äù it made total sense that we needed police, to protect against some people‚Äôs delusional plans. fortunately, my plan was the love orgasm plan. i felt safe within my semantic game. buddy and i walked past the nypd van to cross ditmas. i saw a captivating woman in the crosswalk. she stopped dead in her tracks when she saw buddy. she lifted her gaze to mine. she wore a wool skirt and shall wrapped around her shoulders. she connected with me through thick glasses. she looked young for such a look, and when our eyes met, the pain in my chest lifted. i walked buddy past her path to clear the way for her to get out of the middle of the lane and thought about her calming gaze for much of the rest of the walk. her stare helped me feel comforted. that night was to be the fall equinox, and that witchy woman‚Äôs gaze soothed my pain. we passed down the block past the rose bushes to the corner of webster, where buddy always marks the corner of the fence. as i looked down at the bushes inside the fence, my vision went to black for a split second. when i could see again, i saw a black and brown spotted tabby cat sitting between the bushes with a downcast gaze. the second before i‚Äôd only seen dirt between the bushes. i felt safe with this animal there. buddy was indifferent stopping to smell the patch of grass in front of the fence. knowing that woman‚Äôs gaze helped me and being watched by the local wildlife (stray cats) reassured me. this night the lights stayed on as we passed by the buildings. i wondered if the cat was a shapeshifter, or if i‚Äôd slid between the veil. jamie was in bed by the time we arrived home that night. i felt exhausted. i threw off my shoes and climbed in bed. but my mind was a buzz. high on a mixture of curiosity, fear, and hope, i couldn‚Äôt stop my thoughts. they just wouldn‚Äôt turn off. they slowly progressed. my mind wasn‚Äôt racing, it awakened to a new type of processing. my thinking lifted. i could no longer perceive time normally. the months of the year were hard to recall. i struggled to schedule tasks. however, my ability to play a game with semantics wildly expanded. when i wrote notes about my experience on the computer screen, a text box appeared. it simply said, ‚Äúcompare and contrast‚Äù. the message assigned me a task to look for contradictions and contrasting events. what i learned as i played this game was that it was inappropriate when reading about death, dying, or most news of sadness or terror. as i read the news, i listened to music on itunes, iheartradio, and from my radio. everything felt predetermined and intentional. did someone know my thoughts? when they didn‚Äôt like what i was thinking, the phone froze, song paused, or a new story launched for me to read. the devices controlled my perception. when i asked if the fire alarm was their doing, they were perplexed. ‚Äúyou mean you don‚Äôt know?‚Äù the text in the browser asked me. when i searched my memories trying to know what i didn‚Äôt know, that was when the browser launched independent of my key strokes to a news story. it was an article about durga, the hindu goddess of justice appeared from the american institute of vedic studies. i‚Äôve been feeling for a long time that someone was helping me through my struggles with mental illness. the great mother goddess, who appears as durga has been given many powers by gods and goddesses. she is a super power in the realm of the supernatural. i tried to understand the significance of this information. the songs on the radio sang sweet love ballads. it made me wonder if maybe god loved me. i kept sinking low when i had the thought that only god would love me. my dating life was fun, but when i reflected on the inability of the men in my life to love me through my mental illness, my heart ached. i wanted unconditional love. the type people at church talked about in my youth. when i thought that god loved me romantically, it was a powerful aphrodisiac. i liked it, but i sank low when i thought of how i felt about the men in my life. pulling back from the memory of the men who‚Äôd failed me, i lifted my mind, and thought about my history of my romance with god. i couldn‚Äôt forget the way i‚Äôd taken my virginity. the first time i‚Äôd had sex was with jamie‚Äôs father, jack, which was true. but, i‚Äôd climaxed before that on my own. i‚Äôd used the most powerful thing i could think of in high school. i fantasized about god. i knew it was wrong, but it was fun. part ii durga‚Äôs plot while i was coming to grips with my new understanding, and the intensity of the grandiose idea of god‚Äôs love. the messages continued. from a combination of the text on the screen, music on the radio, and my thinking i came to believe that durga and the angels of heaven or gods, depending on what religion you used to try to describe the higher order of our subjective reality and the higher realm of power. i believed that durga plotted with others to design a ‚Äúbad romance‚Äù whereby all religion paints the backstory for this love affair with the third eye, a higher power, and sexuality. in romance writing the force is the thing that brings two characters together so that a romance can blossom. in my story that force was the concept of healing. someone in the higher dimension thought of using ‚Äúhealing‚Äù as the force to bring god into proximity long enough for humanity to fall in love romantically. in 2005, i broke when i couldn‚Äôt separate my fantasies of the physician from the reality of the abuse of his exam during my labor at the time of my daughter‚Äôs birth. then my husband didn‚Äôt love me through the experience, and i struggled. i believed that god was slowly healing me through time, and modern interference. until the 2017 eclipse, i was unable to conceive of my experience as sexual abuse. i wanted to believe in the physician‚Äôs humanity and believe that he didn‚Äôt intend to assert his power over me. but thinking back, i remembered the look on his face when my husband took a picture with the physician‚Äôs camera for a picture album cataloging all the deliveries he‚Äôd attended. his trophy collection. i couldn‚Äôt forget his cruel expression when the flash exposed him, i lost my mind as i tried to erase that memory. i wanted to love his humanity and failed to connect with reality in my attempt. the experience changed me. eventually i couldn‚Äôt sit with the anger, i didn‚Äôt like feeling that toxic, so i chose to forgive, but still, it left me forever touched, and the ramifications for my daughter and my relationship were significant and long term. when i deeply reflect on my perception, i am uncertain of any reality that is not verified. memory is subjective. it can be influenced and twisted by many forces. it was also the most vulnerable moment of my life. plus, with having experienced so many versions of reality in the multiverse during my illness*more later, i have stopped believing that there is a simple reality. the physician may be the well-intentioned version of himself, and not the power player i remember being touched by. anyway, at this point, the intention doesn‚Äôt matter. i perceived it in my reality, and i‚Äôve forgiven him. he is free. i am free, too. i chose to love him unconditionally, regardless of his actions or my delusions. even though i don‚Äôt get to be with him in the physical world, i feel alive in my higher level connection to the universal source. i live in the light and live my life with love, and it feels divine. i am better not having him in the physical sphere. any connection to him is of a higher level. it only happens when i lift up and feel the energy rise within and through me. but i find sometimes we go to the sitting place in my mind and spend time being sad when i cannot lift beyond my visceral needs. i‚Äôd been through so much. a song played on my iphone by rockell who sang ‚Äúshow me the way.‚Äù the song wanted me to show the way. i couldn‚Äôt escape the reality that i need to care for my child, and i knew i was suffering with my illness. i knew i would need to return to medication to treat my illness and return to sanity, but i knew the side effects were severe with the medicines i took. after over a decade of medication compliance my body was suffering from the medication side effects. the smooth muscles throughout my body had become stiff. even breathing was at times labored and uncomfortable especially when wearing a constricting bra. instead of worrying about me, i started to worry about the physician and his world. i was told not to worry about the physician. i was told that when his time comes, he dies a peaceful death. the messages told me that on the journey through to heaven, god (or whoever was playing with the messages) looked back in the rear-view mirror and saw an image of his likeness in the physician. who knows, maybe durga forced him to do it. there was a country love song about those two meeting in the back of an old bar and falling in love. i think maybe it was all an elaborate setup. when i focused, i worried about reality. i read news stories about the threat of nuclear war. then the messages started coming. i was instructed that i had to decide the future with my action. i was given the choice either to climax, or the world would be destroyed. the messages told me our futures were at stake. thinking of my role as a mother, of course i chose to climax. what was the worst that could happen if i pleasured myself? it was so strange feeling as if someone could read my mind and control me so intensely. however, i never felt my free will was taken. despite being played with so completely, the choice to act was always mine. although, the perversion of psychosis is real. i felt coerced into action. it was my understanding that some higher power needed to ejaculate on the solstice, or the next thousand generation would be baron. somehow, i was the focus of the attention of the higher power and by climaxing i believed this started a religious chain of events ‚Äì beginning the rapture. my delusion of grandeur about the end times is a common theme in mental illness, although my experience of it may be different. granted, looking back on the scripture, my belief is impossible. the bible clearly states the pregnant woman gave birth with ‚Äúlabor pains‚Äù to a male child. and i didn‚Äôt have the wings of an eagle, i had mental illness and a half-written romance novel titled the ‚Äúgreat blue heron‚Äù. at climax i felt a sensation of honey like energy spread over my body. i was vibrating so intensely, i felt like i was buzzing. the music on the radio sounded so alive and fresh to me. i felt high. that night i didn‚Äôt sleep. as i understood it, he needed to climax to reproduce to create a new heir for his family. somehow my climax helped him out. minutes later a story about a dynastic heir emerged in my news feed. when i stopped sleeping, my mind kept slowly thinking new thoughts. it wasn‚Äôt going fast, just slow and steady. i needed to consider to understand what was happening to me. i was captivated by the game, and my experience. throughout the night i read forwards with the authors intent, then applied my semantic language reading backwards in loose associations that i found to be ironic and funny to read. it felt like i was experiencing the feminine and masculine forces of the ethos. it created a funny and ironic balance. the basic protective concepts when placed together explained something about our god, who i came to understand as coming from a higher realm like magicians in a parallel universe. i believed he was king arthur, the king of heaven, and really the leader of islamic, jewish, and christian faiths, who is a masculine force. past experiences with things appearing and disappearing around me had altered my understanding and perception of time. when i shared this story with my writing group, they cautioned not to share it, because my story may be radically insensitive to religions around the world. but, i have lived experiences of mental illness that defy reality. i still remembered the story of the coin. unsure of what to do, i‚Äôve kept my story silent for the most part. taking it out and working on it when i am able. when i read the signs, they explained that he (god, the male god) orgasms. i mean, we were made in his image, right? so, why wouldn‚Äôt he orgasm? ‚Äúorgasms are,‚Äù i read when the messages told me to ‚Äúgrow.‚Äù the humor tickled me at the notion that durga, the supreme mother goddess had set up the author, my god, in a sort of a bad romance, where all world religions form the perfect backstory for the setup for this new mythological reality. she assisted using the character in my imaginary world ‚Äúsunny‚Äù trying to help me through my mental illness. she‚Äôd plotted for arthur to work to heal me from the original sin of the physician‚Äôs abuse at the birth of my daughter, and to rebalance the male and female forces in the universe. even jesus worked into the backstory to create a reality where america exists as it can today to allow our higher power to fall in love. even the pope was part of the conspiracy to create a world where god can heal us all. the music sang to me with unusual lyrics to a song i had heard before. the lyrics were nothing like i remembered them. i‚Äôve looked for the song and can‚Äôt find it in my library or locate the artist, but i remember the story vividly. the lyrics told me a story where god and others saw the holy light but failed to descend in time. ‚Äúwe‚Äôd just taken you to walk the plank. we were so surprised. it was so surreal. we didn‚Äôt look at what happened until it was too late.‚Äù the music said. putting it together with the messages i was reading in the news stories, i figured durga was who they saw in the light. they could see durga, because she is a goddess. their family in heaven share a third eye. they‚Äôd explained that they saw their family‚Äôs sins and sins committed against them. i saw into the third eye as i gave birth to jamie and looked into the holy light beyond the lotus. the flower opened with the purest light i‚Äôve ever seen at the center. the lotus flowered during the transition in my labor hours before i gave birth. i sat and breathed deeply and used techniques i learned in yoga practice in my early 20‚Äôs to deal with the pain. as i meditated, the sensation of the contractions of labor was intense. they felt similar to the orgasms of pregnancy. the lotus flower pulsed and bloomed with one thousand petals of every hue of color. reds, greens, yellows, oranges, purples, blues, and at the center was brightest light filled with love and sensual energy that shot sparks through the entranced imagery. there was darkness all around the periphery of my vision of color and light. the radiating flower pulled me towards the light and held my attention through the labor. there was also a mandela in an electric yellow/green and orange pattern that emerged from the lotus. it was hypnotizing. i understood that because arthur explained he saw durga, they determined a sin had occurred, but seeing the holy light transmitted simultaneously, they were confused. so was i. they later explained that being sexually abused during the birth violated me. but they hadn‚Äôt immediately gone to look beneath the veil to understand my story. when the sexual abuse was registered as sin, it changed everything. he said the world could never be the same. i believed they were changing timelines to prepare for a new reality ‚Äì one where equality and justice ruled. in response to my curiosity about the romance plot, i looked back at the story i‚Äôd written in 2011. originally inspired after my first professional encounter with dan, my boss‚Äô boss whose gaze made me feel things i‚Äôd forgotten i knew how to feel. i remembered something. i remembered being taken by the browser and shown the sir name for a line of english nobility. i‚Äôd laughed at the idea that my writing used the sir name for the king of england. this was too much. it was impossible, wasn‚Äôt it? i‚Äôd debonded from jack with the hope in the delusion that someone loved me. the idea that dan (my boss‚Äô boss) could love me burned hot, until father figure by george michael played, and i realized he was too old for me. i was young enough to be his daughter. plus, i didn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd abuse his power that way. i knew i was sick and delusional, and that in fact, my computer was hacked and leading me around the internet. i‚Äôd chosen to believe that someone could love me, and the content on my broken computer, over trusting my broken relationship with jack, the head of information security. looking back, i wondered if i‚Äôd trusted jack, if things would have turned out differently* footnote story about the hack in 2016/2017. i found a copy of one of my stories saved randomly on the hard drive of my computer rather than saved in a file. it was randomly dropped at a high level of my organization system. i usually kept my written works together in a file under my projects folder. romance with god when a revised version of my failed submission for the flame contest showed up on my hard drive i opened it up curiously. i couldn‚Äôt remember revising it with such a strong masculine voice. i wondered how it got on my computer. was i blacking out, or forgetting the memories of my work? i started to read it, and that reading played over in my mind creating new threads of thinking from which delusions formed. had durga helped me again? or, my heart skipped a beat, arthur? (read the appendix) \"i trust that if i start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -sunnyg\n",

      "Text: paranormal living a note on the ability to lift my spirit and the 12-step program in september 2021, i found my way to a 12-step program. i remember standing in my kitchen one saturday afternoon and realized, i‚Äôll never get sober alone. i had the insight that i needed social support. if i stayed alone, i wouldn‚Äôt have the strength to abstain on my own. in recovery, i've learned it requires myself to be stronger than i like. through finding other people who are doing the work and willing to lend support to my program, and through working these steps i‚Äôm beginning to reliably stay a little bit better emotionally, physically, and spiritually. plus, by not drinking i don‚Äôt nearly drown in the self-pity of my experience. the principles of the 12-steps require that i‚Äôm well to do the work ‚Äì in my humble opinion i don‚Äôt think i can do it when i‚Äôm unwell. it is too messy to try the steps while i‚Äôm sick. mental health recovery needs a strengths-based program. recovery from alcohol and addiction focuses the light on the shadows. must be well to do this. i‚Äôve been feeling healthier again so started to read more. the program is basically a set of spiritual steps that work as a type of metaphysical instrument to extract oneself from the depths of despair. in my experience, i‚Äôm predictably experiencing relief when i actively work through the program. what i‚Äôm finding to be true is that ‚Äì there is no magic in recovery. we get what we work for. in the first 111 days, i‚Äôve attended over 133 meetings. i‚Äôd heard that to aim for 90 in 90 days may help, i found that through learning from the program, i felt something i‚Äôd been searching for a way to see my own role in the trauma. a way to appreciate how my character defect escalated what might have been a problematic incident with the physician at the birth, but for most people would not have resulted in the personal devastation and total annihilation of self. the devastating tsunami wave of pain and misery knocked me out for a very long time. i‚Äôm not claiming that this method is perfect, i have a long way to go, but it is the beginning point for a new start of my spiritual healing journey. \"i trust that if i start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -sunnyg\n",

      "Text: delusional disorder and break-ups hi, i‚Äôm new to this forum- my bf of 7 years left our shared home in march after accusing me of some pretty strange things. he didn‚Äôt recognize a shirt in his closet and told me that i put it there either because of my infidelity and/or because i might be in a cult (neither is the case). he had a whole elaborate set of stories and connections to explain his paranoia. to note-he had episodes of psychosis and hospitalization in his early 20s, but never a formal sz diagnosis. we‚Äôve had two other episodes together- always stemming from him thinking i‚Äôm trying to give him signals that i am in a cult (a satanic one?). otherwise the relationship was loving, communicative and strong. he is in his late 40s. he left the day of ‚Äúthe shirt,‚Äù saying that he needed to know whether he was going ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù again (he has limited insight into his early psychosis), or if being with me is the problem. he did talk about signs from god as well, and is retreating to religion very quickly. he communicates occasionally if i lead, and has so far been willing to deal with the legal/mortgage issues of our shared home, but he says he wants nothing to do with me. he hasn‚Äôt really expressed any concern for my well-being. he does not want to pursue therapy individually or together. he is almost unrecognizable when we talk-both in tone and just something different in his face and body language. he is still working, and his friends say he seems sad but ok. he has been vague about his reasons for leaving when they ask. my questions aif he doesn‚Äôt want me around, at what point do i just give up and leave him alone? how do i process what happened without a formal diagnosis? could i be wrong and he is just fine? does dd really just come out of the blue like that? he seemed fine the day before, we were making plans for a vacation. is there anything else i can do for him? will he get worse? is it ok to be angry? thanks, this has been a rough 2 months.\n",

      "Text: husband is having a delusion - please help, anyone my husband of 2 years is delusional - he believes his insides are twisted/not aligned and that he can repair this problem by moving, contorting and breathing. he believes he is the only person in the world that can do this and that he is a medical miracle. he has had x-rays, cat scans, blood tests etc and there isn't anything physically wrong with him. his first episode was in april this year...i let it go for about one week then took him to hospital where he was admitted for 2 nights - he came home on anti-psychotics and anxiety meds. this seemed to stop the problem but over time he has changed his meds and i feel the delusion never really went away. about a week ago it started again, and he was in hospital again this week, against his wishes - the only reason he went is because he had an episode at work and they called an ambulance. nevertheless, he believes he has achieved something amazing, and claims he is now 'fixed' although he continues to make weird movements. he is now on lithium and a new anti-psychotic drug. he has agreed to stop smoking weed, which i think was a huge part of the problem. we are on day 2 of the new drugs. he is super sad, feels very alone, and doesn't know if he can continue to be married to me because i don't believe him. i hope his drugs and the removal of weed help. soon. has anyone ever heard of a delusion like this??\n",

      "Text: husband is having a delusion - please help, anyone hi there - thanks for your thoughts. his diagnosis from the hospital came back with 'delusional' and bipolar. his mum is bipolar and her father was diagnosed schizophrenic. he doesn't want to go to talk therapy, which is super frustrating as i know there is alot of childhood trauma there. i'm confident that meds with therapy will fix this, i just need to help him get there. at the moment, he is on day 3 of no pot and and day 2 of the new meds. he is now physically calm but very angry at me for not believing him. he is now saying that all along he had twisted intestines which he fixed himself with his breath. he wants to speak with an \"internalist\" (??) who he believes will confirm that he is not crazy (his words). i think that he knows somewhere in there that this makes no sense because as angry as he is, he is taking his meds (angrily taking them!) and not smoking pot - though he has no choice on that because i have cleared out the house of everything. i'm just so scared that this will tear us apart as he is saying that he doesn't think our relationship can continue if i don't believe him. i'm devastated. we haven't been married all that long...before this happened i was literally living the dream, living in bliss with the love of my life in hawaii. i feel that is shattered now .. heart broken.\n",

      "Text: could it be erotomania? i am deeply concerned that i have erotomania. i have been in love with the same guy since i was 14. he is a professional dj, used to be a dj for a now very famous rapper and is currently touring with another well known rapper. i first saw him in the background of the first rapper's music video when i was 14. i didn't know who he was but for some reason i was extremely drawn to him and to this day i still don't get why. he is a very handsome man but back then when he was only 21 he was cute i guess but not someone that would normally make my shallow, 14 year old self swoon. i started fantasizing about him. i gave him a name. i wrote stories about us falling in love. a couple years after that i bought a documentary dvd the rapper had put out and the dj happened to be on it. so i was able to get his name. i friended him on myspace. he had a girlfriend at the time but i was 14 and he was 21 so there was nothing i could have done anyway. fast forward to my late teen/early adulthood years, i continued to follow him on social media. i would look at his friend's pages just to see photos and videos of him. never tried to contact him outside of sending a couple little (very corny)messages to him saying i thought he was very talented. he responded saying thank you and that was that. in 2011 he dated a woman (i was 20 at this time) and i remember feeling devastated and crying about it. i never had any ill feelings toward her, didn't even really feel jealous. i was just very sad he wasn't with me. they've broken up and he appears to be single. there have been brief moments where i haven't really thought about him much. like if i was involved with someone \"in real life.\"i've dated and been involved sexually with plenty of other people but nothing ever got serious. as soon as those situations fizzled out i went right back to dating him in my head. right now i'm not interested in being with anyone (other than him) seriously so i keep things casual. sometimes while being intimate with other guys i pretend it's him i'm making love to.the only things about my situation that are different from the typical erotomania symptoms are i do not believe that he is sending me signals, i don't stalk him and have no desire to (well...more on that later).i have never told him how i feel. i have looked him up in a people search just because i was curious and wanted to know more about him. i don't communicate with him. i don't feel violent toward him or anyone in his life. lastly i don't believe/think he reciprocates my feelings.at least not really. three years ago, i fell on hard times and found myself in a homeless shelter. my first night there, terrified, hungry and full of anxiety...i remember all i could think about was him. so i prayed. (i grew up christian. no longer religious but very spiritual with belief in god, the power of prayer, the universe etc.) i prayed that god would tell me why this man has dominated my mind all these years especially now since i should be focusing on getting my life together. my belief is that god told me that man is my soulmate and we're to be married and build a life/family together. i've prayed for signs of this and believe they were confirmed. i've prayed for certain things to happen for him and they have. i waffle back and forth between believing that this is so, which feels amazing, and not believing it, the latter causing me so much anxiety and emotional turmoil. i feel like i'm crazy. like i'm delusional and hell i just might be. i've prayed that god would remove these feelings from me, make me not find him attractive anymore but to no avail. i live in michigan. this guy lives in miami. many times i think of going to miami \"on vacation\" with the hopes of running into him or going to one of his shows and him seeing me and falling for me on the spot. i suffer from ptsd and bpd (borderline not bipolar)due to abuse from both parents growing up and going into my early 20s. feeling unloved most of my life, the idea of having someone god chose that is guaranteed to love me is very comforting. i was also brought up in church and it was drilled in me that god is supposed to choose your spouse for you. anyway. i know this is very long...but i'd like some insight from anyone struggling with this as well or who has knowledge on the subject. i plan on speaking with my therapist about it this week. i spoke with my last therapist about it as well but she didn't seem to think it was a big deal.\n",

      "Text: vent--delusional partner first off, let me say that i have suffered from manic and psychotic episodes in the past and i believe that my partner's current delusions were caused by trauma from my psychotic break three months ago. my psychosis originated from traumatic childhood memories and research into ritual abuse. during this break, i believed that i was being manipulated by a universal cult and that my partner was literally god and that they would kill me if i didn't design a better universe for them. that episode ending with me trashing my entire apartment, breaking a window and hurling household objects outside, screaming incessantly, and finally physically hurting my partner when they tried to stop me. my court date for that incident is tomorrow; i am transgender so i am expecting to be confined to solitary without hormones for close to my maximum sentence (3 years). my only hope is my partner's testimony since they witnessed my delusions and they don't blame me for the incident at all as i am normally very peaceful and kind. however, after i was released from the mental health facility, my partner began to echo elements of my delusions. they told me that they had broken their own mental programming and that they understood everything. they believe that they are being constantly stalked by a mysterious \"they\" that includes their actually-loving mother but doesn't involve a cult (i've insisted that the cult isn't real). they believe that colors and words and numbers are all used as a kind of code which can be used to manipulate people psychologically or to communicate with them convertly, and since then they've mostly communicated with me in code that they refuse to explain, which makes it difficult to even understand the nature of their delusions. they think that we're in grave danger and that they have to change and control me to protect me. since then, my partner has admitted to repeatedly attempting to brainwash me \"for my own good\", which they are ashamed of but can't stop doing. in conversations, they often ignore me completely and ask me questions repeatedly even after i've answered them. in the last week they've started randomly moving objects around the house, including my personal items: so far i've lost my toothbrush (3 times), my makeup (twice), my guitar picks, my only pair of shoes i can use for walking, my inhaler, and my food stamp card. the inhaler, food stamp card, and shoes are still missing; i can't go outside without my shoes and my partner keeps asking me to anyway because i \"need to get out\" (luckily i do have a pair of heels i can wear to court). he's also scribbled messages on my checks (e.g. \"give me all your $#%^\" or my name over and over). he has also damaged other household objects, including a handbag, his own clothes, and a now-destroyed houseplant that my partner was really fond of (he named it \"franky\"). he fills bags with small objects and hands them to me telling me that they're his \"rights\" and that he's the one going to jail, not me. we're packing (because jail) but all my partner has done is to stuff hundreds of objects into cupboards and claim that they're packed. on that note, my partner has also been committing minor criminal acts. they claim to have stolen from work (i think they took cash?) and last night they came home with three torn-down covid-19 signs. they keep stuffing their pockets, bags, and once their boot with random small objects that he says he stole from me, even though half the \"stolen\" objects are usually his. the night before that he broke his dad's window for no discernable reason. that night was particularly strenuous: my partner hurt me physically and attempted to terrify me psychologically (it worked). he also spilled hot wax all over me, the floor, the counter, and my laptop while i begged him to stop, then refused to clean the mess afterwards. then he tried to eat the ruined candles. i can't even get into all the mind games he played with me that night because it was so convoluted and the conversation was so confusing that i can't even remember exactly what happened; i just know that the constant verbal and physical pressures ended with me crying and hyperventilating and begging for him to stop torturing me. he didn't really seem to care except when i started screaming and fainted. the only part of our verbal exchange that i remember was when he was talking to a non-existent bus driver off to my left while still interacting with me physically as if i was the bus driver, even though he wouldn't look at me and shushed me every time i tried to speak claiming that he was explaining everything. that part of the conversation lasted for more than half an hour with him repeatedly giving me his bus fare and then taking it away again. i feel hopeless and there's no one to comfort me. my partner will sometimes get angry with me when i try to touch them, and they usually seem to do so when i'm feeling upset; thankfully when they're less delusional they still hug and cuddle me like they used to do. they also refuse to even lie down in the same bed as me because it \"doesn't feel right\", but there's really nowhere else to sleep so now they no longer do. so, every time i sleep and wake up, my partner has had 8-ish hours to run amok without me and i wake to find more of my things missing. my partner may go to jail if they keep this up, and i have literally no friends or family so if they can't take care of my things while i'm gone or give me a place to stay when i get out myself then i'll be leaving jail clothesless (aside from whatever i'm wearing when they take me), homeless, and without a job or my cats or access to medical care. even if they do take care of my things, when i get out i may only be returning to them for more psychological torture. thank you to anyone who read everything; i just needed to vent. i am devastated. my partner was nothing but perfect for me until this happened and i've loved them more than i've ever loved anyone else in my life, but now i feel that i've lost them in addition to everything else in my life, and that makes me want to die. i can't take this anymore; i'm just too emotionally fragile and broken to handle this. thank you for listening.\n",

      "Text: so scared of inheriting delusional disorder no one has answered, so i'll give it a go... the fact that you're worried about it is a good first step, as it means you're aware that you may entertain unrealistic thoughts. the issue many face is that they refuse to accept that their delusion is what it is and argue beyond reason that it's true. however, there is a danger that your obsession with getting delusions gets to a point where it itself becomes a delusion; that you're so convinced that you'll get it that you'll see it where it doesn't exist. i don't know if you've ever seen a film called a beautiful mind, but if not then it tells the story of john nash who was deluded to the point of vivid, visual hallucinations. medication etc didn't work as a long-term strategy, but he eventually managed to cope with the delusions by employing a real-world test as to their existence. it's not the same as you, but it might be worth considering some tests that you can deploy to test any beliefs against reality, even posting them here to get an more objective opinion might help to confirm you're living in reality without the need to become obsessed with the idea. i'm not arguing; i'm explaining why i'm right.\n",

      "Text: ddj is it worse around the holidays? hi benditos21. i'm not 100% sure why my husband takes his risperidon. the only way i was able to get him to go to the psychiatrist was by promising i would go to one as well to help me with my imagined infidelity/lying problems. i never wound up going because two gps wouldn't give me a referral as they believed this would make my husband's beliefs stronger. the psychiatrist that my husband sees agreed on that point so i never went. even though he believes he was never the problem, i think his psych explained that the medication would rid him of the physical symptoms of his anxiety and generally make him feel better. in answer to the \"did the meds help\" question - yes and no. yes, it has calmed him down and there have been no fresh accusations for 4-5 months. no, in that i had hoped his meds would provide him with insight to know that i never cheated on him. i just can't get past it without being released from my imaginary crimes. he is going to ask his dr next week if he can come off the meds or lower the dosage because he doesn't feel the side effects are worth it. side effects for him a- absolutely no libido - he's never experienced that in his life before - flat emotions/doesn't get joy from anything much - no motivation to get anything done if he does go off them, it will be interesting to see if his delusional beliefs come back in full force. i'll keep you updated.\n",

      "Text: ddj is it worse around the holidays? just a quick update peeps. hubby (ex) has been on the risperidone for 10+ months now. no change in his beliefs. i often wonder if his extremely fixed ideas would be different without key 'facts' or would a ddj sufferer just make other things key 'facts'? for example, my husband's 'absolute proof' moment was initially a lie detector test that gave an incorrect result. then, it was a video that i apparently put on his phone of me having sex with someone else. the video couldn't be found even with restore deleted images apps. there was however a still frame image of the video and the woman doesn't even look like me. another piece of undeniable proof, was an audio recording one morning that he set up in secret outside out bedroom. there was a faint noise that could have been a neighbour but more likely, it was our small dog snoring. that was interpreted as me sneaking someone in and having sex with them. funny thing is that around the time of that recording, you can hear me talking to a man. the man i was talking to was my husband. you can hear his distinctive voice clearly but he still believes that i had someone there. more recently (aka yesterday), he said his definitive proof was a short recording from our security camera several months ago. the early morning recording in question showed a light coloured shadow moving slowly across our front pathway. i watched it. my guess is that it was a headlight from someone's car. at an absolute stretch, i guess it could have been a large white dog but it was so blurry, you really couldn't make anything out. apparently, that video shows me having sex with someone outside on our front garden path. he does not think any of these 'proof' moments are irrational thinking at all. very sad!\n",

      "Text: friend with apparent delusional disorder hi, someone whose been a friend for over thirty years appears to have been exhibiting delusional disorder for these past 3 years. she hasn‚Äôt been officially diagnosed or seen a doctor about this, but here‚Äôs some history: firstly i have to avoid going into specifics just in case she ever reads this, and shall refer to her as ‚Äúmo‚Äù, which isn‚Äôt her real name. around a decade ago ‚Äúmo‚Äù was assaulted by a guy she‚Äôd started seeing. while she only confided this part recently i believe it to be 100% genuine because it‚Äôs entirely plausible, fits the timeline, everything appears to stem from this event, and it doesn‚Äôt have any of the characteristics common to her delusions. also she‚Äôs always been a very forthright, straight up and honest person aside from the delusional behaviour. seven years later mo naively confided this in a friend, who knew the guy in question. this person didn‚Äôt believe mo‚Äôs story, accused her of making false allegations, and then proceeded to embark on a passive aggressive campaign of slut shaming and gaslighting on social media. it was a few weeks after this (around 2016) that mo first began exhibiting symptoms of paranoia. initially she appeared to be manifesting the non-bizarre persecutive variant, but recently it‚Äôs expanded to include grandiose delusions and erotomania. subsequent to the onset of all this she began smoking weed to ‚Äúcalm her nerves‚Äù, and this most certainly seems to be exacerbating the problem. aside from the delusions mo functions normally, but certain aspects are starting to intrude on her life and career. she‚Äôs also started to broadcast these delusions to more and more people. the delusions clearly aren‚Äôt true as they stretch plausibility too much. while the story remains mostly consistent it keeps growing arms and legs, and more and more people are now identified as persecuting her. it seems only a matter of time before i am perceived as joining her ranks. the delusion has gradually expanded from just the friend who originally shamed her, to a millionaire sportsman from overseas who is paying a team of hackers to persecute her because she reject him, an instagram model, hundreds of followers that these people have across social media, to an international web of conspiracy that includes any cameras and microphones she comes into contact with. more recently a second faction of world famous rock stars has begun defending her honour against the evil masses, one of whom is a band member in redacted who is now her secret ‚Äòboyfriend‚Äô. all this has been communicated subliminally over social media, where the whole drama apparently plays out, and also via the radio etc. it‚Äôs literally everywhere, and she is right at the centre of all this action. it is impossible to reason with her, she admits it all ‚Äòsounds crazy‚Äô but is adamant that it can‚Äôt be because it‚Äôs all true. she‚Äôs been regularly expressing suicidal thoughts, although this depends on here mood, which depends of who is ‚Äòwinning‚Äô this instagram war. at the moment i have the impression that she‚Äôs too important to humanity to harm herself. i managed to get her mind off it all for a while last year, and she admits now that she was considering that it could all be down to her mental health... but then she spilled part of the tale to some other people who tried their best to politely humour her, and now she ‚Äòrealises‚Äô that the notion of her being delusional was ‚Äònonsense‚Äô because these people immediately brought her plight to the attention of redacted, mobilising it against her detractors. as if. she has even gone so far as to report all this to the police, who recommended that she see a doctor, but she won‚Äôt. does anyone have any suggestions as how i can encourage her to see a doctor? she never goes to a doctor with anything, not even when she‚Äôs ill. her parents are completely unaware of all this. she rightly keeps it from then in order to avoid upsetting them as they are old and infirm, so that avenue is out. she has confided heavily in one other friend whom i know of, but don‚Äôt actually know personally. i could contact this person but if word ever got back to mo then that wouldn‚Äôt play well. the problem has become apparent to some other people she interacts with, and together we‚Äôre trying to manage it all as best we can. it might be possible to arrange for the people who humoured her last year to come back and verbally inform her that they are not actually involved in mounting a campaign in her defence, but i suspect that might go badly, or she‚Äôd have some way of explaining/denying it. the story has become so grandiose and complex that the details have begun to get muddled. is there anyone here who has successfully recovered from this dreadful illness? what would you suggest? we‚Äôre in the uk.\n",

      "Text: delusional disorder on dr. phil show (feb 21 2020) on friday, the show's guest was a woman who accused her father of sexually assaulting her when she was a teen and videotaping the incident. years later, she was now accusing her brother-in-law (her sister's husband) of selling the video on the dark web. this was a family of attorneys, and they were struggling with the accusations. according to the guest, who is about 50, a few years ago, she suddenly remembered the assault, a memory which she had suppressed. her niece said that a few years back, the woman appeared normal, and she had good relationships with her family. from listening to the woman, it sounds like her delusion grew to include her brother-in-law as a result of her \"piecing things together\" and \"trying to figure it out\". i gritted my teeth. my dd relative frequently uses those phrases. at the end of the episode, dr. phil announced that he believed the woman has a delusional disorder, specifically the persecutory type. (i was surprised, because i had seen two other episodes where a guest appeared to have dd, and he blamed their beliefs on mold in their home.) he offered her help from a company that offers treatment. i didn't catch the name of the company, but one or two reps appeared briefly on the show to say that they thought they could improve her condition with treatment. i understood the family's frustration as they described the woman's behavior. but i felt that dr. phil was being exploitative when he yelled at the woman for not bringing evidence of her claims. the audience applauded in response to his yelling, while the camera showed the woman looking sad. he could have edited out those few seconds before the show aired. he should know that shaming someone isn't going to provide the safe environment that the victim needs for trusting people. i hope that the show gives an update on this family in the future. it's so rare that dd is referenced in the media.\n",

      "Text: imaginary fleas this fixation with imaginary fleas, or similar, is happening with my mom, too. her delusional disorder began 10 years ago, at age 68, and at first she though her then-husband was having multiple affairs, and that he was sanding her furniture. a couple years later, with her poor husband enduring weekly accusations, she thought he was going to kill her and she left, and thankfully her doctor convinced her to admit herself to a geriatric psychiatric unit, where she stayed for 2 weeks. the doctors there referred to her delusions as 'fixed' and tried anti-psychotics, but the medication didn't change her delusions at all. my mom and her husband divorced, which was strongly encouraged by the psychiatric hospital experts, and which my sister and i were relieved about because we could see the stress on her husband, a dear man who was then in his 70s. she moved to an apartment on her own, and became convinced he was still entering all the time, to damage her furniture or move things around, or take things, to then return them later. there are so many other things she was suspicious of, too many to list here. she spent money on cameras and door alarm monitoring. anyway, a few years ago, she said her apartment has fleas, but get this, her dog did not! she still spent hundreds of dollars on flea treatments. she even took what she thought were flea carcasses to a dermatologist, and was told she has delusions. (she's received that diagnosis from various doctors, to no avail) she started to say her ex-husband is blowing dust and fleas on her through holes in the ceiling, and that he lives in the apartment above her. a few months later, she said she had the fleas under control, but then earlier this year, she started saying she now has mites all over her body. she puts various tree oils and who knows what else all over herself, and does a lot of laundry. she caused a rash on her face, probably from putting various 'treatments' on. and now she also picks at her imaginary mites. a month ago, she suddenly signed a new lease with a new apartment, saying she has to get away from her ex-husband (who, in actuality, is in his 80s now, can't walk well, and lives hours away from her). we worked very hard to help her move, though she didn't consult with me about whether it was convenient, and yet we knew with 100% certainty that moving would not stop her delusions. sure enough, it's been just 2 weeks since the move and a few days ago she told me her ex-husband lives in the apartment above her. she still thinks she has mites, and she's also developed olfactory and auditory hallucinations. she thinks she hears her ex-husband whistling, and gets angry with us when we say we can't hear anything. and she thinks she smells vapors or fumes that he's blowing on her somehow. we're hopeful that the new place she moved to, which has independent apartments, but also has assisted living services, will place barriers on her behavior, or somehow enforce mental health treatment. we'll see. i'm also 100% certain that even if her ex-husband passes away before she does, she will still think he's tormenting her, or that he's hired people to do it after his death.\n",

      "Text: mom has dd - persecutory type and i am at a loss hi, new here - quick introduction: my mother, in her 70's, has delusional disorder persecutory subtype. she's always been a little odd - a little paranoid, but about 8 or so years ago my stepfather died and she went totally off the rails. she moved into a townhouse, and then became convinced that the neighbors were out to get her. she thought they poisoned her dog, she thought they had bugged the townhouse, she thought they were pumping poison in through the air conditioner, that they were talking to the property manager to get her evicted, etc. etc.. i lived in a different state at that time and believed that maybe she had some bad neighbors (i mean, i knew they weren't poisoning her, but i could believe that maybe they were unpleasant). so she moved to a house in a different neighborhood, and again the same kind of delusions popped up, except now she was convinced she was hearing them talk about her, and somehow she became convinced that the old neighbors knew the new neighbors. she was overwrought with anxiety a lot of the time. finally convinced her to see a geriatric psychiatrist, but she bitched about it, because she didn't think that there was anything wrong with her, and she wasn't compliant with med. so...i moved to another part of the country to start a new job, and because i was so stressed out from not being able to help from a distance i moved her up here too. first it took months to get her moved out of my house into her apartment (finally happened with something of a scene - she paid rent for four months without once sleeping in her apartment). within a month, the paranoia set in again. took her to a psychiatrist multiple times, but she incorporated the psychiatrist into her delusions. moved her to a totally secure beautiful condo - doorman building, private garage, etc. - and she is convinced these neighbors are mafia and drug dealers and that they know the old evil neighbors. she thinks they are destroying her hearing, that they're trying to drill through her ceiling to abduct her, and that they are shooting lasers at her to make her blind (through the floor, ceiling, walls) but that aluminum foil can protect her. she also had a delusion involving my aunts, so now isn't speaking to them. this winter i caught her sleeping in her car to avoid the neighbors, took her to the er, and she was committed for a short stay, but after 3 or 4 days when she wouldn't sign herself in, they let her out. then a new psychiatrist, drugs that seem to do nothing, and she won't take anything that would make her sleepy because she feels like she needs to be vigilant all night. she spends almost all day everyday at my house, which drives my husband and kids crazy because it is just one thing about the neighbors after another. it stresses me out and depresses me. i have no family to help shoulder the load on this. i hate it because she could be having a nice life, but she's making herself miserable for no reason. i know she's hiding things from me because she knows i don't believe people are out to get her - like she asked a friend to take her to a hotel last night to get away from the neighbors, or that she sleeps in her closet sometimes. if you look at her, she seems put together - nicely dressed, pays her bills, drives, highly articulate and intelligent. she does have some short term memory issues the last year or two leading to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, but it is pretty mild. i feel so hopeless. i can't help her. she doesn't get better. she is petrified of being by herself, but it is impossible to have her move in with us because it is so hard to hear the paranoid ranting all day. she called the police on the neighbors the other day, and i had to go behind her and call them the next day when i found out, to explain her diagnosis and that the people upstairs aren't actually doing anything wrong... sorry for unloading, it is just so hard right now. anyone have advice? or can let me know i'm not alone? thanks.\n",

      "Text: mom has dd - persecutory type and i am at a loss hi tennesseegal, i'm sorry you're going through this about your mom. i know how it feels to have nearly that exact scenario and it's so unusual and heavy that you can't really talk about it to people because it's too much. my husband and kids are supportive, but i try to shield them from the responsibility and burden. thankfully, i can call my sister to vent once in a while, but she lives very far away. my mom is also in her 70s, and we've been dealing with her delusions for the past 9 years. she was married to a nice man, they'd been together for about 30 years. but suddenly she began to think he was damaging her furniture or knotting up the fringe on her blanket or scratching her paintings. really weird stuff. though, she also thought he was having multiple affairs with neighbors or even acquaintances of mine. three years into her delusions, during which i'd been conferring with doctors, elder specialists, and talked her into seeing a counselor, there was no change. then she snapped and thought her husband was going to kill her. she called police and then was willing to go to a geriatric psych unit for two weeks. they, like previous doctors, diagnosed psychosis with delusions. but she refuses that diagnosis and won't take medications. she is now divorced and living in an apartment. she has become more vocal about her suspicions, telling her friends that her ex-husband is stalking her, that he enters her apartment to damage her things all the time. she spends money on surveillance, cameras, and alarm system. she complains to her apartment manager and calls police occasionally about the 'break-ins', and the police have contacted us so we can share information. the police agree that she's got all her abilities - paying bills, keeping her apartment nice, etc. she's super smart, funny, very pretty, and stylish. this brain illness is so tragic. she says she wants to move to get away from her ex-husband (who we still keep in contact with and help take care of, but in secret from her - so complicated). i know i can't stop her from moving to another city if she ends up really planning that, but i also know that wherever she goes, some delusion will be there always. even if her ex-husband died, i know she'd still believe he's somehow hired someone to break in, or blow dust on her, even beyond his death. the staff at the psychiatric unit where she was in 2012 let us know that we can set limits on what we allow in our house. so if she starts talking about her delusions, i don't engage and i tell her i'll have to take her home if she continues. i've talked recently with county elder specialists, and they, too, told me to guard my own peace of mind. the professionals said i cannot let my mom's upset affect my life, and that i can't ease her discomfort. it's hard for me, because i really wish i could help her. i've tried so many ways, to no avail. so now i see her about once every 10 days, help her get groceries, or sort papers, or take her to lunch. we connect by text or phone every few days and i listen to her current suspicions because i want to keep tabs on her actions. she does keep secrets from me because she knows i don't believe her, but sometimes she lets something slip, like a new suspicion, or that she's filed a new complaint somewhere. i used to think my mom could live with us when she got older, but not now. her being so upset is unpredictable and troubling, and being with her is full of tension, with us guarding against what topic she's about to bring up. she's not violent, but i don't know what her delusions could bring her to do. when she stayed here for 3 nights recently because of a minor medical procedure, i locked my bedroom door at night (our kids are at college). i feel for you, and it's helpful for me to hear that there are others experiencing this with a parent, too.\n",

      "Text: mom has dd - persecutory type and i am at a loss i have delusional disorder and every thing you described is exactly what i experienced. my delusions became so bad because i believed people were trying to hurt me like your mother feels and i wound up committing a crime so i could get to a \"safe place\" where they couldn't easily get to me. i was very resistant to taking medication because my delusions were so real to me and know one understood that they were real so i became very secretive about it. i am on a regimen of loxapine and klonopin which help with the symptoms. i have been delusional free for two years now and i am trying to reestablish my life. the best advice i could offer is to get her a therapist to work with her. someone that she can trust and talk to about what is going on. the worst thing is for her to keep it inside because the behaviors will escalate if she is convinced these things are going on. i was fortunate to have a good therapist who went through my delusions one by one and brought me back from over the edge. i was lost for 10 years and destroyed my life but am in the process of rebuilding. don't give up on her she can be helped. delusional disorder is hard to treat because generally people deny they are delusional. everything you described i experienced and it was a living hell to have those feelings. be persistent about getting her treatment. there are no support groups out there for this disorder so psychotherapy is your best bet. shop around to find the right fit for her, someone she trusts. that is the key because you are suspicious about everyone. good luck colleen\n",

      "Text: mom has dd - persecutory type and i am at a loss hi there i previously wrote a whole reply and lost it so fingers crossed this time. sorry to hear you're having such a hard time with your mum. unfortunately my situation is quite similar, but without the hubby and kids. my mum is 72 and the delusional disorder started around 15 years ago. she has also always been a bit paranoid. my mums delusions are very similar. she thinks one of the neighbours has bugged the house and is harming her through the electrics/wifi (sending shocks etc). my mum also believes aluminium foil or a baking tray can protect her. my brother lives abroad so it's just me. it's very, very hard. these aren't my words, but they are from another carer for someone with a mental illness and sum things up pretty well. they described the situation as 'heartbreaking, isolating and testing to the soul'. the situation weighs very heavily on you and takes a huge toll. the paranoid ranting is very hard. my mums issues were always 'episodes', but this current episode has lasted since may and is not going away. to be honest, the fact that her illness was episodic kept me going as i knew that the dd would eventually go away and there would be a period of respite, however brief. also my mum has started to get more 'manic' and irrational about normal thing and has a lot of mood swings. she got massively stressed out and irrational about cleaning the living room earlier. you'd think it was a cesspit, it isnt... she's also been quite mean recently....it seems like i do nothing right which is devastating when you're going through hell to support someone you care about. my mum has tried almost every antipsychotic out there and as soon as she reaches an efficacious dose the side effects (fatigue, sleepiness) become intolerable. i'm sorry i can't be more positive about the situation, but at least we're not entirely alone in this. i'm in the uk and would really like to get in touch with others dealing with this. i'd really like to hear more about your experiences colleen, but i'll write a separate post before i lose everything i've written. take care g\n",

      "Text: mom has dd - persecutory type and i am at a loss hello everyone thank you so much for sharing your stories it greatly helps me to understand what is going on in my world. but it also saddens me that you are unable to find a solution for your mother's condition. cuz i am in the same boat as you. my story is i am 28 years old i just had surgery which requires to me to be in a wheelchair for extended time so i moved in with my mom while i recover. my mom is married but her husband and her do not live together they still talk and hang out occasionally and they never had the best relationship so fighting was a common thing between them. but after being here a few months i started to notice things were off with my mom, my mom is 55 years old. she is the same as yours well put together very smart outside looking in you won't even notice a problem.then she started talking about how her husband his name is jason was spying on her bugging the house, writing random letters all over to mess with her, listening to her via the tv or a speaker, saying he learned all this stuff through international website that he translates with apps. at first i thought maybe he was messing with her in a certain degree and she wishes taking it out of context but then i started really digging into what she was saying and i would prove everything wrong and yet it still wouldn't resonate with her. i could tell her and show her what she was experiencing was just a app and that's what it does but she always correlated it to something he was doing against her. and now it is only getting worse she is convinced that he is planning something big in her new delusion is that he is trying to convince me that she is crazy so i can't even discuss that a possibility of her not being okay and needs help because she thinks that he is winning.the other night she knocked on my door at 1 a.m. and was super energized and said look i can show you i found them i got it and she was show me a piece of wood she was saying in that used to be part are they shelf and she was look look. she was showing me a blank piece of wood and she owes look right there look at those letters. but there was no letters there and this really shocked me this is when it really dawned on me this is more serious and i thought that my mom truly needs help. i'm a firefighter paramedic and i see psychiatric patients all the time but my job is to take him to the hospital i don't know what to do after this. i can't talk to my mom about this because she just thinks her husband is winning and that's what he's trying to do she is convinced and there's nothing i can say to help her. it breaks my heart so much that people struggle with this for so long without any answers or solutions. it seems to be like my next step would be tried to convince her to go get help which i do not know if that will be possible. or even if it is possible for me reading post it seems like sometimes that doesn't even help possible now i am very torn on what do i do once i am able to get out of this wheelchair and go back to work and go back to my place. do i leave her to deal with this on her own i can't imagine doing that to her but i don't know what else i can do to help her i am so lost right now.\n",

      "Text: husband with delusional jealousy - no hope? a week after the psychiatrist appointment and i haven't really gotten much information about how it went though, the psych has scheduled an appointment for me to come in at hubby's next appointment. we both had individual appts with our relationship counsellor yesterday and she advised me (and said she also advised him) that due to the toxic nature of our relationship, if something doesn't give, she is going to have to get child protection involved. she is encouraging me to move out or make him move out though this isn't something he would ever do. i sat him down when i got home and we discussed the planned separation. i told him that i'm moving out asap and the kids will have their home base with me but he can see them whenever he wants. naturally this wasn't taken very well and a huge argument followed. i am extremely confused now. he is now trying to convince me that the affair he has accused me of having has never really been the problem. the problem is that he believes someone is stalking around our house and has been in our house and if i know nothing about it, then it must be someone who means harm. i tried to rationalize with him on this. nothing has been stolen and no property damage except for a couple of half dead plants outside have happened. why would someone be stalking us? why haven't our cameras caught this person? why haven't our neighbors seen anything? he doesn't have any answers but most of his evidence of this is all a bit fuzzy. two things of about 20 could mean someone has been hanging around but someone is home here 95% of the time, so it all sounds a bit unlikely. the two things are quite substantial. 1. he has an outdoor camera he had placed around the side of the house. one day he brought it in (only out for a day) and he discovered the memory card was missing. obviously this is sus but it disappeared when we were home and it's weird that the camera didn't get taken as well as it was just sitting there. there are only 3 possibilities: - around that day the electric meter checking guy was around. the camera was on the meter box. we have some junk in that part of the yard. perhaps he was poking around the junk and realised the camera was there and took the card so we didn't see what he was doing. - hubby forgot to put the card in - they are very tiny and would be easy to misplace - someone is stalking us 2. some of our outdoor downlights (solar) have switches on them that have apparently been turned off. no idea about either of these two things but as mentioned, these are the only two substantial things he has seen. the rest are as stated in the first post but include plants that have half died, footsteps around the side (pretty much proved to be our large dog), solar light falling off the gutter, small bit of wood falling off the top of the front deck, puddle on the front deck, side fence has started leaning a bit. he says there's lots of other things but hasn't actually told me them. anyway, i don't know whether he is just scrambling with this new revelation (about the problem not being me potentially having an affair) to keep me here or whether i'm going mad and i've been dwelling for a long time on the accusations and i'm the one who has kept it going. logic tells me that i'm not going mad because he often splurts random accusations though often quite cryptic. eg \"you like your men big\" (hubby is not particularly tall but he is lean and fit) or \"the door handle is warm as if you've been hanging on to it watching for me to come home (sometimes he'll say that i'm being mounted by my other man while hanging onto it). i think i've become a bit acclimatized to the comments now because when i read back that last comment, i realize how disgustingly sick it sounds.\n",

      "Text: husband with delusional jealousy it is absolutely hell living like this. he gas twisted so many things. strangely enough, there is a coworker of his i have never even met or talked to that he has accused me of cheating with for a couple of years now. the strange part is this man sent me a friend request on fb today. as i clearly gave nothing to hide, i notified my husband right away. why? because i told him i would always be truthful and not hide things from him. and i anticipated that my husband, ny protector would stand up for me and also see that im not hiding things from him. well instead, he blamed me. he saw the friend request as proof positive that im having an affair with this man. so instead of getting amgry and feeling betrayed towards his coworker, he decided it was an elaborate ruse set up by me and his coworker to cover up the fact that our fb accounts were connected (not even sure what he means by that). so i instead sent the asshole a message calling him out for randomly sending a friend request to his coworkers wife. he respinded thst he hadnt so then i sent him a picture of the request and again basically told him off. of course in my husband's eyes, that was wrong as well. i honestly dont know how or why this person sent me a friend request as my husband actually has me blicked from his fb. again, my husband sees that as even more proof. theres so many examples i see on other threads of these bizarre paranoid behaviors that my husband exhinits... call or text from the wrong number? its obviously my lover. neighbor mzkes noice next door, the husband is signaling me. i get my nails done, cut my hair, buy new clothes....im obviously trying to either look goid for my boyfriend or its just that i have the insatiable desire to have attention from all men. if i have a sniffle, i now have a cocaine problem too. if i shave my legs...going to see the boyfriend. didnt really go to the grocery store....went to see my boyfriend got my promotion last year because....you guessed...sleeping with my boss car slows down anywhere near our house... my boyfriend is checking up on me or stopping by. i am a sex addict and i need some help. i am so cold and uncaring, why do i torture him so? my 19 year old twins know all about my whoring ways and give him funny looks because they really want to tell him. my sons teenage friends....sleeping with me. apparently i have successfully seduced 100% of his friends and relatives, and none of them will tell him because they are all afraid of him. that success rate is better than a playboy model so i guess i should be flattered. i use my paycheck to pay bills for men i sleep with. i post ads on craigslist looking for carsex. i bought a locking bracelet and gave him the key, he swears o either bought two or my boyfriend has the real key. if i check his facebook or phone, im not checking up on him, im talking to his friends if i check his location on gps, its to make sure he isnt sneaking up on me and my boyfriend. the list goes on and on.\n",

      "Text: my friend is always blaming me when something goes wrong hi soconfused. i'm sorry you didn't receive a timely reply. this forum is not as active as it used to be. currently, the conventional advice for this type of situation is: do not \"confess\" to something you didn't do. don't reinforce the delusion. an obsession with the enemy's \"confession\" is a common theme in some of the stories in this forum. a lot of times, the victim tells the enemy: \"i'll forgive the affair/lies/stealing/cheating/whatever if you'll just tell the truth\". it's tempting to say what they want to hear, in hopes that they will stop talking about it obsessively and compulsively. but it's not likely to work; i think it would just lead to new, bigger, worse accusations. do not deny the accusation. even if you're telling the truth, denying the accusation will only make the accuser hold onto the accusation even tighter. even if you have a perfect alibi or undeniable logic that clearly reveals the truth, it's as if the victim's brain will create new pathways to hide the truth from him or her. the accusation/delusion might morph a little bit at this point, but the disease will still likely identify you to the victim as the \"enemy\". change the topic. this tactic works for family and friends who aren't the \"enemy\"; i'm not sure if it will work for the person whom the victim's brain has marked as \"the enemy\". i know it sounds ridiculous, but it works. a relative of mine can talk for hours about all the things her husband has allegedly done to try to ruin her life. a simple question such as \"oh, look at your garden! what kind of flower is that yellow one?\" can change the topic--and her mood--completely. do you know any of this person's family? i would talk to a parent or sibling and explain to them what's going on. maybe this has happened in the past, and they'll recognize a pattern. or...they might believe the victim. if so, this is likely to happen again in the future. even it you break off all contact with him, the victim's brain will eventually identify a new \"enemy\". next time, it might be one of his family members. so if you talk to them, even if they don't believe you now, you've given them the info to recognize a pattern later. i think you have to end the friendship. but let him know that you'll be there for him if you need him in the future. i'm thinking something like: you keep accusing me of things i didn't do. it hurts me that you think i would do those things. i think that we both need time away from each other. i won't call/text/email/visit anymore. i truly wish you the best.\n",

      "Text: am i delusional?? i just spoke with my eldest daughter on the phone. she is a nurse that works on the psych-med-surg ward at a top hospital. she plans on becoming a psychiatric nurse practioner. i told her that i was speaking with a lawyer about what happened to me during a recent er visit. this is unlike me, but it bothered me so i had to speak with a lawyer. i had a night where i got drunk. my husband thought my heart had stopped and he called an ambulance. i sobered up in an er ward. still being under the influence, i was very nasty to the nurse. i said some awful things to her. i knew i hurt her terribly. (this is also unlike me) i wasn‚Äôt physically aggressive. i didn‚Äôt try to hurt anyone or myself. i wasn‚Äôt wandering around, stumbling. i did ask to go to the bathroom quite a bit. they had to get someone to escort me. i would wait until someone was there that could help me. otherwise, i waited in my bed. and eventually i sobered up enough to keep control of my nasty mouth. i did find out the ‚Äònurse‚Äô wasn‚Äôt a nurse at all. i could tell she was angry with me, probably tired and hurt by the things i had said. after awhile, they came in my room and made me get into an enclosure bed. basically it looked like a baby playpen with mesh sides and top. i couldn‚Äôt even stretch out in it. it was awful and i wanted to get out of the thing. it was all i could think about. i finally found a zipper beneath the floor of this playpen. i forced my finger through it and unzipped it and slithered out of the playpen. i got back into my normal bed and waited. when the ‚Äònurse‚Äô came back into the room, she was surprised and nastily called me an escape artist. she didn‚Äôt try to restrain me after that. eventually i was released and went home. i told my daughter all about this. she said she didn‚Äôt understand why this would be so traumatic to me. with my history, i would think she would understand, but she didn‚Äôt. she just couldn‚Äôt understand. and i don‚Äôt understand that...except that she is young and can‚Äôt fully comprehend what has happened in my life. it‚Äôs been a year since all this happened. a lot has happened. i‚Äôve been on a crusade to get off all unnecessary meds, especially the opiates (for cancer) and benzos (for gad & ptsd). then the memory of this came to me and i decided to speak to a lawyer about it. i mentioned it to my daughter tonight. she told me that she is scared for me because of this. she said she thinks i‚Äôm delusional. now i‚Äôm beginning to question myself. maybe i am delusional. but i think to myself,‚Äôi seem to be getting better. i‚Äôm not depressed. i‚Äôm getting out more. i‚Äôm more and more active. sure, it‚Äôs taking some time but i‚Äôm doing it.‚Äô so how am i delusional? part of me thinks that for most of my life (i‚Äôm 55 right now) i‚Äôve had several traumatic events, and i‚Äôve never done anything about it. now i feel that i have to speak up. to say hey, something wrong happened here. it‚Äôs not the money. it‚Äôs the principle of it. but now my daughter has me doubting myself. am i being delusional? if i am, then i need to watch myself. if i‚Äôm not, why does my daughter think this? no matter what, what do i do under either circumstance? i am at a loss. i don‚Äôt know what to think. so i‚Äôd appreciate any feedback from others. ideally i should be able to figure this out by myself, but obviously i‚Äôm ill equipped for that. at least for the moment. so what do you think about this situation. am i delusional? is there something wrong with the way i‚Äôm thinking? wither\n",

      "Text: help needed hello, i got married to this lovely girl last year in february. we dated for a year before walking up the altar. there were some issues that i just chose to look over and initially even believed 1) she said a group from new zealand ( where she had been a student from 2003..did not manage to complete despite changing 3 colleges as everywhere people were ‚Äò out to get her ‚Äò) was hacking her phone and listening to everything we spoke on phone and were watching her change and stuff 2) everywhere she went she drew in new people like her workplace acquaintances into the whirlpool saying that they too were plotting against her 3) once she came home and fought with me saying she saw me talking to a girl at her workplace whom she believed was a part of the plot. i never spoke to her nor was i a part of any ‚Äòplot‚Äô 4) just out of the blue she would fight with me saying i called her a bitch. of course i did not do that. i rubbed it off saying that she‚Äôd probably misheard me. she calmed down but the resentment was there nonetheless we got married, the accusations got wilder.... 1) jesus came in my dreams and told me you are hiding something and trying to break the marriage 2) she accused me of wanting to indulge in wife swapping with a couple who are good friends 3) she would accuse me of saying weird and random things 4) once she drove the car so rash after accusing me of saying some weird thing that i thought she‚Äôd kill me 5) final straw was after 18 months of marriage she accused me of calling her a c**t and a s**t out of the blue. 6) generally she is a very sweet and a calm personality and goes to church at all times but when this hits her, she starts screaming and becomes evil eyed. there is nothing i can do to argue with her beliefs 7) she felt someone was laughing at her on the phone line. i got her phone checked up but nothing was found she left the house and her parents think i‚Äôve hurt their daughter, when i suggested a psychiatrist visit all hell broke loose. my wife though agreed to the visit with disgust, her diagnosis came out perfectly okay even though she made some bizarre statements like .. 1)he walks behind me and spies on me. 2) he goes out in the middle of the night to drink tea 3)he laughs at me together with friends and security her parents lied to the doctor saying that i had apologised to them for my behaviour to her the doctors said she is well behaved and well dressed and did not show any symptoms of a disorder when they kept her under observation for 7 days so now, her paranoia against me is grown more .. she has blocked me off all telephonic ways of contact. which she refuses to accept.she stays in the us now where she is studying. i am funding her education and paying off her loan, she has got no regard for that. just for your information she has accused several people in the past who were her friends of wrongdoing. all of them left. she accused them of the same plotting thing. to her, the beliefs are real and no amount of proof or convincing can help some people don‚Äôt even know what my wife thinks of them. to everyone she is a pretty young girl with a perfect life. i love her and want her to get better. but her super overprotective parents and she are the biggest roadblocks. i‚Äôve tried convincing them as well but got bombed. she says i have been an indecent husband and that i have spoilt her life and that she does not have any trust nor faith in me.. i don‚Äôt know how to deal with this ... this is sapping me of my life.. is there anyone who could give any suggestions ? thanks for reading this long post... last edited by snaga on fri may 03, 2019 2:06 pm, edited 1 time in total. reason: please try to avoid all caps in thread titles, thanks\n",

      "Text: does my wife have ddj our marriage has had good years and bad years, but over the last 29 years the good has certainly outweighed the bad. things were going great, we were eagerly making plans for retirement in the future, until recently when things have rapidly turned dark when the endless accusations began. the first major accusation was that i was having an affair with the girl that cut my hair. then the laser beam focus shifted to my work. she began to incessantly drill me about who i had lunch with in the cafeteria, etc. then i was accused of having an afffair with one of my female co-workers, and then another. she then started checking my home email, computer usage, text messages, and cell phone calls... demanding that i identify each number and the conversations that took place from 3 months prior. the accusations continued to grow. she \"knew\" i was getting up in the middle of the night and spending hours on the computer. her health began to fail, she now needed ambien to sleep and doctors prescribed anxiety and blood pressure medications. because of her health, she asked if i was trying to poision her. she asked if i was secretly taking pictures of her, and asked if i had video tape equipment hidden in our bedroom. my beloved wife then began hiding tape recorders in my home office and car in hopes of \"catching me in the act\". the clincher came when i received what i thought were a couple of innocuous wrong number texts. one was about the individual going out to eat after church and the other was pertaining to someone's family reunion. i texted back they had the wrong number. my wife didn't think they were so innocent. unbeknownst to me, she hired a private investigator. together they tracked down who had the phone number and did research, background checks, etc. apparently this individual was a known homosexual. so now the accusations came flying that i was having a homosexual relationship. that is when she moved out and filed for divorce. after 29 years i am left devasted, hurt beyond words, and left searching for answers. the woman i knew for all of those years bears no resembalance to the woman who she is now. could this be ddj, or some type of side-affect from the medications? or could this be a sign of some other underlying mental health issue?\n",

      "Text: does my wife have ddj wow, there seems to many of us that have the same situation. i've also cruised the mid life crisis boards and the menopause boards and many stories are similar. something comes over people and they go off the deep end. they destroy everything they have loved and worked for and blame someone else (or everyone else) for the results. it's very sad. in this thread alone there are 4 men that have almost the exact situations. it must be diagnosable and treatable. you just have to trick the person into getting help. i had one chance with a marriage counselor and he didn't work out. i've read other threads on this board where people successfully get the person to go to a dr only to have the dr wimp out which then throws the other person under a bus. you have to play that psychiatrist card carefully. you may only get 1 shot. as for instigating a divorce, i find that my wife will make many threats and they all come up empty. those were the mistakes i made at first: i would react to her threats. now i just brush them off. she never follows through on anything. so if my wife threatened a divorce, i would challenge her to go ahead knowing that she would never pull it off. nearly all of her threats are idle and are just attempts to hurt me to get some type of reaction i believe. and i do say it works most times. because once she has broken me down, then she seems to become calm and we have a good spell for a while. i also read in one of our threads that someone can \"see the episode coming\". i'm with you there. i can always see them coming which helps me not to react. i just ride them out. but eventually, she has to hurt me to gain some inner peace for herself. hard to understand.\n",

      "Text: feeling depressed with ddj wife i'm really sorry you're going through this with your wife. i can tell you that for us, it seems to get worse and professionals have told me that i need to maintain boundaries, because i can't help her, i can't solve her delusions, and i need to protect my well-being. in our case, my mom has been divorced from her husband for 6 years and her delusions about him keep changing and increasing. she has also developed another kind of delusion, in addition to the paranoia and jealousy kind. she now thinks she has little bugs on herself, she said it was fleas at first, then she said they went away, and now she thinks she has mites. she still spends money on a door alarm system to keep her now-ex-husband out, and calls police occasionally because of the break-ins. of course, there is no one coming in and stealing her stuff (and sometimes she says he returns and puts the item back), or hacking her computer, or causing her water pipes to make a noise... on and on. she recently told me she's hired a private investigator, and joined an domestic abuse support group. i only wonder how many weeks it will take for these people to realize that the stories she tells never happened. they'll probably start to question when she talks about her ex putting dust on her through holes in her ceiling. she has had doctors tell her she's got delusions, but she won't believe that, and then won't see those doctors. she was on an anti-psychotic medication for a couple weeks, but it didn't help. i've tried and tried to comfort her and calm her fear by letting her know there isn't anyone after her, but she gets angry and accuses me of being naive and stupid. when it started, she thought her husband was having multiple affairs, even with some of my acquaintances, and that he molested my son, and had her car tracked, was damaging her furniture, and on and on. we were so worried about his stress level dealing with the constant accusations. he loved her and endured for 3 years, and finally she pursued a divorce. he's not my dad, but we are still connected with him and make sure he's okay. he's still like a step-dad to me, and he's a wonderful man. we are so glad they are no longer together because of the stress on him. please don't feel guilty or blame yourself for needing to be away from the delusional person. sometimes it's necessary. this illness is truly horrible. i will always make sure my mom has a roof over her head, but i need to minimize contact, and minimize my family's contact with her. it's very sad, because in some ways she's still smart, funny, cute, but in other ways, my mom is gone.\n",

      "Text: feeling depressed with ddj wife thank you very much sanmom for your response. just having someone respond helps me so much. we are living separately for the last month now and it is such a relief i am actually able to go to a store by myself and not worry if the line at the counter is too long. i gave my wife an ultimatum that she needs to accept that i have never cheated and to never again accuse me and that she needs to go and talk to a doctor. it went as well as i should have expected she said i am the one suffering from bipolar disorder and i am the one that needs to go to the doctor. she completely ignores any questions that i ask about her obviously false accusations and only focusses on things which i cannot disprove. i have told her i need a divorce and now she says she loves me and we can start afresh and she will not accuse me if i do not do anything wrong. how can i accept that? i have never done anything wrong and have been called a thief, a cheat and a liar for no fault of mine. how can i accept that she would not repeat this. even now she says she saw what she saw and heard what she heard and that i have done bad things to her. and she alleges the only reason i am asking for a divorce is to get married to the person she says i am \"having an affair\" with. makes me want to cry. i am trying to hold strong to my demand for divorce but the time away some how makes me remember only the good times, look at our pictures and cry. i cannot let myself be treated that way again. i think back on all the accusations she made and try to strengthen myself. still i feel so guilty and sad about leaving her when she says she loves me. why am i facing all this?\n",

      "Text: are co incidences a part of delusional disorder? the short answer for me is yes. my wife also has a major problem with coincidences, but they don't result in her blaming me for something. it results in her thinking she has \"proof\" that the other people in this town and at her work are plotting against her. her delusion is that she thinks that these people wanted her to leave me for other single men that they know. and when she didn't leave me, they decided that to make their \"man friends\" feel better about themselves, they had to make her look really bad and break her down. so every coincidence that happens is proof to her that they are doing this to her. the problem for me is that they thought to fix her up with their friends because they found out that i was such an awful husband, and if i hadn't been so bad, they never would have thought to fix her up with their friends. so in the end, it's all my fault, but i'm not blamed directly for each of these coincidences. i was not a bad husband, not that i was perfect. so i end up apologizing for things from the past that i did not do. that seems to diffuse the situation, and prevent a nasty argument. i'm not sure what to tell you about your situation. he's specifically blaming you directly for these coincidences. i will tell you that simply saying \"i didn't do it\" probably will never work. i'm really grasping at straws for a suggestion, but how about this...... with this friend gordon, there are sort of 2 parts to it. 1-that his friend new about his chat with god and 2-that you were the one to tell him. is it possible to deflect this, sort of, and just say something like - \"i have no idea how your friend found out. i didn't tell him, but somebody must have. are you sure you didn't talk about this with anybody else? or did someone over hear something?\" you may have to defend yourself and prove that you couldn't have said anything. like maybe you've been so busy that you haven't even had time to call your mother etc. i guess what i'm getting at is i think you might have more luck arguing how the coincidence happened as opposed to trying to convince him that nothing really happened. i have had absolutely no success trying to convince my wife that these coincidences are nothing. absolutely no luck at all. so here's a recent example. she went for a 30 minute jog yesterday. while out jogging one of \"them\" passed by on a motorcycle. she was convinced that this was intentional and they knew she was going out for a jog and they are checking on her and plotting the next thing they're going to do to her. what i can't say is \"gosh i'm sure it's just a coinicidence. why would they be out checking on you?\". instead what i said was \"that's awful. don't they have better things to do with their time. what is their problem? what kind of nut-case does something like that?\" i'm not sure if that's helpful or not. i wish i had better advice to give.\n",

      "Text: i'm a ddj man, i'll talk with anyone who wants more insight i realized i was delusional but i‚Äôm not out of the woods 100% (i‚Äôll explain below). i‚Äôve always struggled with a girlfriend‚Äôs past, whether it was an innocent one or a more sexually active one. i would analyze over and over and over making them out to be ‚Äúbad‚Äù no matter the past. i would ask questions about their past and then not believe what they told me and then obsess about it. after doing that for too many relationships i realized it must be me, there was no way all these women were that ‚Äúbad‚Äù. up to this point cheating was not really a worry for me (a little but not too much). i definitely had a trust issue though. i then dated two consecutive woman (not at the same time, lol) who both cheated on me and i stayed with each of them too long after finding out they cheated which only added to my analyzing and anxiety if they were cheating or not (i should have left them immediately but i stayed). this added to my struggle with trust. i finally left and i then met my future wife and i went through the same struggles about analyzing here past. her past was conservative but i still analyzed it and made it ‚Äúbad‚Äù in my head. this slowly lead me to think she cheating on me, it didn‚Äôt help that she lived an hour away when we were dating. she is not a big phone person so i would get very uncomfortable when she did not answer. my thinking went on and one but i hid it well and always seem happy on the surface. eventually it would surface and i would ask if she was cheating. i‚Äôd analyze her answers, body language, etc. she had a coworker that turned into what she called a ‚Äúgood friend‚Äù. she hid their friendship from me, i eventually found out and confronted her, she knew him for two years, they texted/talked 4 times/week at least. i fell into another dark place convinced she cheated. she says i‚Äôm over analyzing and that she hid it because she was afraid i‚Äôd over react. that was six months ago and i still struggle daily. the ddj mind is loves to analyze to the point that it seems like paranoia. has he been deeply hurt in the past? if you plan to be with him, 100% openness is ideal and it sounds like you have been. the ddj mind will find a reason to no believe almost anything, just like the lie detector test you took (i‚Äôm not surprised he doesn‚Äôt believe the results). my wife agreed to take one but i know it will only help me for a short amount of time. it‚Äôs like the ddj mind likes to focus on the slightest chance of something bad happening (i.e. cheating) instead of facts or evidence to the contrary. please don‚Äôt feel weak, you are very strong for dealing with this. one thing to consider is your own mental health. i‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt want to look back and regret staying. he does need serious help/or medication. if you plan to stay know it will be a roller-coaster ride (as you already know). how does he react to misunderstandings? does he turn them into ‚Äúyou cheated‚Äù? i wish this sight was more active. google othello syndrome. there is a fb group for it. i hope this helps and that you‚Äôre doing better. i‚Äôll check back soon.\n",

      "Text: what will happen to the sufferer long time suffering ddj hello there. my mother has suffered from delusional disorder for about 20 years now, starting around age 45. the delusions have grown over time. it started as somatic type (resembling hypochondria). then, after ten years, she revealed that she also believes my father (her husband) was trying to poison/harm/kill her (persecutory dd). it's pretty much torn apart the family. she's kicked my dad out of the family home. he's stuck in limbo with a temporary housing arrangement for a few years now. in spite of his wondering, i don't think he'll ever be able to go back. my mother would be in constant fear, and my dad would have to live with constant accusations. they're both better off apart. note: she did have some improvement with medication (abilify), about ten years ago, but she stopped taking it after a couple of months. she won't even consider taking medication now. there are some periods, when if she's distracted from her delusions, she can seem normal and happy. but when i'm with her, i have to stay on my toes the entire time, constantly steering the conversation over to neutral topics like politics and weather.\n",

      "Text: is this considered delusional? so to start i have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, but i have a very intense fear of psychosis & schizophrenia. my father had major depressive disorder with psychotic features, but never schizophrenia or anything. with him things would get out of hand if his depression went unchecked. i don't really get much depression like my father did (just little minor episodes). but i do fear that i have delusional thoughts. to add to this its because of my past drug use (mainly pot, and psychedelics). i tend to get extremely deep thoughts. my thought process gets really deep. like for some reason i have the feeling of the universe just making sense. i'm not saying i believe i \"understand\" how everything works, but i get the feeling that things just click in a very un-logical way. like if us humans stopped thinking logically then we could begin to understand the point of life without the black and white filter of our own logic. before i touched drugs i was very over analytical. i'm a computer software engineer so its in my personality to think things are either ones or zeros. but after i tripped for the first time i saw things were not so black and white. things had color, and i felt kind of \"enlightened\" and felt there was something else to this life. this feeling of \"enlightened\" isn't always good either. i get really deep into thought and how the universe works that i feel it could be signs of delusions of grandeur which is a sign of psychosis. so i ask am i just a really deep thinker, or could this be signs of psychosis?\n",

      "Text: xiexieniii, from what you wrote i made an educated guess that you are rather young, maybe in your twenties, right? based on that and the content of your delusions (ideas of reference, thought insertion and other rather bizzare delusions towards the end) this doesn't sound like classic delusional disorder to me (this is not professional opinion, obviously). note that that's not necessarily bad - from what i have seen/read, even people with schizophrenia which is responsive to medication and well controlled are often better off than those with supposedly milder diagnosis of delusional disorder who are left untreated. i found literature references to psychotic episodes that were \"one time only\" and even to spontaneous recovery so i guess there is still much we don't know about how psychosis actually gets triggered. are you still seeing psychiatrist? imo it would be good idea to have some continued contact with psychiatrist while you are off the medication so that any signs of reccurence can be caught early. another thing you might want to investigate now when you feel well is whether your state has concept of psychiatric advance directive document - that could help ensure that you can get treatment if you get into another psychotic episode even if you lose insight. best wishes to you and feel free to post here as often as you like.i am always happy to hear from someone who came out of the tunnel, so to speak...\n",

(it's a damn good thing i did not actually act upon my feelings, even though i was certain they wanted me and certain it was a match.) so when the risperdal hit me, and when i realized that not a single one of them was actually communicating any secret messages of love to me, i was heartbroken! the sense of knowing what they were trying to do to me was so incredibly real... now that i am sobered up, i hang out with some of these people (to this day they have no idea what i was interpreting from their benign actions) and sometimes, all i can wish is that the delusions had been real. it was a very foul trick my mind had played on me. i really thought they liked me back. i also had a delusion that a friend was trying to sexually harass me. even though i'm \"sober\" now, and the action of him looking at his watch means absolutely nothing to me (when i was delusional it meant he wanted to kiss me), i can still recall the feeling of being uncomfortable quite clearly. for me, i don't think these delusions will ever return so i've actually stopped seeing my doctor altogether. if i do relapse in the future, that's fine by me -- at least then i might be able to get a solid diagnosis. but for now, it's just a mystery.\n",

      "Text: help for a friend so, for a while now, a very closed friend whom i've know for 10 years has been experiencing what i believe to be psychotic episodes. she is female, early to mid twenties. for a fairly long time she had reported believing people plot against her, but now she's has a very complex explanation of motives and honestly bizarre events surrounding one specific person she has a working relationship with. her speech has been confused and hard to comprehend, she's been wearing strange clothes and not taking enough care of how she looks - i'm talking about basic human care, not anything stereotypic of women. she has admitted to two friends she's afraid of being called schizophrenic and sent to a mental hospital, which is why she doesn't communicate a lot about all that's been going on. her family is not supportive and they have more than once invalidated her requests to see a doctor or a therapist (she is still dependant upon her parents). of course i'm not giving her a diagnosis myself, but i believe she has dd and think it's really important that she goes to a psychiatrist who can properly evaluate it and give her medication. she doesn't recognize her experiences as delusions (me and other friends have talked about it and it's clear that she really has nothing real to support her beliefs). what could be made to help her find medical care and how could it be made? i really am afraid her family might put her in a bad mental hospital and leave her there forever... you see me trying to climb on this pole, but i'm just hiding the pain that's deep in my soul.\n",

      "Text: delusional jealousy? firstly, it is not your fault. my wife had to put up with me doing similar things when i was acutely ill. so the next thing is to see it for what it is - an illness. it does not matter whether or not you are faithful - the issue is what his mind does with the possibility that you are that exists in every relationship. so, once again, it is not your fault at any level. it is very hard on the sufferer of the disorder, but also on their loved ones as you are finding out the hard way. firstly, get him to see a good clinical psychologist who can try some cognitive behavioural therapy. the advice i received was that the spouse's reassurance never works, but makes matters worse: if there was reassurance then it meant the spouse took the allegation seriously. other things that worked for me were that the 'checking' behaviour had to stop. there was a seemingly irrisistable urge to 'check' in many different ways, but if i resisted, then the urge passes. get help for yourself too. from your doctor and a clinical psychologist, who should be able to help you through this to wherever it leads you. get him to see a psychiatrist, too. i recovered from the jealousy, mostly. but then the illness found other outlets - such as persecutory beliefs. so therapy is unlikely to be the answer on its own. i took anti-psychotics for a while, but they did not really work. for me, this only resolved once when i took b-group supplements - blackmore's executive stress. i suspect the supplements work in me because i have a metabolic disorder that responds to the way the supplements inhibit ornithine degarboxylase and get rid of excess ammonia. but severe vitamin deficiency alone can cause these type of symptoms e.g. pellagric psychosis. if you intend to try any form of supplement treatment, discuss it first with his doctor to ensure it is safe for him. supplements are drugs like any other and have side effects and risks, and they are less well researched than many drugs. also, ensure his doctors investigates the possible causes of the disorder by carrying out appropriate tests which should be performed, subject to the doctor's advice, before he trys any supplements or drugs. to my mind, these tests should include but not be limited to in order of importance to my mind: 1. serum amino acids; 2. b vitamins, but particularly vitamins b6 and b3 and b12; 3. urine amino acids; 4. metabolic screen; 5. heavy metals screen; 6. fbc. your doctor may say that the serum amino acids are not likely to establish a treatable cause of the disorder. however, there is a lot of evidence that abnormal amino acid biomarkers may turn out to be crucial biomarkers of underlying metabolic disorders that cause psychiatric and neuro-degenerative disorders. there is a lot of good quality research that says that these disorders often present with patterns of serum amino acid abnormalities. when doctors understand what the abnormal patterns mean, the disorders become metabolic and are no longer regarded as psychiatric. there are likely to be multiple different metabolic disorder that cause psychiatric conditions. my abnormalities were repeat low serum amino acid ornithine and low serum amino acid serine, with high b3 intermediary and high b6. my doctors regarded these as being in effect meaningless results because they did not understand them, but after researching my abnormal results and my disorder (i do not recommend patients do this and do say that if they do this they should do so under the direct supervision of their doctor and only if their doctor does not advise against it), i established that my disorder may find expression in up-regulation of a cortisol up-regulated pathway that probably leads from proline to ornithine decarboxylase to polyamines. this up-regulation explains these and other abnormal results that i have and is currently being investigated by my doctors, so i could yet be wrong about this. your partner probably does not have my disorder, but his disorder may be caused by a metabolic derangement and he may or may not have different abnormal biomarkers. if he does have abnormal biomarkers such as amino acids then they are probably not currently understood, but it is better to know what they are so that when they are understood by doctors better targetted treatment can be provided. if drugs or supplements work, they are more likely to be targetting ameliorating symptoms than the cause, until the underlying cause of the disorder is better understood, so treatment can be targetted at the cause. i am mostly hapilly married with a young son, so whilst i am looking at life differently these days, there is hope it can turn out well. best wishes\n",

      "Text: what treatmant has been successful? our mother suffers from delusional disorder. it has manifested itself over a period of 5 or 6 years. she is pretty much normal in every other way. we finally convinced her to see a psychiatrist in january. we were able to do this by convincing her that at least the doctor could give her something to manage the stress she was experiencing from her tormenters. her delusions are persecutory. the doctor started her on a low dose of abilify but then her delusional characters took her medicine. when she was able to get it refilled, she started taking it again but then she said it started making her sick. i am wondering if any of the members of this forum have had success with any particular medication. i am also curious if psychotherapy has produced any noticeable improvement. i know her doctor at this time is just trying to achieve trust with her. we as family just try to get her mind off of the delusions. another doctor advised me not to reinforce her delusions by adding more locks to her home etc. how has this worked for other family members with delusional disorder?\n",

      "Text: what treatmant has been successful? hi, i have some strategies that work for me. 1. reality checking. i use my relationships with the people around me to confirm if what i think is happening is in fact real. i only tell my most trusted friends and family things. 2. i try to take my medication every day. i always relapse when i forget for more than a week. 3. i managed to form a language of my own to interpret \"messages\" that i get. it is a language of love and that has limited characteristics in it. it works for me, but i'm an erotomaniac, so it kinda turns me on and may in some ways make me more vibrant. 4. build your support network of people you can call and talk to. having social bonds makes it so much better when you need to figure out what is going on. even if you don't want to share about your symptoms, just talking with someone else can be theraputic. 5. do something you enjoy doing. it will help you stay positive, and it will take you outside of your internal battle. sometimes distraction is a good medicine (if you have gotten to the point where you can master the \"messages\" coming at you). 6. did i mention to set reminders to take the medication? i'm never sick when i remember the medication regularly. 7. it took me several medications before i found one that fit my chemistry. good luck. sunny \"i trust that if i start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -sunnyg\n",

      "Text: what treatmant has been successful? hello all, i have been living with this problem since i was 17 i am now 45. when i had my first outbreak i did not beleive anyone who told me, my thoughts were not true. but after a few years i started to learn how to deal with this problem. i thought my friends mother was out to kill me and i was sure of it. there are little things i see that put 2 + 2 together for my delusions to get bigger. i realize i even make up things so everything makes sense in my head. what i try to do is pick out the things that dont fit. that makes me calm down. for example someone rang my door bell and i was in the height of an episode, i thought he was there to kill me and my family. he said he was a salesman. so i thought to myself if he really is a sales man he will be going to other doors too. so i followed him to make sure he was going door to door. once i saw that i calmed down a bit. it seems the older i get the more frequent i get these episodes. sometimes it goes for a year sometimes a month without fear. when i do get them they seem to last for at least 2 months. i think that is because nothing i think is actually happening so i give up on the theory. but they never entirely go away. i started to take the drug fluanxol it is an injection that i get every 2 weeks. i have not taken the drug for about 4 months now and i am again in the hight of an episode. i did not want to take the drug because it makes me feel like jumping out of my skin. they give me side effect medication but it makes me into a zombie(cant think straght). i will have to endure the side effects because i realize i must take this drug. i am also an alcoholic i drink at least 8 beer a day. this is to stop the feelings and thoughts i have. i still have the thoughts when drinking but i am much calmer and i start not to care what will happen. well thats my situation. if any one has any questions post them here i will come back to see. read moschizophrenia forum - persecutory delusional disorder http://ehealthforum.com/health/topic109 ... z1vdiqfd5o\n",

      "Text: ddj husband asking for divorce i am feeling so sad and down today. my ddj husband has been having an episode since father's day weekend, actually maybe longer, its hard to tell anymore as the episodes come closer together and last and last. we have been together 18 years, married 14 years, and i believe this disorder has affected him for at least the last 12-13 years. he was always very jealous and controlling, but i attributed that to issues we had before the marriage. he has been tossing around the idea of divorce off and on for a week or more now, not the first time for that. but it is only the second time that i have been so worn down by this, that i have not been broken down by the threat. i love him, we have 4 children, well two of them are from a previous relationship of mine, they are 19 and 18, and he has raised them since they were 2 and 1. our two children together are 12 and 4. i have tried and fought all these years to keep our family together. i have taken a lie detector test, offered to take more, dealt with emotional, verbal, and sometimes physical abuse, etc... i have prayed, begged, bargained with god to fix him and us. i feel like he has an illness which is not his fault, and if he had cancer, i would not leave him for that, just because of the stress it put on me. so, i have always felt guilty even considering leaving our marriage when he is obviously sick. he will not go get help. he has promised to in the past and has said he would a few times the past week, but i doubt he will stick with that. he had secret social media accounts where he talked to women behind my back. i am not allowed to even look at another man. these came to light last year after he contacted a close relative's ex girlfriend with the secret account and she immediately told on him. he was convinced that my family had a hand in that because in his mind there was no way she would have done that. i found a message that he sent to a young woman telling her that he \"would give anything for all of her love\". it was soul crushing. i screamed and yelled and told him to leave that i wanted him out but he would not. he blamed me for all of it, saying that i was a cheat and he deserved better. he ended up moving out a couple of weeks later, after discovering i had set up a new bank account and paypal account for myself and had applied for some credit cards in my name, in order to set up some type of financial security for myself (i only had $100 in the bank account and $7 in paypal.) but he accused me of stealing from him and decided that he needed to leave me and start a new life. so he was gone for a couple of weeks but came back home, made me quit my job that i had just started, because he will not let me keep a job, and made promises to seek counseling. he saw a therapist twice, and claimed the therapist told him he couldn't see a marriage counselor and him because insurance wouldn't cover both. but he claimed the therapist had agreed to see us together. i went to his third and last appointment with him. it became pretty obvious that he had been lying to me and the therapist and the therapist immediately came to my defense. that was the end of our counseling. i feel cheated. i have loved him all these years, sacrificed for him by having no friends, no outlets, and controlled and limited time with my family. i have given him 18 years of my life. i have not been allowed to dress nice or keep up my appearance. i have gained weight and not been allowed to diet without accusations and threats. he has worn down my self image and confidence by his many put downs over the years. everything we own is in his name. he controls everything. he has told me that he will leave me the house so that our kids will have a home, but that's it. he said he will make sure the kids are taken care of. he bought a very lovely piece of land right by a river, that was basically both of our dreams to have one day. he is going to move a trailer to it and live in that paradise while i am stuck in a neighborhood that i hate and have been begging for him to move us out of for years. we have another piece of land out in the country that we could have put a house on for years, but he would never do it. he says that will remain his as well. he has made statements to me before that he didn't want me to have anything nice. i don't even have a car. if i say anything, i am called a greedy, selfish, gold digger, plus many other expletives. i have never had anything nice that i could call my own, because i have not been allowed it by him. maybe its petty of me to complain about material things, but it is part of life and it is hard to function without a vehicle in a small rural community with no mass transit. i only complain about these things, because i could have had things on my own by now, had i been allowed to work and buy things for myself. i know that he did not allow me to do that as a control thing, but i didn't raise too much hell about it because i didn't expect to be 40 years old and having to start over. i really wish there was some way to get him to seek help. i have personally diagnosed him but he has never been diagnosed by a professional. he told me today that i just wanted to dope him up so that it would be easier for me to cheat on him. i am sad because i truly see no hope at this point. he refuses treatment, so what can i do? i know everyone will say, let him leave, good riddance, etc... but this man has been my world for 18 years and it is hard to just walk away from that. i feel broken.\n",

      "Text: ddj husband asking for divorce hi feelinglost123, i had a ddj fiance. it was so soul-crushing to go through his \"episodes\" with him....i can only imagine how much harder it is when you've been married for many years and have children together. i think that feeling broken and crushed and terrible is completely normal in a situation like this, and there is not really any way to avoid it. you're gonna have really bad days. but i do think it is super important for you right now to get some space apart from him. i totally understand not wanting to \"punish\" him for his illness....but staying around isn't helping him anyway. and it's really harming you. if anything, maybe there is a way to get a friend of his, or a family member, to check in on him once you've gone. he might respond better to the caring expression of someone he is not deluded about. i understand how emotionally wrenching this is for you, not to mention how much it sucks to be unfairly accused of so many things, not to mention the prospect of having to start over from scratch with no closure and no advantage. it's $#%^ luck, but the sooner you take a step toward your future, the better. how are the kids about this? have they seen your husband's jealousy or does he hide it from everyone except you? sending love to you.\n",

      "Text: i know i suffer from ddj but now there a few red flags hi, i suffer from ddj and have for a long time in various relationships. my ddj was/is very strong but every now and then i‚Äôd usually have an idea deep inside that it was my imagination and my jealousy that made me so suspicions. i was always looking for evidence of some kind. unfortunately that changed recently when i found some text messages on my wife‚Äôs phone from a former co-worker. i could tell the previous message threads them between had been deleted. needless to say i concluded she was sleeping with him. i did not confront her though. all of the messages i saw where innocent type conversation, nothing sexual, although he offered her a massage on message and added a lol to it at the end, she did not reply. a few weeks later i eventually confronted her about the situation to which she said answered a few questions correctly but lied about his name. i told her i knew she was lying, etc and told her i was going to divorce her (did i over react?). after 5 days of no speaking to each other we eventually sat down and talked. she said she knows she was wrong and that she knows she hurt me (she knows i struggle to trust, i‚Äôve been cheated on before by 2 other woman but also had ddj before that‚Ä¶.ironic) but she was scared because she thought i‚Äôd have a jealous reaction and that is why she lied about his name and never told me about him. i told her i needed transparency and open communication and for us to get on the same phone plan, etc. she agreed and she told me that since the day we met she have never been with anyone else but me. however after our talk i noticed she google searched how to not have contacts show up on an i-pad and she did delete him from our i-pad contacts and it was not because she didn‚Äôt plan to talk to him again. i just recently started using the i-pad a few weeks ago, she‚Äôs used it for a year. so to my point, i read a post a few years ago about a guy who suffered from ddj. he said all the signs of a cheating spouse were there and he was convinced his so was cheating on him. then for some reason he realized it was him and he explained it in great detail. i keep looking for the post but can‚Äôt find it. also, i‚Äôd really like to hear from anyone who had a situation like mine above where something similar happened and the results turned out innocent. i know i suffer from ddj but i can‚Äôt over look this. thanks\n",

      "Text: delusions of the past hi grandcyan11, welcome to psychforums, i hope you find this place as supportive and helpful as i have over the years. diagnosis in mental health are less important than you'd think, as long as you find an effective medication that reduces or resolves symptoms, therapy, support, and positive coping strategies... i think that is the part that is important. at this point in my history being \"diagnosed\" with mental illness, they have changed the diagnosis to include every diagnosis in the family. bottom line___ these doctors are using symptoms to define the illness rather than finding the real cause and diagnosing the way medicine should work. *even the nih has realized their use of the dsm in mental health research is wasteful... basically, for decades physicians have labeled symptoms - for billing purposes, and then treating mental illness using broad categories rather than finding the biological, social history, or environmental source of the illness. i understand mental illness is complicated, but generations of people have been labeled and basically dismissed by this. society gave up on trying to understand what was happening biologically because of this society's acceptance of the apa's flawed labeling system that doesn't have a valid scientific meaning based in biology. think of susannah cahalan in her book brain on fire where her parents didn't give up on finding a reason for her illness - her disease was cured. for the rest of us, as we fumble through the mental health system, the doctors use diagnosis to experiment on us with categories of drug classes until they hopefully find a medication that works. i mean, i guess the mood stabilizers are important for mood elements, and the anti-psychotics for psychosis, the anti-depressants for depression, etc... you get my point. honestly, i'm glad my diagnosis of severe mental illness was delayed with less severe sounding illnesses like you describe being used in my early days... like postpartum depression, delusional disorder, or psychosis with possible mood elements. i know it's hard to feel the weight of stigma from a mood illness when you feel more affinity to the delusional portions. i totally understand. i will say, on the positive side, the mood disorder support groups i've attended are more fun. thankfully with medication, therapy, and a wonderful network of supportive individuals in my life, i do well. i've been in recovery for over a decade. sunny \"i trust that if i start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -sunnyg\n",

      "Text: delusions of the past hi , i read your posts and they have given me real hopes . my boyfriend is going through exactly what you went through. its a nightmare . its been just 4 months . you took 4 years . some take forever . i have realized by now its a long long way to go . unless my boyfriend makes up his mind to never talk to me like hes been doing almost everyday for the last 4 months and actually does it . so heres my story , we're 19 and have known each other for more than 6 years now and have been in a relationship for almost 3 years . it started with him accusing me of having an affair with all his friends . he accused me with them one at a time . and then when he couldn't find any proof he jumped to the conclusion that i along with his family and all his close friends are talking behind his back and are planning something for him or against him . its a nightmare of constant accusations and questioning. there are days where i feel like lying to him and telling yes there is something and make up a fake story and end this! but i know thats not the right thing to do and will just worsen things. the main problem in my situation is ... his friends talking about things to him which sometime coincide with something he has told me in private . for example , he told me about a weird dream he had with me and person . a in it around 2 months ago .. a few days ago his friend told him about him having a weird dream about person a .. person a and my boyfriends friend are friends . the blame is all on me now. i told his friend about the dream and now his friend is trying to tease him . there have been quite a few instances like these which can be mere coincidences which have completely strengthened his belief that weve been conspiring against him . i really love him and i know he loves me equally . all the important people in his life are the villans right now and since im the most important person to him . im his main target to get to know the \"truth\" . he thinks breaking up with me will be the best way out since hell have the toxic person out of his life and him not being with me will be punishment enough for me. he breaks up and then comes back asking the same question to tell me the truth . and when i tell him what bes thinking is wrong he gets aggressive and leaves again . i dont know what to do ! i dont understand what im being punished for . its very difficult to see him like that. he says im the only one who can calm him down and make him happy . i go to him everytime he needs me because i love him and that is why i cant leave him in this difficult time of his life . but again he thinks im taking all of the suffering because im guilty . he has been to several psychologists and psychiatrists but there has been no change in his thinking. he thought they were involved in the conspiracy too . he saw one recently on his own so that he could make sure hes legit. he doesnt want to tell me about how it went. but since his thinking hasnt changed im sure it was ineffective . i dont want to involve my parents in this situation and from whatever little they know they want me to stay away from him . it gets really difficult at home too . im swinging between my mother and boyfriend. i just need an answer to the question ' what do i do now'? he's been on some medication which calms him a little and helps him sleep . but the delusions are still strong as ever . could you please tell me from the point of view of the person with the delusions what would you have liked to hear and treated when you were ill. what medication helped you ? and do the delusions really go away? for does medication and treatment just stop it from happening further . please help.\n",

      "Text: paranoid about encryption to the point of suicide *tw* hello all..... i am a fan of encryption tools that are apparently monitored by various government agencies. i am very very very very worried i am going to be labeled as a terrorist and killed due to this. i have never ever done anything remotely illegal and i love this country very much and am a proud american, and i use these tools for safety and security and privacy while online. when i say \"encryption tools\", i am talking about more \"extreme\" measures such as using tor and tails and truecrypt and pgp, all of which there are rumors going around that the government thinks anyone who uses these is a terrorist. i am not, and as i said, i am a very very proud american and i despise terrorism! now onto how this affects me. a few weeks ago, i almost *mod edit* due to psychotic episodes i have been having. one was so real, i heard someone talking (while awake) about me and how i should be hunted down and killed for using these tools. it has only gotten worse, to the point that i am convinced random people in the store are fbi agents coming after me and i see people where there are none. and the worst part is, they seem so real. i cannot function properly in my daily life because i experience these psychotic episodes and spend nearly every waking moment freaking out about being interrogated at airports and being stalked. i am in circumstances where it would not be favorable for me to go to a psychiatrist and talk about this, because i would be viewed as insane and off my rocker. as a note, i am not interested in stopping the use of the tools, as they make me feel like i have privacy online. i want to live in peace and in harmony with nature, my community, my country, and my government. as of right now, i am not using any drugs that would cause this kind of paranoia. please, i need help. i want to be a happy american. i am loyal to my country and want to be treated as such. last edited by seabreezeblue on fri jan 19, 2018 11:41 pm, edited 2 times in total. reason: small edit to remove graphic detail, and poll removed due to triggering nature.. trigger warning added to title..no further edits.\n",

      "Text: husband with persecutory delusional disorder, can you help? hello all, i was wondering if any of you can help me out. my husband is not diagnosed and won't entertain the idea of going to a doctor either. his symptoms are similar to rest of persecutory dd but it seems it comes and goes and it is not that extreme as other described. basically main things are he believes they are after him and there are cameras with audio everywhere in our apartment, cars, phones, etc. he thinks they are at his job and he is being taunted everyday by everyone. he believes there are live streams of our lives and we are filmed being intimate, taking showers, etc. he can go weeks without even mentioning it and then all of the sudden he will talk about this for few days. it really gets him depressed and causes anxiety. at one point he was questioning me thinking i am part of this but that passed. as of right now he only trusts me. he thinks his parents and my parents are part of this surveillance and he is stuck. he believes he can't get a better job because new job will know immediately that he is being filmed etc. recently he is focused on how this is unfair to me and that i shouldn't be married to him anymore and his best bet is to move out and live in his car to \"protect me\". at first i believed him (it started mild, about 2 years ago) and tried to find solutions with him. scanned and upgraded our phones, scanned laptop, etc. then we looked for cameras everywhere but he thinks they are some military cameras so they are tiny and we won't find them anyway. i brought up a topic of delusional disorder and seeing a doctor. he got really angry at me and said that he is very disappointed that i don't trust him. he is 100% sure this is real and he said that they want him to go to doctor so he can be labeled as \"crazy\". he used to go to therapist for his depression and anxiety (that is gone.. i think) but he wouldn't ever open up about this spying issue because he was convinced that they are also at his therapist and he did not feel safe. we are young, he just turned 30 and i am few years younger. we don't have lots of money to keep going to different doctors. i am devastated because i keep hoping it will go away but it didn't and i don't think i will. i have been looking at this forum for months now but today on the phone he said something new. he said that this will blow up once they are done with him and something horrible will happen. i am worried what he means by it and that he will talk himself into doing something stupid. please help me, any advice?\n",

      "Text: reoccurring jealous delusions held so i am a new member here, i came after searching \"my girlfriend is delusional\", and a thread here came up. i am just looking for any possible insight to what i am dealing with, and though this forum doesn't seem very active i think worst case i get to unload a little bit. it's not something i am really able to talk to anyone in my life about. so i have been in a long distance relationship with a girl i met online for about a year now, and she has told me that this christmas will be our last time seeing eachother. the main delusion she seems to have is that i am stalking one of her former friends on instagram. this one was probably the first red flag that came up, and has continued to be the most persistent and damaging idea that she holds regarding me. there is some girl who was at one point her friend on instagram, who for some reason i don't understand my girlfriend despises now. my gf believes that i am obsessed with this girl and thinks that i am spending all day looking at this girl's pictures. the truth is i never have looked once, not out of respect for my gf even, i honestly don't care about social media at all. it isn't really my thing. i'm not going to become infatuated with anyone on social media as far as i'm concerned, for it even to be possible i would have to know them. so i will spend hours arguing in my own defense over this, asking why she thinks this, and she will say that the things that me and this random girl tend to talk about and specific words we use are too similar to be coincidence. like i have had her turn on me for using the word \"good\". my gf says she knows when someone is lying to her, and that she \"knows what i'm up to\". sometimes she will just say that, that she knows what i'm doing, and refuse to elaborate. there are other times where she will be insecure and weirdly jealous, like when we are out she will get upset any time i appear to look at a woman, assume the worst, and think i only look at other women because i am not into her. to me that seems like normal jealousy though, because there is at least a grain of truth there in that i do look at other women. the main thing that seems to prevent her from trusting me though, and the thing that she has broken up with me several times over, is this delusion where i am stalking this random girl on instagram. like at best i will be able to get her to table it, and admit that she feasibly could be wrong only because there is no evidence, but that never lasts and that partial admission never makes me feel any better. before long she is 100% certain of it again and expects a confession, insists that i am a liar, and says that if i would confess we could work it out. i was planning to move to another country to be with this girl, and honestly nobody has ever made me feel happy and satisfied in my life like she does. after reading some accounts here i am really starting to believe that things are extremely unlikely to work, and it would be better if i cut ties. i think that some of this is relatively moderate, and we often just write it off to stress from being apart so often, but more and more i think that things will only get worse for us. i just wish i could help and am extremely frustrated, but it doesn't seem like there is anything i can do, and i can never realistically expect her to have trust in me. i feel like i am abandoning her, even though she is the one who keeps breaking up with me, but i don't know what else to do.\n",

      "Text: i imagine people and talk to them continuously i don't know when it first started but for as long as i can remember i have talked to people \"inside my head\", so to speak. when i was in elementary school i would often imagine people i liked, maybe boys i had crushes on etc. whenever i was alone home or just wherever i would imagine them being with me and had conversations with them. as i grew older the people i would imagine often changed, and so did the circumstances. i would talk out loud, maybe a loud whisper when i talked to them. when i was in middle school i started imagining idols and people i looked up to or just thought that had really fun personalities. the people i talked with didn't even know i existed but in the situations i created we were often best friends or living together etc. i'm now 17 and i still do this, but lately i have been more and more aware of it. another thing that worries me is that my thoughts tend to get mixed with reality and well - them. they are with me constantly, even when i talk out loud to communicate with them or not. even when i'm watching netflix or youtube or whatever and not really focusing on anything else - for me they're still there, reading a book or maybe watching with me. if i'm having a conversation with someone (that actually exist) i sometimes blurt out something weird that has nothing to do with the context of the conversation we're having at all. for example - some time ago i was on a cabin trip with my (now ex) boyfriend, and we were under the covers of a bed talking about how hot the room was. and as he commented the heat i simply answered \"but shouldn't it be cold in la by now?\". i live in norway and have never had anything to do with la whatsoever. i said this without even thinking cause in my mind i was currently on a trip to la with the people i usually tend to imagine - this was how i imagined the whole cabin trip. normally people just brush it off and laugh or give me weird grimaces whenever this happens, cause i'm known to be quite the clumsy, outgoing person. when this first happened i didn't give it much thought, but now it kind of worries me. the situations i imagine now are often played out in the future, or at least a different now. i'm good friends with this group of idols i keep imagining since april now, and since i'm known to a certain degree, i'm often at interviews making people laugh etc. it sounds really weird and i tend not to think too much about the situations when i'm aware. personally i don't think it's unhealthy or whatever, i love communicating with them and being with them makes me happy. if anything, i'm quite happy about it, considering i'm always looking forward to being with them and so on. i'm not antisocial or anything, and have too many friends for my own good, so it's not influencing my social life. if i'm invited to a party or a cabin trip or whatever, i always imagine it being them who invited me and that's what i'll be looking forward to too. i don't really consult anyone at all about my personal issues or well, anything. in all my (soon) 17 years of life i have only opened up this last month. i talked to two of my friends about two different issues. one being my childhood and the other one this issue about the people in my head. the friend i consulted about the people and the situations i imagine said i should go see someone just in case this was something unhealthy which should be dealt with. she knows about my childhood, and said that it might have something to do with that. i am unsure if this has anything to do with my \"issue\" or not, but i'll explain it just in case. when i was younger i used to get beaten and scolded a lot by my parents. as i grew older the abuse would decrease. recently my parents divorced and now i only live with my mother. we have a really good relationship and i'm happy. i'm often left alone a lot at home, though. my mom is often at work or with her boyfriend, and my older sister usually stays at her boyfriend's apartment. when it comes to my mental health i'm usually happy but have periods where i'm seriously depressed. i've been diagnosed with winter depression so it's often that time of the year its worst. so i guess that was the most of it. i could consult a psychiatrist in my city but i'm just so unsure if i need to or not. so if you have any knowledge or experience about this or something similar, maybe even just some advice - please help me!\n",

      "Text: i imagine people and talk to them continuously this sounds like maladaptive daydreaming to me, which is something i do frequently, and i've done it since i can remember, i'm now 26. i have a history of abuse and neglect in childhood, and abuse in adulthood as well. like ubinix800 said, for me personally, loneliness and detachment are major influences for how often and how intensely i engage in this. i've heard it's a form of dissociation. when i was younger, in my teenage years, i had such a rich imaginary life, that i would list important dates of my imagined friends i had relationships with and i would also draw the house i imagined i lived in, places i went, etc. on a couple of occasions, i contacted the actual real people (like celebrities) i had imaginary friendships with, imagining that we had such a bond that they would contact me back and this would begin the real friendship and save me from my current situation. recently, i had to make a point of being more mindful throughout the day, because i had been escaping my entire life through this daydreaming. i was irritated when anyone interrupted my time with my imagined world and could not accomplish anything. i think if it gets to that point, it can be unhealthy. but, if you're functioning well, still care for your other relationships, self care, and any responsibilities that you may have, then i think it's completely ok. maybe explore if you believe it is an escape for you. if it is, then what are you escaping from? ‚Äúthe best way to escape reality without running, is smiling even though, it is obviously fake.‚Äù devil‚Äôs little sister\n",

      "Text: i have something i need to get out!!! hi, i am an 18 yr old man, i have been diagnosed w/ a mild case of psychosis, although i really think i just need to adjust my thinking in order to resolve it... that said i have become convinced that i am affecting the world's population with my actions, and i feel a very strong need to say something about it...i feel like saying this to everyone. if you care, if you want to help in any way, then please read all of it... everyone in this world, on this planet earth, especially in america, please listen to my words... i have, truthfully, become very, very, very stressed over all of this in the past few months. and i can tell other people felt that way, too... it isn't what i want. i'm gonna say exactly what i want, not what im feeling, not the anger or sadness that that i feel, not something crazy. i want people to disregard my past words and actions. i don't like vulgar, greedy, or arrogant people, as a matter of fact, those traits are without a doubt, 3 of the most disgusting traits on the earth. the opposite are some of the best... empathetic, not greedy, clean in their actions and their hearts, open to others' perspectives. people with those traits are already pretty good, worth while, model people. in addition, people who do hard work, solve problems instead of creating problems, and don't cause trouble for other people, are very deserving of respect; i will always value those traits in others, appreciate them, and feel respect for the people with those characteristics. people who make trouble for no reason are always sad, weak people, who can't achieve much in life. this world needs more of the good traits. on that same point, if anybody feels hatred, sadness, even happiness or anything else towards me because of my actions \"influencing your lives\" emotionally or psychologically, then stop. just stop, really. just stop-- don't feel this way. you shouldn't be concerned with me, or any of this, really; focus on useful information in life, critical thinking, working hard towards achieving your goals, and being happy. everybody has a right to happiness--especially the good people in the world. and the evil people--- the ones who are detrimental to society, who care only about themselves, who don't care about the suffering of others, who hold bad traits such as vulgarity, arrogance, greed, who hold hatred, anger, or violence--- people like that will be incredibly unhappy. people even similar to that will find only depression, and ultimate failure. the one's who act deceptive, use others, try to make the world worse, those people are the most worthless, and they will definitely falter, fall, fail, until they change. people who worsen other's lives, will suffer from sadness. and the ones who know they are bad people, but choose not to change, or are proud---they will never find happiness or satisfaction, or true success. they will suffer and fall even harder. the good people-- who desire to solve our problems, help others, love peace, the people that, really want to do what's right, they will be the most motivated, the most passionate, the most successful, and the happiest. and that's because they deserve success. that's what i want, that's what i believe! racism is evil, and i believe black people and those who receive prejudice should portray themselves in a better way and convey themselves in a positive way. that's very important in my belief, and there are singers these days that flaunt their vulgarity, their wannabe \"toughness\", their gross lifestyles and basically spread their unlikable personalities. people who represent themselves in a bad way have affected views towards their entire ethnic group, and those people need to stop. show you're good qualities, your human qualities, your kind qualities. and people will respect those things. the weird things that people show interest in today are truly sad... people talking about porn and drugs as if they are normal things just disturbs me...i find it disgusting. how can some people be so gross? pot, is not too terrible; it helps some people, and relaxes. but drug use overall is bad and so is marijuana. the media today would be much, much more entertaining if they didn't display those things and almost flaunt them as often as they do. i think it's sad, and those kinds of things are detrimental to society. people please respect the taboo things in our society, some things are not meant to change. i want the good people in the world to succeed -- i always have. don't misconstrue my feelings. for the past month i've tried \"following my heart\" but it's turned out to be somewhat similar to just doing what i feel. i feel anger and frustation at times, but i don't wish for others to actually hurt. please, don't misunderstand my feelings, instead, listen to my words!!! i have said many things this past year, but 99% have just been emotions that i feel, meaning little and not conveying my thoughts at all. emotions are fleeting but beliefs are more permanent. i believe those who want goodness to win, people who don't hold anger or violence in their hearts, who respect hard work and always consider the lives and emotions of other people, who try to do what's best in any situation, the people who hold any one or more of these traits; i want to see more people like that in the media, i want to see those kinds of values succeeding in the world. i want the people who have standards like those to value them, and find motivation, find happiness, find strength, and success, so they can rise higher in the world. that's something i want---for the people who want to the do the right thing, to succeed! to get what they need. to solve their problems, and win at life. i desire that more than almost everything else in life--- for those people to succeed greatly in the world. and it makes me depressed to see the opposite---to see good-for-nothing, problem causing, conflict creating trashy people winning; it's one of the worst things to see, truthfully. motivation and happiness--- if the good individuals in the world have more it makes me feel a lot better. i love to see those people succeed. thanks for listening. i see people today, and in the past i've thought that the people today don't feel as much, or are more cold hearted than before, or don't feel as much happiness or depth in their feelings. but i know now that that isn't true. i know there is just as much depth to the hearts of good people as there is in mine. there is great happiness in their hearts, with real meaning and persistence. there's a ton of fight left in good people's hearts, i know. and i know that people feel the same emotions that they always have, and just as strongly---happiness, peace, relaxation, satisfaction, and all the rest. that's the way it should always be; i would not have it any other way. the depth in their hearts is immense. and with that, i'm done. i felt the need to say these things to, well, everyone--- and there's more i want to say but it's too much for just this forum. some things i say, they appear to go against the things that i stood for in the past. people misconstrued my messages in the past, while i did not speak in a clear way. these words are crystal clear; they are my true beliefs, the standards that i hold, the same beliefs i held a year ago, years ago, possibly my entire life. i have always felt the same but haven't been able to communicate it as well in the past... now, please, listen to the words i said here. it's the truth.\n",

      "Text: new member, delusion qualification hi, first post so i guess i need to wait for mod. to approve it before it goes up, that's okay, and thanks. i have a question about p.d. i know and have been diagnosed as mildly paranoid and delusional. i'm okay with that, and most of the time i have a decent grasp of what is and what is not \"real\". i'm 40, i am a sober alcoholic, i recently moved in with my mother and her husband of 25-ish years, they got married when i was about 12-14?? i don't want to give too much history that it skews the question, so here goes; when i was younger i thought my step dad hated me to the point of intentional emotional abuse, but when i talked about it or accused him he played dumb, and was very careful about not doing or saying anything that would incriminate him. often i was told i was acting out against him because he was a new step dad and that was normal. i sort of accepted that, and moved away very young. years years i had a psychotic break in january 2017, got treatment-help-therapy, felt pretty good. was diagnosed as paranoid, and self diagnosed as delusional. moved in with moms and sd, now i have this feeling again, that he is trying to hurt me, trying to make me question my morals and what i do. i'm 40 and physically uhhhh not intimidated nor mentally either. there are some scenarios that are definitely not delusion, but again not enough to seem malicious to anyone except to me, of course!! and it is only him, other people do not get to me, my normal delusions are spiritual in nature and/or apocalyptic. so the question is due, how do i know if this is my pd or if this is really happening? can i test it somehow? thanks, r\n",

      "Text: new member, delusion qualification it can be confusing when a person has a diagnosis of something like persecutory delusion, paranoid delusion, schizophrenia. it can also amplify the problem if not dealt with correctly. i had a breakthrough on this topic. one thing we the sick need to know is that we are not the only ones out there who are sick. and as most of us know or should know; hurt people, hurt people. with that said, what i realized was, that it wasn't a delusion, but it wasn't as personal as i had suspected. i thought it was all well thought out attack against my self. (so a contribution to my already existing condition) what it is, is that this person is severely passive/aggresive, and is unaware of it. it comes across as personalized because i live in self pity right? but in actuality it isn't meant that way at all, it is as a result of someone else not dealing with their issues, and inability to communicate. he is sick and that is okay, we all are right. thanks, ill hang around a little if that's okay, r\n",

      "Text: practical advice erotomanic delusion disorder i was hoping that someone who has a dd can provide advice on whether counseling or cognitive therapy without medicine can successfully treat a delusion disorder. my wife is erotomanic with grandiose elements. she believes she has a rich, powerful boyfriend that loves her dearly who sends her messages through songs, television, movies and other mass media. this condition has persisted chronically for nearly four years. i believe that this condition arose due to a psychotic break on what i believe to be a massive bipolar episode. consistent with a delusion disorder, she believes her version of reality and resists all logic and evidence to the contrary. she believes she is sane and thus will not take medication. she is completely in love with her delusion, and thus has only brotherly love for me. she will occasionally run off in search of her illusory paramour based on hidden messages in songs on the radio, only to return crestfallen. i have four options: just accept it, involuntarily commit her to force medication, divorce her, or try to get her to try psychotherapy (to which she is not opposed). does anyone have success with treating severe delusion disorder without antipsychotics ?\n",

      "Text: practical advice erotomanic delusion disorder i don't have dd, but from everything i've read, the answer is no. one book on delusional disorder said if you think this illness can be managed without medication and only using psychotherapy like cbt, then you've way underestimated this illness. first, antipsychotics, then psychotherapy as a supplement. getting them there is the hard part. read \"i'm not sick, i don't need help\" (if you haven't already) to learn how to get her to see a psychiatrist without telling her that she has an illness (or that she's crazy). you can always try to get them to see a therapist, using whatever reason you think would get them there. then preempt the appointment by letting the therapist know what's going on, so he/she can figure how to get your wife to see a psychiatrist. you have a tough road ahead of you. i couldn't get my now ex-wife to seek treatment.\n",

      "Text: practical advice erotomanic delusion disorder hi sister's keeper, i agree with herculeanhercules, medication is essential, and for me the longer my delusions went untreated the harder they are to rebound and recover from. it is impossible to forget the memories of the delusions that set in when i got sick after the birth of my daughter in 2005, that were treated long enough to clear a break, but then slowly crept into my memory bank. for me, medication is essential. the only type of therapy that i believe in other than taking an antipsychotic is love based community oriented therapy where people who love you share their truth. this is extremely hard to overcome - erotomania. sometimes even 11 years later i still have emotional feelings in response to the deeply seated memories i developed in my postpartum - i believed my physician loved me an was sending me secret messages in the form of wrong number phone calls. it took writing my truth in the form of a book that is \"fiction based on a true story\" i mean, how can you write a delusional memoir without calling it fiction? it also took releasing it into the world, years of continuous and rational choice to take medication and live in the reality people say is true, and the love and support of my friends and family to share their perception regarding my story. they couldn't understand my story when i tried to explain it in conversation, it was too challenging. so i learned to write. i spent 10 years crafting my story. i still take medication every day, and will probably need it for the rest of my life. today, i understand that the physician will never love me, and that my experience was a natural response to the trauma of an exam during childbirth, and the isolation i felt in a rural community. for me, learning to accept my illness was heart breaking, realizing you are delusional is very upsetting. the disillusionment of it is devastating, but i lived through it to live in recovery which for me is the desire to stay in reality with the people around me. the people who love me read \"i'm not sick and i don't need help\". they joined the national alliance of mental illness, and took the family to family course (which helped them learn how to help themselves and me). as for how you decide to live your life, that is a decision only you can make, because you have to be able to live with whatever you decide is best. hugs, sunny \"i trust that if i start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -sunnyg\n",

      "Text: are these dd symptoms... i've been accused of cheating since marriage and at first, i chalked it up as normal jealousy like all of my buddies talked about but they are all divorced now and ironically, i'm still the one married that never cheated and puts up with all of the accusations still because i love my wife for better or worse. i've thought about leaving and i decided to move out for a few months to see if a break would wake her back up to reality but that just led her into depression until i returned. since then, she promised to get help and do whatever it takes and acknowledged she has a problem. i never knew to how pervasive her thoughts were because she acts so normal until we go out and have drinks. she can't go out without drinking or she is anxious and bored and if she has one too many, the night goes from fun to accusations and conspiracy theories over anything i do! then i find out all about the thoughts she has been having all month that make her believe i'm cheating. anything can trigger these accusations and her logic behind everything never makes any sense and the next day she breaks down and cries and apologizes and realizes her story is so far fetched! then i forgive her..we make up and go on with our life until the next time we go out. the problem is, she can't stop these thoughts from entering her mind throughout the day but she doesn't react to them until we go out to a bar, club, party or even on vacation where we are around other people. it doesn't matter where we go, it could be all the way to cancun and if we meet some random nice couple and start to socialize, out of no where, i'm accused of personally knowing them and setting up this whole trip in order to meet them and make her look stupid. i've had to cancel trips and make up excuses why we leave friends parties or events as soon as i get accused of something. at first, i thought all girls were like this that are insecure but we've been married 25 years now and it's obvious to me not everyone is going through this much. so basically, we have no friends left because i've pretty much given up on trying to salvage any types of relationships. i've been living in a bubble like her, only focusing on work and family. i go straight to work and home and have gotten off facebook. no one knows or seems to care why because they think we are probably stuck up by now. no matter what i have done to prove my innocence, the issue still persists but we are now trying everything possible with natural remedies instead of prescription drugs. she is totally on board to try anything because she realizes now more than ever when others and our own kids have had to correct her accusations about me. one time, she thought i was up in a vip section of the club laughing and mingling with a group and when i showed up behind her after returning from the restroom, she was totally shocked how i could go from upstairs in the vip right behind her!! she thinks i'm a magician!!! she still tells me it's not rational but her mind still tries to figure out how i did that trick! another time, i decided to wear my punk rock ring i haven't worn for over 10 years out to the club and she thought some sort of mistress at the club gave it to me as a message to her and got so upset! she said i never owned that ring and thankfully, we took pictures of ourselves before leaving the house that night and when she saw the ring on my finger in the picture, she broke down crying and felt stupid!!!! but guess what!! soon after she still tried to figure out if i pulled another stunt to trick her!! like i wore it on purpose to make her think that way! i don't really want to give up going out, having friends and having a social life and we both enjoy traveling but it's like playing russian roullette planning, getting all excited, buying tickets, airfare, etc just to end up fighting and leaving, losing the money and feeling frustrated once more. i know one thing is for sure, alcohol does not help with this problem! she does not react to these thoughts all month, but when we go out and drink, she has no power over them and everything comes out and i never know what the trigger is going to be so i'm always on egg shells and can't be myself but then it's not right because it's perfectly ok for her to talk to others and laugh but if i do...something is up. no one knows she has this problem i'm dealing with because she covers it up really good in public but will start accusing me in my ear or with a look or pinch and that's when i know it's time to leave because i've tried reasoning with her and it just escalates. she doesn't trust me or anyone else when these thoughts occur and thinks everyone is laughing at her. is this delusional disorder or is there more to them?\n",

      "Text: my first post hi everyone! this is my first time finding this site and finding out about dd. i was researching online just trying to understand what my wife is going through mentally so i can be more helpful and this really sounds like what she might have. we haven't seen anyone about this but 10 years ago we did try a marriage counselor and all the female counselor did was reinforce her beliefs that i must be cheating because her beliefs sound real. we got married at 18 and have been married over 25 years. we were h.s. sweethearts and everything was good except the occasional jealousy and insecurities i thought was normal. it's kept getting worse over the years and it's been hard dealing with the jealousy, conspiracies, panic attacks, anxiety and isolation from friends and family because of it. i guess the warning signs were always there but i always thought her jealousy and insecurities were just normal so i tried to do everything possible like setting up gps on my phone so she knows where i am at all times! going to the gym at lunch so i have no life outside working hours! i will even give her my phone in a moments notice if i'm accused of anything. we do practically everything together! i mean, if you saw our life on facebook, you'll see that we are inseparable and always doing stuff together which would be great if i didn't also have to isolate myself from everyone. i certainly love being with my wife and all of the fun activities we do, but the problem is whenever we meet others, it triggers her jealousy and conspiracy thoughts against everyone. for example, we can travel all the way to cancun and end up meeting a really nice couple but somehow i know them and planned this entire trip to meet them and didn't tell her! one time i signed us up for a party bus tour in vegas and the hostess recognized my name over the phone and came over and said \"hi, i'm the one you talked to on the phone\" and the night was ruined from the start! all of the sudden, i knew her personally and it's all a setup and she felt stupid thinking we are trying to fool her so we end up in a big fight and ditch the tour. i keep trying with my wife because i love her but it gotten to the point with money and accusations that i'm at a breaking point. i'm damned if i do and damned if i don't because no matter what i give up, there's always a new accusation. i must have a secret phone she doesn't know about! i have spent so much money on vacations that we cancel as a result and have to be so careful and refrain from talking to any strangers or it's a conspiracy! it's been hard on me and i know that she literally can't help it. she is suffering with these thoughts and will break down crying and apologizing the next day and it hurts me because i can't help her and i suffer from the frustration and pain i feel with the one i love not being able to trust me and the frustration i feel having to give up a life outside of our relationship too. no one knows about this struggle because we both hide these issues and just conveniently leave parties and events by making up some other excuse but the real reason is that my wife just came over and questioned my whereabouts when i had to go to the bathroom. i've learned that it's better to leave without fighting by getting her out of there asap instead of things escalating into more serious accusations that i upset me even more. we've had too many nights where we were lucky to make it home so now we just show up and leave just to make our presence known. sometimes i think the night is going so well we stay later but all it takes is one too many drinks for her to bring out everything shes been holding in the entire week or month i had no clue about! i have left her once for a few months just to see if a break would help and that just put her into depression. since then, she has acknowledged her problem and has opened up to me much more about it and i've been shocked and hurt to find out some things she has been thinking about she deals with these conspiracy thoughts on a regular basis but i never notice until we go out. i like to have fun and socialize and drink, gamble, dance, etc but that's when the real problems come out because i never know what the trigger is going to be tonight! she is the type that can't have fun without drinks or she'll just be bored but if she drinks one too many, her conspiracy thoughts spiral out of control and we have to leave before it gets worse! anyways, we are trying natural remedies because i seriously do not want my wife on drug care. has anyone ever found any natural remedies that actually work?\n",

      "Text: delusional jealousy - so tired of it i've been dealing with delusional jealousy with my wife for almost 3 years. we have 3 kids (17, 15, 8 ) so it's been stressful trying to maintain a sense of normalcy for them while living with the chaos of this illness. we've been married almost 24 years. we have been through both counseling and psychiatric care. the counselor and psychiatrist both agree that my wife has delusional jealousy and she was given medications: risperdal - seemed to help a little but caused weight gain so she quit taking it. seroquil - turned my wife into a zombie. the doctor never could find a level that didn't almost make her catatonic. she couldn't function as a parent in this state. she hasn't been on any medications for about 2 years now and refuses to attend counseling because in her view the last counselor was on my side because i paid the bill. i've encouraged her to find a different counselor but she refuses and it won't do any good if i find another one. all of the counseling in the world won't help if she just adds each counselor that doesn't agree with her to the idiot list. there is at least one difference between our problem and most of those i have read here (and elsewhere). my wife's delusional jealousy does not involve accusations of infidelity. she doesn't accuse me of sexual relationships with other women but instead accuses me of looking at other women. now, mind you, when my wife says \"looking\" it sounds like a sex act. it's hard to put down in words just how debilitating this issue is. i've made major changes to my life to reduce her stress as much as possible like dropping my ymca membership (women there), tv (women), woodworking magazines (a few women there), the newspaper (yep, women there too). when i drive to work (3 mile residential type driving) she calls me on the way and asks me how many women i have looked at. she picks out women we see regularly in the neighborhood as my \"friends\". she's not accusing me of having sex with them, just leering at them. she even picks out women at church that i am supposed to be leering at. and to really twist the knife she usually points out some other guy (just like me) and says \"joe, wasn't looking at other women\". my most cruel experience with dj was when my father was in the hospital last summer close to death (end stage alzheimer's) and i had to stay in the hospital with him. in addition to the stress of my father being near death i had to hear constantly from my wife about \"what women are you looking at\". i also was expected to drive the back roads from my city to my father's so that i wouldn't see any billboards with women on them. our families have been of no help. my family believes that \"i let my wife behave this way\", even though she is mentally ill. her side doesn't know at all and even though i think my mother-in-law would understand and help my wife doesn't want them to know. i'm reaching the end of my patience, my wife seems to be getting progressively worse. i have stuck around in what is a toxic situation for me to allow my children to live with both parents but it's getting to the point where i think the children would be better off with us apart. i would love to hear from anyone who has had experience with delusional jealousy not involving accusations of infidelity.\n",

      "Text: how to achieve a realisation in a delusional disorder person i need advice on how to care for my mother who has been diagnosed with delusional disorder. she is confused and does not understand that she is mentally ill. the head psychiatrist told me that people with this illness can't realise that what they are experiencing is not reality, although some can achieve it if they are on medication, undergoing therapy and are 'lucky'. we were also told we can't tell her she is unwell or it will break up her relationship with that person, and she will always resent them for it as she will probably always believe it was real. to be honest, the health system that are helping us have been extremely unhelpful and we are really struggling. my mother has not been eating or sleeping well for a while and is under constant surveillance from the family. although she is not panicking like she used to about the voices she hears and the facts that they tell her are true, she is adamant that she is not unwell. unfortunately her social worker included me in the conversation of persuading her to take medication. however she has not turned her back on me as a result so far, which she was doing if we said that something was what it was-and not what she thinks it is. as she is not a danger to herself she has to come to some sort of realisation to accept psychotic medication or accept going into the hospital ward again. she did agree to medication when faced with the social workers persuasion, but then quickly went back on it because she doesn't think she is ill. does anyone know if they can come to realise that they are ill? the head psychiatrist said it as if it is brain chemistry but i can see some people in this community know that it's not real by themselves. i'm wondering if it is chemical or psychological. it's been about a month and we haven't had any evidence or any proof that these 'stalkers' planting things and posting things online exist and are doing what they say they are doing, to her. our assigned long term planner won't get back to us on a plan for my mother and the social worker hasn't got back to us after my mother said she would take them. which now she decided she won't. i don't want to loose the bond i have with my mother and i'm scared that while my family are seeking advice on how to deal with this situation, and not tell her she is ill, something will go wrong, and i might loose that bond. any help would be appreciated. thanks.\n",

      "Text: coping with delusional disorder? [note: this post is lengthy because it provides background information and clarification on the question at hand but please take the time to bother to read it anyways.] hello i am new to this forum and have decided to join because i would like advice from other people pertaining to delusional disorder. i suffer from both bizarre and non bizarre delusions including believing in telepathy(bizarre) and believing people are out to get me (non-bizarre). i have not been officially diagnosed with delusional disorder but i have been having delusions for about 4-5 years. my delusions include believing people can telepathically read my thoughts which would be classified as bizarre delusions as they are considered impossible and unlikely to happen. my other delusions have been thinking people are out to get me,have ill intent,or have said things behind my back which are considered non bizarre as they have the possibility to happen... i do not know if my symptoms truly mean i have delusional disorder as i may be misinterpreting the information of delusional disorder incorrectly but it appears i have it... moving along...the reason why i am so self aware despite my psychosis is due to my rational mind and belief in science which assures me that telepathy is not possible since there has been no proof of telepathy being possible.the only \"proof\" that has ever been given on telepathy has come from pseudo scientific studies.meaning people who claim to be scientists and who claim to have proof which in reality isn't proof at all. so thanks to my highly rational scientific mind i am able to realize i am delusional. however the delusions have made my brain develop a pattern of irrational thinking which causes me to be very psychotic despite this realization.basically the irrational pattern of thinking caused by my psychosis overpowers my rational personality which is why i'm self aware yet psychotic. thankfully thanks to my rational mind i am at least capable of realizing i have a problem and despite not being able to cope i have decided to go to therapy to unravel my irrational thinking or at the very least get anti psychotic medication... which brings me to my next statement...i have to wait a couple of years until i can get therapy and antipsychotic medications...i have a hard time making social connections due to my paranoid persecutory paranoid thoughts and due to my overall psychosis which means i lack a support group... whilst i wait for the ability to go to therapy and take my antipsychotic medications i want to cope,in a relatively healthy way,with the delusions i have so i can socialize and be a regular happy person. so i have thought about drinking when i am the legal age for drinking in my area. as i plan to self medicate for the social anxiety i have by becoming a social drinker whilst i wait for therapy i am left wondering if healthy,controlled,self medication with alcohol is possible for delusional disorder... i am not stating in any shape way or form that i plan to become a alcoholic or refuse therapy/treatment for my delusional disorder. i fully plan and intend to get therapy and medications for my mental illness so i will not harm myself or others and so i can live a healthy happy life. i also plan to drink responsibly as it is my responsibility to do no harm to myself or others. however i am stating that i am considering self medicating with alcohol in a responsible manner to cope with delusions whilst i wait for therapy.not now but when i am legally allowed to drink alcohol. i would drink responsibly and have no intent on getting excessively drunk only enough to \"take off the edge\". with my background and intentions in mind now clarified that leads me to my actual question. can i use alcohol,responsibly of course,to cope with delusions,in a safe controlled environment,whilst i am waiting for the opportunity to gain enough money to get therapy and/or anti-psychotic medications? meaning... will alcohol be able to help me cope with delusions? i am not sure if it would help but i would like some opinions from other people...please and thank you\n",

      "Text: coping with delusional disorder? hello since for some reason you are unable to get psych help from a professional i would recomend going to support groups for depression or anxiety, you stated that you have some social anxiety. the groups are free and you could probably find something in your area. also you could call the suicide hotline and ask for free mental health programs in your area if that is something you would be able to do. as for self medication with alcohol, i dont recomend it. it can make the delusions worse and when your not intoxicated you could become depressed. also even though you have the intent to not get drunk, when you are out with friends it is hard to stop and know your limits, especially since you will be new to drinking and social drinking. if you start relying on alcohol to control your anxiety then it would be very easy for your drinking to get out of hand. remember no one has the intent to become an alcoholic the drinking just gets out of hand. i have some similar issues with persicutory delusions and social anxiety and i found that when i drank i would just be more likely to talk to people about my beliefs and be more openly passionate about what i know is true and what everyone else knows is false. that could get you into trouble socially, people will most likely not be kind when rejecting your viewpoint and then when your not drunk or under the influence you will have to address what you said and how you acted and try to back peddle to try and convince that person that you are not crazy if you would like for them to still accept you into their social circle. i commend you for reaching out on this forum and for having such incite into your beliefs as such a young age. i feel that professional help would be the best option. you can always talk to me whenever you need.\n",

      "Text: any suggestions on how to help someone who thinks they are normal??? my husband was recently diagnosed with delusional disorder (after years of wierd behavior and me and my family knowing something was way off) he never can see how odd his behavior is and thinks it is all me and not him. about 3 years ago he started in on researching a \"plot\" my dad and i were in on since before my husband and i were even married...he insists we did a \"real estate scam\" on him...and that my dad is a pedifile (or however you spell it) and has been abusing me since i was 5 up until current ...it is so disgusting the things my husband comes up with. he has outbursts and out of control anger - thinks it is totally justified because of \"all the things we have done to him\". he is up all night long on the internet compiling his \"evidence against me\" - he was up all night thursday and still on he computer when i got up. other times he goes to bed at 5am and gets up at 2 in the afternoon. a few mos ago he was having chest pains. i figured it was anziety or depression. after 4 days he felt a bit better. in the middle of the night he left to go to tucson to visit a friend. on facebook i saw him post that he felt like he was going to die due to sever chest pains. i told him \"well, if you had told me you were going i would have said to wait - not a good idea to make a long drive when you are having chest pains\" and he got all mad at me about it. i told him to go to the hospital (which he did 2 days after getting to tucson) he had a lot of fluid around his heart which was drained (they said 2 more days he may have died) so i drove out there and arrived at 5 am - his surgery was at 8. he started yelling at me and they had to give him valium before the surgery to calm him down. 5 days later he told me to get the \"f\" out of his room (he was yelling about the real estate scam he thinks i did) and then later that day on the phone he threatened me and the nurse heard it. they involuntarily admitted him to the mental hospital which is where the phychiatrist told me they diagnosed him with delusional disorder. any suggestions on how to get him to see he needs help?\n",

      "Text: what is litmus test for delusional disorder or schizophrenia well, i'm not quite sure what the difference is between delusional disorder and schizophrenia. i thought that they could all be classified under schizophrenia. what i'd like to know is if there is some way of identifying, some way of testing someone in some casual conversation to find out if they have a major psychotic problem. like example if i said, what would you do or think or feel about such and such a thing. the idea being, can i find some general loose connection in her circuits. the purpose of which would be to help her cure her problem or prove to her that she has a weakness and should go see someone. here are the circumstances. my friend seems so absolutely normal in so many ways. she has many problems in her life and seems to be busy solving them, though in a different manner than i would, but she does solve her problems. at the same time, she strongly advocates conspiracy theories, that she is being monitored, that she has devices planted in her and that the government is harboring aliens from another world, that so much of everything is psychic and numerous other types of thoughts of what appear to me to be competely delusional. and she could tell i'm skeptical and asks me why i don't believe her. the thing is that so much of her seems absoutely normal and then there's a part of her that seems completely psychotic. if anyone here met her, the first impression would be that this is a wonderful woman etc. but when she starts going into all this crazy stuff then you'd think different. it's no use getting her to see someone because she is tremendously proud and strongly arrogant in what she believes and even finds it an insult that i question her beliefs in these things. then to prove that she is right, she goes to youtube and shows me the lying conspiracy assholes who put up nothing but false information. i constantly tell her that such broadcasters never give true facts but take only circumstantial facts and incorrectly draw them together in wrong conclusions. these youtubers also have no one to answer to for the truth of their facts. at least the standard media have bosses to answer to and other media organizations to answer to when they are wrong and will be publicly humiliated or fired if so proven. well, she doesn't really get it and says that she won't believe a word of what the standard media says. in the old days, people used to call this type of normal and abnormal behavior monomania where you could seem so normal and wonderful on one side and totally psychotic on another side. later on psychologists and psychiatrists realized that if these types of people were further tested you would find out inadequacies across the board and the term monomania was stopped and i guess schizophrenia or other names were used. so is there some way that by casual conversation i can do a litmus test and get to the root of her disorder to find out what circuits are loose for the purpose of helping her or getting her to see someone.\n",

      "Text: dependent personality mother with dementia! yes, i absolutely have the same situation, and it is heartbreaking. growing up, my mother went through a divorce, and she latched onto me as the older daughter. then when i got married; she found someone and got married, and suddenly i didn't exist. she became so latched onto her husband that every sentence began with \"bob and i.\" i couldn't even sit near her without her sitting and holding his hand. she decided to move from connecticut to florida with him, because he had 5 kids, and she didn't want to deal with them. when she moved 2000 miles away, i was heartbroken; but she told me i would get over it. she missed all the years of my son (her grandson) growing up, and when she did visit, all she cared about was being with her husband, and going back to florida. her husband died at age 79, and the day he died, she latched onto my single sister, sarah and moved back up to connecticut to live with sarah for five years. my mother never went back to her home in florida she started to use phrases like \"sarah and i.\" she was extremely despondent and lost lots of weight. finally, my sister couldn't take it anymore. my mother was losing her mind. long, story short, we had to finally place her in a dementia unit; this time closer to my house. this place is gorgeous. it is like a 5 star hotel, with excellent food, activities all day, maid service, bus trips. it is bright and clean, and yet all my mother does is keep packing to go home with sarah. she calls sarah night and day. they finally had to take the key from my mother, because she tripped over her own things that she packed by the door, and knocked herself out, and landed in the hospital (another day of hysteria). she threatened to put a bullet in her head, and she landed in the hospital psych ward. the psychologists are trying to get her on some type of anti-anxiety andepressant medications. she pegged her whole life on her husband, and when he deceased, she glued herself to my sister, and my sister burnt out. i visit at least twice a week, and every weekend we go out for a ride and ice cream. now my mother wants me to sleep over with her in a semi-private room in the dementia ward. sometimes, she forgets it is me and calls me sarah. she is angry, because she said she came up north to be with her kids, and noone cares, so she threatens to go back to florida. she can't go anywhere, because she is now 82 and has moderate to severe dementia. they don't know if it is alzheimers, but it is really bad. the guilt i feel is enormous, because she is so unhappy. don't know how much longer i will have her, and i want to enjoy our time together.\n",

(i recently lost a dog, so i know how bad it feels to lose something or someone you love). please know this - when a loved one gets alzheimers, they need the love and support more than ever. i wish there was a cure for alzheimer's. well i hope i've helped someone by my story. i know it's a sad thing to go through with a loved one, but remember when they die that they're not suffering anymore, especially if they know the lord. take care guys, rock of ages \"assuredly, i say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will by no means enter it\" (luke 18:17)\n",

      "Text: my granny hello. i didn't really know how to title this post. i introduced myself in the 'intro' topic. i am the 34 year old granddaughter of an 89 year old woman with alzheimer's. she is my mum's mum, and she now lives in a nursing home which specialises in alzheimer's. i'm writing this on behalf of my mum really, as she would like to know more about other people's experiences, but she doesn't want to be a burden and she's not confident enough with computers to be able to use this forum. granny was in sheltered housing, with a flat to herself and a warden. this was about 5 years ago. she was first diagnosed with alzheimer's after she lost the following: ability to tell the time. ability to recognise the values of coins and notes. became forgetful (would leave the stove on, etc), and confused about things. began to wander around town at night, until she was found by a good-natured member of the public or a police officer. regualrly insisted that people/neighbours were coming into her house and stealing/moving things around. she would have arguments with the neighbours, accusing them of all sorts of things. mum and dad tried to take her on holiday, the journey was taken by car with frequent stops. dad had a sattelite nav system in the car, which was switched on. at the end of the journey (a few hundred miles) granny leapt out of the car and ran away accross the road, in a distressed state. she had got the idea into her head that the sattelite nav computer was controlling dad (because it was telling him which way to go and he was obeying), and that he wasn't dad any more but some imposter ('bad' dad) who meant to harm her. she also thought that this 'bad' dad had done away with 'good' dad, and had convinced mum to be with him instead of 'good' dad. after mum went after granny and explained to her the real situation, granny didn't believe her. she would not let dad into the holiday cottage, so he had to wait down at the local pub until mum phoned him to say that granny was asleep and it was 'safe' to come back. in the morning granny still believed in the 'bad' dad, and would not accept food or drink from mum or dad, as she believed that they were trying to poison her. they had to cut the holiday short and bring her home again. they contacted the doctor immediately. after that, granny was put into a residential assessment centre where she stayed for some months until the progression/level of her alzheimer's was established, then a suitable place was found for her to recieve residential care. the care home is only 10 miles away from mum and dad, and mum goes to see granny every day. nowadays granny talks mostly nonsense, but she does have short periods of lucidity (ie: only a sentence or two at a time, 5 minutes on a good day). i live over the other side of the country to mum and dad, so i don't get to see them or granny very often, but we are in telephone contact regularly. a couple of weeks ago i went to visit her with my mum and my sister, who brought her baby along to meet granny. that went well - in amongst the nonsense granny understood that this was her great-granddaughter. she was very proud and pleased to have her family around her, she was able to hold the baby for 10 minutes with no problems. baby needed a feed, and my sister and mum left the room. i said i would catch them up, and stayed talking with granny for a little longer. she seemed to be more lucid with me than with the other members of the family - we spoke about grandad (who had died when i was 17), who she has not mentioned for years and years to anyone else - mum had thought that she had forgotten about him! but then mum called me to leave - i didn't really want to as granny seemed to be having a good time with me, but i had to go - mum can't spend too long with granny as it upsets her and she finds it very stressful to see her mother deteriorate as time goes by. mum has manic depression, and has been told by her doctor that she would not be able to look after granny, which is why she can't spend so much time with her. i wish that i lived nearer so that i could visit granny more often, but money and time are short (i work in the community support area, which means low wages and long hours). i speak to granny on the phone, but she is rather deaf, and refuses to wear a hearing aid, so i know that she doesn't hear much of what i say, even when i raise my voice. sorry about this, i'm rambling - here come my questions soon.... 7 days ago granny fell over in her room while mum was visiting. an ambulance was called, and luckily granny had not broken anything. after mum and the ambulance left granny fell again, this time she broke her hip. she was on the floor for 30 mins before staff found her (luckily, as if it had been a different time of day she could have been lying on the floor all night!). she went straight to hospital and her hip was pinned. the doctors' plan is to give her physiotherapy to get her back on her feet, and then she can go back to the nursing home. the trouble is, granny is not sure where she is in hospital. since the operation she has had no lucid moments at all, and is increasingly confused. she is very suspicious and thinks that people are trying to poison her again. so, she is refusing all food, drink, and medications. she has another urinary infection (she has always been reluctant to drink for fear of wetting herself, so she gets loads of these infections, which don't do her mind any good) because she will not drink. doctors did put a drip in her arm, but she kept pulling it out, so they won't put another one in. she also tries to pull out her catheter. she has become violent with doctors and nursing staff, trying to bite and hit them. i'm very glad that she was able to see her great-granddaughter before she broke her hip and took a turn for the worse. i am wondering if there has been anyone else who has had similar experiences of: being told by doctors that you can't look after your loved one because you have a mental illness. alzheimer's patients taking a turn for the worse since being under anaesthetic for a major operation. i think that's about it really, thanks for reading. sorry it was so long, but it all sort of flooded out!\n",

      "Text: dear faithful, my mother died a few months ago after a long decline from parkinson's. she was similar to your dad in that she eventually could barely speak, just make little grunts, so it was really hard to know what she was thinking. her facial expression was also rigid, so reading emotional content was impossible. we tried as much as possible to relate to her as though she understood us. it was sort of like having a baby, but without the expressiveness infants show. very difficult. my heart goes out to you. if he still can recognize you, i would think going to see him alot, and providing him with familiar objects, like a favorite blanket, ect. might help him cope. i often felt that my mother was lost in a big house she used to know her way around in. she would look out the windows so to speak, but not recognize the neighborhood. very lonely. so like i said, go see him alot. go sit with him and don't worry too much about feedback. just pet him and hug him. \"so it goes...\" kurt vonnegut http://schizoids.net/forum/index.php\n",
