I eat total rubbish like I drink coke ALL DAY cause I am addicted, and like i eat like 1kg of bacon and put 7 eggs in and eat several meet pies, cheese cake etc. I can't eat healthy stuff it makes me sick I tried it I can't stand the stand it is horrid. I'm 135kg and rising. Its not due to me being weak its genetic, my mum had it so did granpa, though they weren't as fat as I am. I don't work, never go out the house, never shower (I stink bad) all i do all day is play computer and eat. mum comes over couple of times per week (1.5 hour drive for her each way) and cleans the house up and does the dishes, washes clothes etc cause I am too fat and lazy lol I got a dog and even he is mega fat. Like REALLY fat and I don't over feed him either. I don't know I think I should be able to go to hospital cause its due to mental and genetic problems, it is nothing to do with will power. Like serious I am on disability and if mum did not bring me food over I would not be able to afford to eat properly. She pays for my internet, cigarettes and everything. I am 38 BTW. I also got a cousin he is 200kg and on Disability too. His brother is also on Disability as well for social anxiety that is bad well its really bad. The girls I am living with are complaining say they hate it here, saying i stink and crap, its real rude man like I got a disability. I never had a job, I never even finish year 8 in high school. I am sick though of attitude i get , discrimination, its crap persecution, like serious, don't blame me. I am bit down though, wish I had gf so could have sex aheaps, and like serious need them to clean the place, i am never going to do it, but i HATE fat women not attractive, only like very pretty skinny girl, young like 21 would be good. I want someone that can accept my disability and would be good if they did have job though cause not enough $$. Society does nothing for me man, I don't get enough support. I can't even afford stuff like a car, have to get my mum to come all the way down in the rare even i go out, but i wont do that anymore wont go to the doctor he had the nerve to call me obese and try and lecture me saying what I gotta do, he has no idea bout my medical conditions. Even the locum made inappropriate comments and stuff when i got them out to my house. My uncle got $400,000 he was sexually harrassed, i been discriminated against due to weight, i deserve money like that so i can make my life better. disability aint enough for me.", "hash": "2bd42e6c7e05e4fefc6ae370dfce1ab686d47774e1ced1316ac6989eaf90aa3d"}

The first step in losing weight and making a change happens with you. You need to tell yourself \"do I really want to make a change?\" if you answer yes then I can sure help you. The first step is to get away from fast foods and soda. These have a lot of fat , grease , and sugar which is not good for you because it will not only make you gain weight but it can also cause early death! . Next step is going to be hard , and its to change your eating habit to a more basic healthy regiment . remember to get the body and weight you want its 70% in the kitchen and 30% working out. There are 3 basic things to know when it comes to eating healthy and its carbs , healthy fats , and protein. some good carbs to get would be oatmeal, whole grain products, corn, apples bananas, veggies, etc. carbs to avoid would be cookies, cakes, pastries, and candy. Good protein would be chicken with no skin, turkey, fish, and low fat dairy except for eggs. Finally ,good fat choices would be peanut butter, almonds, canola oil, low fat cheeses, and even sunflower seeds. Try to avoid butter, and high in fat meats and dairy. All you have to do now is look at the nutrition facts when choosing a food and see if it meets these requirements. If you want to take it a step further and workout . just work on you lower body one day (legs, calves, and hip flexors) and upper another day (chest, arms, back ) and core every other day. make sure to give at least 2-3 days a week of rest and remember to eat clean ! hope you take my advice and change your life , goodluck!", "hash": "a22aa4906cadbccc6300f6f6ac8943b1fb32092bed2b3c475b3f4722b11baed0"}

As for your last post , I think you already know all the reasons why you shouldn't eat junk food . Addiction is a disease of compulsion . I've found that distraction works for me but I need a literal list of things to do instead of giving in to my compulsion ( I'm addicted to gambling but have been in recovery for 7 years now.) I had to make a plan . Without a plan , I failed again and again . I also had to address the reasons why I gambled which for me meant facing a lot of the unhealthy ways I dealt with stress , loneliness and unhappiness .

My Mother's Committing Suicide w/Food by Jessica-0672 » Thu Jan 29, 2015 7:09 pm I desperately need advice. My mother is over age 60 and obese. Like many American women, she struggled with her weight through life, but nothing like this before. She has given up on herself, she is depressed, she can barely walk, her health is crumbling rapidly, and any attempt our family makes to ask her about it ends in her crying and acting like we're abusing her. She fully admits that she is an addict and runs to food to fill every void. But that's as far as she goes. She is unwilling to fix herself and comes up with elaborate excuses for why she can't work at losing weight. She and my father have been happily married for 40+ years, but I think he's nearly had it with her. As have the rest of us. Having to watch her fist down a dozen pastries after dinner feels like I'm watching her slowly commit suicide. I've never been ashamed of her having some extra weight on her but now I'm deeply ashamed of her obesity. I cringe when we're together in public because people actually stare at ME like, \"a good daughter would get her mother some help\". Last year I offered to bring she and my dad on a family vacation and she said no because she can't walk. I told her she had a year to lose some weight before the trip and she looked at me like I asked her to model down a catwalk. So this is my dilemma... Should I remove myself from her life? Or should I have an intervention? I've removed less toxic people from my life in the past, but this is my mother! I want to travel with her and watch her play with my children, not watch her die of an addiction. It's so bad I can't even look at her when she's in the room. Even my little kids ask \"Why is grandma so fat? Teacher says that's unhealthy.\" One of the problems with intervention is that she's convinced herself I have no credibility because I've always been thin and have no addictions. Whenever it has come up before she always starts with \"You don't understand because you're skinny.\" - or so strong willed, etc etc. When I try to show her obese recovery stories she always has an excuse like, \"I'm older than her\", or \"shorter than him\", or \"she has a different body type\", or \"he has a fighting personality and I don't\"... Then the excuses expand - \"I can't afford to eat healthy\", or \"your father won't eat diet food\", or \"I 'd feel silly going to a therapist\", etc, etc... The thought of telling her I'm removing myself from her life makes me cry just thinking about it. But I'm spending far too much time miserable and frustrated because of her and it's starting to take its toll on *my* marriage and children now. Any advice you can give me on this would be most appreciated.", "hash": "88c02698025c3685a2b29aa7df5a0be19b13da5e2b12533ee567706617834115"}

Today it finally came to me to Google the situation and see if I could find anything. So that is what has brought me here today. I struggled with whether to post this in this particular forum or one of the sexual abuse ones. As I do not feel as though I experienced abuse with my particular situation, I opted for this forum. Please, if it is improper here, let me know and I will move or remove it to the appropriate forum. I have been overweight the majority of my life. Apparently I was of a relatively normal weight until sometime in elementary school. A comment made by a family member has always left me curious (and it is someone I fully trust, so please do not read into it as more than an offhanded comment). I had asked if I was overweight as a little kid. They said no you were a normal weight when you were little, but, \"sometime in elementary school, we don't know what happened, but you just seemed to start gaining weight.\" Hmmm. When I was \"young\" - I'm not sure what age, I don't recall - I in my parents' bedroom snooping in a drawer containing belongings of my older brother who was active military. Most of the contents was rather boring; however, there was a cheap looking paperback book that caught my interest. I still remember the name and what the cover looked like. Campus Pussy . As a voracious reader even then, I naturally had to check it out. I am confident that I need not expand on the subject matter and the fact that my body had natural (female) reactions. To my knowledge, no one ever knew I had found that book, despite the fact that I marked every page where an explicit encounter took place. Earlier this year, I caught a portion of an interview of none other than Kanye West wherein he spoke of being exposed to pornography as a child - that there were images and magazines around their home that he would see. He went on to talk about how that impacted him as an adult with his sex addition issues, and I would suspect, other addictive behaviors we know nothing about. Something with his interview got me thinking. COULD THERE BE a correlation or connection between my reading that very age inappropriate \"novel\" and my basically life long weight issues? I know often times sexual abuse and rape victims gain weight as a cloak to hide themselves and their bodies. Otherwise I have a very normal, productive life. Educated, professional job, various relationships, etc. Until Kanye's interview, it never crossed my mind that even reading that type of material as a child could have a negative impact. I have been on every diet and program under the sun. I have had successes. I have never been able to maintain the weight loss, but I believe some of the blame lies in the dated methods used in the 1980's-early 2000's. Additionally, my mother was an alcoholic all of my life. Thoughts? Thank you!", "hash": "b68f4235aa36992922caeef83cf6b0d140856e219a686e12b9d85e0f2a17f6a8"}

If you're not already doing so, I'd suggest seeking out a good therapist to work with you. Your post sounds very well thought out, it's clear that your weight is causing you distress, and you're looking for answers. In addition, it sounds like you know something is off -- and the family member's comments seems to support that. Do you have any recollection about when, how or why you began to gain weight in childhood? Do you remember how old you were, other people's comments at the time, how you felt? It would seem quite strange if you didn't. I was really struck by your last sentence. You added that in an offhand way and to me, your mother being an alcoholic would be incredibly unlikely not to create significant psychology issues for you, issues which should benefit from psychotherapy. Children of alcoholics have a higher number of challenges than children of non-alcoholics. I wish you the best in your quest and your healing.

My therapist agrees that I have a food addiction but my family does not believe me and they say that it’s just in my head and I’m making myself believe that. I binge eat junk food almost everyday and food is the only thing that makes me happy. Once I start eating I don’t stop and no matter how full I am I will continue eating. I sometimes throw up when I’m feeling full so I can continue eating. I’ve gained 30-40 lbs in the last 6 months because of my eating. I’d like to get help and get healthy. I’ve tried going on diets but I always fall back to my ways. When I eat healthy I feel sick and I feel depressed. Everyday I say starting tomorrow I will eat healthy but it never happens. Especially now it’s Christmas time it’s going to be harder for me to eat well but I’d like nothing more than to break my addiction. My therapist told me to limit my food intake and to practice portion control but that is so hard for me it feels impossible and nobody seems to understand me and my family isn’t taking this seriously but I’m so desperate for help. I’m thinking that I will try to recover from this addiction starting tomorrow, Thursday December 12 2019. I think maybe if I talk to others that understand me I can get some necessary help so I can break my addiction. I’d also like to document my journey to get healthy as I think that that’s also something that will help me.

It's amazing what you'll eat, and how much of it you'll eat, when you have things like stress, anxiety and exhaustion factoring into your daily life. I tell myself every day that I want to quit sugar, and go carb-free and green. Then life kicks me in the face, and I'm back to binge eating protein bars and sandwiches. (my two current weaknesses).

The first part is unpleasant to tackle because the physical cravings are hard to ignore. I found the cravings for fast food went away after about a week. Emotional eating is harder to address. Do you have rituals associated with the food? Is it a way you treat yourself? How do you feel before, during, and after eating it? If your mood state is dependent on knowing you will be getting the food at some point, you're eating emotionally. Ask yourself what you're thinking, feeling, and experiencing physically as you go through the craving. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota.", "hash": "0953bce28c44f6e898657ae2b1ade24d47b3c5f8fc4fed88d4fbf3077399df1b"}

I have not actually figured what they are actually talking about or saying to me,I have absolutely no idea. Are they saying go to both SAA and OA are they saying stop going to SAA go back out and sexually act out while I am in OA? Are they telling me to put my weight back on so I can go to OA?

It's good to have an open mind about them but your choices are your choices . I think their reasoning is this : Trying to manage 2 very different and difficult behaviors at the same time can become overwhelming to the point where some people just give up trying . They feel like \" If I can't fix everything , then I can't fix anything .\" It sounds like you have a good plan that's working for you . What's important is that you're honest with yourself if you find that it's not working .

I've read your post, and I'm really glad you've reached out for help! I'm by no means a mental health professional, but *mod edit* I myself have (very recently) struggled with my very own food addiction. I think you have a very positive outlook on your situation; as you've said your parents will have a very difficult time understanding your actions and how to deal with them appropriately, and, while it's not your fault that you have certain impulses (a lot of this do have to do with your environment and body), you haven't victimised yourself. The most important first step is realising that it is, indeed, your responsibility now to take action and change your life for the better, and that that's very much possible. While I never had what would be classified as an eating disorder, I have faced a lot of the same emotions and problems, such as binge eating, wanting to eat in secret, excessive guilt, and etc. etc. However, I am also a certified personal trainer and fitness enthusiast, thus I've since turned my psychological reactions (in terms of food addiction and a prior panic 'disorder') into curiosity and learning opportunities. I've talked to people, done some research, and seen some first hand accounts, and it's helped me see the bigger picture. Sorry if I'm rambling a bit, it's just that I'd really like to help you get to a better place, and it would be a pleasure if you would accept what help I can offer you on a level of peer support I'm not sure what other information you might be looking for right now, but please do respond (I'll try to check back often) *mod edit* Look forward to hearing back from you, Victoria Last edited by Snaga on Mon Jul 17, 2017 7:44 pm, edited 1 time in total.

Long story short, I had to change my diet because of an intestinal issue that would lead to me being hooked up to medical equipment for the rest of my life if I didn't take a step back now. I'm not overweight or in bad (looking) shape, but my digestive system seems to be held together by duct tape. Over the course of a little over a week, I've noticed I haven't missed the food or caffeine which I also can't have at all. Thing is I'm still binge eating from time to time, but only with healthy foods (I'm not allowed red meat, bread, pasta, artificial sugar, fried foods etc). The thing I DO miss is the random energy spikes I would get. Now granted I'm sure this also has to do with me being bipolar, but it seems I'm not so much a food junkie as much as an adrenaline junkie. One thing I've found is eating certain foods increase manic episodes with bipolar giving me a manic high with energy spikes. Not sure where I'm going with this. I suppose I'll have to find a balance with foods that give me energy without going too over the top with it. I guess I'm also curious if anyone else had gone through withdrawals like that and how they handled the energy levels.", "hash": "ec35d1c0549f155ef6dba0e91d2155e9d33893929d216abea055adc5e8c4e95c"}

You'll have to wean yourself off them slowly and start to replace each soda with something like a cup of tea, and then switch to herbal tea or water once the aspartame withdrawals are over with. Even though there's no sugar in diet drinks, the phosphorous in the drink will erode your teeth.

Once a person can find something more healthy to replace that addiction, it is a success. So maybe ask yourself what Soda does for you. Do you have a routine that goes with drinking it?

I don't know what this is. Today I ate over 3300kcal. I did not exercise, heck I didn't even leave the house. I'm 5'7 (170cm) and roughly 132lbs (60kg). I go for daily walks, weight lifting four times a week and dance twice a week. In general I follow a high carb, low fat plant based style of eating with occasional high fat foods. Medium amount of sodium, almost no added sugar and no added oil, but I still eat natural sugars in fruits and veggies and fat from nuts and seeds. Usually I eat at least three portions of vegetables and five portions of fruit a day, most of the time it's more. I do not blend my food (no smoothies and juices) and eat a lot of starchy vegetables and beans as well. Whole grain flour products sometimes. I have absolutely no idea why I can't stop eating and eating and eating. The foods I binge on are usually whole grain products (today it was homemade pretzels), often without any salt or sugar, sometimes it's dried fruit - any source of concentrated, but still relatively unprocessed carbohydrates. I have a huge stomach volume, my diet contains 80-120g of fiber daily, I drink at least three liters of water, sometimes over four. I get adequate sleep (around eight hours per night). I usually do not count calories or weigh my food, but when I do I'm always shocked. My belly started growing from this kind of eating. I'm also growing muscle, but I know there's fat gain going on as well. I'm bloated a lot of the time and my stomach hurts so bad after binging. I just want to eat normal portions. Everyone who sees me eating comments on how much I eat because my portions are enormous. Other people eat less in an entire day than what I have for breakfast. I can easily eat two cups of dry oatmeal cooked with water plus mango, blueberries, flax seeds and cinnamon after I ate half a honeydew melon as an appetizer. It's gotten really bad when I started to lift intensively, on the one hand I'm weirdly proud that I can eat so much, but on the other hand I just want to be a normal person eating normal amounts of healthy food. Nutrient wise I don't have any problems, my blood tests are flawless, I've never been anemic or had any other nutrient deficiency (that's basically impossible with the amount of nutrient dense foods I'm eating). I need help. I've been in therapy for depression for around six months now and a year ago or so I developed restrictive eating patterns (eating 1400-1600kcal a day), but that's long gone. It's gotten better, but now it's getting worse. Anyone know any advice?", "hash": "0a8b0968f3dae0da3541112679dda1f361f0fbf6780bcaaf1452150336f2f40b"}

I remember being 8 or 9 and asking my mom for a chicken sandwich at McDonalds after I finished my entire happy meal. I've dreamed of that moment. I've thought about it over and over. It's the moment I believe, started a downward spiral. I remember being 16 and walking to the deli and getting a giant meL of 5 pieces of fried chicken and 10 potato wedges, a jar of pickles And a half gallon of chocolate milk.i grew to love that feeling of fullness. I could t stop once I started. To this day I still tell myself all day that I'm going to do good and eat well. Some meals I do. Today for instance I woke up early and made oatmeal and put fresh Blueberries in it. All day I told myself how good I was going to do, but at lunch I sorta left my body and drove to mcdonalds and ate a whole value meal and two McDoubles. This scene has played out a million times in the last 20 years. I hate it. I tell myself I don't want it and I honestly don't! I'm talking myself out of it, even while I'm eating. I realized a year or two ago that I lied to myself everyday. I've been so full before that I've had to call out of work. I'm a glutton. I eat like a demon. I never have leftovers. I have eaten whole boxes of hamburger helper and still ate more. It feels like a curse. I'm 32 and if I wasn't naturally hardy and a little athletic and still young, I would be crippled. My weight won't come down no matter how much I work out because I eat and eat and eat. I am reAdy to change. I'm ready to be healthy. I'm ready to live for the first time in my adult life.

Getting compulsive behavior under control is a process . Be patient with yourself and acknowledge your successes . I found that asking myself why I was experiencing the urges helped to identify the situations where the craving for the addictive substance ( gambling , in my case ) was triggered . In my case , stress and boredom were my two biggest triggers . I started to make lists of things I could do to distract myself when the urges hit , and put those distractions into action . In the beginning , it worked one out of five times . I made myself celebrate that one success instead of focusing on my four failures . Within a month , the ratio began to change .

I don't binge eat either I just eat when I don't really want to, but never binge eat I just eat a meal and move on! The thing that sucks is I was a dipper for years and one day I woke up and said no more and well with some help I have been tobacco free for 18 months, but man this food addiction is tough all I can think about it subway, and doritos, and mountain dew, and Oreos and anything else that I can eat to get My mind if eating. I feel like if I quit dipping I should be able to quit eating, but I know that being successful by yourself is usually a no go. I am the type of person that needs accountability other then myself! I'm not concerned much about weight or scales I just want to kick this food addiction. Any one got any tips other then identifying the triggers, and the emotional attachment.

I would lie about my food habits and hide food in my room to snack on. I have always prided myself on being someone who never did drugs or got into alcohol. I still don't drink and have only ever done drugs (weed) a few times. I always thought I was fairly strong to never get into these habits, because with my depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, I always really felt like I was exactly the type of person who might end up like that. The only problem I realize is now, is that I actually do have an addiction, only to food. I wish I had a clue where to start, but nobody really talks about food addiction and nobody can tell because I hide it, and eating is a normal activity. I know I am unhealthy and this is only making me feel worse. I recently went almost 3 weeks without eating any sweets (which are my main comfort food), and I fell right off the wagon during thanksgiving. I hate myself for this. I want help.

So on a bender I went and gained about 50 lbs. OK so now I AM fat!! I have 2 girls 13 and 15, I would like to be a better role model for them.

I don't like to go anywhere with him because he is so rude and intolerant, and I am ashamed that he is so inconsiderate of obese people’s feelings. You don't need to keep your mum's attitude to dieting and weight loss. Next time she says something like that, listen carefully, and ask if her attitude sounds healthy. Ask yourself if it makes her happy. You can reject her views on dieting without rejecting her. Learn from her mistakes; be smarter. Treat yourself better.

Eventually of course the young athlete grew older and had much less time for training and was more often working than not but he still had time to eat.

It's a 'withdrawal'. it takes a very strong minded person to go through with it, perhaps for a week, when it's in almost everything. However, at least if you do cook your own food, you can be in control. One other thing.....in recent years, when TV programs bang on about 'junk food', I used to react by saying 'food is food'. If you are hungry, you will eat almost anything, and there's no such thing as 'junk food'. After all, poor people from poorer countries don't get the choice. In the Western World, we do.

This is my first post on this forum. I decided to post here under Addiction rather than Binge Eating because, well, the latter is the symptom of the former, and I don't binge so much as find myself desiring a food so much I can't avoid it. So, yeah, I'm addicted to food. I don't know why I am. It probably has everything to do with chronic low-grade depression that I've apparently had since about age 9, and it gets especially bad when I'm stressed out (which is always for the last oh 10 years). My parent's have no addictions at all, and I don't know anyone in my family that is addicted to anything. Me, I'm addicted to food and anything else that ignites the pleasure center of my brain (movies, tv, hobbies...) and it has on occasion affected my life, but not drastically. My food addiction became obvious to me when I admitted to myself that I hid food, planned access to the hidden food, and ate food in secret basically all my life but increasingly so the last few years. Everyone else I know loves food as much as I do, but they don't cave in to the slightest pang of hunger and run to the fridge. None of them are big people. So naturally I become ashamed and don't want to be seen when I secret-eat. Even normal eating sometimes brings fears of ridicule. I'm nearly fainting from hunger not long after a meal (which is another problem), but I'm hesitant to even go and eat an apple lest I hear about it. \"You shouldn't snack,\" \"don't eat between meals\", \"you just ate\". Sometimes these comments never come, but sometimes they do, from people who do not have the same stomach-schedule as I do, are not weak to their addiction. Hints to the addiction were also seen in cravings. I will crave a food, a specific food so strong that it will put pregnant women to shame. If I don't eat that food, I will remain hungry. This can't be physical, because entire meals aren't satisfactory if I want something else. Today, I had a wonderful, big lunch out. An hour later I felt hungry. Yes, I am PMSing right now, and stressed and depressed because of reasons, but there was not one chance that I was actually hungry after eating a meal I could barely finish! I put off eating a snack until a couple hours later, but still. That doesn't make any sense. In any case, I'm addicted to food, all food really, but of course none of the HEALTHY stuff. The depression tells me that nothing matters and that I should eat whatever I want because in the end I'm going to die anyway, might as well enjoy what I love most (and of course that happens to be food). The stress I have in my life is just worsened by the knowledge that I gained weight, because people aren't \"supposed\" to be fat, and of course most people will not find me attractive. Even my long-term partner (who is living in another country at the moment) I worry will leave me once he sees the weight I gained, because he's French, and the French are morbidly terrified of fat. My issues with him is a whole other can of spam.... It's a vicious cycle of eating to de-stress and stressing because I'm eating. The thing I want most I guess is to stop NOT caring that I'm eating myself towards a heart attack, but I really need to stop being so addicted to the types of foods that are destroying my body.", "hash": "ee06bc2ee2342e227dd793970e8e95749434f5927bf1c81806c43aac24a71dc9"}

From eating so much sugar everyday for the past 8 months (the time I was with my horrible ex-boyfriend) I have developed a yest infection in my gut known as Candida, which feeds off sugar.

I have been addicted to sugar for YEARS so I totally get what you are going through. Sugar is so insidious as part of our western culture and you are right it is in EVERYTHING. I have recently gained a bunch of weight due to feeding into my sugar addiction. When I am under stress I can't seem to control my need to gorge on sugary and starchy things (coca cola; licorice black or red; jube jubes, bagels etc). I too have had yeast infections from over consuming over a period of time. And I am also obese as well. I've tried repeatedly to kick the habit and repeatedly failed. I'm posting 2 brief articles my husband wrote on the topic...at the very least it will help you know that this is a problem of epidemic proportions: ARTICLE #1 A World Without Sugar? by Marc Tardif In November 2011, a substance known as Stevia has been approved by the European Food Safety Authority for use as a natural sweetener in drinks and food products. The United States granted Stevia the “generally regarded as safe” (GRAS) status in December 2008. In Canada, Stevia extracts are not currently approved for use in foods, but Health Canada has approved the use of stevia and its extracts as a sweetener in natural health products. Stevia can be purchased as dried leaves and in liquid format at most health food stores. So what is Stevia? It is a liquid extract from the Stevia rebaudiana plant, commonly known as “sweet leaf” or “sugar leaf”. This plant grows naturally in subtropical and tropical regions of the world. It is said to have up to 300 times the sweetness of sugar, but what is especially sweet about Stevia is the fact that it has 0 calories. Stevia is fast becoming an attractive option in a world where obesity epidemics are breaking out in most technologically advanced countries due to the overconsumption of refined sugar. This is no doubt a major motivator for Western food and drug regulation agencies to fast-track their approval. Stevia is also attractive as a replacement for aspartame and other artificial sweeteners due to the fact that it is natural and is not linked to cancer and other diseases in the way that chemically-based artificial sweeteners are. And for people with diabetes, Stevia is a welcomed alternative as it has a negligible effect on blood sugar levels due to its low glycemic index and avoids the risks associated with artificial sweeteners. As one would expect, Coke and Pepsi are in a race to be the first to bring a Stevia-sweetened soft drink to the North American market, as soft drinks have been identified as major contributors to the growing obesity epidemic. We could soon start to see new versions of Stevia-sweetened soft drinks come onto the market, which has already happened in many Asian markets such as Japan. In fact, health food stores are now selling soft drinks sweetened with Stevia, such as the Zevia product line. The amount of new Stevia-based products coming onto the market is increasing, but currently in Canada you would only be able to find such items at your local health food store. Eventually though, it is likely that Stevia-based products will be available everywhere. ARTICLE #2: Hooked on Sugar by Marc Tardif A minority of people have classified the growing obesity epidemic as a drug addiction issue. Let’s examine the concept of sugar addiction a little more closely for it is one that causes much controversy. Refined sugar is traditionally classified as a food “used to improve the palatability of many foods.” 1 A drug is defined as “any absorbed substance that changes or enhances any physical or psychological function in the body.”1 At first glance, it would appear that the words “sugar” and “drug” are diametrically opposed. But when you consider the effect of refined sugar on physiology and mood, the chain reaction of events is not entirely dissimilar to what happens with other drugs. When refined sugar is consumed, a chemical imbalance follows and the body reacts by pumping out insulin to bring blood sugar levels down to a normal level. For most people, mood tends to become more jovial after consuming foods containing refined sugar. And everyone can relate to the feeling of a “sugar high” and the “sugar crash” that follows. While the physiological and mental effects are different with each drug, the high- low cycle and dependence/addiction are hallmarks of drug-like substances. It has always been said that people feel more jovial after eating sugary foods because eating good-tasting food is more pleasurable than eating plain or bad-tasting food. While this is true, recent studies have shown there is more to it than that because refined sugar “is a depressant and, consumed in large amounts, it affects the opiate receptor sites in the central nervous system.” 1 These are the same receptor sites affected by opiates like heroin and morphine. But unlike other drugs, refined sugar is a tough habit to kick because it is added to most everything and is readily available everywhere. And because it is labelled as a food and not as a drug, the overconsumption of refined sugar is described as an obesity epidemic rather than a substance abuse issue. To find out if you are hooked on sugar, try removing foods containing refined sugar and flour and see what happens. You will probably experience withdrawal symptoms as your blood chemistry reacts to the reduction of glucose and the absence of the periodic surge of insulin into your bloodstream. Studies have shown that withdrawal from sugar can be as painful as withdrawal from alcohol. It has been described by those who have undergone both as ‘worse'. 1 Symptoms include mercurial mood swings, irritability, light-headedness and feeling clammy and sweaty. But in a few days you should eventually notice that you feel more stable and clear-minded now that you have gotten off the roller-coaster insulin ride and your opiate receptor sites are no longer being affected. To be clear, naturally-occurring sugars like those found in fruit are not the problem, it is refined sugars that are. Thankfully, Stevia is emerging as a better sweetener alternative which can go a long way to helping in the fight against obesity and addiction to refined sugar. Look for it at your local health food store and use it in place of refined sugar. Be careful though, it takes a lot less Stevia than the amount of refined sugar that would be required to achieve the same sweetness. 1. “The Reclassification of Sugar as a Drug” by Marie-Hélène Lyle, University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. http://www.lurj.org/article.php/vol1n1/sugar", "hash": "63dadbf068f1180f46a5da2b74f1a1e1110345966e504c8e75410ebe23b3e490"}

Spent my ENTIRE life eating whatever I wanted until it caught up to me. I am a glutton and I have a hard time resisting most foods, good and bad. But of course I crave carbs and sugars the most. I also have an issue with portion size, I eat large portions. I'll be full and still eat just because food is available. I am overweight and I really want to lose but my food issue has me conflicted. Often convincing my self \"oh this won't hurt\" or \"I'll be good tomorrow\". I work out 3-4 days a week but they say 80% of weight loss is the good you consume. I look at my mother, who just had gastric sleeve surgery and tell myself that I'm not gonna let my love for food send me to the operating table or diabetes. I'm pre-diabetic now & this is what really concerned me. Ironically, since I researched food addiction and realized I had almost all the signs I find myself not having cravings for the last 2 days.

I live in LA and I'm mid-twenties (and a chick). I'm here to learn healthier eating habits so I can lose weight. I've known for a while that I'm emotionally dependent on food -- when I'm excited/happy/celebrating something, I go straight for food. Likewise, when I'm upset/anxious, I go straight for food. I love food, which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing on its own -- I love to try new foods the way I love to visit new beaches, you know? BUT I'm not emotionally dependent on beaches. So, I desperately want to learn a healthier relationship to food. Dieting simply doesn't work for me. I actually eat well in the home, I rarely get myself junk food. But when I'm offered junk, or I'm at a party or restaurant where there's junk, I have zero willpower. And the thing is, being young and single and living in the city with friends, we go out to eat a ton. I want to hang out with my friends without it equaling be ordering the junkiest thing on the menu and then feeling bad about it afterwards. I'll be getting ready for a party and think, 'I will have one serving of dessert' (there's always plate after plate of cookies, brownies, pie, in my friend circle) -- and then go there and have four cookies, not one. I've recently realized I'm addicted to food, to the way it can change my mood. So I'm here to make friends with people with similar struggles and those who've been there and have advice to impart to me. But in the spirit of not sounding super depressing, I think this is the thing I need which will help me to get better!

But it's caffeine, and people don't really accept it as a serious addiction, even though it is. Because of this, I have told none of my friends or family; also, this is partially because I feel certain they would just brush it off, in the same way as some people brush depression off as 'being sad', or they brush fibromyalgia off as 'faking it'. This is especially likely as I have Asperger's Syndrome which may make people think I'm just 'confused' or 'doing it for attention'. I know I need help, but I do have physical medical issues as well so I'm reluctant to see a GP in case he/she decides that my physical issues are no longer relevant in light of this.

If you don't mind reading this I'd appreciate any insight. Since I'm new to this so I'm just going to put it out there **this might contain triggers**. I'm a 36 year old female,and am significantly overweight. I've been increasingly overweight since my 20's. I've tried diets and exercise programs but I always manage to put back on everything I've lost and then some. Food feels like my only happiness in life, and I've admitted as much out loud. In the morning the only reason I ever want to get out of bed is mostly because I can't wait to eat something. I'll lay in bed and think about what we have in the fridge/pantry and my excitement for whatever we has is what gets me going. If it's a lean week and we don't have anything good (ie; chips, candy, string cheese, soda, ice cream) I become so depressed that I don't want to get up. Once I'm up all I do is think about what I can eat next. All day long. I wear a path in the floor from the couch to the kitchen. When I'm in front of other people I'll eat a normal amount, at a normal pace, and leave a normal amount on my plate all hoping to avoid judgement (can't be the fat girl who cleans her plate), but I'll go home and stuff my face. I rarely ever leave the house. I dread it. I feel so fat, so unattractive, that I don't want people to look at me. I don't even own any decent clothes that fit me anymore and I refuse to buy clothes for my fat self. She doesn't deserve it. She shouldn't even try. I live in fear of being invited to anything. I ended up quitting my full time job because I always had so much anxiety about going out in public and being judged. And I struggled with trying to look nice and professional while I hated myself so much. I would never eat lunch in front of anyone, I rarely ate anything in front of anyone. Which is lame, I'll admit, because OBVIOUSLY I love eating...no one becomes this overweight suddenly or by accident. So now my husband and I are struggling to live off his income alone which means no vacations, no fun outings, no fun purchases. Thankfully we can afford pizza. I don't have Facebook or any kind of social media account because I used to be really pretty and I don't want anyone from my past to see what I've done to myself. I'm basically hiding from the world. I don't feel like I deserve to go out anyway. I go to great lengths to hide from friends and family because I worry there will be cameras and pictures of Fat Me will end up on Facebook, and I worry about how my friends and family might judge me. In fact my sister asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding and initially I said yes but now I'm trying to think of a good reason to back out. I can't imagine standing up in front of 150 people and be judged, never mind that she'll plaster pics all over Facebook (as is her right as the happy bride) and people will see what I've become, how far I've fallen. I'm just hoping to avoid all the anxiety and depression that I know will come with trying to \"pretty up\" myself and, naturally, fall short. With all of the ways that my eating habits have ruined my life (more than I've mentioned here) it occurs to me that I've allowed it to happen. And continue to allow it. But most of the time I feel powerless to eat less or more healthfully. Junk food feels like my only happiness. Even if it's just a moment of happy here and there. Going to the grocery store almost feels like (what I imagine) going to buy drugs feels like. I'm wondering if I could have a food addiction. If I do I definitely came by it naturally...before she passed, my mother was a (recovering) drug addict and alcoholic. Somehow I seem to have sidestepped those issues but I'm SO fat. I'd almost rather be an alcoholic or drug addict because at least those people don't WEAR their addictions, not all of them anyway. Anyone who looks at me, instead of through me, will assume I'm weak, suffering, lazy, unhappy, etc etc... It's so embarrassing to be overweight. Do I have a food addiction do you think?

I tell my mom everything. She's my best friend. We tell each other absolutely everything. I'm just not sure how to tell her about this. There's a huge back story to this, but I think it's mostly due to stress. One year I lost 6 people who were very close to me within 5 months. I don't talk to one of my brothers anymore because he uses/makes crystal meth (he doesn't live with us anymore). My aunt can go to prison for 10+ years because of meth charges she has, my parents fight a lot, money is a big problem, my therapist doesn't help, my grandma is dying, my dad is dying, & it's making a huge impact on me. I was vegetarian for over a year, but my binge eating has gotten so out of control that I started eating meat again. (I became vegetarian for personal reasons, not health problems.) I spent 15 minute typing the whole story earlier, but it didn't save. I attempted suicide in February, I've dealt with self-harm for about two years, I've suffered with depression even longer. I was always a bit overweight throughout my life, but it's never been to this point. When I was on my vegetarian diet I was very happy and confident in myself, but a lot of family problems started going on and my school work was getting ridiculous. I would spend 3-4 hours after school working on school work & I would give my all in every class, but I would still just barely pass them. (I'm in 10th grade.) But recently my binging is beyond out of control and I've gotten to the point that I started eating meat again. The last thing I ever wanted to do is start eating meat again. One night it was so out of control I didn't even realize I was eating meat. My body soon got use to it and that's when I started gaining a lot of my weight back. I started going on late night drives to McDoanlds, only a mile away, & I started hiding food in my room & car. I would eat secretly & constantly eat when everyone was sleeping. I would eat an entire cheese pizza at least 3 times a week. I would drink over 2 liters of coke a day. I would eat multiple ham & cheese sandwiches throughout the day & still snack in between. One night I ordered five double cheeseburgers from mcdonalds & hid them in my room. I baked & ate an entire cheese pizza in one sitting, ate two bowls of ramen noodles, ate a ham & cheese sandwich, & drank a gallon of sweet tea. After that I went & ate two of the five cheeseburgers then threw up because I was so full, then continued to eat the rest of the burgers, & made a grilled cheese sandwich and drank 32oz of coke. My food addiction is out of control. I feel disgusting and hate myself after binging, but I continue to do it and I don't know why. I current go to therapy for severe depression and anxiety. I'm on Lexapro for my depression now, and it does help my mood a bit, but my therapist doesn't really help me. All she says is \"Oh, tell me more. Okay. I see. When would you like to schedule your next appointment?\" We don't really have a conversation, she just seems to pretend to act interested. My dad frequently makes comments on my weight like \"Damn, you're getting fat!\" \"I can't find the TV remote. Did you eat it?\" & things like that. I understand I'm overweight, but his comments still really hurt. I tend to wear over sized, baggy clothes to hide my body. I'm so tired of it. I know I need help and I really want to tell my mom, I just don't know how. How do I bring it up? What do I say? How do I tell her I binge to the point that I hate myself? My mom & I can talk about anything from drugs & sex to depression & suicide. (I've only ever smoked pot, which I haven't in a year, & I'm not sexually active.)

I live with my mom...and even though she does not care to admit that she has issues of her own..like I do. she does seem to be a hoarder. the cubards in our kitchen are completly full all the time! if you were to take all the stuff out of them you would probably find dates on them that go all the way back to the 80's and i know that I have found things in the freezer before. that have freezer burn...she even has a HUGE outdoor freezer that literally things from when i was in elementary school. and she claims that she is saving it for special occasions and the words \"that was mine\" are heard quite a lot also. in fact the key to the outdoor freezer I have frankly not seen it in several months. what hurts even more is she knows I have an eating disorder. I do not always eat as often as I am supposed to or when I am supposed to. And I don't really always consider oh is this mine or is someone else's my mind set has almost always been if its in the house and its in the kitchen then anyone there can have it. but this is not how things work. I just heard her step into the kitchen and she is already complaining about the milk nearly being gone. My boyfriend and I drink milk....but he is getting paid tomorrow and has completely no issue what so ever in going out and getting new milk for the household. I get that she just got it a day ago...but honestly food is not a decoration its there to be in fact EATEN this behavior drives me nuts and is one of the main reasons why i am working so hard at putting in extra hours and looking for a second job. So we can get out of this house. My mom refuses to see her faults will not try to get help or admit maybe she just like me has mental health issues. and I can not possibly move forward in my life dealing with my mental illness around someone that does not take care of theirs them selves.", "hash": "a08e7c4880c03b1dbed4837b1ec0be35ab843ba5109fcfd64f329b4a444da694"}

My parents in law are suffering an addiction problem at the moment. My fiance's dad was diagnosed with lung cancer earlier this year but is finding it extremely difficult to stop smoking as is his wife. Speaking to the pair of them I've noticed similarities between my own attempts to lose weight. I've struggled with my weight as long as I can really remember, I was always a bit podgy and was bullied in school due to this. I had a rather \"hearty\" appetite and Sunday lunch was always two largeish bowls of pasta, tomato sauce topped with cheese at my grans house. As you can probably imagine high school was pretty hellish even though I wasn't hugely overweight. My parents made attempts to address my problem as I'd always opt for baggy clothes. Unfortunately I think that only made matters worse and I started scoffing in private instead. My mother and grandmother always seemed to be at some weight loss class or another. Both enjoyed some short-lived success at times but I just kept quiet regarding my weight. As an adult I've tried a few classes and like my mother and grandmother found it too difficult to stick to any plan. Over the last couple of years my habits have gotten worse, I find myself constantly craving fast food, crisps and sweets. I reckon I must spend around £100 on fast food each month (which I can't afford to do). I shudder to think of the number of times I've opted to use £20 our weekly food budget on a take away rather than buying raw ingredients (which would give us far more meals). As a result we've then ended up having very little to buy proper food and ended up eating the same couple of cheap meals for a week. I frequently eat until I feel extremely sick, often think about food, have many many foul moods where I can only really focus on how weak a person I must be and this is pretty much ruling my life right now. Over pretty much my whole life I've gotten bigger and bigger and am able to pack away a disgusting amount of food. I'm well into the obese numbers on the BMI chart and avoid going to my doctor in case he says anything about my weight. My poor fiance is at a loss so I'm hoping that maybe this is indeed what I'm suffering and I can perhaps find ways to help myself. My first step is to change my daily eating habits to ensure I have three nutritious meals a day with small snacks in between. At the moment I often don't eat until I get home from work at night then end up eating far more than I need. Second step is to start making meals from scratch again. I always enjoyed making curry and pasta sauces but have gotten very lazy about this recently and have been buying jars from the shop (which are generally full of rubbish). I'll have a look at other threads for more ideas.", "hash": "2971c7c3749fd84f67f9b27f4ea0174cb36f84a734f460552307348a2e1252fe"}

As a lot of you may know, theh cause extreme weight gain Mainly due to the appetite increase. i became a tyoe 2 diabetic at age 19 because of it, and my appetite was never the same even after stopping to take the drugs. I've managed to lose about 220lbs since 2009, and Im still overweight and battle food obsession daily. Taking lithium now, which increases appetite a little bit too. I've found a few techniques that seem to work, though some of you might find them silly or extreme. Number one: dont count calories. Or plan meals. Or get a strict diet. Im serious. We all worry so much about the food we eat that we end up thinking about food way more than we should. Dont take note of what you ate, dont count calories, do t beat yourself up to keep it under control. The mere stress from doing this is enough to open an appetite. It obviously KEEPS REMINDING YOU OF FOOD. and really, spend 5 minutes telling yourself \"i will not eat my favorite item on burger king's menu, i will not eat my favorite item on burger king's menu\". What do you feel like doing now? Number two: Medication. if your appetite is too extreme, consider taking medication. Or stopping. Dopamine antagonists, antihistamines and serotonin increasers are usually the main culprits in appetite increasing. If you take antipsychotics, antidepressants, allergy medication or sleep aids, you might be getting your appetite from them. And honestly, its unlikely it will subside as long as you take the meds. Rry switching around medications until you find one that impacts your appetite too much. Dopamine agonists (aka stimulants) and other dopamine increasing drugs are in my opinion the best appetite supressants. Number three: now, this is not healthy at all and outright gross, but.... ever considered NOT SWALLOWING? lets be rational... any kind of food above your necessary daily calorie intake will become fat. On the other hand, your unconsiderate brain doesnt stop begging for more and more food. Why dont you give it what it wants and buy a huge ammount of food? Go all out on a favorite food shoppjng spree. Get that delicious, ever so desired piece of delicious heaven on your mouth, chew it, savor it, chew it some more.... and spit it out. Do it. I do it. I chew it and spit it on a plastic cup. I chew an entire pizza by myself and spit it all out. Ebentually I get tired, satisfied ans grossed out. Buys me more time without eating or thinking about food, and my brain gets what it wants without screwing up my body. Number 4: try reducing simple carbs. I know i contradicted tactic number 1 here, but honestly, sugar is bad. It is addicting, it is very caloric, it is very easy to digest, it messes up appetite by itself and it is delicious. Going cold turkey on sugary foods, pasta, bread and so on works best for me. You cant really stop a cocaine binging habit by reducing a few grams per day, I believe... the cocaine itself will make you want more from it. So will sugar make you want more and more sugar. *mod edit* Anyways, this is what i do. I still battle a never ending appetite and food obsession daily and have trouble losing weight, but this is what worked best for me.

When you read the posts, there's a lot of people who can relate to something from their childhood, or teenage years, that they feel may have caused this. I don't think anyone is entirely sure. I too seem to have been a 'hearty eater' to put it politely, since as far back as I can recall, but I was not aware of it being a problem, and I wasn't a fat child, or teenager. However I was never skinny either. When you are young, you are usually active, (in my case walking to school) there weren't the same amount of fast food places then either, (I'm of retirement age so I only remember sweet shops, bakers and the fish & chip shop), and there wasn't the cash around to spend on too much, (in my particular case). So.....there were less temptations I guess. This may then suggest lack of willpower being to blame. Again it's not that simple either.

I'd like to say I don't think of food every day, from the moment I get up, to the moment I go to bed, but I'm afraid I still do that. Some 'ordinary' eaters would say I must be bored then. I should find something else to do that would excite and stimulate me. I've always been a simple person. I enjoy my family, walking, shopping, reading, watching TV, gardening etc. When I'm doing these things, I'm feeling content, so why am I still thinking of food? Crazy, isn't it? However, there is always hope. Never forget that. I gave up smoking around 12 years ago, and although I regularly pat myself on the back for that success......I still have a sneaky feeling that my eating probably increased round about the same time, as they say smoking is an appetite suppressant. One of the reasons people don't give up smoking, as they are worried about putting on weight sadly. However, I overate a lot then, even while smoking, but I was a lot younger then and a lot more active, so I was burning off the calories. Now, I've got lazy too. I have recognized the food items that I crave, and try not to buy them. I walk past the fast food places (who shall be nameless, but you know who I mean), as, just like an alcoholic, if I go in and eat one?.....I'll crave one the next day and the next. I am convinced that the flavour enhancers are addictive, just like other drugs. I also believe they are intentionally so. I also believe that if you stop.....and it will take about a week to hopefully get over the addiction....your taste buds will get used to unadulterated food items, especially if you can hang on until you are really hungry before eating. Please re-visit, to tell how you are doing.", "hash": "ff2b099f76393664dcdad8b301399dea6292ea9a2192a6da494d65d5a06ce552"}

The articles said no one has time to prepare six small meals much less eat them and it's too costly. They said if you exercise i.e. aerobics, it makes you eat more and move less than you would have throughout the day. They said people can lose weight the hard way (lots of exercise, frequent small meals, lots of fruits and veggies) but because it's so hard, people have a hard time keeping the weight off.

Eating one meal per day or restricting in general might cause the insides to look clean, it will have an impact at the cellular level. Your body needs a constant source of energy to draw from and eating only one meal per day is going to cause it to go in and out of survival mode. Gradually this will mean that your body's metabolism slows down. There are some bulimics who don't throw up and use laxatives. We restrict food until a binge happens, then exercise as much as possible or avoid eating altogether. Most bulimics are average or above average weight, and part of that is because of a messed up metabolism. Muscle burns more calories. Of the times I've been healthy and tried to lose weight in a good way, building up muscles was the way to go. After I got stronger it seemed like the weight came off quicker and the inches came off fast. Walking is good but your heart is going to need a little more than that to keep strong for the rest of your life.

It might sound silly but I like playing video games a lot and last month I made a topic on my friends gaming forums where I said I was going to try to start losing weight. The first month is over now from when I started on 1/24/14 *mod edit* I have been trying to get advice from the people that post on the forums there and I'm not really getting much help nor the support that i'm seeking. As you can see I was starting out at 369.3lbs and my goal is trying to get down to 180lbs, I am 6'0 and I realize that goal is going to be super hard but I am ready to do it. I have never really tried to lose the weight before because I've never really had a reason to or at least thats what I told myself. I want to start getting healthy to be able to support my family. I have 5 brothers and 2 sisters all who are younger and I want to be around to be able to take care of them and I realize I won't be able to do that if I die at age 30 from a heart attack which is the road that I was on. So during my past few weeks I have been weekly pictures of my progress which I'd like to share. *mod edit* (First week is over 1/31 and i'm 363.) The end of my second week *mod edit*. By Feb 10th I am at 355 *mod edit* (my toenail fell off after my grandma dropped a plank of wood on it .) Now finally by 2/25 the month is over and i'm down to 353 *mod edit* So for the past month I started my goal I lost 16lbs and I know that I could have done sooo much better. On every chance I had I cheated and had no regrets until I was done snacking on whatever it was. I realized the most important part of losing my weight was actually wanting to lose the weight which is why i'm here seeking knowledge and support. I am looking for any tips on what you might do instead of eating when your hungry because I can go the entire day eating 800 calories or so and then when it hits like 8PM-9PM I get urge to start eating whatever I can find and thats when I crash and end up eating another 800+ calories sometimes 1000+.. During my diet, I wake up and have a normal sized bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios with skim milk and for lunch and dinner I have a lean cuisine which are about 220 calorie each putting me around 800-900 calories a day. I stopped drinking soda and all I drink now is water. Any tips or motivation would be great and I would really appreciate it. Thank you.

I'm recovering from bulimia as well (I always say recovering because it's easy to slip into relapse) and find myself in a pattern of eating too much at night as well. Eating food at night usually leads to an uncomfortable sleep. If you eat salty foods before bed, you'll get thirsty at night. Sugary foods will cause a sugar drop during sleep and will cause you to wake up in a panic. You've likely already noticed this. If you're anything like me, eating to calm down an emotion is like an automatic reflex, so when that panic or disturbed feeling sets in, I want to stuff it down with food. It can be a taste, a texture, or just the action or chewing... I want something else to focus on. You've likely already tried all the obvious solutions like keeping binge foods out of the home and eating a larger meal. One thing that's helped for me is to drink strong herbal teas. The sweet taste curbs my appetite a bit and it seems like a treat too. Hang in there. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota.", "hash": "aa23e212bca1741f68d0a0b3a33c79a82f727c25538fcb578c324a1d13f0ad9b"}

There didnt seem to be much open to me without spending money I do not have so I started researching the crud out of it. I googled and podcast searched my little heart out and found some really helpful stuff. I found that trying to completely cut it out sugar increased my want for it, but eating a lot of it also increased my want for it. I had to find a safe medium where my urges for sugar are more controllable. This is a very fine line, if I accidently go over I basically start again. I am not sure if this is food addiction, binge eating or both. But it is a start. I have all the knowledge for weightloss, but putting it into practice is proving extremely difficult.

It feels really good to binge eat after sticking to a healthy diet. I have studied nutrition and sugar is the worst thing you can eat. Eating foods with fat and carbs is actually very good for your body because they make us feel full when sugar makes us want more and more. Sugars serve no dietary purpose for our body and gives us no energy unlike protein, fat and carbs. So my first tip of advice would to see if you can go a day without sugar. You can still eat whatever you like to eat to make yourself feel full. Now see if you can go three days without sugar. If you can great and give yourself a pat on the back. Then why not go three weeks without sugar? And eventually it will be easier to go three months (90 days) without sugar. If you relapse don't feel bad and go on a binge. You have conditioned your mind to resist impulses and have made mental progress. The magic number is 90 days and that's usually where your mind reconfigures itself. After that point your sugar eating is no longer a habit and you may choose to stop eating completely or eat in moderation. But at that point I doubt you'll ever want to eat sugar again because you know that it just harms you. You may have to eat sugar around friends and family but you'll be able to prevent yourself from going on binges. My second tip of advice is to create a realistic nutrition plan which you can implement using the method above. Use an online Body Mass Ratio (BMR) calculator like this one: http://exrx.net/Calculators/CalRequire.html I am assuming that you are a age 25 female with a body fat ratio of 30% (slightly overweight) who spends 23 hours resting and spends 1 hour everyday walking and running. Your estimated number of calories you need a day is 2605. 2205 is the number of calories you need everyday to lose weight without exercise. You can eat more if you exercise and the heavier you exercise the more calories you will lose per day. It is intimidating to start exercising if you haven't done so in a while. If you feel too self conscious to go to a gym try going to a park and doing light jogging. If you feel too self conscious for this go during the evening or night time, given that your area is safe. I was a chubby kid and did this for 1 year until I got confident enough to exercise in the morning and eventually sign up for a gym. Remember that you will always have time to exercise and use getting healthy as your motivation. The fastest way to lose weight is to build muscle. If you are overweight this body will consume your natural reserves to build muscle. If you are a woman others will not notice this muscle due to the lack of testosterone which makes muscles bulge. It will be only when you flex really hard that the muscle will be slightly visible. Your body stores fat in your hips and butt making these areas stand out when you exercise. For a person high in fat, adopt a \"keto diet\" high in fat and protein and low in carbs. You can eat as much chicken, peanut butter, eggs, avacados and olive oil as you like. Your body will go into ketosis and use up your body's fat reserves very quickly.", "hash": "9fb793ece0b584fd792131b7335fcf140aeaed5273bab58c1f1388f8ca0f2431"}

Thoughts are hard to control, and the ways I know involve effort, the effort needed to control your attention, to focus your mind, to stay with anything including controlling or reducing weight. An excellent way to learn to control your mind is simply to count your breaths. Losing count tends to give almost immediate feedback that you've stopped paying attention. I do it a lot. I stopped at 600 when I started this. Counting breaths also interferes with other thinking, such as thoughts of food. Gradually it can almost entirely replace thoughts of food.

I use to never be this bad. Well, not that I can remember. Almost 2 years ago I was going through a lot and part of it was a divorce and restraining order and etc. I focused on just going on my treadmill constantly. Every time I had a horrible thought, just go on the machine, and start adding weights. At first, I couldn't even handle 3 min on the treadmill. So I made it my goal that every day for a week that I would try to speedwalk on the treadmill for 3 min a day. Then every week after would add either 2-5 min. It worked, I also done what I always dreamed was to be able to jog a couple miles without feeling that I was dying. Plus I joined WW, that all helped and I found a wonderful man. I lost 80 pounds! Awesome, right? Wrong, after I accomplished all that I got almost to my goal and for some reason I just sabotaged it all. All that work and lost all that weight in like 8 months. But afterwards, I quit everything and started eating and eating and eating, even if I'm already full. I keep eating till it hurts so bad that I rest for awhile. Then like 15 min later, I go eat something else. I feel terrible because all I have is food on the brain non-stop. I feel like I'm going crazy. Well, in about 6 months, I gained over half of that weight back that I worked so hard to lose. People said I was on the stress-diet and that's how I lost it. After all that work and to gain 6+ sizes back in only 6 months. What is wrong with me? I try not to go out anymore or hang out with my friends because I feel so disgusted with myself. My friends tell me I need to be surrounded by them but I don't want to it just makes me feel more like crap, seeing them all skinny, happy, not a care in the world about food, that I so constantly have on my mind. I feel crazy. Can someone out there please give me some words of advice? I feel like I'm slipping back into my cave under my blankets in my bedroom again. I've been doing that for the past few months now. I need help. My doc just keeps prescribing more meds. But I don't want that, cover it up and a pill will make it all go away. There's got to be something else to do. and yes I know about the God thing and to just keep praying but its hard for me to concentrate on that when I'm thinking about food and yes I tried reading the bible and its hard when I'm thinking about food. So please, spare me the gospel preaching. I'm so sorry just rambling on and on. I honestly, do not want to offend anybody. I just feel like crap and this is the first time me going on these post forum things. So please bear with me. I'm sorry.

Anyhow, I agree that sugar and floury things are generally pretty bad for your health, especially in largish quantities. I do believe, though, that eggs are great for us! So, if your problem is that you want to eat a big skillet of eggs, I say go for it! Anyhow, how long has this been going on? Sounds like a new thing? Has there been any other big changes for you? Can you remember how you ate before this problem and try to do the same for a few days? If something like that doesn't work, I kinda think you should try cold turkey on the wheat and sugar for a while. If you are still having trouble with no wheat and no sugar, then you might want to go further and cut out all starchy foods and sweets (including fruit!). But I'd just start w the wheat and sugar. Have you read Wheat Belly? Very eye opening about the addictive qualities of wheat, and it has all been true for me. If I eat wheat I just want MORE.

I'm not the only one??? by anemone999 » Tue Jul 13, 2010 4:59 am Hello all, I am shocked, and relieved, that I'm not the only person in the world that is hooked on food. Right now I'm seeing a psychologist, and she's helping me figure out the reasons why I eat so much. Number one reason: I grew up with an alcoholic mother (also an undiagnosed bipolar), and I never ever knew what to expect from one day to the next. Really the only thing ever constant in my life was food. Food was my friend. It was available when my mother was smashing things against the wall or screaming at me in a rage. Food made me feel better. The only time when I was ever \"slender\" was when I smoked, which I quit years ago. So I grew up relying on food to soothe emotions. When I'm happy, I eat. When I'm stressed, I eat. When I'm sad, I eat. My therapist is trying to help me with replacement behaviors for eating all the time. Go for a walk. (Really? When grabbing a cookie takes 5 seconds?....lol) Yes it's an uphill battle. Yes I like food, and good food too. Anyone else battle this?

Many of us with this problem have found help in Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous (FA). FA is a program based on the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. The program offers help and recovery to those whose connection with food can be understood as a form of addiction. There are no dues or fees and the meetings include no weigh-ins. Membership is international and includes men and women, adolescents, and the elderly. All are welcome. People who find help in FA vary greatly. Some of us have been diagnosed as morbidly obese while others are undereaters. Among us are those who were severely bulimic, who have harmed themselves with compulsive exercise, or whose quality of life was impaired by constant obsession with food or weight. We tend to be people who, in the long-term, have failed at every solution we tried, including therapy, support groups, diets, fasting, exercise, and in-patient treatment programs. Some of our members have been in continuous recovery (maintaining a stable, healthy weight and enjoying freedom from obsession with food, weight, bingeing, or bulimia) for over twenty-five years. Members with five to ten years of recovery are increasingly common. FA has over 350 meetings throughout the United States in large and small cities such as Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Charlotte, Grand Rapids, Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Austin, and Washington, D.C. Internationally, FA currently has groups in England, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and Australia. If you would like more information about FA, please check out our website.

My Father is a large, obese man. He has gotten so big that he has to sleep with a machine every night strapped to his face to give him air because he can't breathe at night. My dad works two jobs, my mother one. My dad loves to eat out so much that he spends all the money eating giant meals. $400 a month average. Me and my mother when we DO go out, we try and split something or we order something small. My dad loves buffets, giant drinks, and he eats out every meal. Its taken such a toll that my mother has moved out. She refuses to stay in that house where he doesn't do anything. Because of his eating he now takes blood pressure pills, which me and my mother do not agree with as we believe in natural medicines. The pills make have turned his face beet red and made him tired which now causes him to do NOTHING but sleep, eat even more, and watch TV. I have been taking care of him (cleaning, cooking, etc) but im at the end of my rope. Any food i cook, he doesn't eat..he wants to eat out. Has anyone been in this situation before? Anyone have any advice...... I've come to think that there's nothing I can do as the fact is my dad doesn't want to change.

First for him to understand that this source of pleasure will cause pain from illneses and even death in perspective. So he needs to find happineas in other things. Hobby, sport, satisfing activity(not other addiction like sex, videogames, drugs, and so on). Second thing that us up to you, dante is to pray to God that your father would change his way of life. You might think that I just screw around or mean something else, but im not. Try to pray in your thoughts to God,for example in the morning and before sleep, so that God can help your father to stop destroying his body. Once agsin its not a joke.

It's really easy to get the two of those mixed up and equally hard to figure out what to do about it, which I'm sure you already know. Focusing on what you're feeling and thinking when the urge to binge happens can help you figure out what is causing you to crave it so much. I still sometimes can't figure out where the trigger came from, but that moment of reflection will often stop the binge from happening. It takes a lot of practice but is worth it. You've learned to binge from two generations of family members before you so healthy eating is going to feel foreign and uncomfortable for a while. I went through something similar and there are methods of learning how to eat normally that do work. Eating by rote is one of them, but that comes after catching the binge before it happens and figuring out the triggers. Keeping your binge foods around will mean having to deal with constant temptation. Sugar is my crutch as well, and I try to keep none of that around. If I do, it's a small amount. Anything more than that is setting myself up for failing. For instance, I bought some Halloween candy that was meant for trick or treaters, but I knew it was there and ate it. I'll have to buy more but will have to make sure I do that the day of Halloween. Anyhow, I hope this message helps a little. Let us know how you're doing. Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota.", "hash": "34ebdf91c8c1b3075b89010cc1293c7ac4fb96f0b33692919fdbfabc088b36f5"}

I have three things that have allowed me to take some control back. 1. If we let ourselves get to the point where we are so stressed that immediate relief is our top priority, then we will do whatever brings that relief in the fastest, most efficient way possible, and the reality is that food, especially sugar, brings it a lot faster than going for a walk. The key is to find ways to reduce stress before it gets to a crisis point. Once we are in crisis, adrenaline robs our brain of the ability to maintain a healthy list of priorities and the need for relief overpowers every other consideration. 2. The brain is always trying to communicate things to us, dragging them up from unconsciousness to consciousness. Because these messages are longstanding, the brain has lost the ability to communicate them in a direct way. This means that our unconscious communicates with our conscious brain in ways that can be confusing. We are left to infer from our feelings and behavior just what it is that our brain is trying to tell us. Ask yourself, what is it that my brain is trying to tell me by triggering this urge to eat? What is the source of the stress? 3. Don't waste time after you eat beating yourself up. You have not been in control. It was not a wilful decision. It was an automatic reflex. Instead of berating yourself with an accusatory \"Why would I do that to myself?\", insert the words \"I wonder\" in front and you now have an actual question to answer, posed out of curiosity instead of condemnation. What was the sequence of events and feelings that led up to the act? Start to keep track of these sequences and see if any patterns emerge. Your life is a goldmine of data. Start using it to your advantage. Anyway, I have applied these insights and have recently turned the corner not just on my eating, but on my overall health. I hope this is of benefit to you.", "hash": "f3cb294cbeb86143036351f516143cd5c68da450890542c1ed25196861a7ed69"}

The problem is I am addicted to MacDonalds. It's not that the food is unhealthy in small amounts, but the quality of the sugar and the salt and the oil in their fishburgers and so forth, has permanently warped my mind. I think about it all of the time. I even have the discipline not to go there again, but I still think about it. It's because the pleasure of it is so intense. I thought about it, and I would rate MacDonalds to be as pleasurable as anything but Holy Communion and Desire itself. Now Holy Communion, for those of you that don't know, is the highest point of the faith, there aint nothing that beats it - if anything beats it, it is because God lets it and He doesn't do that often. Desire, you would know, is constant pleasure. So how does something become that pleasurable and not be illegal? The thing is, being hypervigilant, and realizing that MacD was addictive, I actually started to take steps to see if I could ignore it. For example, I bought the burgers and walked away from the store, looking down at the ground and when I was at home, then... I ate them. Only this did not erase the memory of the store from my mind. Then I shrugged it off, and just ate them normally. Then I let those two memories conflict... and you know what? My memory couldn't tell me there was a time when I was not at the store! That's when I knew I had a problem: the pleasure of ... had redefined my memory - I do not take that lightly. So I am left with two weapons: Holy Communion and Desire:: and I have one enemy: MacDonalds. Somehow they have manufactured their food to be completely exciting, like obscenely exciting and no one thinks they are doing the wrong thing!!! I have started to rule out eating foods that even look like MacDonalds! I'm not sure if you know a secret to the mind, that lets you override pleasure or something, but it would really help. Undoubtedly, a lot of you would have had MacD. If you see nothing wrong with it: ask yourself \"Do I make my choices, or does my food make my choices?\" I am not even trying to be confrontational there. Of course, I know its not the end of the world, and for those of you who don't have the self control to even stop anything, I have prayed for you. It may be that prayer is the only answer.", "hash": "b51bf5358503211c813d4a3ea197268d68cebd13407301e50454dc788a42880b"}

I have been battling food and sugar addiction for the last 10 years. And losing I might add. I've tried OA (which I hated),hypnosis, even that ridiculous thing Winona Judd tried - brain balancing or something, supplements, iridologists, and a few naturpaths. I have diabetes type 2, pcos, alopecia, adrenal fatigue, edema, arthritis, depression and probably some other stuff they haven't found. I also did not binge and I ate foods today that usually trigger a binge for lunch. I am 50 lbs overweight but have the problems of someone 100 lbs overweight. I realized a few yrs ago I had a problem and that I always had a problem but b/c I had an active lifestyle I managed to stay fairly thin. Then I moved to the burbs, drove everywhere (NYC u walk everywhere) did not cook (all there is Italian and fast food), lost my artistic community (not too many bohemians in the burbs, so few friends and eventually none), and two jobs (so no time to be healthy). I was eating out of loneliness, stress, despair, and convenience. Recently my fingers and toes began tingling, a sign of neuropathy for diabetics which can lead to amputation. Even this could not keep me from the twinkles as a matter of fact the anxiety made me buy two packs. Last year I lost 20 pounds but it was all consuming. All I did was shop, cook, and menu plan. It was intense. I could not sustain it and gained it all back quickly. I don't remember why I did this. I am such a dramatic extreme person as u can c from the previous strategies. I vaguely remember praying to God, who I have a love/hate relationship with. Anyway I decided to binge on water. Not my usual tentative sips, that barely drained a cup all work day, but 4 to 5 of the starbuck's Venti sized cups that I use as my water container. 4 o clock came and no twinkles, no chocolate even my cubicle mate noticed, which made me noticed.

I love dark chocolate and have a couple of blocks per day. As for weight gain, I have recently discovered something that sounds ridiculous, yet it is working for me now. Down the road, who knows. I was hit by car a few months ago on bicycle, now wear a back brace and it has a cinch line on it, so I can tighten belt to point where my stomach has stopped sending all those crazy lying messages to my brain that I am hungry, when I am not. Shocked that I have lost about 25 pds. or so in the past few months this way . I know know most can't go out and purchase and start wearing a bulky back brace, but I looked on internet, and there are abdominal binders that are used after surgeries, to help strengthen stomach muscles, etc., also used after a c-section, and after hysterectomy to help draw in the stomach to strengthen muscles. Material is porous and air can flow through material, also velcroe to cinch abdominal binder. Haven't tried binder yet. Do not know if it will cinch as tightly to stop the feeling of hunger (empty tummy) as well or at all, like the belt does. Patchoulijade. Sounds crazy, I know, yet I am losing weight. I had lost 100 pds. prior to 5/5/12 wreck; gained 58 back, now have lost", "hash": "bab3a6a31b8035ea7a950743c2b2d54f700e9cae803ca24528a0c9581c2ab22c"}

I am a binge eater. I am constantly nervous, and my nervousness is translated by hunger...that feeling in my stomach must mean that I'm hungry! I tend to get double of what I need and eat it all in one day...A family sized bag of chips can be gone in a single sitting with me holding onto it. It's a nervous reaction- I ate one chip, so it's okay if I eat another, and another, and another...till the bag is quickly gone. It's okay though, there's another bag of chips in case I want more. I consider myself addicted to milk products. Breakfast, lunch and dinner (unless I'm eating sweets for breakfast), 8/10 times will contain excessive amounts of cheese, cream or sour cream. When thirsty I will forgo water and choose milk instead. I am in adoration of those two things to the point that people like to ask me--- \"you going to have some noodles with all that cheese?\" or \"you going to have some potato with all that sour cream.\" To give you a picture, one tube of sour cream for a potato at a restuarant is never enough, I always have to ask for more sour cream because I don't like the taste of the potato without sour cream on it. xD My sandwich HAS to have cheese. I won't eat it without it, and if it doesn't have it, I'll put some on it. xD And so on and so forth. One of my favorite lunches is ramen noodles with sour cream, which, to your probable horror, involves me putting half a cup of sour cream in a single bowl of noodles. The fact is, I might as well be starving myself. I get almost no nutrients in a day, it's all fat and sugar and water. That's it. That's what I eat every day. It's a wonder I function at all with my lack of nutrients and junk diet... Now though, it's getting to be a problem. I do not consider myself overweight, I am only a small amount over the weight I should be. So even though I eat tons of fat, it never goes anywhere on my body that I can tell. The problem is that real food has started to make me sick. Meat, vegetables, I used to be polite and eat all of them on my plate though I didn't like them. But now, I can't stomach meat. I can eat maybe three bites of meat and I feel full, any more meat and I feel sick. It isn't just meat, it's practically anything solid...I can eat junk food all day and feel fine, but put real food in front of me, and I can't finish my plate. It is beginning to stretch over into solid foods in general. For example, I take a few bites of a sandwich and I feel sick to my stomach. I have been forcing myself to eat. The only thing I haven't been forcing myself to eat has been, of course, junk food that's nothing but air and salt or sugar, because I don't feel anything after eating junk food. Does anyone know what could be causing the the sick stomach after eating even small amounts of solid and real food?

I am diabetic and my meds have almost stopped working. My blood sugar is constantly around 500. I think the meds would work if I quit binge eating every night. I only eat one meal a day, at night. The reason for this is that if I eat earlier in the day, my body bloats out and I'm so uncomfortable I can't do anything and my clothes don't fit. I mean like 9 months pregnant kinda bloat...and no stomach/gas pills don't work. It's more of an inflammation than a gas prob. I have Crohns and Fibro and a bunch of other probs. Seriously if I eat one piece of lettuce this happens. Also, if I eat...I can't stop eating. I also can't say no to many foods so I don't keep much around that's pre-prepared. SO...it's become habitual to eat at night after all the work and excercizing are done. Problem is I binge and eat 3 meals worth in one setting. I also take my evening meds around 4 to 5 and they give me kind of a buzz that makes me really not care so that adds to the prob of binge eating. I'm also OCD so now this has become a part of a ritual. I'm to the point with the diabetes that I am jeopardizing myself and doing more nerve damage constantly....and yet I eat. I excercize A LOT. I mean way more than most people do. 3 miles a day fast walking, gardening ...en mass, I have an iris farm and right now do all the work myself by hand. You'd think I'd burn up the excess but it does'nt work that way. Calorically I eat a normal amount for a day...just all at once. Now, if I cut down on that which I have not been able to do psychologically...I would not be getting enough calories or nutrition, but i could get my diabetes under control which is the main objective. I have tried to psych myself out by filling myself with low glycemic food....but inevitably I crave fruit and carbs...and end up binge eating those. My mind rationalizes everything, especially after my night meds. I looked for an overeaters annymous chpter near me but there isn't one. I also don't drive and have nobody to drive me. I live way out in the boonies. I looked for an OA message board but there isn't one that I can find which really surprises me. Right now...my body is tingling and numb even though I've had my diabetes meds. I'm about to do my walking/gardening and that will have no effect. Food is the only pleasure I have in life.

Part of my problem is that I have not been able to find a doctor who will really listen to me. I move a lot and you'd think one of the docs I've been to would do something other than prescribe protontix for acid reflux but that's all they do. I hav'nt found a shrink with any suggestions either. I pay out of pocket for medical. Can't find an insurance that will accept pre-existing conditions. Because I have no insurance perhaps the doctors just don't take me seriously. I don't know. They can see that my blood sugar is high but just want to throw pills at me instead of help me with the problems that cause me to overeat in the first place. I am at the point of needing insulin but I am scared to use a needle. You'd think my fear of needles would override my other probs but it does'nt. I have recently moved again...am hoping this is the last time. I'm 48 and have moved 78 times in my life. I looked for a local doctor but nobody will take me due to the insurance issue so it's back to the clinic...the nearest clinic is 40 miles away and I don't drive so that should be amusing. It will be weeks before I can get in. I can find a shrink closer but it will also be awhile before I can get in. In the meantime, I thought I'd post here and maybe it will help me in some way. I did fairly well last night...for me. I had a bacon cheeseburger, sweet potato fries ( baked ) and asparagus and 3 sugar free ice cream bars. I actually stopped there. Usually I would have eaten another full meal on top of it. Unfortunately I seem to do better with low glycemic foods that are fatty...it gives satisfaction...but then I have spankingly high cholesterol too...ugh. About the only things it's safe for me to eat with all of my conditions are turkey and lettuce/spinach.

Nobody here will be able to offer you professional advice. The usual suggestions I'd give to someone with binge/fasting patterns doesn't apply to you because of the diabetes. It's possible anything I suggest could do more harm. If you're looking for generalized tips on how to stop binging though, you could always check out the binge eating disorder forum. I'm not sure what kind of help you've sought out aside from regular doctors, but here are a few suggestions that may or may not be feasible for you. I hope one of them is able to open a door to getting the treatment you need. -Diabetes clinics & education centres -Naturopathic doctors -Licensed nutritionists/dieticians -College/universities (sometimes their students need patients) -Call social services and see if there's something nearby you haven't thought of -Support groups -Websites for diabetics Blame it on me, but know that I won't regret one iota.", "hash": "fa4d8eb4f8260dee3b08ce8e3a2cf535597208b008779140bc631ce9af2bfd62"}

I have always been overly aware of food, from an early age. Slowly, this obsession became worse and worse until I would already start thinking of when my next 'fix' would be, before I had even finished my current meal! My days are now ruled by food; If I'm not eating, I'm counting down the hours to be able to eat. I hate that my life has turned into something that revolves around food. I even have particular obsessive compulsions regarding my food... If it doesn't fall into the following criteria, I will excuse myself from whatever social situation I'm in and go and find the next fix. 1) I simply cannot bring myself to eat without some form of movie/show on in the background. I don't think I've eaten a meal without watching something for years and the thought of trying to wean myself off this habit scares me to death. 2) I need to have huge amounts of salad with my meals. I don't know why... It developed when I started trying to lose weight a few years ago and switched from sandwiches to salads. At first my salads would comprise of cold meats and some lettuce/spinach (say 200g). Now, I currently eat 800g of salad (lettuce, cabbage, carrot) with EVERY savoury meal, no matter what it is. I buy bags of salad by the boatload from my local grocery store, and am known as the 'salad girl'. I heard one guy behind the deli even placing bets with his friend one day as to how many bags I would buy . I know it's not the worst habit to have, but try eating 800g of salad out at a restaurant and looking normal. It literally takes up 4 huge bowls. So basically, I eat by myself, or with my partner (who still looks at me in shock when he sees how much salad I eat). These two things aren't very condusive to a normal social life, and many of my friends have fallen by the wayside (which is my fault, because I'm too 'scared' to eat out with them). Is there anyone else out there that has stupid quirks like mine that go with their eating disorder? Please tell me I'm not the only one... the lone 'salad girl' . I developed bulimic tendencies about 2-3 years ago. It never got out of control though... I made myself throw up (most times, rather unsuccessfully) maybe once every month. Fast forward to today... I have 2 marathon purging sessions a day about 6 days a week. It has gotten to a point where I almost LIKE it :S. My weight is slowly creeping up, as the amount of calories I am putting through my mouth is so huge, even the vomiting won't stop all the damage. And there is realy only ONE thing that I keep bingeing on... It used to be anything and everything (mostly junk), but over the last couple of months it has been one particular thing: Yoplait Le Rice (vanilla flavour) Puddings. I don't even know why! But I can't get enough of them!! I eat about 22 a day . I try to throw it all up, but I'm never sure it all comes out as rice is tricky . It has gotten to a point where I WEIGH my damn vomit to see if it matches what I just ate. Then I will keep on eating, and then purging, and then weighing... and the cycle continues. I am at my wits end . The amount of times I have promised myself that this is 'the last time' and 'tomorrow is a new day - you can beat this!' are just ridiculous. I know now that there is no such thing as 'one last time'. I just want to stop thinking about food! I have written this after a day of 22 rice puddings (along with a few bowls of ice-cream and some normal meals such as lasagne (with the requisite 800g salad)). That is not a normal day of food. None of it is normal. I just wish I was normal . Thank-you to whoever takes the time to read my sad little tale. I would love to hear about your experiences/weird obsessive quirks/recovery... anything! Instead of making some grand plan of attack (complete with meal plans and times etc etc), I am simply going to take tomorrow very slowly. Hour by hour... I can't think beyond that or the thought of no more damn rice puddings will drive me insane. I can't truly say, as I have never been addictedto cocaine or heroin, and don't want to undermine people who actually are addicted to these substances, but I feel as if I am truly in the throes of an awful addiction that is spiralling out of control.

For a while during my eating disorder all I would eat were bags of popcorn and veggie soup. They were my \"safe\" foods. Do you feel as though the salad & rice puddings have somehow been marked as safe in your mind? People did notice the amount of popcorn & soup I was buying as well and it was embarassing. Eventually my friends began to ask questions but my denial was so entrenched that I denied having a problem. At least you've already admitted that this is a problem. If you haven't done so already, I suggest you see a doctor about this. What you're describing sounds ritualistic beyond what most people with ED experience. You may have an anxiety disorder, such as OCD, that is manifesting itself in food rituals. Binge/purge cycles are really hard on the body too, so you'll want to get the doctor to check and make sure there aren't any urgent issues which need attention. Are you able to identify what is going through your mind if you aren't able to eat the rice pudding or salad? Recovery is always possible, so keep trying every day even though you feel it is ridiculous. One step at a time.

You said you were overly aware of food from a young age. I too found that i took solace in food, eating to mute emotions that i wanted to hide and it was personal...not being confident in who i was; food was quiet, did not judge me and it seemed to comfort. Have you had any help with your relationship with food... it’s obviously distressing as you know that it is controlling you and impinging on your quality of living...? I find myself, like you needing something to watch, or read when i’m eating. The more i think about not doing it; thinking of it as bad the scarier it is not to. I basically live on fruit and vegetables and the odd bit of gestural carbohydrate and protein in between b/p-ing, anyway...if i can’t get, or don’t have access to fruit i go a bit mentally unstable...the overwhelming need to ‘correct’ it or i cannot do anything else. Conditioning, as it could be described. Food must fill about 80% of my thoughts which really could be filled with better things, particularly as that 80% is a repeat of a repeat of a repeat of a repeat... it is frankly insane. Living for merely brief moments of satisfaction with desperation and loneliness in between. Is the mind that tries to control what you eat and how you eat ever sorry for taking you away from the party or concerned about how you are experiencing life or say kind things about you... does it give you the support that you’d give to a friend... or the respect?

It's very nice to be able to talk with other folks who understand. I've been addicted to food since I was a kid. I started overeating to make myself feel better. I was depressed and very insecure. Of course as I got heavier I got teased and put down by other kids. In the 6th grade I decided to pretend I was sick (factitious disorder) so I wouldn't have to go to school. I pretended my stomach hurt. To keep up the pretense, I had to eat much less and ended up losing enough weight to be in the normal range. I was finally seen by a shrink (although I didn't know it he was a shrink), who told my parents there was nothing physically wrong with me and to make me go back to school. But he told my parents they may have trouble with me later on - but I didn't know he had said that. And I had lots of problems as a teenager, but that's another whole story. I'm a carb addict because carbs help release seratonin in the brain, which makes me feel a bit better. That's why they call food that's high in carbs \"comfort food\" - but it also packs on the pounds! I take an antidepressant, and have been doing so for many years. The bad news is that some antidepressants actually contribute to weight gain! But I don't think I can blame the one I'm taking. I just love carbs! I'm overweight at this point in my life (57 yrs old), but not obese. I'm trying to get back into the \"normal\" BMI for my age and height, but it's really hard. Now I'm losing my job, and I live alone so I really need to have a job. All that makes me want to eat even more!!", "hash": "ac4ccabbf47397cf64a446b449178422a90ef99053c6270cd28b88322394816d"}

I refuse to eat certain things unless they involve cheese or sour cream, and usually A LOT of cheese or sour cream. I will eat normal food if I have to, but when alone or when a type of food like tacos or pasta presents itself, I will make sure that I add at least four tablespoons of sour cream and two handfuls of cheese to what it is I'm eating. I'm addicted to the taste, I can't give it up...without the condiments, the food tastes disgusting! I've been eating way too much cheese and sour cream since I was a toddler, and still haven't given it up because I love it so much. I cannot tolerate low fat milk or sour cream. The lowest I ever go is 2%...otherwise it tastes gross. And taste means the world to me for some reason, like I actually want to ENJOY my meals... As for salt, I eat way too much chips than is good for me and also add sprinkles of salt to almost everything...I even add salt to my sour cream, that's how bad it is! I can go through a bag of chips that should last three days in two hours, because I just have to keep munching, it's like a need. But the problem is is I can't get away with it anymore.

If you are going through puberty, then your body is still developing and it requires a lot of energy. equally, if you regularly exercise then your body needs the energy to not only carry out the exercise but also to repair itself afterwards. your eating behaviour come across as a little 'obsessive'... you feel that you have to eat certain things and that there are no other options. The truth is that there are countless other options and the best way to get through this is to replace what you currently eat with other things. For example, the salt that you use could be replaced woth something 'lighter' (pepper, basil, thyme, etc). The sour cream can equally be replaced with some other type of sauce that is much lighter.

I have fallen prey to this problem I suppose. I know I'm a bit young to be worrying about health issues but I do nonetheless. My senior year in high school was the best ever I guess because I was in the best shape of my life, or so I thought. I went from 145 pounds to 115 pounds over the summer break. I was/am a runner and had the best season in my six years of running. Everyone was amazed and proud at how good at running I became. Then, as the season was halfway through, I noticed that I still looked good in my opinion but was always tired and irritable. People started commenting on how \"thin\" I was and wondered if I was starving myself, which I wasn't ( I was eating six times a day!! though they were small snacks). Some said I ought to maybe eat more because I was coming up on having to stay over 110 pounds. I am about 5'5\" so that is considered almost underweight. I was worried about eating things with \"bad\" ingredients.... So what happened is that I DID start to eat more. I ended up running my best time at my last ever cross country meet and could have even gone faster! Then I joined powerlifting and then track for my last seasons. I kept gaining weight because I was eating more than I did. Then, it happened...I got injured halfway through track season and was confined to a bed for days and not able to run for weeks. All of that extra time was an incentive to eat more. Turns out, things have been getting worse since then. I struggle with the sport that I once loved and feel helpless about it. I hope I can get some support to regain my life once again and feel good about myself. Thanks from Texas, Oncearunner", "hash": "c980705dab49cfb707ea2100c2ca1f941d7d3c88b0a7928e1227efa78439434c"}

I completely understand that most people won't take the time to read the novel I just typed up, and I don't blame them one bit lol but if you do I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm surprised at the lack of activity in this particular forum. I got on the internet today to find a sort of support group when it comes to food addiction. This is the closest thing I could find, to my surprise. I just hope this forum is still active enough to provide what I'm looking for. I just recently discovered that I have a food addiction or binge eating or whatever you want to call it. It seems every site and specialist classifies it as something else. Basically i think about food 100% of the time. When I'm eating I think about what I'm, going to eat next. I binge eat in private; i.e. i eat a lot more when there's no one around. I never really feel full and I'm never hungry. I just obsess over food all the time. I can sit for hours debating on what to eat. When i finally, impulsively, choose something to eat i often times don't feel satisfied with my choice and eat whatever the other option was after finishing what i chose. I am on a fast track to death really, in the past 7 months I've gained 50 pounds. I've been on every diet you can think of. I do well on some of them for a short period of time but then i talk myself into a short of break (i.e. i can eat what i want on my birthday because hey, it's my birthday!) then I never get back on my diet. I'm weary about visiting a psychologist because they all want to classify and analyze me the same as everyone else. I mean maybe there is some underlying reason for why I am obsessed with food, maybe there is some traumatic thing that happened to me in my childhood that causes me to find comfort in food, but i just don't feel that that's the case. I do have some resentment towards my parents for certain things involving food or my weight but i don't feel like i eat when I'm sad or depressed or whatever feeling you want to insert. I just eat because I love eating. But I feel absolutely terrible about myself after I do eat. Until about 2 days ago i didn't know such a thing as a food addiction existed. When people hear the term eating disorder automatically what comes to mind is a super skinny girl that either doesn't eat at all or eats then purges. Which obviously isn't me. Funny enough what got me thinking about food addiction is watching the show Intervention (people addicted to drugs/alcohol or with an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia) I started paying attention to the basic principals they were teaching the individuals on the show and started applying them to myself and much to my surprise, they all fit! I had the same sort of behaviors as these meth addicts and alcoholics! (You know what i mean). But I felt crazy bringing this up to anyone. Trying to explain to someone that I needed the same sort of help as a heroin addict? Yea right. So I tried bringing this up to my mom (I'm 20 years old so she's still a big part of my support circle), not that I'm addicted to food, but that i needed some kind of help; that there's something that's just not right. But it was the same song and dance \"You just need to have some self control\" she said. Of course she didn't really know the extent of my binging seeing as I do most of it in private. So maybe, just maybe, she would help me if she knew. (Or at least i try to convince myself of that for my own emotional well being). That being said, I do have spurts of depression. Being a binge eater/food addict and not a bulimic makes me over weight, as you could have guessed. But i have been over weight me entire life. I think the last time i was at an average weight was when i was 5 yrs old. Every picture and memory i have after that age is of this over weight girl sticking out like a sore thumb. I try to blame my parents, asking myself why they let this happen (I mean I'm not cooking myself huge portions of food when I'm 6 years old ya know). But it's not their fault, they weren't forcing me to eat the amount that i have been since i was able to voice how much food I want. Anyways, back to my point, I have pretty low self esteem. I say pretty low because i am 100% confident in myself when it comes to brains and the like but I am so self conscious of my weight. I avoid people a lot these days because I'm afraid for people to see me, even my friends. Which only makes things worse because if i was out with people i wouldn't be eating! It seems like everyday i feel lower and lower. I'm at my largest right now so i don't have many clothes that fit anymore. Which makes me feel worse but I won't go shopping because that just results in me standing in the mall sobbing because nothing fits. I'm sorry if I'm getting off topic here I've just never talked about this before, it has all just been random thoughts inside my head. I just wish i knew why I'm obsessed with food. I don't want to be. It's like a switch in my head, as soon as the thought of eating enters my head I'm on a mission to get food as fast as i possibly can. Then after I'm finished I feel absolutely terrible. I mean i can be on my way to eat lunch and i will tell myself \"You are only going to get this, you aren't going to get more than you need. You are not going to over eat anymore\" but then as soon as i get there its like a different person enters me and i HAVE to eat as much food as i can. Its almost like I'm trying to fill myself with things i wont have in front of people. I will eat before I go eat with friends or family because i know I can't eat that much in front of people. I feel so ashamed about it. There's so much more I feel like I could add to this but I know this post is INSANELY long as it is and all over the place so I'll leave it as it is and hope someone will a) be willing to take the time to read it [If you do i thank you dearly] and b) understand the jumbled mess I've typed up lol", "hash": "6a9f3a56f9085f8d54e8340a67785897a54d8b9acf7c78c528b17431119c9f12"}

I know how you feel when you say that food is on your mind basically all the time. Sometimes I can stand there for a good 10 minutes deciding what to eat, and have the other thing afterwards anyway, because I wasn't satisfied with my choice. I can spend HOURS in a food shop. Being indecisive, telling my brain to say no. but it doesn't work. I read somewhere that food addiction is pretty much like another addiction like smoking. And it's a HARD to kick! Suffice to say - you are not alone and we can all fight this together. The fact that you have come on here, and searched for this means that you are one step closer It's good that you've typed up a lot of things whirling around in your head.. have you thought about seeing your GP maybe for a referral?

I had a good life but i still ended up ruining it on drugs. addiction isnt one of rational behavior, but mostly irrational behavior. but what is behind that addiction?addictions are usually the result of something else. if i slap someone, I had a reason. i didnt just slap them cause i slapped them. I either wanted to pick a fight, I didnt like what they said, I have nerve issue where i cant control my arm, or i didnt like the way they looked. Regardless there was a reason besides \"i dont know\". why did you start the your first ever bulimia action? I was addicted to drugs because i wanted to change myself. I wasnt happy with how i was. Keep looking and find out why you like eating, besides i just like eating. is it comforting to you? are you trying to self-destruct yourself? eating away abuse or something else in your past? are you insecure about your body image(you feel this is the onl way to keep weight off)? do you get a thrill out of it? you could always try a therapist if your willing.

I am a food addict. It all started as a child. I was not fat, but somehow, everyone starting acting as if I was. I started skating around the same time and perhaps, was a little chunkier than the other kids (10 lbs more) and people went crazy. Suddenly I was on a diet. This of course, just made me look for any opportunity to eat more. But still I skated so much.. I wasn't that fat. I was about 20 lbs more than the other kids. At the same time I had a very self esteem trying thing, a backbrace. It is amazing I am not a serial killer given what I went though with that... but, still it made food.. the easiest and most normalizing things. When I was 18 I stopped skating, went to college, and got the brace off. I went wild. Doing exactly what I wanted, and I would have kept doing that too but I realized I had streach marks. I put the breaks on and started dieting but I was never able to lose the weight all the way. Thus began a 20 year up and down and obsession with food. Dieting, not dieting, thin, not thin. Finally recently I got down to the closest point yet... 48 lbs gone. Until I just couldn't get down there, not to the point I wanted to be. And I boomeranged back up 40 lbs. The slide began long before this, but recently I lost both my parents and now... literally my life revolves around work and food. And there is some part of me that doesn't want to be denied anymore, denied anything, eating until I am sick, eating when I feel like what I feel like. - when I can't go to lunch on time at work I get insane. - I hired someone to run my errands because I didn't have the food I wanted in the house - I spend my weekend thinking of what else I can eat - every monday I start a diet and that lasts until 12 noon - I don't do any exercise I work the drug and alcoholics and now, I really am starting to see that I don't have control over my life... food does. Food tells me when to get up, allows me to survive work, is on my mind 50% of the day. It is, my life. I haven't had a life in 20 years.. it has been on hold due to my battle with food. At least the first step is accepting you don't have control.. that is something I have never admitted until now.", "hash": "9846eda5d4bed955c037d3ef1c6fce9ab38dedd8d99a3c6702700b61a6f877cc"}

I have been a food addict since I was 14 when my mother committed suicide. I have had some really hard years including a few short (luckily) bouts with bulimia. For the last month I have actually been doing really well. I am feeling more mentally healthy than ever before, and since my mind has been so clear I have been able to eat healthier and stick to a workout routine. Though I am moving slow in weight loss progress I am finally starting to feel like I have control again. Enter my problem. My husband wants to go up to visit his family this holiday weekend (its about a 6 hour drive). We will already be visiting them next weekend for his Sister's wedding, but since a whole bunch of family from Alaska is in town he (and I) really want to see them as much as possible and go both weekends. Because of this I have started to have severe anxiety. His family are big social eaters (and drinkers) and at this early stage in my recent mental health I don't feel mentally strong enough to attend a big event without bingeing and ruining all my progress. We are already committed to the wedding, but two events, two weeks in a row is giving me anxiety attacks. Luckily my husband is the most wonderful man on the planet, and I told him how I was feeling and he totally understood and said it would be fine if we stayed home and went to the wedding only. Now I am having major guilt because he was willing to give up something so important to him so I could continue with my healing ... which makes me want to go to see his family even more because he deserves so much to be with them. I have told him to go without me, but he doesn't want to. It's almost like I am an alcoholic and I've been sober for only a month, and all of a sudden something really important to my husband is taking place in a bar. Do you guys have any suggestions?

I have came up with many ways that I could practically prepare myself so I don't run into any sticky situations (packing my own snacks and fruit for the trip, making sure to walk every day, excusing myself when drinking is present, etc.) however, I don't feel that I have any practical ways to prepare emotionally, which is why I am so scared. I know exactly how to eat healthy ... that has never been the problem ... my emotions and social pressures are the problem. What do you think? Do I stay at home with my supportive husband ... or be the supportive one and go with him? If I go with him how do I make sure I don't ruin all my great progress and physically and emotionally binge?

Can you identify your triggers for binging? Is it the fact that there will be a lot of food there? Are his family big eaters? Will they be pressuring you to join them? If you went (hypothetically) would you want to eat the food that they have there? I feel like I need a bit more info from you so that I know what you are like a bit better before giving you advice.

My husband's family is the typical southern \"eating\" family. They are big eaters and all functions are centered around food, which is part of the reason why I am so indecisive. For me, all food is a trigger, so it is a constant battle. I have found in the past that when everyone is eating I will let myself binge because I am disguised and it doesn't look out of place. I think about food all day, everyday, so it is an ongoing battle for me to moderate myself and eat healthy. Fortunately, I have been doing SO well lately, better than ever, which is why I am so nervous to possibly set myself up for failure and have to pick up the pieces all over again. I have trouble with support from my side of the family because it doesn't look like I have a food addiction, so when I try to talk to them about it they don't really take me seriously. I am not horribly overweight (only about 20 pounds or so) and I actually am pretty healthy, but my mind is sick. My mind has the disorder. I have used food as a drug since I was 14 ... but many people just don't believe me because I am not 90 pounds or 300 pounds. My husband is so wonderful and supportive, but as much as I would like not to admit it, this issue seriously affects our relationship. I would love for him to see me one day as a woman \"untormented\" by food. He thinks about me in every food decision he makes, which is SO thoughtful, but I don't want him to have to. Logically I know it's just food, he knows it's just food ... but even the thought of bringing a trigger food within 100 feet of me can make me panic that I might lose my progress. (When I refer to progress, I mean mentally) I am also going through therapist withdrawals because my husband and I just moved to a new state so I had to leave my amazing shrink behind. I am looking for a new one now, but I think this adds to the reason as to why I am so jumpy and nervous about going. I think the problem is that I have failed so many times. I usually had a short-lived success before each failure, but this time is different. I feel SO good, and I am actually backing up my words and living life like I want to, and I have been reaping the rewards like I never have before. I know that at some point I will have to venture out and test the water to see if my resolve is as good as it feels, but I am nervous that it is too soon. I hope this wasn't too \"ranty\" and gives you enough extra info. As of right now we decided not to go to his family's for the 4th (although we will still be going up there next weekend for the wedding) so though the immediate threat is gone, we will still see them very soon. How do I emotionally prepare and keep my mind in a healthy state?", "hash": "105d1dd9da259a9060eaa4cf243fef0b10422345d26312cdf5320c612a8d78e2"}

Well, you could look into losing weight on sites that help you figure out how many calories certain foods have and how many calories you should have every day so that you lose weight. I heard that you're supposed to eat about 1500 if you're a woman and maybe 1600-1700 if you're a guy (I'm not sure though) per day, no more, and work out a few times a week. Apparently cardio like running or jogging is good and 30 minutes of jogging burn about 200 calories so you could try doing it about 4 times a week. But if you're out of shape right now, you could try walking for 30 minutes every day, walk to the store, go for walks in your lunch break, maybe walk to work if it's possible. That way, you'll slowly get in better shape and train your body for working out. And remember to eat less calories every day. You can still eat food you like, but control the calories, figure out how small your portions have to be. There are sites that help you find out how many calories a certain food or product has per 100 grams, I think, google it. I think making a list of what they plan to eat every day or of what they ate and figuring out how much more they can have helps people with eating problems and people who want to lose weight too. forum-rules.php I am sorry I am not on the forum as much as I used to be, if I do not reply to you quickly, please contact another moderator/supermod/admin as well.", "hash": "53c3b5f607db4dfd219684d982de31f89a97c4fecbdb89c360b72538d1a63c1d"}

I'm gonna be honest: I can't relate. I mostly avoid things and consciously starve myself of a lot of things. One of those things used to be food. ...Actually, I CAN relate. When I would myself in one area of my life, I would binge in another. For example, while I was busy controlling food, I would binge on cigarettes and clothes. While I was working on stopping my sexual anorexia, I suddenly (and compulsively!) started to control money instead. Binging and control are related in the sense that they are both replacements for something bigger. So the question is: what are you trying to \"fill\"? You mentioned feeling empty, emotionally.

I feel a compulsion to listen to them, encourage them, feed them, make them laugh, etc. An amazing thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago: I had a friend and her boyfriend over for game night. It was awesome. I was actually able to enjoy Monopoly for the sake of playing it! I don't know how I did it. I think it starts with defining what I want. What *I* want. It took me a long time to realize that by constantly trying to be useful, I was actually constantly justifying my own existence.

The U.S. Declaration of Independence is an empowering document, specifically in a personal sense. You know, the other day I finally took a shower for ME, for the first time in months? Not because my being clean would be useful to someone else (like if my fiance wanted to get intimate, or the cashier at the checkout line would think I smelled nice), but because I enjoyed the shower. It hit me several months ago: I didn't know what was \"fun and comforting\" for me. For you, it sounds like food. So I figured it out. I made a list of things that I actually like.

What is the difference between Food Addiction and Binge Eating Disorder? Technically speaking both could be viewed to mean the same thing. Or maybe the distinction is that one is a constant and emotion based and the other can come and go and is based on chemical triggers...? I find that I don't think about food all the time, I've slowly learnt not to 'obsess' over it. However, even if I eat a piece of lettuce out of place it could 'set me off' to enter a trance of eating, eating, eating and not being able to stop even when I can't physically move anymore because I'm so bloated. I know I have a direct addiction to sugar and white processed carbohydrates (think freshly baked white bread...) - so I've learned to accept that I just can't have these things ever again because with them my life is harder and actually DOES become 'Tunnel Visioned' on food.

Kevin Well it's never a bad thing to venture outside our comfort zones Kevin - even if it is in a different forum! But wouldn't addiction also imply a chemical/physiological response too? Such as - a feeling of over-stuffedness sometimes causes mild euphoria for some, or as mentioned before; addiction to sugar, or additives, or combinations of fat/salt/sugars? --- Can this sort of response trigger a Binge episode? Could the two be linked in any way? Because I often feel I have elements of both, addiction and BED.

Have you ever thought of your feelings as hole your trying to fill with something comforting? If so, what would that hole be caused from? Often we use food as comfort. It feels warm and nurturing. Something we need and if it is lacking we crave. If we get to the painful thoughts behind those feelings and learn to understand and heal them, food no longer needs to be the solution. Your hurting very deeply and them feeling guilty for trying to make it stop. I think your looking for healing-its just not going to be food that helps though. You need to comfort the old injuries directly. One thing that helped me connect with that dark place was a letter. I said something like this: One, I know you hurt so much and no one understands I know that you just want to feel loved and safe I know you need to feel valued and beautiful You have not been given what you deserved THEY were wrong, not you. You deserve comfort and peace now I am on your side now I am the adult who will care for you You-the younger in me, need me the older to be strong to help you I will no longer treat you pain as an enemy I will listen to you and we can cry and grow together I will begin now to choose the best for us and not the least \\ I could go on but you get the idea. Perhaps speaking to your inner pain like this will help. I hope so. For what ever you are carrying, you can choose to let it go and move forward. It can be done. It takes time, mistakes, binges etc, but slowly loving yourself will help that pain go away. With Hope, One Two men looked through bars.

Have you ever thought of your feelings as hole your trying to fill with something comforting? If so, what would that hole be caused from? Often we use food as comfort. It feels warm and nurturing. Something we need and if it is lacking we crave. If we get to the painful thoughts behind those feelings and learn to understand and heal them, food no longer needs to be the solution. Your hurting very deeply and them feeling guilty for trying to make it stop. I think your looking for healing-its just not going to be food that helps though. You need to comfort the old injuries directly. One thing that helped me connect with that dark place was a letter. I said something like this: One, I know you hurt so much and no one understands I know that you just want to feel loved and safe I know you need to feel valued and beautiful You have not been given what you deserved THEY were wrong, not you. You deserve comfort and peace now I am on your side now I am the adult who will care for you You-the younger in me, need me the older to be strong to help you I will no longer treat you pain as an enemy I will listen to you and we can cry and grow together I will begin now to choose the best for us and not the least \\ I could go on but you get the idea.

My suggestion: get rid of all your nice coffee. Buy the cheapest, nastiest instant coffee that they have at the supermarket. Make that the only coffee you're allowed. (So if you really need it, it's there.) Buy yourself some really nice teas. There are lots of delicious herbal teas. Find some you like. Then when you're craving caffeine, you'll have to choose between that nasty instant coffee that doesn't taste very good and mucks up your day, and the yummy teas that are good for you. It makes it easier for me to kick the habit.

If anyone is, being afraid of being that way or being seen that way doesn't mean that you are like that btw. The same way being afraid of being a histrionic wouldn't make me one. Most Narcissists, I suspect, rarely have their feelings validated. Narcissists wallow in self-pity. Every slight, every bruise, everything that's happened in our lives that fell short of perfection, or that's left us less happy than we could be, is something that we ruminate on and voice our displeasure about. What if I had talked to the girl at the subway? What if I had gone out with the prom queen? What if I had majored in this subject instead of in that subject? What if I made more money? These are things that Narcissists will frequently complain about, and of course very few people are going to validate all of these complaints. Others will simply call the Narcissist a whiner, or someone who thinks the world owes him something. The Narcissist, then, is used to not having his feelings validated by others. This begins at such an early age that it's nothing new to the Narc. But it will never change the Narc's mind. The Narc will continue to believe that he is owed everything that he's ever wanted and more, and will dismiss the opinions of those who refuse to validate his feelings and devalue them immediately. It's important to understand the role that other people play to the Narcissist. They are other objects and nothing more. When they get in his way of what he wants, they are like a vending machine that swallowed his quarters. The Narc will \"shake the vending machine,\" so to speak, in order to get what he wants, i.e., manipulate those around him without concern for them. The Narcissist, of course, needs other people to praise him, admire him, respect him, have sex with him, or do other things to feed his ego and give him supply. But that should not confuse the Non into thinking that the Narc values any of their opinions and needs them to validate his emotions. He does not. Their praise, respect, admiration, love, or giving their very bodies over to him are nothing more than the candy falling from the vending machine. Once he has eaten the candy he will throw the wrapper away and forget it ever existed. The Narc does not need others to validate his emotions. His emotions are valid simply because he feels them and is experiencing them. This makes them prima facie valid. Anything else will not be considered, because the Narc cares about one thing in the entire universe: himself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb5dEtNIKZk", "hash": "c6e6ecaf1cfb2ec1aa539cb90c7b463e3844c8b00b0e5049c63e3ae5cb795fcf"}

It brought to mind a recent session I had with a psychotherapist employed by the university at which I am currently a part time student. We talked about personality disorders, and I expressed scepticism about the validity of the classification in DSM IV, because I could see quite plainly, elements of all three 'clusters' in my own disordered personality. She readily agreed, saying her view was that personality disorders are deeply embedded maladaptive 'scripts' that people develop, hold on to, and live by. Each person will forge their own unique 'script', formulated as a result of painful early life experiences, in the context of their individual neurological makeup. Hence it doesn't really make sense to try to erect a taxonomy of mutually exclusive, separate personality disorders (and this comes through in places in Holdren's thesis). Instead, we should say there are a number of recognisable elements which are commonly incorporated into people's scripts, but each person will have their own unique blend in their personal script. Have you come across this viewpoint, and what is your own view? cheers Paul", "hash": "db768148025c158d856bcb546891c9e1ef203f019334d9c72315e00c82be203f"}

They are probably too complex to be boiled down to one thing, but my vote goes to attachment. Human bonding. Love. Whatever you'd like to call it. My understanding is that most of the personality disorders are chiefly evidenced in interpersonal relationships. Similarly, you can't boil down an eating disorder to a problem with food (no pun). An addiction to the pleasure induced by food might be a component of bulimia, but anorexia is much more about self-image which has become predicated upon physical appearance. It's been argued that it can be a form of self-injury and -punishment. The anorexic is typically an obsessive perfectionist. Food is involved only as it relates to metabolism, esp. lipid production, thus relating to appearance.

They are evidenced most obviously in interpersonal relationships because that is the most directly observable aspect of a personality. But the fundamental disorder is lack of a stable sense of self. Attachment and interpersonal issues are just one part of the problem, the bigger problem is that a PD personal struggles with self-identity and can't know himself very well. It's impossible because he doesn't have a single stable personality, his instability makes him act like different people depending on state of mind. You could almost say it's a little bit like a mild form of multiple personality disorder, where different parts of your personality come and go (although unlike true MPD the personal still has a single continuous consciousness) I think that's one of the fundamental causes of attachment issues that PDs have. Being in familiar, comfortable place surrounded by people and family and things you are comfortable with can eliminate a lot of the stresses that fling the unstable personality around. Having enough control of his surroundings to keep things stable makes it easier to deny the unstable personality, because external stability causes somewhat improved inner stability for as long as it lasts. Workoholism and serious hobbies can help too, I think of all these things as \"anchors\" that help me remember who I am without drifting too far into insanity.", "hash": "ea289f14e3c55f4d8fc1d2ce4133987111bc10665049137903122ab97cf0a0b5"}

I think Sfguy is right - it is in interpersonal relationships that NPD is most obviously manifested isn't it? They may be the 'conduit' through which NPD expresses itself. sfguy75x wrote: It's impossible because he doesn't have a single stable personality, his instability makes him act like different people depending on state of mind.

The lack of a 'stable' personality - and the awareness of this lack possibly - is at the core of NPD. I wonder if it is only the most self-aware Narcissists that realise the lack of correlation between what they say/think and their behaviour - or if they are all conscious of it to some degree. If so I expect that it is extremely frustrating and disorientating. I also wonder if the gap between the true and false self becomes more obvious as a Narcissist ages and recognises the 'flip-flopping' between one kind of behaviour and another.

Just thought I might get some good info here. I believe my Dad has got narcissistic tendencies, and undoubtedly other mental health disorders too. We walk on egg shells around him as any perceived slight could trigger his full wrath. This can be anything from being abusive, to his favourite punishment, “The Silent Treatment.” He can also be highly sarcastic and nasty, and if he know you have a sensitive spot will really go for it. The silent treatment really does not work on me anymore, as I moved out ten years ago and can really take him or leave him. I think that because he does not have any control over me he basically is on his better behaviour around me. This year, he was angry because early on Christmas Eve, my mum decided to go to the shops early, around 8am and believed he was still asleep. Later, when they discussed this, Dad went totally mental when Mum said, “You were still asleep when I went to the shops.” This made Dad very angry, because in fact, he was “dozing.” (Not asleep, just ‘dozing.’) Because of this, Dad hasn’t spoken to mum for days. When the rest of our (oblivious) family arrived for Christmas lunch, dad said hello but didn’t look up from his book. He didn’t sit at the table with us, instead reading at the couch. During Christmas lunch, he interrupted us all to come and get a breadroll from the table, making a big performance about putting butter on it before taking it and returning to the couch to eat alone. The rest of the family was obviously very uncomfortable but didn’t know what to do. He hadn’t bought anyone gifts, but accepted many gifts off multiple family members without even saying thank you. This behaviour is all basically because my mother dared to use what he perceived to be the wrong term to describe the correct level of his wakefulness. I am not an expert in any mental disorders, and I am sure that he is eligible for many!! I don’t think he would meet all of the characteristics for narcissism, and please feel free to correct me if I’m wrong but I feel he meets some. I am quite sure he has depression, and probably ptsd. He is ex-military, and was in a horrific motor bike accident when I was very young. He has extensive health issues as a result. He has a gambling addiction too. While these things are not easy, I believe his personality Theres really nothing anyone can do, as I don’t think he is open to any sort of support. My concern is more for my mum, as she is stuck with this crazy irrational tyrant. When he is not in his bizarre bad moods, he can actually be very pleasant and helpful. These bad moods strike suddenly, without warning and for no logical reason. He has lots of issues at work, and is always complaining about how stupid this or that co-worker is and what he has to deal with. My younger brother is properly psychologically messed up too, and obviously this sort of upbringing has had an impact. He is making really silly life choices and has zero interpersonal skills. It’s so sad, seeing this all play out and being reasonably helpless.

I am fairly hung up on having a label, because it will help me to have something to research and understand. Unfortunately, without him getting assessed properly I'll never know.

I would become more upset if an earlier incident had upset me, and then when it was discussed I was told I was doing something that I did not think I was doing, ***and*** I was being told my supposed actions were being used to justify the incident. A question arises here which you could put to you father. If he is asleep or appears to be asleep is it OK to wake him up? Where importantly, because he appears, to you, to be angry 'sometimes', you are not wanting to experience him being angry with you. Could he understand what is being explained to him or is just too irrational to understand that? After all, if your parents are still married just how irrational can he be? Can you talk to him or is it just impossible?

We have a 17y/o daughter who for several years now we have noticed she doesn't show empathy or express concern or interest for others in the family. She is totally self focused and does not appear to consider how her wants / demands might affect others be it plans or inconvenience. Ive noticed other make reference to walking on egg shells and this is now the saddening norm in our home. Most conversations somehow turn onto how she 'needs' something or how we her parents have 'failed' to deliver on passing suggestions. What is also extremely concerning is how her recall of situations frequently differs hugely from what really happened -thankfully im not a single parent as if I was I would be questioning my sanity. She appears not to have the ability to reflect on situations and offer an apology which worries me and has done for some time as she truly believes she is always the one in the right. She refuses to do anything at all from walk the dog, washing up, clean her room or lies that she has done things which blatantly has not been done eg feeding the dog whilst we went away. Occasionally she has thrown cushions or small items like pens when the blind anger strikes but today it has escalated to smashing a plate and saying at least it wasn't aimed at you! (we have never thrown anything in anger) There is no chance she would consider counselling (we offered this a number of years ago and as she doesn't have an issued its who we have made her? it was blankly refused) at the age of 17 what else can we do. Any help or advice would be hugely appreciated as we are worried what will happen next - as far as we know in college shes progressing well but does seem to rotate around different groups of friends which we are wondering if this may be linked to similar self focused/importance behaviour.

Self-involvement and lack of empathy characterize this personality disorder. People with narcissistic personality disorder are frequently perfectionists and need to be the center of attention, receiving affection and admiration, and controlling the situation. To get the attention he craves, he may try to create crises that return the focus to him. Like patients with antisocial personality disorder, this person places entitlement issues at the fore. He feels that the world owes him, regardless of whether he makes a contribution. Alcohol and other drugs (AOD) can induce states that mimic a personality disorder, but if an AOD-using person with a personality disorder abstains, only the symptoms of the personality disorder will still be evident. AOD use may trigger or aggravate a personality disorder. The course and severity of personality disorders can also be made worse if other psychiatric problems, such as mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders are present. A patient with a personality disorder frequently uses AODs to relieve her symptoms: to raise self-esteem, decrease feelings of guilt and amplify feelings of diminished individuality. Narcissistic personality disorder often leads to use of drugs, particularly stimulants. As a disinhibitor, alcohol may help lower anxiety and alleviate depression. A shy person with narcissistic personality disorder may depend on marijuana to relieve her social anxiety, while others use steroids to boost confidence in physical perfection. Without AODs, a person with narcissistic personality disorder may believe that others are overly critical or do not adequately appreciate her good qualities. In a crisis, she may become severely depressed. Symptoms Overreacts to criticism, becoming angry or humiliated Uses others to reach goals Exaggerates own importance Entertains unrealistic fantasies about achievements, power, beauty, intelligence or romance Has unreasonable expectation of favorable treatment Needs constant attention and positive reinforcement from others Is easily jealous Causes The exact cause is not known. Although onset of the disorder is usually early adulthood, it is likely to be in response to childhood experiences. A psychological evaluation may be performed. Treatment Psychotherapy may be useful in getting the individual with narcissistic personality disorder to relate to others in a less maladaptive manner. The following guidelines may help therapists working with these patients, especially those who are also AOD-dependant. Engagement Therapists can actually use the narcissistic features of their patients to engage and assess them. To avoid angering the patient, it's important to work with, rather than belittle, the narcissistic ego. A therapist should, for example, address a patient's heightened self-importance and desire for control by saying such things as \"Because you are obviously such an intelligent and sensitive person, I'm sure that, working together, we can get you past your current difficulties.\" Narcissistic personality traits can also be used to provide motivation for therapy. The patient may be induced to change negative behaviors: a better appearance, improved career prospects, or romantic and sexual conquests can been viewed as a reward for recovery. Therapists will need to address thinking errors—which may reflect inflated self-esteem (\"I'm the star of the office\") or hypersensitivity (\"My coworkers are trying to get me fired\")—that interfere with the patient's ability to work. While empathizing with the patient, the therapist should offer reality testing. If a patient complains that, \"things are really going wrong\" or \"everyone is against me,\" the therapist might sympathize, but tactfully point out the reality of the situation and how it could be improved by behavior changes the patient could make. Crisis stabilization In a crisis situation, the therapist should assess the patient's defenses, and to put them to therapeutic use. For example, when a patient blames his wife for \"calling the police on me,\" the therapist can mention that the best way to avoid being arrested is to stop getting drunk and hitting her. Patients with narcissistic personality disorder are often perfectionists. For them, the best way to approach their problems is from a \"no-fault\" disease perspective. This removes blame from the patient and allows her to perceive her illness as a biochemical disorder, reducing the sense of failure that can make treatment more difficult. A patient with narcissistic personality disorder tends to become depressed when his feelings are badly hurt, when his defenses have let him down and when he believes his world is collapsing. When wounded, he is at the greatest risk of acting out, either against himself or others. A patient experiencing a narcissistic rage may become homicidal, particularly if he has a need to seek revenge. Because of the intensity of the narcissist's emotions, the counselor needs to deal very carefully with this anger and avoid a power struggle. Patients believed to be suicidal should be asked to sign a safety contract. To stabilize the patient, a brief, goal-oriented hospitalization may be necessary. Because HIV-positive patients with narcissistic personality disorder are likely to view themselves as expert lovers, therapists should establish contracts with them to practice safe sex. Otherwise, the wide-ranging sexual encounters that often accompany the narcissistic ego, puts them at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases. Longer-Term Care Individual Counseling Ongoing therapy is needed to manage not only the self-aggrandizement, hypersensitivity, and need for control and attention found in narcissistic patients, but also their anger and depression. Individual and group treatments for patients with antisocial personality disorder, including 12-step programs, are often helpful for patients with narcissistic personality disorder. In fact, therapists may want to approach an individual with narcissistic personality disorder as a hypersensitive version of an antisocial personality disorder patient. Group Therapy Group therapy may be helpful for patients with narcissistic personality disorder, but the therapist should, tactfully but firmly, place limits on their speaking time so that they cannot control the discussion or focus all the attention on themselves. Explaining that members of the group need to share the time, therapists may want to make a contract with patients with narcissistic personality disorder before each session to encourage pro-social behaviors. Some of these behaviors include: Limiting speaking time Not interrupting other speakers Respecting the feelings of others Responding to other group members Listening objectively to responses and feedback from others It is important to continue to use the patient's behavior traits rather than to attack the narcissistic ego. It's best to be empathic while confronting the narcissist: \"I can see that you are hurt to hear that not everyone in the group believes you.\" Continuum of Care For patients with narcissistic personality disorder, the least restrictive treatment environment is preferable. It permits patients to feel that they are in control. These patients are normally moved quickly from inpatient to outpatient levels of care. If they do not like the treatment, they will stop participating. Thus, it is critical not to over-pathologize the patient's disorder with constant criticism. However, acute hospitalization for psychiatric emergencies (such as homicidal or suicidal plans) may be necessary. Narcissistic patients generally enjoy the attention they receive through involvement in outpatient treatment. Long-term outpatient involvement is critical to maintain a narcissistic patient's pro-social behavior and sobriety. Therapists who strive to build narcissistic patients' strengths and who pay close attention to them in therapy will find them active participants in the recovery process. In addition to their personality disorder and AOD use disorder, some patients may engage in compulsive sexual or spending behaviors that should be addressed therapeutically.", "hash": "9eaf0f703699f21a7ba8df5a507c7e20a0372f709866905ddd4e3198fa2b9af8"}

I really think this is something easily overdiagnosed, it's obviously used often by laymen as a pejorative. In many cases, I believe people who accuse others of narcissism are also experiencing cognitive distortions. The stereotype of a narcissist is that they \"can't empathize\" or that they \"think they are omnipotent\". To me, descriptions like this imply that someone is engaging in exaggeration, describing (and perhaps thinking) in an all-or-nothing manner. It is more realistic that these people simply have ELEVATED ideas of their potency, and have DIFFICULTY empathizing (or perhaps just apathy towards it, or they choose to disregard their empathic instincts for fear of misinterpreting them). People are so blinded with anger at people who think highly of themselves (so ingrained are we in cultural habits of humility that we absurdly believe the non-humble to be predominantly inferior beings) that I believe they think of them in black and white terms. In this way, treating so-called narcissists in a hostile manner, I ponder if perhaps the attempt to diagnose this condition is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consider this: when someone perceives someone as narcissistic and treats them in an impolite or condescending manner or is angry with them. A narcissist reflects this behaviour back at them (as persecuted defensive people tend to do when attacked) and this response is then classed as 'symptoms'. Thus confirming the diagnosis which may have been made prematurely, but is then cemented by the response to other's prejudice. When observing how people come to such judgements, the \"narcissist\" looks down upon their evaluatory skills and feels misjudged. He then thinks \"I would not misjudge myself like this\" and thus feels superior in that sense. Many people are vulnerable to falling prey to cognitive distortions such as \"Falsum in uno, falsum in omnibus\". In a more reserved sense of what a subconcious thought like that would represent, a person may think \"if this person misjudges here, why should I have confidence in their other advice?\" At that point, it seems unfair to diagnose resistance and hostile defensiveness to criticism as a symptom of illness when it may simply be a symptom of an unsatisfactory analysis. This is something I'm very concerned about when you consider that these episodes of 'narcissistic rage' are described as temporary. When it comes to temporary situational episodes, I think much attention should be paid to the situation and the history of interactions between all parties involved, lest we risk generalizing specific kinds of disputes as 'how they always react to any kind of X'", "hash": "caed5bccf244e12b961434ac2e3a4a05425b4076a78fa3bead2a53227c1cc32a"}

Ellinor Greenberg has a bunch of really good writing on Quora about this. In the system she uses they believe that there are essentially 3 distinct types of a narcissist. A grandiose type, a vulnerable type (covert), and a malignant type. The grandiose type seeks to be the center of attention attempts to drown out other people so they are the only ones anyone sees and is generally more likely to address confrontations head on and in person. A vulnerable type is more likely to attach themselves to things or organizations to appear like great people, to get adulation by proxie of the causes they attach themselves to. Think a lot of social justice warriors, church Karen’s that think they can do no wrong because they are doing Gods work, these people don’t actually care about the issues they just care about how it makes them look but they don’t know this because they don’t really understand why other people do these things. We are living in a phony superficial narcissistic echo chamber as a society. These types will usually avoid direct spotlight as they don’t have the grandiosity and believe they are defective and will be exposed as a fraud (as they usually are). This kind of a person usually attacks people indirectly, spreading rumors behind people’s backs atttempting to smear them and discredit them etc. I’m sure you know the type. Then you have the malignant type I believe my grandfather was this type, they are always trying to destroy other peoples self esteem. Casting doubt in their minds, nothing is ever good enough for them. You do them a favor and they try to belittle you. I remember my father buying him some brand new slippers for around the house my father was very particular about which ones he bought him but he said he hated them and he would probably fall and break his neck in them to take them back and bring him something he could wear. It was a game he played, it kept my father coming back to visit him and he kept criticizing him over anything he tried to do.", "hash": "4c39c4e5e11cf4c271bc3f5dd9783c46c03ee8717124ae5d0182319c85f56985"}

I fell in love again in February 2022. I told my wife (38F) pretty early about the affair, understandably she was upset and angry. I could not stay in our co-owned flat because of the tension. I impulsively decided to leave our flat and my wife was alone. She moved to a different flat in August and I helped her move. I asked if I could stay for a few day at my girlfriend's (39F) flat. These days turned to weeks and weeks to months. I am a peaceful guy normally, but there were times when my girlfriend (now ex) had provoked me multiple times accusing me of things that are not true. I had this habit of bursting out and saying hurtful, condescending things to the other person when I feel cornered. I have done this to my brother, parents, to my wife even. My wife has forgiven me multiple times. And she has seen a nice side of me. Me and my ex-gf had actually a few fights in the span of 7 months. Additionally, there were times where due to my own insecurity I used to write stupid messages to her while at work. She was burdened by this. When she gets pissed at me, she has yelled at me, multiple times in front of her son and people too. So, my coping mechanism was WhatsApp messages and hers was yelling and getting out of her system. She was a difficult person to be with, in the beginning I was patient, but it grew thin pretty fast. Beginning August we moved into a bigger flat (it was her choice, I had almost no say in this decision), and there were tensions in the next weeks. But there were super nice moments too. She told me she's pregnant in 2nd week of August. Since, I wish the best for my kid, I suggested things like private school etc. I know it's far fetched but I wanted to see if she respects my opinion or not. She disagreed. This was our biggest fight, I exploded said mean things and she was hurt. After a week, we mutually decided to end the relationship. I was a bit upset because the timing was not great since she was pregnant and instead of saving the relationship she chose to move to a smaller apartment with her son. A day later she was infected with Coronavirus. She did not text me anymore. Last week she sent me a mail that she was in the Hospital and that she had a miscarriage and it's over. This was the 2nd miscarriage since we were together. First was in May. Our relationship was very special. I never experienced things with anybody else the way I did with her. She has also told me that no one else has made her so happy like I did, which was the reason we both wanted kids. I feel she sees only the negative side of the coin and somehow refuses to see the sweet moments we both had. Perhaps, we both needed more patience with one another. I still have not received closure because it seems like she has made up her mind. I am seeking therapy because my temper and impulsiveness costed me 2 relationships. I cannot sleep, I dream about my ex-gf and wake up at 2, 3 am. I regret my actions deeply, I wish I went to therapy more than a month ago. I still miss her a lot and regret my behavior towards her. I informed her about therapy, but she doesn't acknowledge it. And I feel this burden of guilt for running everything to the ground. Right now I stay in our co-owned flat which has almost nothing. My wife allowed me to stay there, this flat was supposed to be sold by now, according to plan. I feel more terrible because I do not deserve my wife's generosity. Is there any way in the future to revive this relationship?", "hash": "4c7b42c53c039315f0844efab2831f7aa74afce55204c4f6a1687cf4fee0a7fb"}

But I never had thoughts of harming myself, neither did I have feelings of emptiness or suicide. I believe I am a fully functioning adult.

Yes, you are right. My ego is hurt by the rejection. A part of me still obsesses about her. But, there's this other part which does not want to go back to her. While I was with her I have had thoughts of leaving, running away. I don't think one would feel this way, if it was actually \"True Love\". But, I could not. Because I knew I would be alone and I was scared. I was emotionally dependent on her. She knew this well and used it to her advantage. There were times clearly when I told her \"I want to leave\". She responded with things like \"I love you\", \"I don't want to fight with you anymore\". I didn't really man up and set boundaries or leave.

I mean : it seems that some people become destructive with people close to them - or depending on them. On the short term, they \"win\". On the long run, their projects tend to fail. Or cost a lot to people around them. Besides, narcissism - as love for oneself - seems to me something positive. For me it's sort of energy that you need to manage. It's something that is often learned with experience and I think can be called \"maturity: taking own space, allow space to other, thinking on the long term, not be afraid to \"lose\"... From what I read, you seem to have kept a good relation with your wife. That's good for both of you. The outbursts of rage seem to be a problem for people around you. And for your girlfriend, it seems to be difficult to handle.It seems to me that it's typical impulsive destructive attitude : you feel bad and want the other person to feel bad, hoping you feel better. Some partners can handle it if they are very strong. Of course it's better, if possible, to find quieter ways to express your needs. What calls my attention is this: I know it's far fetched but I wanted to see if she respects my opinion or not. Not sure of the meaning of \"far fetched\". Do you mean that you discussed about the future mainly to \"win\"? Maybe there are other ways to feel respected. You seem to have strong emotions and you seem a little lost about how to find your space and your wants. I hope time and therapy make you feel better.

She has manipulated me many times, like asked me to expedite the divorce with my wife, in the 3rd week we were together. And i confronted my wife with this, because i was so blinded by love. She convinced me that I'm her knight in her shining armor, how her previous lovers were losers and how she's convinced that she could start a family only with me, etc. And I felt bad, listening to her stories, watching her taking care of the kid alone, i wanted to support her and I have. I believe I was the codependent empath who graduated to narcissist which destroyed the relationship. Our core principles were different. She is a social worker. She didn't mind sending her son to a school in a not-so-great part of the city. And I'm more of a capitalist. So I believe if you work hard, you deserve to have good living standard.

Yup. Someone with AvPD would definitely avoid drawing attention to themselves. I've been on a stage to deliver a thankyou to someone in front of a hall full of people, tripped over my words and hated every moment of being up there. Did it because the person really deserved the recognition and thanks for going above and beyond for me, but I couldn't get off that stage fast enough. Almost every music performance I ever did (I was never facing the audience directly), even though I love my music, I always hated being the one at the centre of attention. I desperately wanted to hide or blend into the background- or not be up there. It was easier accompanying another musician, but as a soloist or front and centre, nope. Would be freaking out the whole time. First rule of mental health: Learn to distinguish who deserves an explanation, who deserves only one answer, and who deserves absolutely nothing.

I've been doing so much research on this disorder recently that I realised I resonate with a lot of the traits, and this sent me into a depression and wanting to isolate from my loved ones to protect them! I have empathy, but I feel it's circumstantial, like for example I feel deeply for homeless people, if I see one, I become tearful because they look lonely and depressed and I think about them all day hoping they are okay! I feel sad when someone else is sad and I want to console and help them! I can't stand to see animals suffer and I cry if a family member kills an insect in the house, feeling bad for the life lost! Now the reason why I feel it is circumstantial is because there are certain situations where my empathy is lower and I try to feel something but it just isn't there, and so I instead feel dismissive towards the person! I don't get mean to them, but I just come across as uncaring and uninterested and this makes me feel awful, I feel both shame at myself and guilt for the person and I apologise to them and try to explain how my brain is! The narcissistic traits I feel I have apart from inconsistent empathy is a need for validation that I'm worthy, and this takes form in dressing up in a certain way when I'm going out so that men look at me and find me attractive! This is all I want, but when I get it, I start having thoughts that I'm the sexiest woman out there! I don't actually think I'm sexy at all, I find myself incredibly repulsive, but when these men look at me, whistle at me, honk their horns, however they show that they're looking and liking I get a high from it and start thinking I'm better than other women, and then feel embarrassed for thinking that when the high crashes! I don't experience rage if I don't get the validation I need, but I go home and cry in private wondering why I just can't be beautiful like other women, why I'm so ugly and disgusting etc and don't want to leave the house anymore... but this just repeats and it is exhausting to the point I've just wanted to end my life! The next trait is a fear of rejection and abandonment, and due to this I experience debilitating anxiety about being rejected, ghosted or cheated on and this causes me to need a lot of reassurance that I'm still loved and valued! Also, due to the abandonment/rejection anxiety, I experience excruciating jealousy, and I say excrutiating because it triggers a painful wound in me, a wound from being left out/excluded and bullied when I was growing up, both at school and at home! So, if a partner is showing love to someone else they care about, instead of being happy for them, I panic that I don't mean anything to them anymore, I'm jealous that it's not me getting that love and my brain convinces me that the love I get is not the same and is actually less than what others get, and so I cry and say to myself see? you are nothing! I don't have trouble holding myself accountable, I understand when I've made a mistake and done wrong and try to correct it! If I hurt someone, I feel guilt and apologise to them! I confuse myself so much because I have this good side of me, and then this horrible side comes out, this wounded child that I can't calm down! I've tried my best but I just can't regulate my emotions and I turn to others breaking down! I have a diagnosis of ADHD and I thought for the longest time my experiences were related to that, but NPD (particularly in vulnerable form) makes so much more sense because of the flip flopping between grandiosity and feeling worthless (not seen in ADHD)! Every day is a battle between healing and surviving (narcissism) and whichever one of those dominates varies from day to day, and situation to situation! It is truly exhausting! :'(", "hash": "e1050a5b7cd712cc57887b71dc9510be90a4509f93321c8c6f1529e1cc35dadc"}

Yeah it’s different now but like I say the 5 symptoms that they required before would have to be causing all sorts of pretty sig dysfunction before they would be considered clinical symptoms. From my experience they don’t really diagnose like that anyway they pretty much look for core issues. There are things that are present in all personality disorders they look for first, things like black and white thinking, thinking in extremes and being unable to see or comprehend nuances or gray area. Not having “whole object relations”. Which is just the ability to understand that just because you’re mad at someone doesn’t mean they are evil they can still be good and even care about you while still arguing with you. People with a PD have a very difficult time understanding this. Once you establish that a personality disorder is even present they look for what drives the behaviors as they can look the same. If it’s centered around a fear of abandonment they might look at something like BPD or if it’s centered around needing to be the center of attention and adored by your friends while being completely unable to accept criticism then perhaps it’s NPD but usually they just give a diag of PD nos meaning not otherwise specified", "hash": "798baa45ee0edd5758d404bc1c22a678cf4d68a36322fb1b31c0eeeb3c3b6630"}

So, as stated in the title. For years I thought myself to be histrionic because of my attention-seeking behavior. But I didn't realize until the last few weeks that I am in fact more likely a covert/vulnerable narcissist. I realize that my motivations and behaviors might be more in line with that. I've been in denial for years about the severity of my behaviors, desires, lies, half-truths, fantasies. But certain things lead me to believe that I'm NPD. For example, two of the three times I was hospitalized for mental health reasons I was panicking and unsure of how to handle certain situations and I think more than anything I was looking for a way out. I've thrown people under the bus in an instant to save my skin or my reputation, including a sibling. I haven't been great to my family. Actually, I've been quite mean. I used to have pets but I feel I did the bare minimum for them. Like yes I fed them and everything and made sure they were alright but I never wanted to play with them giving them that connection they need. I feel I can be a bit neglectful. Like wanting to be left alone and such. I notice more my emptiness and how I'm trying to be real but can't bring myself to be. I'd like to be someone who is capable of having normal relationships. I've lost friends. I've lost a lot actually. I read that this is God's punishment. I thought I had a moment of having a repentant and contrite heart but I'm not sure. Today in private I threw a mini tantrum when something didn't go my way but I caught myself and tried to calm down. I took a nap and felt better after. But I'm not sure if I'm capable of being a legitimately good person and it hurts to feel that. I'll likely never be someone who is healthy and has healthy relationships. I'm questioning how much capacity for empathy I have and if I'll ever be able to be content with life. I got a good job but I'm already screwing it up and becoming lazy. Self-sabotage I've always struggled with. I don't feel content. I don't know if I ever will. I feel I'm always playing or portraying myself as the victim and I know I crave that sympathy that comes with that. I don't know why. I want to be cared for. Rescued. Things like that. I have a lot of rage that was dormant for many years but has been coming out for the last few years. I don't like who I am. I hope God can forgive me as I try to change.", "hash": "34b42f164ffde76fefdf6e83dba9530398722c86bc8f27d6f5f46cc72a7df3d3"}

Sure there are those who have genuinely been in a relationship with someone with a PD, but I agree there seems to be a thing where the relationship has gone south and they are not willing to admit or accept that a relationship is a two-way street, and they start looking for \"excuses\" as to why it didn't work, and look to blame the other party and label them with a personality disorder. Rather than accept any responsibility at all for their own actions and contributions to the relationship failing. Or maybe they just were two people not meant to be together. But I suspect the percentage of people who have actually been in a relationship with someone with a PD is not as high as those on the internet would have us believe.

That the behaviours are not intended maliciously, but are a learned protective response to having dealt with a lifetime of trauma, threats, instability and abuse. And you're often not conscious of even doing it. I have a different PD. Mine is not demonised as much as NPD is, and I have a different range of behaviours I get accused being difficult with, but I hear you.

One was a driver’s license photo and the other a candid photo of me crossing a finishing line at a local race. Both were absolutely awful. It seemed I was in the full throws of geezerhood. Since then I’ve been able to convince myself, as usual, that it was the lighting, the angle, and the general circumstances in which these were taken, and that my much better---or less awful---looking mirror images were more true to life, by reading some articles and watching several YouTube videos. I suppose I cherry-picked all these to console myself. At some point, I felt better, as I usually do, and went back to a more positive facial self-image. Everything was fine. I was grossly over-blowing it. Hey! I could pass for 30! I was uniquely, almost disturbingly, youthful! (Of course in the back of my mind, I knew this was probably just another fluctuation, reality would smack me in the face once again, and I’d be due for another round of despair.) The larger issue is---and there are plenty of people who sneeringly ask this question---“why do I care so much about how I look?” Am I more obsessed about this than most people? Most men? People sneer at “vanity”, yet it doesn’t take much searching to find how many products there are on the market to improve personal appearance, not just to stave off the signs of aging, but for younger people too. Attracting a mate is surely part of this, but I think it’s much deeper and more nuanced than that. I also think blaming it on advertising, media and society is ultimately a copout. Oprah Winfrey once had Luther Vandross on her show after his radical weight loss. She declared in amazement that he looked like “a completely different person”. No, not the same person who’d just lost a lot of weight, but again, “a completely different person”. After a large weight loss at about 30, my brother made the same comment to me. It’s hard to explain, but there’s something very significant about this perception. I think it’s called “the halo effect”. It’s not just how you’re “seen” by others, but how you’re “felt”, and in some inexplicable way, who you are . A YouTuber by the name of Danny Mabley did a video on his weight loss journey. He went from looking middle-aged to a youthful 20-something, and yes, it was like he had become a “completely different person”. To me, even his voice and mannerisms seemed younger. Reality, or illusion? Where does outer beauty end and inner beauty begin? I don’t see any easy answer that question. It’s ageless. Luther Vandross on Oprah https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOzoiP3pMqE Luther After Weight Loss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snXaYujtDUc&t=64s My 140 lb Weight Loss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxoqoGphvO8&t=70s The Halo Effect https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCzZ6HvFHBk Okay. So, what? This is what: most of us want to be seen as the inner self, the inner person, that our body matches. There’s a certain enjoyment, sense of well-being in that experience. If you’ve got looks, you can shrug at this. But you neither know, nor probably care, what it feels like to people who don’t and never have. Or to those who had them but are losing them. When I was young, I scoffed at all these hair transplants and face lifts, but as they say, “you don’t know what you got ‘til it’s gone”. Maybe some people don’t feel this at all. Maybe some feel it only a little. But I think a lot more of us feel it much more, despite the tendency of most people to deny it out of the social conditioning that it’s vain and shallow. They are satisfied with the unreflective platitude that “beauty is only skin deep.” I am not . Will I ever accept my aging face and body? Will I ever be able to re-invent myself? Will I ever be able to accept my new niche in society, as I drift ever further towards its margins? Will I let go of all my old youthful fantasies? I’m working on it. But it won’t be easy. I’d be a fool to think it will be. The inner life of the secret schizoid is incommunicable.", "hash": "a4d3cadfbc916a47b0ea44fcad2044cea67c4a210ae3138122f9b35c6f3d72af"}

I can relate with how it's difficult to be aging. You talked about identity. I like when people think I look a little younger, but I wouldn't like to mix with much younger people \"as if I was their age\". I would have the impression of fake, I wouldn't feel comfortable. And I don't know why, I tend to feel comfortable with older people, sometimes very old. Will I ever accept my aging face and body? Will I ever be able to re-invent myself? Will I ever be able to accept my new niche in society, as I drift ever further towards its margins? Will I let go of all my old youthful fantasies? Personnally I always felt comfortable in a niche. Much drama inside, I prefer the margins, where they don't ask me too much and I can find some space. And look at trees and birds, sometimes. I find the question of feeling inside /outside very interesting. Why do I feel so lonely in a crowd ? That impression of being outside. With what does that resonate inside me?", "hash": "0a10611ee84ac00950bd44950e8e455852f9ea69dc3cf670fbe7bda4acd06ea9"}

Today one of my therapists (a psychologist) suggested that I could be a \"covert\" narcissist, or at least that I could have some traits of that disorder. Honestly it was the first time I heard of this word, \"covert\", although I knew the word \"narcissist\", so I was a bit confused and after the meeting I started searching online for clarification. Long story short, the two important things for me are: I'm very competitive intellectually by nature and I was bullied at high school. Also, it's important to mention that in high school I was very bad in Maths but, when we started Calculus, I became interested in it and started studying it, also for social \"revenge\" and \"glorification\". That led to me starting a Maths degree like three years ago, of which I completed with average results a little more than one year of study before entering therapy for what I suppose was depression (I studied too much alone, did not follow lectures and tried to avoid social life in general). After that, I changed like three or four degrees because of confusion and anger for what I felt was not right. Now I recovered, and I'm back into Maths in some way. Despite that, I'm still focused on what happened in that strange period and in high school, which I consider an unforgettable failure in my life both academically and socially. Although I have few \"real\" friends (3,4), I'm now active socially in a group of people without any problems. After this data, I ask about what should I do about these words of being a \"covert\" narcissist: should I, for example, ask for clarifications directly to my therapist or should I simply \"trust\" him/her, work about it at therapy with the chosen path and forgetting the curiosity of the possible \"level\" of the disturb ?", "hash": "388b81d50706ce962817fa99c8a5e2362930c9319e0633c8b8acc17d4a2cec4d"}

Years ago i used to smoke a lot of pot, but all I knew was that I was smoking pot. When I picked up my medicinal card earlier this year, I started to learn about this magical healing herb. The two dominant strains are the Sativa and Indica strains. Everything else is a hybrid variation of these two strains. Sativa's are best used during the daytime. Different strains will have different effects, but in general, sativa's offer a more energetic effect. Indica's are best used at night. Again, different strains will have different effects, but indica's generally tend to provide a sleepier effect. I tend to buy Sativa's that are 25% or more Sativa dominant and Indica's that are 25% or more Indica dominant. I don't generally play in the middle ground, with a few exceptions. The best methods for consumption are either as edibles, or via Vaporization. Joints, pipes, etc are all fine, but they include much higher health risks. If you are already a smoker you may not care, but if weed is all that you are smoking, use a vaporizer. I LOVE my Pax (by Ploom). Vaporization is immediate and will provide a peak effect for up to an hour (depending on the strain and quality of your bud) and a residual effect that could last up to two or possibly even three hours. Edibles take anywhere from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours to kick in, but when they do it happens all at once. Edibles can provide a peak effect for 4 to 6 hours or so, again depending on the quality of the material that the edibles were infused with. It ramps down from there, but it's not unheard of for edibles to continue having an effect that last 8 hours or more. You MUST be careful with edibles - sometimes it's tempting to eat one quarter of a pot brownie and say 'I'm still not feeling anything', so you eat the whole thing. You may not get the effect you were looking for if you overdo it like this - plus, you're just wasting your weed! I prefer not to use edibles anymore. I WILL NOT DRIVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE. Taking an edible means that I am stuck for pretty much the entire day - or I need someone to cart my ass around from place to place. If there's an emergency I may not be able to drive... I just don't like the limitations it imposes. Edibles are good if you're going to be somewhere all day anyway though. I also avoid edibles late at night - it often gives me a hangover of sorts the next morning. There are also concentrates and a whole host of additional forms of consumption available, but for the purposes of getting some relief from cannabis, the above approach has worked wonderfully for me.

Favorite Indica: Doesn't matter - I'm going to sleep Links: https://www.leafly.com/ (database of strains and dispensaries).", "hash": "ac9eb49eb2c8d411961ff28775c60073b95777488183b544058b8663d71b4e74"}

(I'm the owner-operator of a lawn & garden service.) As I was driving down the residential road, someone started calling out to me. It was a man on the curb. It was kind of an awkward place to stop, but I stopped my truck in the road---which wasn't busy---and walked over to him. He was sitting with a friend. He wanted to know how much I'd charge for mowing a heavily grown over lawn across the street. I gave him a \"bid\" and he began to haggle a bit. We agreed on price. He wanted to know if I'd do it right now. I told him \"no\", I've got two other people right now. I told him I'd give him a \"soft\" promise of about mid next week. Then he started to give me the usual \"old man wisdom\" about the work ethic and how the time to make your money was when you're young. He made a point in all this that he was 70. His friend looked about the same age, maybe a little older. I told him that sometimes you have to be careful of taking on too much work because it can damage you're body. (This, I know from experience.) He said, yeah, if you're old,like me, but \"you're only 30!\" I was a little amused, but I decided to just accept the compliment---or was it a joke???---and not tell him I'm 57. Now, of course, I know he could've been just being facetious, but the reason I suspect he may really have been serious is that these kinds of comments aren't isolated incidents. I'll admit there's some shameful boast in my posting this. But on another level there's a dark side to this phenomena, if it is indeed real, and the evidence, not all of which I'm revealing, suggests it is. There's a rush of \"supply\" when I get these comments, but there's also sense of unease in them too. It's kind of creepy. It's not natural. It feels almost \"evil\" sometimes.

(I believe I have npd by the way, although it's hidden very well as far as I can tell.) I did read The Picture of Dorian Gray recently, a few months ago or so. I'd been intending to for quite a while. I enjoyed it a lot. There was a lot that I didn't identify with in Dorian, and a fair amount that I did. I don't want to come across as elegant or decadent, and I don't seek the hedonism he did either. In fact, it's a bit confused exactly what I'd want to do if I could be physically young again, whether forever or some extended period of time. But one thing I could relate to is the sense Dorian had that something was very, very \"wrong\" in what he'd attained. Something disturbingly \"off\". His sense of being irredeemably evil . This was expressed by Wilde in his own cultural concepts and images, which included religion. But this obsession pre-dates my reading or even really knowing much about Dorian Gray. I think I've explored it enough in my blogs and posts on this forum. How much is the perception that I look much younger delusion, wishful thinking, exaggerated, and how much, if at all, is it really true? Why should it matter to a man of character? Is it just crass vanity? I think the psychology of and experiential sociology (if I may coin a phrase) of ones personal looks, of ones personal physicality is more than just vanity. I don't think BDD or NPD theory really delve into it, really explain it that well. One part of it is that you really do become part of a different world as you get older. You're more invisible. And this is much more so for aging misfits and socially marginal people like me. But I'm still not quite sure why I have this mixed reaction of \"elation and relief\" on the one hand when I get these \"you look a lot younger\" comments followed by shame and dis-ease on the other.

I've struggled in my life - very shy, withdrawn, introverted, anxious, negative intrusive thoughts, resentful, petty, cowardly, grandiose, I could go on and on. I have no friends or any real relationships, I just don't feel comfortable around people. The only time I feel comfortable around others is when I feel I am in control. I've been like this my entire life but had no idea the cause behind it. I thought I was suffering from trauma/cptsd which was causing of my issues. But learning about covert narcissism has fits me more accurately. I came to this realization recently from experimenting with psychedelics, this was after trying traditional forms of therapy and getting nowhere. The psychedelics have opened my mind up and I can see things about myself that I was completely oblivious to before. I see how I am manipulative and sneaky. I can't believe I am seeing these things about myself. It's humbling but also quite liberating. My life finally makes a little more sense. I believe I picked up this narcissistic wound very early in my life 2-4 years of age. I think my mother has a similar wound and my father was an aggressive alcoholic. I decided very early on, to not be myself. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest. But I also wondered if real recovery is possible. A lot of information out there makes you believe narcissists are doomed to live their lives in this way forever. However, following the breakthroughs I've experienced with responsible psychedelic use, I feel recovery is a possibility. Any thoughts?

Personality disorders are hard to treat and take ridiculous amounts of time in therapy to get anywhere. Since they usually use psychodynamic approaches the sessions can seem onfocused and seem not to work on anything in particular basically indefinitely, especially if there is lots of dissociation going on and you dont consciously perceive what you are working on. Ive myself been in therapy now for 5 years or so and while some stuff definitely changed theres other stuff that I feel has not changed at all. So I think you need a high level of thick-headedness (and depending where you live lots of funds) to go through with it.

So recently I've been feeling kinda bad about myself and I feel that my confidence has been knocked from offhand comments and bullying, like the bubble which I lived in that protects me from feelings of inferiority or low esteem has been popped, and I am kinda struggling to even find footing or grounding resources or anything of the like, or how to get back to a stable place of self esteem. I have seen two therapists before for this sort of thing and also social anxiety, which ig is comorbid with VN, as well as looking for a new therapist, and talking to two close freinds who understand. That vaugly helped and I had rebuilt some of my esteem but I still don't feel the same. That mixed with a loss of self from emotional abuse which I (mostly) recovered from makes it basically impossible to find and footing in myself or what is going on around me just makes it harder to keep my own boat afloat if you get me.

Im not sure about the cause-effect situation in your case, but I think its the other way around. Through maturing and growing as a person we becoem more open to the different aspects of both ourselves and the outside world, including other people. Something like idealization has the secondary gain that one doesn't have to face negative sides at all. So you dont have to worry, dont have to be anxious, dont have to be angry etc because your object is perfect and can't cause any of those associations or affects to arise; indirectly - by freeing you from having to perceive all those other aspects of your inner world (and the person) - youre then facing a very onesided version of yourself, too, which might seem perfect. So in that regard as a defense its very effective and thats what I would think also sets it apart strongly from idolizing somebody as an ideal, forming an aspiration to grow all the positive features one sees in the other person in oneself - as that requires one to be aware of what is missing. I think the ability to do that and ultimately to not fall into that need to idealize somebody / to split reality, is a result of personal development though and more an effect than a cause. But I dont know, it might be possible to work on the object-side, too? I guess you have to find out which one works better for you or what you think will work better in the long run. dx: SPD", "hash": "ae19e5db66ccb21b5cb0e5b334b31c6f0065f4998fa9c8bc69a67279b0816b99"}

Thank you for your comment, Akuma. I think that sometimes - say for instance with a parent - idealisation can put some pressure on oneself. I remember having read a book where the author perceived sort of relief, learning that the (distant) parent wasn't the perfect person he imagined. In case of distant parent (be dead, traveling, distant, busy, emotionally unavailable etc.),i think a child has no other choice then idealizing. Positively or negatively. In my case, i think i need to feel something good towards that person. Some people around me talked very negatively, describing that person as evil. Because of some anecdote, i was somehow confused. I think i need to keep some sort of bubble with good image. Maybe it's a bit exaggerate. Some years ago, someone who i knew very long time ago and didn't like, contacted me and offered to talk of the past. I didn't answer. Because i didn't like them. And an other reason was that i didn't want to break that bubble. -- Sat Jun 05, 2021 12:10 pm -- 1PolarBear wrote: The person idealizing idealizes their own feelings through the idol.

I saw a lot of people idealizing, but it does not imply a personal perfection, and sometimes quite the opposite. It can be that you are so below the person idealized, that your imperfection is almost swept away because its for the cause, or for some altruism. Let's take a few examples. Sick children, they are usually idealized. So sports players will visit sick children, in order to show they are caring people, but it does not imply they are perfect, but when they do something wrong, like send another player in the hospital, then they can justify their existence by saying the visit sick children, so they aren't all that bad. Who else will visit them? Or plenty of people idealize Jesus, who they think is perfection, so they are nothing in comparison, but then again, others are also nothing. So then they go on abusing children and tell them that Jesus would be nice and would not defend himself. The person will admit readily being a sinner, but somehow they think they should get a pass, because they worship the right person. Toxic is all the bad stuff you impose on people and in this case, it is made worst, because it is not owned, it is blamed on the idol. So the person feels justified, because it is seemingly altruistic, and the victim cannot fight back either, because it would mean fighting the idol, and if they do, things just escalate because the idol is sacred and cannot be touched. So it is toxic, there is no resolution ever possible and it is bad for at least one of the parties, usually both. People still fall for it though, they never learn. The whole schtick is pretty obvious though, but people only see it when they don't believe in the idol, but don't question the need and usefulness to have some in the first place. They just want it to be the right one, the one that their feelings want, the one they emote about. That one they will fall for it, and become toxic and allow other like minded worshippers around that are also toxic. So then the will fight each others through the idol. And if it is a person that is idealized, then they will simply abuse the authority, because it is beyond reproach, up to a point of course. Politics is the same. People idealize their party, which gives them cover for whatever bad stuff they want to do. It does not make them perfect, just a conduit for their emotions to be carried through the idol. Same with ideas, \"values\". Climate change for example. People will use it to tell people what to do, what to eat, what to wear, what to consume, where to work, etc. Not because they are perfect themselves, most aren't and are oftentimes worst than the people they accuse, but it gives them cover for every little emotion they have and want to impose on others. If it is someone you know, their perfection may be used to do all kinds of things in the same way. You are just following orders. That is the defense the nazis had. Or it could play out in other different ways, but the idealized person is seen as a sacred object. It cannot be changed, so others have to change and be forced to change in the name of the idol. Parents can be seen like that of course. If they are idealized, children will fight through them. If one does not worship the parent, it becomes the black sheep of the family, not part of the play. It's a bit of a natural human behavior and most parents probably want it that way, because it gives them more power, but it changes when children grow up, or should. Then they start worshipping something else, or worst, someone else. It's why their is adolescent crisis, the children learn the parents are not all knowing, and all wise, and in fact are quite lacking. It creates narcissistic rage, because the reality is confronting the delusion. So there you have the answer to your question. Reality always win, and whatever quiet you think you may get from idealizing, not only it will be confronted by reality, but you will use it to abuse people and be abused in that same way.", "hash": "75c4a5981b7ccc9e067b50b87926d3cc2b7506e382cdbfcfa808aa2da69ef3bb"}

But it plays out differently. Like the antisocial thinks he can get away with things, that life is a competition and there is no rule, so everything is permissible. That people can't hurt him, because he does not feel guilt and can endure pain. So strictly speaking, it's a type of delusion, or different belief. I think it is central to narcissism. It's basically the delusion that your image is your self, what you project is truly who you are, and that you can control that image. People are there to mirror you as an example, and therefore they become an extension of yourself which can be exploited since you are also in control of the image. So you could go on and on with all the others, I am sure they all have their specific delusion. Strictly speaking the societies we live in are also delusions, they are make believe things that don't necessarily mesh with reality. So they are delusions in that sense, but since it is a \"normal\" delusion, it is not called that. It might be called the \"current thing\" or the politically correct. or the faith, sometimes the customs. You need that to have a society, because the bondings are in themselves illusory, it's just habits, which can change, so in order to have \"something\", you have to create an illusion that it is. The only question is whether you can realize when it starts to be true, or stops being useful. But in the sense of different belief than the normal, all personality disorders are delusional, pretty much by definition. It's a different belief of the self and social relationships. In and of itself it means nothing, it's more useful if you look in the detail of what difference? but it is not the type that makes it problematic, it's that it is strongly held and inflexible.", "hash": "f8012f878261daf75a55b48885c6be470bdf9816752ddcdedd62f6de68e6e253"}

It’s ok to have flaws, it’s ok to accept criticism and sometimes other people (other narcissist) will try to tear you down because they are insecure about themselves. You have to realize this is about them, their issues and has little to do with you.", "hash": "8e1795c023286208115b198adaedc9e2f9dd36a5e09416780ec401563e163295"}

This confused me even more and now I want to figure out if I should be worried about something or not. So, my story: I had severe schizoid behavior when I was a child. I almost didn’t talk to anyone, only with my closest relatives, I was a closed child, I practically didn’t express emotions and maybe didn’t feel them much. Jie, as a child, I began to feel as if detached from people: I did not have a special need to talk with my peers, I was more attracted to adults, I wanted to find out and listen to what kind of conversations they had, what was happening to them; I did not understand why the children around expressed such strong emotions, it seemed to me that they were doing it for purpose, but I never could understand why; I wasn't empathetic back then, I didn’t understand why others immediately began to calm someone who was crying, I didn’t understand why they had such a strong desire to communicate with someone that they did it right during class, why did they go everywhere together. Along with this, I was kinda neglected child. Mli parents may not appear at home for days, sometimes even a month. and as I learned they did it even when I was a baby, I was looked after by the aunt with whom we lived. But it seems to me that at the age when I began to realize myself, I didn’t care about their adventures outside the home. More importantly, I never felt love, attention, care, praise and so on. But I wasn't abandoned at all. My parents actually cared and still care for me. they tried to make me happy. I always knew that they loved me. but this knowledge wasn't helpful at all. My mom has always been easily irritable and impulsive. At the same time, she is distrustful of the new and therefore the first reaction to my hobbies was very unpleasant. She often yelled at me. Now this is my trigger. I often provoked my mother into emotions, I think that was the only way to get attention from her. By middle school I realized how much I am addicted to attention and praise when my teachers did this to me. By the age of 14-15, I realized that this was not enough and that being a gray mouse was not effective, and I began to change. I became quite a socially active person. At first glance, very open and emotional, empathic, confident. Probably the perfect person. The changes went unnoticed and quickly. Later this caused a lot of problems. I no longer understand who I am. There was a feeling of emptiness inside. I realized how shallow my emotions were. I realized what a strong emotion of boredom haunted me all this time. I realized how much I satisfy my desires, nothing can stop me on the way to them. It started ruining my life because I had no control over myself and I still have no. I became disgusted with myself. And with that, I had a hard feeling that my whole personality is one big lie, like I never had it. Like all my thoughts, action, emotions were because of boredom. I did not know and still do not know who I am, what I want in long-term and what I really like or love. Also I realized I feel nothing for people. I never was attached to someone. Tho once I was addicted because of the attention a person gave me at the start of the relationship. Much earlier, I realized that I feel nothing for my parents, they are like strangers to me, but close simply because they know what I really am.And this is the only factor by which I determine how close a person is to me. I need people only to satisfy my needs of attention and entertainment. I often say strange or inappropriate things, twisted their words just to put them in awkward situation. Tho I do not only negative thing (But actually I don't think my behaviour is wrong). but I don't like negative attention to myself. This hurts me a lot. Recently I realized when I behave inappropriate I always blame otherns. Like they made me so and I have the right to those feelings, they hurt me, so I will act like an asshole. I tried to feel myself bad person, but I never can. I know that in the first place for me is me. I don't think I ever be able to care someone as much as for myself. As a child I felt myself I was better than others. Much better. Then I had some contradictory feeling -- I was best, but sometimes I had feeling of low self-esteem. Now I have no problems with low self-esteem, and I feel more superior that others again. Even tho I know I am a grand loser and feeling self disgust sometimes. I always feel like I'm a normal person with some problems, now I feel like I'm one big wrong. But I still love myself. That just drives me mad. I doesn't ever feel myself alone even tho I never had someone close to me even a little bit. And I don't think I will ever had. I don't have trust issues just because I don't care about others thoughts or words. Even tho I have superficial emotions, I am really an irritable person, and that is not superficial. I always have strong irritation inside and I'm always ready to show it. It's really intensive. I hardly can restrain myself from bad actions. Often I want physically hurt someone or something. And now even myself. I have no past or future influence for my actions or feelings, only now exist for me. I am very gambling and addictive to things that bring pleasure. And even more I am addicted for atteion and praise, I think I don't even need care or love. It is good to have only for not doing something yourself. I never felt guilty, regretful or remorse. But I felt ashamed. One or two times I guess. I don't remember any of these situations. But I know I felt that because someone knew something I don't want anyone to know. I think that was not really a shame, but some kind of sad. Also, I have tested on the internet. That was a test for Person's character accentuations. Not sure if that exists in the English language. But there was the first time I heard about Haltlose behaviour. So, there was such a diagnosis like Haltlose PD in past. That's just me with only one amendment. It's not easy to influence me. I have had this #######5 problem from my early childhood. I'm about to be diagnosed with depression. It makes me feel hatred towards myself, but the I like myself again. But (almost) all this stuff I write above was with me from my earliest memories, so I believe it's now because of depression. I think vice versa I have depression because of this. Yeah...

Went from an overt to a covert. This was shocking to me at 1st until I realized studies show that you have a 90% chance from going to one narc to the next. 90!!! They are both one in the same animal, only difference is confidence. If the covert had the confidence the overt has, I know he'd be just as bad with the triangulation & wouldn't feel an ounce of guilt for any drama caused. I haven't been in contact with the OVERT for a year and a half because it got to a point where everything he said was not based in reality, \"liar\" is an understatement... however I'm still in touch with the COVERT as it's really hard to let go. We are no longer dating, but still talk as friends, but I'll be happy once I can cut off contact for good without feeling like he will turn on me in some way. How it's going.... Well, today is a weird day for me as last night I was on phone with the COVERT (who has driven 9 hours to visit me in person at least 5 times now) who told me that my pictures don't match who I look like in person. If I'm so ugly, why come back 5 times? Then today, the OVERT (who I haven't spoke to in a 1.5 year) has posted an away status that says \"you can put makeup on a pig but it's still a pig\". Like is my phone tapped or is this narcs just narcin? LoL. Strange coincidence right? At the end of the day, I'm older, aging...I'm no spring chicken anymore, but the truth is I have made money off my looks for the last 20 years & still do, but I've never based my value on my looks, even tho they clearly do. I got both the OVERT and the COVERT telling me I'm ugly, yet one keeps coming back to my state just to see me & the other keeps posting away status messages about me even after 1.5 of no contact!

You also have to incorporate what I say into your own world so to speak, so there is a threat there too. If what I said you disagreed with or when you do, then you have to defend yourself somehow. Reject what I said for some reason, etc. Or you could reject me entirely, call me names, etc. That last one would be in the narc injury and rage department. Not always of course, but usually if it is not voluntary. ... My theory is that the narcissist self is porous. I explained it to the other guy in the other thread recently. There is a lack of distinction between the self and the others, or even to ideas. So if you like ice cream, and I say ice cream is bad, you will take it personally and rage. You might not even be aware of why necessarily, but it's there somewhere, you pegged me as an icecreamphobe. I've definitely experienced moderate anger, cursing, holding grudges, grumpiness for no apparent reason etc. , but most of it seemed mild (to me at least) and within my control. Rage is perhaps anger I or any person fail to control. As for the second paragraph - I understand black-and-white thinking as thinking in extremes, and I remember reading somewhere about Jung's explanation of the term enantiodromia and the 'emergence of the unconscious opposite in the course of time', I try to stay around the middle for practical reasons and for fear of going into the other extreme. There are also occassions where it's difficult to \"take some and leave some\" and not be extreme in attitudes, in e.g. certain professions it can be a welcome/useful trait. I also think it can be okay to reject a whole person and not just the acts if the number of such acts exceeds what we are capable or willing to deal with. I generally agree with your description but then I think of an example from my life where I acted in a similar way and it doesn't seem as unreasonable any more.. Paragraph three - so name-calling would be another example of narcissistic rage. Narc injury in this case can (maybe) be perceived as running out of arguments in a discussion. Some people use insults lightly and at a superficial level, and might have another mode of communication hidden within layers of their personality that a narcissistic injury uncovers. Or perhaps I'm wrong and all people react in a similar verbal way when narcissistically injured. I am also not sure if a person can have a countless number of narcissistic injuries (or even two same ones), maybe every such wound that goes from the subconscious to the conscious mind also gets (at least partially) healed in the process. I hope so at least. The ice cream paragraph - I think people often get hurt or angered by ice cream comments when there are deeper unresolved issues in their relationship that they then project during such seemingly insignificant arguments. If there are no deeper problems, and the person reacts with rage, then I'd perhaps describe it as a narcissistic rage/injury. The negative emotion itself is not so much an issue in my opinion, and can be considered some sort of internal energy. I am just not sure to what extent is it possible to control or consciously focus the energy into something constructive in such a state. I will also check out the other thread you mention.", "hash": "ff1afa497ec15581033ce9578f5ac13a20dc9e302a2b0da641093d088706289b"}

So it's a good thing to be able to recognize them and address them, especially since after that, you then can avoid the same type in the future. It festers like a virus too. So if your mommy called you lazy, you might get a narc injury, which is not treated, will be there in your unconscious, and you might end up calling everybody you don't like lazy, or use it as some argument in the wrong places, or accuse everybody of it, say the whole world is lazy and you are the only one that's not. You might end up writing books about how to overcome laziness and do talks. Now, it might all be good and perhaps even true, but it does not solve your problem that eats you inside.

I don't know too much about his work, but I got cca 70% of it (without knowing the context and details). A different type of personality comes to my mind when I imagine a narcissist or a dictator (Trump, or Putin). Trudeau('s public persona) seems milder than that, mostly decent, fair and agreeable. I also admit I know very little about Trudeau's politics and not enough about politics in general. I am also never sure if the politicians act/speak freely (in public) or are tied to their political party. Relating to next paragraph - so if I want to stop a non-dictator acting like one, I only need to call them a dictator? Doesn't say what might happen if they are a dictator. Right.

If it ends in writing a book (etc) and doing talks, it sounds like a mature way of dealing with the injury imo. I think creative activity might solve half of the problem, therapy maybe all or most of it. I am not sure what people were using before psychology was invented to deal with trauma. I also remember reading something about psychoanalysis and the term wounded healer, it's what this story's ending reminded me of, healing yourself as you are healing others. Maybe it's also difficult to perceive progress in such a scenario, perhaps it can only be measured from a time-distance, or in terms of constructive things done, or in improved relationships with people, even though the issue lingers on to eat us inside (meaning to say perhaps the progress is externalized somewhere in the world around us). I'm not sure if we can at least partially choose what will define us, there are probably numerous things people called us throughout life, both good and bad, why focus only on some of it. Or perhaps it needs to come from a parent, or at an early age. If parents have such a strong influence on their children, they could also positively influence them. I wouldn't say this story above on laziness has a sad epilogue, there seem to be ups and downs, and some struggle, which builds personality. From what I know of subconscious mind, it's not easy to make sense of these things as they are happening, but it becomes more clear with time/experience. Yes, that's a good point. There might be some other reasons, so then it could be displaced anger, or just using whatever to create a drama. But I was thinking once, I had this thing.

So any case of getting disproportionately upset (along the anger-rage spectrum) is some sort of a narc injury? Are there even people out there who've never experienced them? Not trying to relativize, but I'm also wondering if psychologically/mentally/emotionally healthy person actually exists or whether it's just an abstract ideal we should strive towards. Even if they do exist, I don't think they're as common. I caught myself subconsciously replaying the situations that happened to me with other people (e.g. someone humiliates me, or is rude, and I do or at least attempt to do the same/similar to another unrelated person).

What you're describing sounds like supressed anger. It's more that it can be suppressed also, but it is not strictly speaking anger. Like I said in the first post, anger is wanting to destroy an obstacle. But someone not validating your self image is not an obstacle to a good, because self-image is not a good in itself, or should not be. It's something that should be in sync with your actions and how others perceive you, so in the end, rage is against oneself. It's like in the story of Snow White. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqmIMvWnIV8 She thought the mirror would tell her she was the fairest, but it didn't, so it causes her a narc injury and rage, where she tries to poison Snow White. It's not really anger, because it is not SW's fault. She is not the cause of her not being fair, just the fairest, so it is envy and jealousy that drives her, not pure anger. It's her own sense of superiority that is in danger, her own self-image. So it looks more like self-hatred projected out on others. But that is the whole consumed thing. Just the narc injury could cause suppressed anger too, but it's not rage itself. In other words, it does not always cause rage, but in the narcissist it will. And I suppose in theory the right use of the word is when a narcissist is injured, it is narcissist injury, but it's a bit of a circular definition that does not tell much if you don't know what those type of injuries are. Iznahs wrote: Not sure how much of that do I have in my subconsciousness and whether it's better to somehow release it or not disturb it at all.

Perhaps it's better to focus anger on lunch/activity/place than on a person? Or not. Didn't think this through. You should. Yes, it is better to focus on acts than the person if possible. But at least it should be the bad act itself. Like for example a thief. It's the act of stealing that is the problem. Calling the person a thief might be legit. But if you don't like the thief and then call them a racist, it then makes no sense. Or in the case of Snow White, she did nothing, she just happens to exist, so it is a great example. The Queen should focus on being fairer, or just drop the competition she cannot win. Iznahs wrote: A lot of Trudeau in this paragraph, in a constructive way though, to convey psychological ideas. I don't know too much about his work, but I got cca 70% of it (without knowing the context and details). The context is how he dealt with the freedom convoy. Give the silent treatment, project and caricature the opponents, denounce them as such and then take measures that are disproportionate because it hurts his own image of a good responsible leader. People don't recognize his greatness, so it can't be because he sucks, but for some other reason. It's in the public domain, so if you want to see a narcissist injury and what it looks like in real life and in real term, it is the typical example. Iznahs wrote: A different type of personality comes to my mind when I imagine a narcissist or a dictator (Trump, or Putin). Trudeau('s public persona) seems milder than that, mostly decent, fair and agreeable. Yes, he is the good narcissist, but even then he can't fool all people all of the time. It causes him trouble, and in this case, a kind of trouble akin to a natural disaster like floods of famine. In his mind, it is the same, for a lot of people, it is an incompetent that is over his head and is grandiose. It also shows another thing about the narc injury, it is an existential threat subjectively speaking. Either the image is restored, or the whole thing breaks down. That is why the rage or the violence can be extreme. Just like the Queen, she has to get rid of Snow White, her existence threatens her own because all of her existence is invested in her image of being the fairer. If she is not the fairer, she ceases to exist. Iznahs wrote: Relating to next paragraph - so if I want to stop a non-dictator acting like one, I only need to call them a dictator? Doesn't say what might happen if they are a dictator. Yes. Well someone that is in good faith and has principle, if they make a mistake, will recognize it. If they are in bad faith, they will know they got discovered and will lash out and will call the cops. It's a narc injury for an undercover agent. His real goal was to bust you all along, so talking about it just alerted the Man. Iznahs wrote: If it ends in writing a book (etc) and doing talks, it sounds like a mature way of dealing with the injury imo. Depends. I was just watching a documentary on Hitler's henchmen. Goebbels was a bit of the typical fragile narcissist. They portray him as having that narc injury, which happens to be a real one, his leg that was not good. So it is a constant humiliation for him, and he seeks to overcompensate and attach himself to a more grandiose figure from which he seeks constant attention, plus he sends his rage on others, in that case mostly the Jews but also other cripples at first, which he wanted to exterminate. I don't think you could call it mature, but as the Minister of Propaganda, he was doing movies, doing talks and so on. He also burned books that disagreed with his own. Iznahs wrote: I am not sure what people were using before psychology was invented to deal with trauma. The question is more whether psychology does anything. I know for Catholicism, there is the sacrament of penance that does the trick, because basically you end up forgiving yourself, and are forgiven by the world at large. So it is designed for that. Otherwise I am not sure. Shamans had kind of animal quests, which also does some of that, especially when it is communal in structure. Mostly it happens in family structure and grooming more generally. It reinforces the good identity and allow the bad to be evacuated through sadness. Iznahs wrote: I also remember reading something about psychoanalysis and the term wounded healer, it's what this story's ending reminded me of, healing yourself as you are healing others. Yes, there is that archetype going around, and I am sure it exists. But more often than not, I think it is a kind of living their narcissism, like Goebbels. I am watching the sci-fi serie Farscape right now, and the personality of Zhaan is the wounded healer. She does not write books or do speeches though, she attends people individually no matter who they are, and I think it is the main difference here. She deals with real people, while the Goebbels type deals in ideology and archetypes.

From what I know of subconscious mind, it's not easy to make sense of these things as they are happening, but it becomes more clear with time/experience. Yes, sounds good. Most of it is unconscious, you only basically know when you fixed it, and how you do that is a bit of a mystery, but time is a big factor.

But I think a common language can be found in both cases, and I don't think you 2 were arguing (just) because you disagreed in opinions. Well, I was, I don't know about the other guy. I suppose he was not. The point is that it could not be about me, because he didn't know me at all. Sometimes it is less clear, but the idea that some people invest in some ideas and take it personally when it is attacked is a sound one. It's especially the case in personality cults. If you criticize the dear leader, you can expect a lot of resistance, and it has nothing to do with you or the person resisting. They simply have invested their self in the other. But it can be about ideas too, and many other things, that was what I was pointing to. Iznahs wrote: So any case of getting disproportionately upset (along the anger-rage spectrum) is some sort of a narc injury? Well, I would say it is an ego injury at that point. Whether it is a narc injury has to do with the lack of defense mechanism against it, plus seeing it as an existential threat. Then it starts looking at a narcissist injury, and it is even more the case if it is about envy, then you know for sure. So Goebbels was jealous of people that had good legs for example, or the Queen was about one person being fairer. So that's the complete archetype, but there are many steps along the way to get there. Like I don't think Trudeau is envious of the truckers, but I still think it qualifies because of the lack of defense mechanism, and ability to communicate properly. He could be envious of others though, like Trump or Xi Jinping , but I can't read his mind. But given his overall personality, I would say it is. In other words, there are gray areas, and no, it is not just any disproportionate reaction. Some people are just explosive in their very nature for instance, or you might truly hate something for subjectively good reasons. The big tell tale is the existential threat I believe. Rambo might kill all the commies because they killed his new girlfriend, but they aren't an existential threat per say, although it kind of plays close to narcissism. It's more obvious in the first movie, where now the police is portrayed as an existential threat to his freedom, and that looks more like narcissistic rage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtWHgkNH5yU That and some PTSD thrown in, but for the viewer, it looks more like rage. The cops outside and the whole society are the existential threat, so the war never ends. Iznahs wrote: Are there even people out there who've never experienced them? Not trying to relativize, but I'm also wondering if psychologically/mentally/emotionally healthy person actually exists or whether it's just an abstract ideal we should strive towards. No, which is why I said you probably had hundreds of examples in your own life if you look broadly enough, depending of course on your age. Possibly the most important ones, you don't even know consciously. You probably only know the ones you can deal with consciously, and the others might come in flashes here and there in your memory. You don't know they are significant, or just how much. By digging, you will find more, that is guaranteed, but you have to have a broad enough understanding and not just look at Rambo style stuff. As for what is healthy, it's just that there isn't a real universal definition, it's a thing you know when you don't have it, just like national identity. You can tell Rambo has some issues, or the Queen, and this and that. You could avoid their trap and still have other issues, and some people might have their issues and still do fine overall. Just the same, you can tell Chinese food is not American, even if you don't know what an American is and what it eats. Iznahs wrote: Even if they do exist, I don't think they're as common.

I think it can be prevented by expecting a chain-reaction after any such negative incident in my life and by having some coping mechanisms ready to use (instead of creating further conflict). I tend to replay other people's positive effect on me as well, not as often though. Not sure how much effect do people generally have on each other, and what does it all depend on. It's best to deal with problems as they happen and in a restricted way to the problem itself. This way your sense of self is not affected, because it's just one issue, not an existential threat. Since it's on the spot, there is no need to brood over it, or having it go into the unconscious and fester there, and being restrained allows the possibility of a resolution, so if it does not happen, you did what you could. Anyway, it's a long subject, and plenty of people talk about it, but overall, the bad defense of the narcissism is to attack the whole person, or the whole history of the relationship, and not the act itself, so it forces separation, or else you get into a very toxic relationship.", "hash": "5e7149dfa633f2c3ba229baad196a83dbd0158eae35cb88c0757b88710e55028"}

Like I said in the first post, anger is wanting to destroy an obstacle. But someone not validating your self image is not an obstacle to a good, because self-image is not a good in itself, or should not be. It's something that should be in sync with your actions and how others perceive you, so in the end, rage is against oneself. It's like in the story of Snow White. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqmIMvWnIV8 She thought the mirror would tell her she was the fairest, but it didn't, so it causes her a narc injury and rage, where she tries to poison Snow White. It's not really anger, because it is not SW's fault. She is not the cause of her not being fair, just the fairest, so it is envy and jealousy that drives her, not pure anger. It's her own sense of superiority that is in danger, her own self-image. So it looks more like self-hatred projected out on others. But that is the whole consumed thing. Just the narc injury could cause suppressed anger too, but it's not rage itself. In other words, it does not always cause rage, but in the narcissist it will. And I suppose in theory the right use of the word is when a narcissist is injured, it is narcissist injury, but it's a bit of a circular definition that does not tell much if you don't know what those type of injuries are. I am not sure if I should relate to Snowhite or the Queen in this story. I can understand envy and jealousy, if a person finds a way to overcome it. But not at all a pleasant feeling (speaking from experience). What I'm trying to say is - I'm questioning whether narcisisstic injury should always have such a negative connotation, injuries are to be treated and healed I guess. You should. Yes, it is better to focus on acts than the person if possible. But at least it should be the bad act itself. Like for example a thief. It's the act of stealing that is the problem. Calling the person a thief might be legit. But if you don't like the thief and then call them a racist, it then makes no sense. Or in the case of Snow White, she did nothing, she just happens to exist, so it is a great example. The Queen should focus on being fairer, or just drop the competition she cannot win. In fairy tales, it's very much possible the archetypes did nothing wrong. In real life, also possible I guess, though I think it's reasonable to take at least 20% of the fault even if I've done nothing wrong (consciously). Not saying other people should do the same. The queen should probably look into the underlying motivation of her needing to be the fairest. Yes, he is the good narcissist, but even then he can't fool all people all of the time. It causes him trouble, and in this case, a kind of trouble akin to a natural disaster like floods of famine. In his mind, it is the same, for a lot of people, it is an incompetent that is over his head and is grandiose. It also shows another thing about the narc injury, it is an existential threat subjectively speaking. Either the image is restored, or the whole thing breaks down. That is why the rage or the violence can be extreme. Just like the Queen, she has to get rid of Snow White, her existence threatens her own because all of her existence is invested in her image of being the fairer. If she is not the fairer, she ceases to exist. I am not sure how to understand the term good narcissist, something like covert/vulnerable narcissist I assume. I don't know where the difference lies between being human and making mistakes, and then being either a covert or overt narcissist. If I try, I can find some narcissistic traits in almost everyone I enounter, which sucks because I started doubting the DSM criteria and the psychology in general. If we're all narcissistic, then nobody is. Yes. Well someone that is in good faith and has principle, if they make a mistake, will recognize it. If they are in bad faith, they will know they got discovered and will lash out and will call the cops. It's a narc injury for an undercover agent. His real goal was to bust you all along, so talking about it just alerted the Man. Not completely sure how to understand the term in good/bad faith, but I think I got the core of it, what you wrote makes sense when I apply it to various situations I've experienced in my life, taking the responsibility is not what always happens in any kind of relationship with a non-narcissist, but it never happens with a narcissist. It takes a mature personality to take responsibility. Depends. I was just watching a documentary on Hitler's henchmen. Goebbels was a bit of the typical fragile narcissist. They portray him as having that narc injury, which happens to be a real one, his leg that was not good. So it is a constant humiliation for him, and he seeks to overcompensate and attach himself to a more grandiose figure from which he seeks constant attention, plus he sends his rage on others, in that case mostly the Jews but also other cripples at first, which he wanted to exterminate. I don't think you could call it mature, but as the Minister of Propaganda, he was doing movies, doing talks and so on. He also burned books that disagreed with his own. I was watching/reading a lot of interviews by Putin these days, not sure how to understand his need to get rid of the \"nazis\". Projection perhaps. Or a conscious propaganda. Or being severly misinformed. The question is more whether psychology does anything. I know for Catholicism, there is the sacrament of penance that does the trick, because basically you end up forgiving yourself, and are forgiven by the world at large. So it is designed for that. Otherwise I am not sure. Shamans had kind of animal quests, which also does some of that, especially when it is communal in structure. Mostly it happens in family structure and grooming more generally. It reinforces the good identity and allow the bad to be evacuated through sadness. I had a phase in which shamanism seemed like the way to follow, and religion/spirituality/mysticism in general, not sure what to make of it these days but it still helps with all kinds of fears I think. Forgiving oneself as a form of therapy makes (a partial) sense. Yes, there is that archetype going around, and I am sure it exists. But more often than not, I think it is a kind of living their narcissism, like Goebbels. I am watching the sci-fi serie Farscape right now, and the personality of Zhaan is the wounded healer. She does not write books or do speeches though, she attends people individually no matter who they are, and I think it is the main difference here. She deals with real people, while the Goebbels type deals in ideology and archetypes. I am wondering if this might have something to do with being an intuitive vs. sensing type (MBTI). Well, I was, I don't know about the other guy. I suppose he was not. The point is that it could not be about me, because he didn't know me at all. Sometimes it is less clear, but the idea that some people invest in some ideas and take it personally when it is attacked is a sound one. It's especially the case in personality cults. If you criticize the dear leader, you can expect a lot of resistance, and it has nothing to do with you or the person resisting. They simply have invested their self in the other. But it can be about ideas too, and many other things, that was what I was pointing to. I had situations where a person reminded me of someone I've known for a long(-er) time and so my attitude towards this person was (either positively or negatively) influenced by the person they remind me of, not sure if that can also be the part of the answer here. Well, I would say it is an ego injury at that point. Whether it is a narc injury has to do with the lack of defense mechanism against it, plus seeing it as an existential threat. Then it starts looking at a narcissist injury, and it is even more the case if it is about envy, then you know for sure. So Goebbels was jealous of people that had good legs for example, or the Queen was about one person being fairer. So that's the complete archetype, but there are many steps along the way to get there. Like I don't think Trudeau is envious of the truckers, but I still think it qualifies because of the lack of defense mechanism, and ability to communicate properly. He could be envious of others though, like Trump or Xi Jinping , but I can't read his mind. But given his overall personality, I would say it is. In other words, there are gray areas, and no, it is not just any disproportionate reaction. Some people are just explosive in their very nature for instance, or you might truly hate something for subjectively good reasons. The big tell tale is the existential threat I believe. Rambo might kill all the commies because they killed his new girlfriend, but they aren't an existential threat per say, although it kind of plays close to narcissism. It's more obvious in the first movie, where now the police is portrayed as an existential threat to his freedom, and that looks more like narcissistic rage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtWHgkNH5yU That and some PTSD thrown in, but for the viewer, it looks more like rage. The cops outside and the whole society are the existential threat, so the war never ends. Example of Rambo confused me as the existential threat seems real. I understood the definition of narcissistic rage in this paragraph as a reaction to perceived existential threat. And maybe slightly off-topic, but can't help wondering why Trudeau would be jealous of Trump or Xi Jinping. As for what is healthy, it's just that there isn't a real universal definition, it's a thing you know when you don't have it, just like national identity. You can tell Rambo has some issues, or the Queen, and this and that. You could avoid their trap and still have other issues, and some people might have their issues and still do fine overall. Just the same, you can tell Chinese food is not American, even if you don't know what an American is and what it eats. I think we can tell Rambo and The Queen had some issues because they've pushed it to extreme.. It's best to deal with problems as they happen and in a restricted way to the problem itself. This way your sense of self is not affected, because it's just one issue, not an existential threat. Sounds like a wise tactic, but not sure if it's possible to always separate the two. Depends on the issue I guess.", "hash": "24d28fcb91ff699fe6c444a009e81898bb4e3f300b2f93de371ddf0c6d3db24c"}

Your profile isn't very narcissistic really. Being right or kind gives you intrinsic self worth. You aren't using anyone or requiring a win over someone or needing anyone to value you. Check out OCPD. Addx has identified with your story and he has more going on with OCPD. Life doesn't always reward who is right or kind. That sense of injustice might rile you. Envy is about wanting the success of someone else that you feel you deserve. You might think the people who are kind are deserving. Adopting a moral code gives one a sense of certainty that they are doing the right thing. You have organized your life around this principle of kindness so you feel more in control and more content.

I've heard people talk about a discard in Narcissism before, so I wondered if this would shed any light on: A cognitive process where people are literally discarded in terms of worth. As follows; An individual has a strong overriding schema, and another individual tries to contravene a law in that schema. The other individual has also tried to insult the first person's Agency. Because those two things happen the individual diverts the idea containing the rights of those individuals in line with the overriding schema. The individuals are worthless and do not deserve because they have contradicted the overriding schema. It feels like some sort of discard to the individual. Worth drops out, those individuals have no worth, they are literally valueless. (As living beings) The overtone for the reaction to the schema as a whole is Persons who contravene against the individual's Right (The Law) are in the wrong / they must be prevented and severely harmed. It could also be applied to people \"shutting the door on other people\" if worth is the motivator? I don't know what could shed light on anything in here or make more sense of the concept.

I thought NPD was primarily a label for disorders of self (and subtypes of)? It's both, just like any personality disorder. The naming says it. Personality has to do with a construction of the self, and the disorder part is social. The discard is mostly social, or at least it is the easier to spot, and what people usually talk about. But it can happen with objects, jobs and so on as well, thus why I gave the toy comparison. The process of idealization and devaluation can happen in everything. It can also happen in the self image as well, political stances, etc. But if someone does it, nobody will see it, so it does not really bother anybody. So while personality disorders may create internal problems to the person, nobody cares until it affects them. So in that sense, the diagnosis are mostly interpersonal. user1357911 wrote: Having re-read through the part of the book I was looking at, it does say \"need for admiration\".

Of course they can go together. user1357911 wrote: I expected the discard to be something to do with false/true self or with disorder of self? It does. Idealization is basically the false self. The feature of narcissism, is to identify with the idealization, it's what makes it different than most people if pathological. Most people will idealize, but they keep a kind of secret sense of self. They know they are really different than their social image. So they play roles in public, and another one in private. The narcissist is always the same role at a conscious level. What it leads to in the long run is a denying of the self, the true motives, the true desires, etc. Everything gets subordinate to the image, or the false self. It's also why there is a need for admiration. Since the self image is idealized, then others are expected to see the same thing, otherwise the relationship breaks down. One common example, are people that want to be called \"doctor\" or \"professor\". This is an idealized self and is also a social role. A normal person knows it is just a job, and the status is not the total self, so when they deal with other people, family, friends and so on, or outside their field of expertise, they know they are not that role anymore, that they are equal. But some people think that image, that role, is their whole self, they are invested entirely in it, and they want everybody to acknowledge it as such, and with the same reverence they have towards it. That attitude transposes everywhere and they stop being able to interact simply as human beings on an equal level, so in other words, they seek admiration in all things, even if it does not relate to that status. It's delusional grandiosity. user1357911 wrote: What is rigid, I mean there are only absolutes, if someone steals something from you they take it, or if they are rude to you they have neglected your personal agency. However I wonder if I missed the meaning. I don't think it's an overly rigid ethical stance, but it might be a rigid pattern of behaviour. It's just that to have functioning relationships, you have to be able to give some and forget some. You have to allow for mistakes, or to some divergence of opinions. Someone overly rigid would not accept mistakes or would not accept differences of opinions. It also depends on how close the person is. So yes, in theory the \"stance\" might be fine, but the real issue is whether it is a deal breaker type of thing. If it causes relationship breakdowns more than the normal. Someone might cheat on you, and obviously it is not rigid to say it is bad, but the question is what are you going to do about it? to you denounce it and move on? do you think it is a deal breaker and have to close down all relationship with the other? That is where there is no absolute, it really depends on the individuals involved. Some parents will reject their children if they do bad things, don't live up to their expectations, so they put their principles above everything, but some, probably most, will accept everything in the end. They may not like it, but they will accept it. So someone too rigid, would be the first type, and then again, it would be on small things. Small details, when someone is a little imperfect, or make a mistake. I do think it can happen in narcissism, but the overall thing is broader, it is not primarily that, because if you say it like this, you miss the role of the image, that is quite crucial. There are plenty of people that are too rigid, and they aren't narcissists at all. But when a narcissist would do it, it would be for other reasons. Not for moral reasons, but because the self-image is threatened. They will try an pass it as moral though for sure. They won't say straight up it is not like me, so I reject it, they will find more general reasons, moral reasons, but the reality is different. In the myth of Narcissus, N. meets Echo, and everything goes well, as long as she repeats what he says. She has to mirror him, and essentially be him, and reflect well on him. It's the image, the false self. When Echo shows herself as an individual, as \"different\", once the delusion is broken, it is when N. discards her. And it is a discard like throwing away something bad. He does not try to talk or interact or anything. It is a brutal and immediate rejection, just based on the fact she is not him. The myth is the basis of the narcissist construct. It's delusional because he thinks he is essentially talking to himself, so he ends up being condemned in doing just that, and admire himself in a pond. user1357911 wrote: Isn't that again, codependancy or narcissism where external supply to an idea is needed to help maintain a false self (vulnerable narcissism,) rather than Primary Narcissism, where the meaning of ego as \"fragile\" takes on a completely different psychological explanation?

I think the primary narcissist has the same need, it just plays out differently. It's why I talked about master/slave. The master is not \"independent\" of the slave anymore than the other way around, it's just that the other becomes and extension of the self, so the idealization is not internal, but external. It is about shaping others in your image. If the object resists or shows itself to not be suitable, then it is thrown out, discarded. And by object, I mean people too, primarily. It's still a porous boundary, because two people become one. When the object shows independence, it is not part of the idealized self, and therefore must be cut out. It kind of threatens the self in that way. If you see yourself as a leader, let's say, and it's a narcissist thing, then you will lead always in everything everywhere, and if people don't follow, it is a threat to authority, to the leadership, and needs to be cut out, discarded. That is why in the definition, exploitative behavior is there. It's exploiting people for your own gain and self, not for their own good. And the reason for that is porous boundaries, not being able to tell which is mine, and which is others. It's true that the ideal might be stronger and usually more stable than for the slave, others are not necessary to create it, but there is still a need for validation and admiration. Independent people don't need those type of validations all the time, they are secure in their self, and don't need everybody to accept it. 1PolarBear wrote: I would say it is more obsessive-compulsive type of personality if it is pathological. Rigid idealizations of moral standard?[/quote] Right. The idea of purity, etc. Everybody has to follow the rules, and no exception allowed. It's more of an obsessive-compulsive thing. The thing is that both kind of rejoin together in that it is based on superstition, but the object of worship is different. For one it is the law, but for the narcissist it is the self. Of course, sometimes you get both together. One narcissist might be an enforcer of the law, and avenger. So it gets hard to differentiate in those cases, so the boundary thing to me is more meaningful. It's why I thought your definition was lacking, it does not differentiate well between the two. In practice it is fairly easy to distinguish though. The obsessive-compulsive is coherent with himself and is the first one to apply what it preaches because it is based on a true belief that by doing the right thing, good things will happen. It may create a pathology where nobody is good enough for the standards and some sort of culling the chaff too readily. If you are dealing with a narcissist though, it is usually a rule for thee, and one for me. They don't follow their own rule, thus the delusion of grandeur. And it's because there is no true self, it's all in the image and what others reflect on you. 1PolarBear wrote: To be fair that sounds like the sort of thing the person thinking it would have said about it a year ago. \"It's just simple justice\". But it is a discard because in the action the person is literally discarded - not meaning to say it has anything to do with the cycle you explained using Trump. Well yes, it is discard strictly speaking, just not the narcissist type. What happens a lot in those relationships, is that the person gets discarded, but they don't really know why. It just comes suddenly, and they are left to try and figure it out. Like \"did I do something wrong?\", or \"what could I have done to fix thing?\". One day the person is nice, and the other a stranger. If you do something wrong, and there are good boundaries, you know what was wrong, because there was communication. But if the communication is lacking, because you are supposed to be the same as the other and read their mind, then it is a lot harder to tell if not impossible. It could be anything, but really it is just being different. Showing some independence. Sometimes people will say it is like walking on eggshells. So just the fact you exist, there is the risk of some sort of an outburst, and eventual discard. Of course you won't know, because there is no clear boundary. The discard is not even sure to happen. It might or might not. There is also a game where the narcissist tries to \"reconquer\", so sometimes there is a discard, but then the mere fact the person is now independent will trigger the opposite effect, because the need to control that person is too strong, or there is some jealousy that someone might get the goods. Now, if someone was truly doing it based on some boundaries and rule, that type of behavior does not happen. The rules are known and the discard is final. Just like being condemned for a crime. The laws are known, and the punishment is final. So if there is a discard, you would expect it to be final, or last quite awhile at least. Not some push and pull type of thing, or being threatened for existing. 1PolarBear wrote: Interesting comment on boundaries, again I thought poor boundaries was a subtype issue? (Interpersonality again) Poor boundaries were most commonly associated with codependancy? Although what you have to say about strong interpersonal boundaries is true. There is no codependancy.. Well, it is my opinion, maybe others see things differently. You have to realize that in today's society, people see masters are free people. I just don't see it that way, and lots of thinkers in the past didn't either. It just got lost. So I am not surprised, that they would think this way. I just don't think it is accurate. You would have to give me some links to see by myself what those people are saying. I do think that usually, what people talk about the vulnerable type usually have poorer boundaries, than the other, but the other isn't healthy either. Maybe they confuse boundaries with sense of self too. Of course someone with a poor sense of self will show really poor boundaries in an obvious manner, but it does not mean the reverse is true. You can have a strong sense of self and still have poor boundaries if you don't respect other people's boundaries. It's like a sociopath, they have poor boundaries, but their sense of self is usually just fine. If you steal from someone, it is poor boundaries in my mind, it's the whole point of having boundaries. Now they might have personal good ones, meaning they like to steal, but don't like being stolen. That's what I mean by porous boundaries. And that is what usually happens in the primary narcissist, the one of the DSM. They exploit, so it is poor boundaries pretty much by definition in my opinion. Now there is some other type of poor that is more like none. Can't remember the name, but it's like someone with no identity. Identity diffusion I think. That is closer to borderline pd, and also the vulnerable type of narcissist (some of them). Very often people confuse the two, because they overlap a fair bit. I say that from the people here trying to autodiagnose. And really it is hard to tell from the outside too. So maybe it is what they meant. You have to remember narcissism is a common thing in everybody, it's just not pathological in everybody. So it's not a monster thing that only happen to a few. It's more a degree of adaptability and pervasiveness, which is quite subjective. 1PolarBear wrote: I'm trying to look at the individual psychological processes.

I agree it is possible that it happens. It is common in academia these days. People get a value, they identify with it, it becomes their god of sort, then they try and apply it everywhere without even trying to do it themselves, or actually doing the opposite without realizing, or thinking it is not the same because they are good, while the others are bad. It's a common narcissistic projection. You can look at Melanie Klein, she attributes every stereotypes to some narcissistic projection and black and white thinking. The good object, the self-image, has to be expulsed out of the self, and this is done by blaming others for it. So you idealize others into bad. It's not a discard though in the sense I understand it, because usually there is no real relationship to start with. Maybe that is where the difference is. What I understand by discard is basically the person is in a relationship, then suddenly they aren't. It is the silent treatment. It's how it is usually used here, or was when there was people in the forum. It's about suddenly being treated like trash after a love bombing.

Yes, so its where the individual idealizes a certain idea and cannot accept that that is not how they are behaving; the idea is their true self, presumably assuming in some way the ideal is grandiose? (somehow the idealized traits make the person better for some reason rather than just viewing the traits on a neutral level - false self because the ego cannot cohese with the idea of true self? If people without narcissism put on an act socially, that isn't really idealization is it? Isn't that just an act? 1PolarBear wrote: The narcissist is always the same role at a conscious level. What it leads to in the long run is a denying of the self, the true motives, the true desires, etc. Everything gets subordinate to the image, or the false self. It's also why there is a need for admiration. Since the self image is idealized, then others are expected to see the same thing, otherwise the relationship breaks down. Isn't it the underlying idealization, importance placed on the idea of the traits and the underlying schema which lead to denial of the self, (actual actions, true motives, true desires etc.?) So somehow the false self (idealized image you explained) ends up in the lead because intent is in the lead and intent is driven by comprehension? I don't know about the need for admiration although I comprehend what you're explaining. Outside of the criteria, an individual could have a completely false self in relation to their own behaviour and go on to rationalize people's reactions instead of needing others to see the same thing to support that ego perspective. (the support to the schema could be internal, denial, rationalization, etc.) Having said it sounds like you explained the false self or image as being a driving factor and not a rationalization, perhaps that is the difference between the two concepts? (Not sure at the moment.) 1PolarBear wrote: One common example, are people that want to be called \"doctor\" or \"professor\". This is an idealized self and is also a social role. A normal person knows it is just a job, and the status is not the total self, so when they deal with other people, family, friends and so on, or outside their field of expertise, they know they are not that role anymore, that they are equal. But some people think that image, that role, is their whole self, they are invested entirely in it, and they want everybody to acknowledge it as such, and with the same reverence they have towards it. Because the individual genuinely believes \"Dr\" has worth attached to it and therefore makes the person better or genuinely superior. Therefore for example if there were cases of the opposite, if the person was not a doctor, they might try to rationalize that they could have been, or even go as far as to pretend to be one.? The two things seem different, that was what I wondered about the need for admiration. However isn't Dr just a job if you are healthy? - and even someone who finds it superior would still not put on an act about their role as a doctor? 1PolarBear wrote: That attitude transposes everywhere and they stop being able to interact simply as human beings on an equal level, so in other words, they seek admiration in all things, even if it does not relate to that status. It's delusional grandiosity. Yes that makes sense with extreme narcissism as an idea. 1PolarBear wrote: It's just that to have functioning relationships, you have to be able to give some and forget some. You have to allow for mistakes, or to some divergence of opinions. Someone overly rigid would not accept mistakes or would not accept differences of opinions. It also depends on how close the person is. So yes, in theory the \"stance\" might be fine, but the real issue is whether it is a deal breaker type of thing. If it causes relationship breakdowns more than the normal. Someone might cheat on you, and obviously it is not rigid to say it is bad, but the question is what are you going to do about it? to you denounce it and move on? do you think it is a deal breaker and have to close down all relationship with the other? That is where there is no absolute, it really depends on the individuals involved. Some parents will reject their children if they do bad things, don't live up to their expectations, so they put their principles above everything, but some, probably most, will accept everything in the end. They may not like it, but they will accept it. So someone too rigid, would be the first type, and then again, it would be on small things. Small details, when someone is a little imperfect, or make a mistake. On the other hand the person might say being monogamous is a deal breaker because it is not what both people want. If the person has a decision they also have a quality, each genuine decision a person values presumably indicates something about them. I think the idea I posted is more that the person sees red and uses a black and white - not a social discard - more like \"you have done this now you have to die.\" (This could obviously lead to the breakdown of relationships if it were ever to occur between friends.) Rigidity is more that the response set might be seen to be a rigid (unchangeable) response. Because it is not social, it is not about friendship or lack of. 1PolarBear wrote: I do think it can happen in narcissism, but the overall thing is broader, it is not primarily that, because if you say it like this, you miss the role of the image, that is quite crucial. There are plenty of people that are too rigid, and they aren't narcissists at all. But when a narcissist would do it, it would be for other reasons Yes exactly; if the person is deluded into thinking they are moral when they are anything but, through all sorts of denial, rationalization and reversed calculations (information which literally disappears when it hits a conflicting schema) they may apply the same standard to others, so the idealized self is the operating schema or linked to the operating schema at least. - unless the moral self is a true self, (the person would be lucid enough to want to be that way but also not want to.) Apologies, this part is going off on a tangent and is unclear. 1PolarBear wrote: In the myth of Narcissus, N. meets Echo, and everything goes well, as long as she repeats what he says. She has to mirror him, and essentially be him, and reflect well on him. It's the image, the false self. When Echo shows herself as an individual, as \"different\", once the delusion is broken, it is when N. discards her. And it is a discard like throwing away something bad. He does not try to talk or interact or anything. It is a brutal and immediate rejection, just based on the fact she is not him. The myth is the basis of the narcissist construct. It's delusional because he thinks he is essentially talking to himself, so he ends up being condemned in doing just that, and admire himself in a pond. Yes I came across that idea once of a person needing a mirror but don't know a lot about it. Having said, I can see how acting like someone with a false self and reflecting badly on that person would draw attention to the denied items - presumably in the more general sense it depends if there is anything the individual needs to deny or if there is a second rationalization behind the false self, whether the false self would give way to the second rationalization or whether the individual would suffer/self judge. 1PolarBear wrote: I think the primary narcissist has the same need, it just plays out differently. It's why I talked about master/slave. The master is not \"independent\" of the slave anymore than the other way around, it's just that the other becomes and extension of the self, so the idealization is not internal, but external. It is about shaping others in your image. If the object resists or shows itself to not be suitable, then it is thrown out, discarded. And by object, I mean people too, primarily. It's still a porous boundary, because two people become one. When the object shows independence, it is not part of the idealized self, and therefore must be cut out. It kind of threatens the self in that way. If you see yourself as a leader, let's say, and it's a narcissist thing, then you will lead always in everything everywhere, and if people don't follow, it is a threat to authority, to the leadership, and needs to be cut out, discarded. That is why in the definition, exploitative behavior is there. It's exploiting people for your own gain and self, not for their own good. And the reason for that is porous boundaries, not being able to tell which is mine, and which is others. It's true that the ideal might be stronger and usually more stable than for the slave, others are not necessary to create it, but there is still a need for validation and admiration. Independent people don't need those type of validations all the time, they are secure in their self, and don't need everybody to accept it. That was interesting to read; I'm only familiar with that in a person's theory of mind soft concept for emotion interrelational comprehension, or in their Agency. (rather than as a role which plays out) Can only imagine shaping others in a person's image as a contravention when it comes to what I was thinking of. i.e. the individual would not believe it was correct on all levels. It is as if there is a way of people being afforded different roles specifically - although that happens frequently in the example I gave I can only imagine a person lacking worth, not having a specific role e.g. a mirror. It was interesting to read but at this stage without doing more reading etc. I think I don't understand the topic fully yet. 1PolarBear wrote: Right. The idea of purity, etc. Everybody has to follow the rules, and no exception allowed. It's more of an obsessive-compulsive thing. The thing is that both kind of rejoin together in that it is based on superstition, but the object of worship is different. Cult leaders as an example? Would that make someone like Hitler obsessive compulsive? (massive cult type ideations where everyone has to follow the rules about the Jew? -Assuming he believes he is correct and is skewing the concept from morality so he views himself as a highly moral person? 1PolarBear wrote: For one it is the law, but for the narcissist it is the self. Of course, sometimes you get both together. One narcissist might be an enforcer of the law, and avenger. So it gets hard to differentiate in those cases, so the boundary thing to me is more meaningful. It's why I thought your definition was lacking, it does not differentiate well between the two. In practice it is fairly easy to distinguish though. 1PolarBear wrote: The obsessive-compulsive is coherent with himself and is the first one to apply what it preaches because it is based on a true belief that by doing the right thing, good things will happen. It may create a pathology where nobody is good enough for the standards and some sort of culling the chaff too readily. So the idea I was thinking of sounds more like a trait similar to the obsessive compulsive plastered onto the top or interwoven with a disorder of ego/self with a different issue underneath, hence why the discard example does not look like NPD perhaps, despite being a discard. 1PolarBear wrote: If you are dealing with a narcissist though, it is usually a rule for thee, and one for me. They don't follow their own rule, thus the delusion of grandeur. And it's because there is no true self, it's all in the image and what others reflect on you. Or perhaps not because the same would happen in the example I gave, although it does not contain a need for admiration. Presumably that would be because it would be a \"disorder of self or ego\". It sounds like a cross between the two reaction types. 1PolarBear wrote: What happens a lot in those relationships, is that the person gets discarded, but they don't really know why. It just comes suddenly, and they are left to try and figure it out. Like \"did I do something wrong?\", or \"what could I have done to fix thing?\". One day the person is nice, and the other a stranger. If you do something wrong, and there are good boundaries, you know what was wrong, because there was communication. But if the communication is lacking, because you are supposed to be the same as the other and read their mind, then it is a lot harder to tell if not impossible. It could be anything, but really it is just being different. Showing some independence. Sometimes people will say it is like walking on eggshells. So just the fact you exist, there is the risk of some sort of an outburst, and eventual discard. Of course you won't know, because there is no clear boundary. The discard is not even sure to happen. It might or might not. There is also a game where the narcissist tries to \"reconquer\", so sometimes there is a discard, but then the mere fact the person is now independent will trigger the opposite effect, because the need to control that person is too strong, or there is some jealousy that someone might get the goods. Now, if someone was truly doing it based on some boundaries and rule, that type of behavior does not happen. The rules are known and the discard is final. Just like being condemned for a crime. The laws are known, and the punishment is final. So if there is a discard, you would expect it to be final, or last quite awhile at least. Not some push and pull type of thing, or being threatened for existing. Yes that makes perfect sense, the first half would occur and if any discard the discard would not involve going back looking for the person, unless for example the person changed the action and trait which caused the discard. - As you said just like being condemned for a crime. 1PolarBear wrote: Well, it is my opinion, maybe others see things differently. You have to realize that in today's society, people see masters are free people. I just don't see it that way, and lots of thinkers in the past didn't either. It just got lost. So I am not surprised, that they would think this way. I just don't think it is accurate. You would have to give me some links to see by myself what those people are saying. I do think that usually, what people talk about the vulnerable type usually have poorer boundaries, than the other, but the other isn't healthy either. Maybe they confuse boundaries with sense of self too. Of course someone with a poor sense of self will show really poor boundaries in an obvious manner, but it does not mean the reverse is true. You can have a strong sense of self and still have poor boundaries if you don't respect other people's boundaries. It's like a sociopath, they have poor boundaries, but their sense of self is usually just fine. If you steal from someone, it is poor boundaries in my mind, it's the whole point of having boundaries. Now they might have personal good ones, meaning they like to steal, but don't like being stolen. That's what I mean by porous boundaries. And that is what usually happens in the primary narcissist, the one of the DSM. They exploit, so it is poor boundaries pretty much by definition in my opinion. That part of the definition slipped my mind. Then if you would regard someone stealing or cheating on a partner as having poor boundaries, but this is presumably a different sort of boundary i.e. could be \"you are my property/an object/an extension of me\" in Agency rather than codependency as I imagined it in an idealization and discard.? When I talked about boundaries before, I was thinking about things which were strictly codependency, stealing would mean a boundary is being breached but would not imply codependency? 1PolarBear wrote: Now there is some other type of poor that is more like none. Can't remember the name, but it's like someone with no identity. Identity diffusion I think. That is closer to borderline pd, and also the vulnerable type of narcissist (some of them). Very often people confuse the two, because they overlap a fair bit. I say that from the people here trying to autodiagnose. And really it is hard to tell from the outside too. So maybe it is what they meant. You have to remember narcissism is a common thing in everybody, it's just not pathological in everybody. So it's not a monster thing that only happen to a few. It's more a degree of adaptability and pervasiveness, which is quite subjective. Yes I noticed the similarities to borderline PD in the quote above as well. I was pretty sure its possible to not have narcissism, to simply have an idea of Theory of Mind, other, and a knowledge of self? Is it really normal as such rather than more common that it ought to seem to be? I am not surprised at people trying to autodiagnose though, psychiatry and psychology is very expensive and people here in the UK don't generally get a looking when it comes to psychology (or at least from what I've seen.) - and PD presumably requires a lot of psychology to diagnose. It seems the doctors go straight for axis 1 diagnoses unless its EUPD at the moment. 1PolarBear wrote: You'd have to provide links or something. I am not saying it is wrong, just maybe not going to the essence of the process. I've been reading Personality, Personality Disorder and Violence. (Mary McMurran, Richard Howard.) Its not an online link its printed only as far as I know. Some of it has sunk in and some of it has so far gone in one ear and out of the other. The example I gave is not from the book. 1PolarBear wrote: I agree it is possible that it happens. It is common in academia these days. People get a value, they identify with it, it becomes their god of sort, then they try and apply it everywhere without even trying to do it themselves, or actually doing the opposite without realizing, or thinking it is not the same because they are good, while the others are bad. It's a common narcissistic projection. You can look at Melanie Klein, she attributes every stereotypes to some narcissistic projection and black and white thinking. The good object, the self-image, has to be expulsed out of the self, and this is done by blaming others for it. So you idealize others into bad. It's not a discard though in the sense I understand it, because usually there is no real relationship to start with. That sounds like some sort of syndrome in itself... sometimes you'd just wonder if they're not thinking when they act? Expulsing something from the self, isn't that likely to be something particular that's been taken and applied from a disorder description? - But obviously not everyone would have that disorder. 1PolarBear wrote: Maybe that is where the difference is. What I understand by discard is basically the person is in a relationship, then suddenly they aren't. It is the silent treatment. It's how it is usually used here, or was when there was people in the forum. It's about suddenly being treated like trash after a love bombing. And it's the idealization/devaluation cycle. Yes I've seen it used that way in relationship discussion, but when I saw the psychological mechanism it made more sense that way when I read it. I found it makes a massive difference trying to piece apart the colloquial from what the psychologist is meant to know sometimes helps understand PD properly. (Psychological and psychiatric jargon uses words in completely different ways, so the descriptions written on the pages of clinical manuals are not meant to be read literally in plain English without psychiatric/psychological training. It makes them tricky to read without piecing apart what is actually meant. Yes its awfully quiet in here. I don't know if that is a bad thing though if perhaps no one needs the place? What the hell is a love bombing - there is probably a definition link somewhere.", "hash": "8fc04e6f47651a08370046192200a7061d0d8f64f2d76b1da4c65619c11e0772"}

Is this a description of one? by 1PolarBear » Fri Jan 28, 2022 8:30 pm user1357911 wrote: I thought idealizations of things were stable in NPD and fluctuated in BPD? There is splitting in both constructs. BPD is rapid cycling. So yes, NPD is stable. Discard is not something that happens all the time, while if you are dealing with BPD it will happen pretty fast. If the image is not threatened, there won't be any, so you can end up with a stable relationship. Think about guru relationships, they can be stable as long as the devotee remains a devotee. But if they stop, then there is devaluation and usually destruction. Might be some attempts to regain the devotee too. One striking example of how it works is scientology. There is done willingly as part of the doctrine. The narcissist discard has been institutionalized. Most organized religions have the overall same idea. Like if you leave Islam, you are on a death sentence. In Christianity it is ostracism. It creates scapegoats too, which keeps others in line. But scientology stands out for its viciousness. user1357911 wrote: Yes true... relationships seem to be most common posts. But there is also a trend for that sort of culture so its hard to tell whether the number of interpretations through PD would be the same without? I am not saying it is the only one, but I assumed it's what you meant. Like I said, I think the phenomenon also applies to everything \"other\". There was a time when everything had some sort of value. If you had clothing, it was loved in a special way, so you would fix it if it broke. Now it is just easier to discard and create some new shiny toy, which does not last long usually. It's how consumerism creates a bunch of narcissist behaviors. Same goes with relationships in general. Why fix one when you can find another more exciting one through an app? If you add a devaluation of the object over the top, or a desire for destruction, then you have narcissist discard, imo. user1357911 wrote: I was thinking subtypes but for some reason I wrote traits, could also have a completely different name,e.g. gregarious or something? I tried to look but for some reason I could only find Millon. I wonder why all this stuff isn't on the boards as lists of relevant theories? Millon isn't exactly mainstream. It is as an introduction, but if you want psychological process, etiology and causality, he is not the go to guy, and it is what people look for the most. Categorization, not so much. Some people might auto-identify with subtypes here and there. I mean, the whole subtype thing is mostly a Millon thing and it's like taking ingredients and mixing them up. It might make different recipes, but not necessarily good ones. They lack practical usefulness. It's a good intro to the idea of spectrum and that type of thing, or to learn how to differentiate. It's mostly diagnosis focused, and people here can't diagnose. I don't know about gregariousness, I think most people with NPD are extroverted, at least the primary type. So they will tend to be people person for that reason, but it could be a limited one, like a \"safe group\" that actually feeds the image. Pathological narcissism can't really take criticism or even differing opinion. user1357911 wrote: Yes, so its where the individual idealizes a certain idea and cannot accept that that is not how they are behaving; the idea is their true self, presumably assuming in some way the ideal is grandiose? (somehow the idealized traits make the person better for some reason rather than just viewing the traits on a neutral level - false self because the ego cannot cohese with the idea of true self? I'll try and rephrase it differently. Usually in people there is a true self and a false self. That's the theory behind. You could say it is the private vs the social, or the superego vs the id. In a normally constituted person, both cohere in some way, but stay distinct. So there is a give and take between them. So people might have a social life up to a point, and keep a private part for themselves. Relationships will be graduated along that line as well, so people don't treat strangers the same they treat a friend. In terms of morality, people might find some compromise between following the perfect rules, and following their own desires. That's the normal, healthy way of creating an identity. So you are not all social, or all private, all moral, or all free. It's a mix, and people draw lines and boundaries between those things. The true self is the id, and the private. It's what you would be with total freedom, if you were omnipotent. The false self, are the self imposed limitations that people put on themselves and that are usually also enforced by society. Now the narcissist does not deal well with those compromises. It's an all or nothing thinking. Black and white thinking. Either you are this, or you are it's opposite. It's binary. So what happens is that the narcissist, being social, invests entirely in it's social image or in some morality stance: \"values\". Now, this is fairly common in all people. They take responsibility and they \"loose themselves\" in a false self. It's so common that it creates existential crisis in life, one commonly know as the midlife crisis, where someone reclaims their true self that was neglected, and it looks like a regression into childhood. Lot's of people's unhappiness comes from this, and it is what mostly Freud and his followers were trying to address. By looking at dreams, they would free the true self, the genuine desires that were repressed, and try to integrate it to the false self, and that would create a more complete individual, an \"integrated\" individual. So psychotherapy is about integration, to integrate those part of the self that are neglected but still there. In a narcissist personality, the false self is idealized so much so that the true self is denied, so there is an integration, but in the wrong manner because it denies reality. Reality being here the true desires, the true longings, but also the true capacity, the true morality, character, habits, etc. So everything is invested in the appearance of such, and this is what I mean by idealization. It's a kind of delusion. And because that false self is considered \"good\" absolutely, the goal is to play the part the most perfectly possible but not from some internal drive, but by some external drive. So you end up with moralities of the sort: \"you can do whatever you want, as long as it is not known\". But of course on the outside, everything has to be perfect, like a Potemkin village. The words and actions you do have to be perfect and no mistake allowed. But the reality behind is usually a mess and the opposite. Plus, the narcissist will denounce his own real flaws, his own true self, that he projects and assume in others, thus the splitting. Cheaters see cheats everywhere, and denounce it, which gives them some moral altitude. So the person ends up thinking they are gods of some sort, or at least it is the image they are selling. So normal people, they see that, and think the person is delusional and grandiose, which is true objectively. Not only what they pretend to be is impossible to attain, but claiming or suggesting they have reached it even worst. So the person acts like a god, perfect, and commanding. It's essentially arrogance, delusional pride. It's what the DSM more or less defines, or what people call primary narcissism. There is a pretty good interpretation of it in the movie \"American Psycho\" if you haven't seen it. As for what people call the vulnerable narcissist, Fight Club is pretty much a good take on it. Both are quite similar, but there are subtle differences. Like in Fight Club the guy is not grandiose himself, but he creates an imaginary friend that is, which turns out to be himself. But those are stereotypes, you can go down further and there are many other forms possible with the same basic personality structure. Delusional thinking is all part of them at base though. The narcissistic image is self-referential, so it cuts the person away from reality and others, and from themselves. And pathologically, the person is not self-aware, that's where it gets pretty bad. The person gets cut from their life force so to speak, and if the image crumbles due to reality, it can create a downward spin that is hard to fix. And it's usually more a question of time than if. user1357911 wrote: If people without narcissism put on an act socially, that isn't really idealization is it? Isn't that just an act? Yes, but the process is the same, it's just a matter of degree. Some people can act, and they know reality still, so it's fine. Might be a problem in the long run, but it's not pathological. They also are free not to act, which is important. It creates some balance. If you can only be your act, then it's pathological. That's why people say it is a spectrum. There is no clear cut categorization that can say this is good, and this is bad. It's got mostly to do with how it interferes with every day life and what the prospects are. But yes, it is idealization. The problem with idols is not that they are idols, it's when they take too much place and blind from reality. You can see it in normal day and political \"thought\". People will think in terms of \"left\" and \"right\", or some other binaries. Those are idealizations that have become idols, and depending on the part of the fence you are in, everything good you will attribute to your side, and everything bad to the other side. So that is splitting in action. It blinds from reality because those words are meaningless, just placeholders, and they resist strong attempt to define them, plus they shift all the time. So it's whatever people feel they are, their own emotions, good or bad. So it's the same here. A narcissist might have an idol of looking good, so it is what they will focus on, and want to be the best looking. Or the more logical, or the more this or that. There are plenty of idols, but here, look is subjective and vain, logic can is meaningless and can be garbage is badly used, etc. Every idealization has flaws, which is why usually black and white thinking inevitably leads to a loss of reality, and in the end, pure emotional drivel, but unassumed. Like its the best because I wear it, or it's logic because I thought it, and of course, all the others are inferior since they don't agree with it. It's idealization plus black and white thinking that is the problem, not just idealization itself, because everybody does it. Any word is an idealization. But one word can't explain all of reality or encapsulate all possible human experience. user1357911 wrote: Isn't it the underlying idealization, importance placed on the idea of the traits and the underlying schema which lead to denial of the self, (actual actions, true motives, true desires etc.?) So somehow the false self (idealized image you explained) ends up in the lead because intent is in the lead and intent is driven by comprehension? I think so yes. Although when it comes an idol, comprehension takes a second seat. I mean, comprehension of reality. It stops happening because you know everything already. You have those handful of values and idols, and you can explain everything and justify all your intents. It's even better when those idols are self-contradictory, then you truly are a god. Nobody can refute you ever, and you can justify every action. Government are starting to figure this thing out, and they also figured out people won't be able to tell. It's not even sure if they can, so perhaps they just lucked on the concept. user1357911 wrote: I don't know about the need for admiration although I comprehend what you're explaining. Outside of the criteria, an individual could have a completely false self in relation to their own behaviour and go on to rationalize people's reactions instead of needing others to see the same thing to support that ego perspective. (the support to the schema could be internal, denial, rationalization, etc.) Yes. Well the admiration is a byproduct, and it's mostly seen from the outside, but often there is an internal need for it as well. Really I think it is at base a desire for validation. But if you follow something that is good absolutely, and try to appear to follow it as well, then it is logical that you would want admiration, or expect people to realize your greatness. I mean the admiration is in the narcissist first, so he will not see why anybody else would think different, and his image is perfect, he embodies that image perfectly. So if others don't admire him, then it means they simply are jealous and failures, and since nobody's perfect, it is easy to see the flaw in others, which distract from self-awareness. When you are busy finding flaws in others, you don't attend to your own. That's what I mean by being totally invested in the false self. Like any personality disorder, it is self-reinforcing behavior, and there is no obvious way out. If the idol is good, and if you are the biggest believer, then there is no other way out. You have to keep promoting and ignoring flaws. Why wouldn't you? everything else is inferior. user1357911 wrote: Having said it sounds like you explained the false self or image as being a driving factor and not a rationalization, perhaps that is the difference between the two concepts? (Not sure at the moment.) Yes, it's the carrot that drives everything in terms of causality. I follow the old philosophical posture that people are driven by good things, not spending their whole life avoiding bad things. But yes, some people consider narcissism as defense mechanism. I think it's a bit too easy and does not explain anything. Here, I am even going to go further, I will say it is a narcissistic theory. Because how easy it is to accuse everybody of being \"defensive\"? I could easily say to everything you say that I disagree with that you are being defensive, and if you defend yourself that you are being defensive, then you just proved my point in proving you are defensive. So there is no way out of that mind sexual intercourse. You are always right, and others are always inferior, and they have to agree with everything you say. And behind it of course, would be some idol, like being transparent, or genuine, or authentic, and so on. I am a free person, I don't ever defend myself, and I have no boundary, I am a person of the world, I am everything, I am one with the world in some symbiotic state and things that are different, are having defense mechanism, which is bad and needs to be condemned. You could have the same pattern with \"rationalization\". People that give reasons are defensive, and are hiding their true motives. They are unconscious of their true selves, while the perfect self is totally free and authentic, with no need for reason or morality. Again, there is no need for boundaries which is what rationalization does, it creates division, and everybody that would rationalize them is different and therefore inferior to the true instinctual being that is one with the world and in harmony. All reason must be condemned because they fall short of the ideal. And of course, I am totally free of that flaw, I am a story in the making, totally in the flow, etc. Those two scripts are all based on one ideal, basically the idea of being open and authentic. It's the idol, and it is used to deflect any attempt to correct it, and you could quite easily spend your own life believing this, because who would say otherwise? if they did, they would show they aren't part of the ideal, and therefore not worth considering. They have to be shown the errors of their ways at best, or discarded. They are two examples of what i would consider a narcissist personality. They have that one ideal that explains everything and can't be countered except through common sense of a sort, but logic by itself won't cut it. You can see how easy that carrot can drive everything. Complete self-justification, perfect image worthy of admiration, etc. You can do whatever you want, and destroy anybody you want, so what's not to like? user1357911 wrote: Because the individual genuinely believes \"Dr\" has worth attached to it and therefore makes the person better or genuinely superior. Therefore for example if there were cases of the opposite, if the person was not a doctor, they might try to rationalize that they could have been, or even go as far as to pretend to be one.? The two things seem different, that was what I wondered about the need for admiration. However isn't Dr just a job if you are healthy? - and even someone who finds it superior would still not put on an act about their role as a doctor? Let's see, a normal doctor are yes, doctors in the day, and sure enough, they get deference, which is quite normal because they care about people, or at least they should. People that are sick and go a doctor, they are genuinely grateful if they get well and cared for. But that's a gift of sort, it is not \"due\" to being a doctor, it's just a normal thing that happens. But for some people, it comes with the title, so you have to be grateful because the person is a doctor, because they lower themselves to even consider you. So here's the difference. The good one, his goal is to cure and care for people. They don't do it for the status or to get something back. They are usually the ones that are the good ones, that will actually cure you. The bad ones, they are simply doing their job as a doctor, because it's who they are. They might cure you, or not, but they expect gratefulness, because they see the good doctors are revered, so they want that too, and since both are doctors, there is of course no reason why the other one would get love and not you. In fact, you should get more, because you are a better doctor, since you are the pure ideal of a doctor, with the white coat and all, good salary and so on. You spent all your life, and made lots of sacrifice to be there, so you are owned the same reverence. And then of course you have the grifters that call themselves doctors but aren't. Like a doctor in psychology that want to be treated like a medicine doctor. The word is the same, the merit is the same, so you want the same. Of course it does not work that way. It's a kind of delusion of grandeur. user1357911 wrote: I think the idea I posted is more that the person sees red and uses a black and white - not a social discard - more like \"you have done this now you have to die.\" (This could obviously lead to the breakdown of relationships if it were ever to occur between friends.) Rigidity is more that the response set might be seen to be a rigid (unchangeable) response. Because it is not social, it is not about friendship or lack of. Ok, I think I get what you meant. Basically it would be a sort of internal monologue. Anger is totally normal though. People get angry when someone else does bad things. If you want the person to die, then it's hatred. Again fairly normal reaction to badness, although hatred starts to come up in the idealization. Because now it is not the act itself that is the cause of the anger, but the person in its entirety. So yes, a case could be made it has something to do with a kind of narcissistic response. I mean, ultimately, it is like playing God, deciding who lives and who dies. But also, it is again about porous boundaries. Going from anger to hatred usually shows some boundary problems. Lack of differentiation between the act, that can be changed, or the person, that cannot be changed. So there was this guy that killed his wife because she kept putting the milk in front of the butter. The guy snapped and killed her. Probably he took it personally every time she did that and he thought she was doing it on purpose to spite him. Now I don't know if it is narcissism. Could be, or could be something else. He could have been paranoid or a puritan. All that I could say for sure is that he did not deal well with boundaries, either too rigid or not enough, and lacked justice because of the disproportionality of the act. On top of being illegal of course. There is just not enough data to tell the reason. It could be the upbringing too, if he was punished in the past for doing the same by parental figures, or it could be the other way, the parents always did that too and the killing was a way to free himself. I don't think I would put hatred necessarily in the narcissism construct on the face of it. But it happens. user1357911 wrote: Yes exactly; if the person is deluded into thinking they are moral when they are anything but, through all sorts of denial, rationalization and reversed calculations (information which literally disappears when it hits a conflicting schema) they may apply the same standard to others, so the idealized self is the operating schema or linked to the operating schema at least. - unless the moral self is a true self, (the person would be lucid enough to want to be that way but also not want to.) Apologies, this part is going off on a tangent and is unclear. Right, it could happen that way. The moral self is always part true, part false, it's a compromise. I mean, by it's essence, it is social. A man alone is never going to do things he does not want to do, out of some social consideration of good and evil. As soon as you start acting morally, there is some falsehood that creeps in. There is always the ideal, and the truth. Most people keep both fairly close together, but not always, due either to circumstances, feebleness in resolve, or just that sometimes you have to make hard choices between two bads. Well, I don't know if it is most people, but let's say healthy people. It's when you start thinking you are completely good that it gets deluded, and you become basically the false self, irrelevant of what you actually do. Almost inevitably it is justified by saying you have good intentions. So the deluded person always has good intentions, because they are a good person with good ideals, then whatever bad happens, you can't be blamed for it, nor the ideal itself. It's the joker card everybody uses. Yes, I may have bombed Hiroshima, but I had good intentions, not like those other people that bombed Pearl Harbor. user1357911 wrote: Cult leaders as an example? Would that make someone like Hitler obsessive compulsive? (massive cult type ideations where everyone has to follow the rules about the Jew? -Assuming he believes he is correct and is skewing the concept from morality so he views himself as a highly moral person? It's my opinion, yes. I think Hitler had that personality, but lots of cult leaders are narcissists, like Hubbard, that one is a classic. Mussolini in the same period clearly was as well. Basically the kind of super socialism where everybody has shiny shoes, is an obsessive compulsive ideation. But then again, it will also happen with narcissists, because they want people to be a perfect representation of themselves. So Hubbard, he thought he was a sailor and an admiral, so everybody had to dress like that in the \"org\". They became extension of himself, and those that failed were discarded, like his son who was homosexual. Or just all those that decided it was not for them. He was even making them sign their soul to him in a billion year contract, which justified whatever he would do to them afterwards. \"Consent\" right? So you see the desire for control, but it's all based around his personality. He did not like psychiatry for obvious reasons, so everybody have to not like it. It is the enemy of the religion and he tries to replace it with his own stuff. So then, all drugs are bad, and so on. It goes from there, but it's all based on one person's desires, himself. And it's based on a few ideals he has, the marine, being \"clear\", and a few others. Of course, he never was an admiral, was never clear and so on, but he presents himself that way, and people have to pretend, that not only he is an admiral, but the best of them, obviously. He is also the best writer, the best psychologist, savior of souls, etc. Whatever he pretends to be is the best, and everybody has to pretend it is true if you want to stay around. If not, you get discarded, harassed, destroyed financially, professionally, etc. Called a deviant. Basically the guy was a tyrant. Hitler I think was more of a perfectionist that wanted unity, he was not into building a personality cult. I haven't studied him much though, but it's the impression I get. Stalin was a narcissist big time. He basically became the Revolution, so whatever he did was the Revolution. user1357911 wrote: So the idea I was thinking of sounds more like a trait similar to the obsessive compulsive plastered onto the top or interwoven with a disorder of ego/self with a different issue underneath, hence why the discard example does not look like NPD perhaps, despite being a discard. It's what I think, or it's a possibility. It's more a question of what you can rule out or not. It can be many things, including narcissism. It could be normal too. I just did not see anything specifically based on narcissism in it. user1357911 wrote: That part of the definition slipped my mind. Then if you would regard someone stealing or cheating on a partner as having poor boundaries, but this is presumably a different sort of boundary i.e. could be \"you are my property/an object/an extension of me\" in Agency rather than codependency as I imagined it in an idealization and discard.? When I talked about boundaries before, I was thinking about things which were strictly codependency, stealing would mean a boundary is being breached but would not imply codependency? Well, if you think someone is your property, it is poor boundaries, unless you are in a place where slavery is legal, and that person is actually your slave because you bought them, and you have papers to prove it. Otherwise it is simply delusional. Right, stealing is poor boundaries that don't imply codependency or a relationship, at least not in the common sense of the terms, but if you think about it longer, the thief is in a relationship with others. He does need other people to steal, so he is also dependent on people allowing him to steal, or on people not being good enough to stop him. So in order to be a thief, he needs a whole system that allows it. He needs property, and property laws, and a whole bunch of things. He isn't independent, he is playing in a bigger game with set rules he can cheat on. And those rules are the boundaries, so he has poor boundaries and is in a relationship with society in general and the people he steals, and he needs them to be as they are. Keeping in the psychiatry realm, the antisocial construct has the notion of parasitic lifestyle. A parasite, in biology is an animal that needs others to survive, and it does not give anything of value in exchange. So it is dependent, and has poor boundaries, because it cannot give back, it is not independent and therefore cannot be just. Now, narcissism is not antisocial so it is not parasitic, but exploitative. So it gives back a minimum, but takes more than it gave. Just like Hubbard, he takes your whole soul for a billion years, and give you some self-improvement courses. user1357911 wrote: Yes I noticed the similarities to borderline PD in the quote above as well. I was pretty sure its possible to not have narcissism, to simply have an idea of Theory of Mind, other, and a knowledge of self? Is it really normal as such rather than more common that it ought to seem to be? Some people think it is part of normal development of the child, as language develop and experience is gained. It seems that way to me. Younger people don't know much, don't have too many tools, so if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, and getting idols is quite normal. Most people grow out of that phase, while some don't. What's not normal is not to grow out of it, to cling to omnipotent ideation or black and white thinking. There was a quote by Churchill. \"If you are young and not a progressive, you have no heart, and if you are old and not a conservative, you have no brain.\" It's because as you grow older, you acquire more tools, and more experience, so you can relate to others more readily, get a better theory of mind, and realized everybody before you were not such idiots after all, they simply knew things you didn't, or dealt with life situations you never had to deal with. So that's how people grow out of narcissism, by becoming independent, having to take decisions, taking responsibility, etc. user1357911 wrote: I am not surprised at people trying to autodiagnose though, psychiatry and psychology is very expensive and people here in the UK don't generally get a looking when it comes to psychology (or at least from what I've seen.) - and PD presumably requires a lot of psychology to diagnose. It seems the doctors go straight for axis 1 diagnoses unless its EUPD at the moment. Not necessarily, the tests are designed to be done in a session by a qualified psychiatrist. The reason people autodiagnose is mostly to find an identity, they aren't really interested in the pathological part, and since most of those personalities are vague and common, everybody can see whatever they want. So it either gives identity, justification or both. Or it can be used, which is even more common, in justifying rejection or failure in relationships. So people diagnose their partners. user1357911 wrote: I've been reading Personality, Personality Disorder and Violence. (Mary McMurran, Richard Howard.) Its not an online link its printed only as far as I know. Some of it has sunk in and some of it has so far gone in one ear and out of the other. The example I gave is not from the book. Ok, I see, it is in the context of violence. Like how to explain violence out of personality disorders because there are some correlations. I usually resist that type of approach, especially since the biggest correlation is with antisocial personality, and it's a chicken and egg problem. People get diagnosed because they are violent, then turn around and say that they are violent because of the personality. And in that context, narcissism is mostly seen through the psychopath, so it's an added feature that may help predict future behavior. But in that case, it is fairly simple. The ideation is actually about violence, so the person sees herself as violent. It becomes the false self and the personality, anything else being weak. It's also self-reinforcing, because any act of violence will show the strength and independence of the person at least in the ideal self. Doing violence therefore proves the others are weaker and that you are in control, which in turn justifies the violence, because it is what weak people are for, being victim. Not only that but in some case, it can be seen as altruistic, as in being tough forces the victim into responding and making them less of a victim. It makes the victim into the image of the psychopath, or it is discarded and dies out. It's about culling the weak to keep the strong. The weak will of course be blamed for being weak, thus blaming the victim. There can often be some other factors and ideations, but that's a common one. I already talked about being an avenger. Superheroes are pretty much psychopaths if you look at it objectively. But in this case, the weak is defended, or at least it is the justification. So there is some wrong going on, and someone needs to be saved, whether they like it or not, and it gives full justification to stop the evil and destroy it, beat them to a pulp with bare hands ideally, all that outside the confines of the law. Sometimes it is some other thing, based on some moral value, like pretty much all activism does. Animal rights activism especially, is full of very violent people who think it is fine to do violence on humans, because animals are the ideal here to be preserved. The nice little innocent animals. Of course it proves good intentions, and justifies violence. Now you could say it is after the fact justification. Perhaps, or perhaps they truly believe this too. It sure fools a lot of people. user1357911 wrote: That sounds like some sort of syndrome in itself... sometimes you'd just wonder if they're not thinking when they act? Expulsing something from the self, isn't that likely to be something particular that's been taken and applied from a disorder description? - But obviously not everyone would have that disorder. Well, just take the animal activists. They reject being carnivorous animals, because it exploits animals, give them possibly pain, is bad for the environment and so on. So instead of accepting you have eaten meat, have participated in exploiting animals, are able to give pain and are dirty, then you find a cause, and you project those things on others, which gives you the justification to do the same thing they do. It's just easier to do violence on animal killers than on some innocent people. I don't know if it is a syndrome, but for some people it passes as morality. If you can convince yourself some people are bad, reciprocity will justify them in doing bad things to them. So you paint black and then attack what you just painted, because you are white. There was some experiment, they took a bunch of people, divided them in two, and gave each group a flag of a different color. It did not take long they were attacking each others. They were sworn enemies. user1357911 wrote: Yes I've seen it used that way in relationship discussion, but when I saw the psychological mechanism it made more sense that way when I read it.

It's said of people acting in the beginning of a relationship. They idealize the other, and send a lot of love, and the other can do no wrong. So love bombing. Some people with poor boundaries will do that. They are all in for awhile, then it stops and the devaluation comes, and it adds up, until everything you do is wrong and your existence itself is an irritant. So love bombing is the all white phase which usually attract people to the narcissist, or psychopath, or whatever. They can do that because they don't care about the real person, the other is an idea. So they will tell you who you are, in flattering term, with lots of intensity.

But if they stop, then there is devaluation and usually destruction. Might be some attempts to regain the devotee too. One striking example of how it works is scientology. There is done willingly as part of the doctrine. The narcissist discard has been institutionalized. Most organized religions have the overall same idea. Like if you leave Islam, you are on a death sentence. In Christianity it is ostracism. It creates scapegoats too, which keeps others in line. But scientology stands out for its viciousness. Implying the discard is in fact deliberate not just the result of the schemas involved? The person finds their own decision to have the right to perform the discard? 1PolarBear wrote: I am not saying it is the only one, but I assumed it's what you meant. Like I said, I think the phenomenon also applies to everything \"other\". There was a time when everything had some sort of value. If you had clothing, it was loved in a special way, so you would fix it if it broke. Now it is just easier to discard and create some new shiny toy, which does not last long usually. It's how consumerism creates a bunch of narcissist behaviors. Same goes with relationships in general. Why fix one when you can find another more exciting one through an app? If you add a devaluation of the object over the top, or a desire for destruction, then you have narcissist discard, imo. However for this to be a discard your Theory of Mind would have to extend to Economic Value in line with the lives of others because otherwise the items cannot have worth. 1PolarBear wrote: Millon isn't exactly mainstream. It is as an introduction, but if you want psychological process, etiology and causality, he is not the go to guy, and it is what people look for the most. Categorization, not so much. Some people might auto-identify with subtypes here and there. I mean, the whole subtype thing is mostly a Millon thing and it's like taking ingredients and mixing them up. It might make different recipes, but not necessarily good ones. They lack practical usefulness. It's a good intro to the idea of spectrum and that type of thing, or to learn how to differentiate. It's mostly diagnosis focused, and people here can't diagnose. Yes, diagnosis without causality through psychological process doesn't seem of much use other than for those working in those fields although perhaps traits being highlighted could point people in the right directions. 1PolarBear wrote: I don't know about gregariousness, I think most people with NPD are extroverted, at least the primary type. So they will tend to be people person for that reason, but it could be a limited one, like a \"safe group\" that actually feeds the image. Pathological narcissism can't really take criticism or even differing opinion. 1PolarBear wrote: I'll try and rephrase it differently. Usually in people there is a true self and a false self. That's the theory behind. You could say it is the private vs the social, or the superego vs the id. In a normally constituted person, both cohere in some way, but stay distinct. So there is a give and take between them. So people might have a social life up to a point, and keep a private part for themselves. Relationships will be graduated along that line as well, so people don't treat strangers the same they treat a friend. In terms of morality, people might find some compromise between following the perfect rules, and following their own desires. That's the normal, healthy way of creating an identity. So you are not all social, or all private, all moral, or all free. It's a mix, and people draw lines and boundaries between those things. Yes, so the Id Ego and Superego are ways of describing/categorizing functional personality aspects, but would surely not be false self? As I understood, In a healthy person the superego only conflicts with the Id in internal debate (The superego is not a false self, it is more of the individual's social responsibility and conscience.) 1PolarBear wrote: The true self is the id, and the private. It's what you would be with total freedom, if you were omnipotent. The false self, are the self imposed limitations that people put on themselves and that are usually also enforced by society. (Or what you would be if you had no superego.) To need a false self, either society would need to be incorrect or the individual would need to feel or find them self constrained in some way. Now the narcissist does not deal well with those compromises. It's an all or nothing thinking. Black and white thinking. Either you are this, or you are it's opposite. It's binary. So what happens is that the narcissist, being social, invests entirely in it's social image or in some morality stance: \"values\". 1PolarBear wrote: Now, this is fairly common in all people. They take responsibility and they \"loose themselves\" in a false self. It's so common that it creates existential crisis in life, one commonly know as the midlife crisis, where someone reclaims their true self that was neglected, and it looks like a regression into childhood. Lot's of people's unhappiness comes from this, and it is what mostly Freud and his followers were trying to address. By looking at dreams, they would free the true self, the genuine desires that were repressed, and try to integrate it to the false self, and that would create a more complete individual, an \"integrated\" individual. So psychotherapy is about integration, to integrate those part of the self that are neglected but still there. Description of what mid life crisis is about reminds me of the comment on society and enforced ideas of self or functioning. Society creating too much socialization seems to cause problems - I think there was more of this around in Victorian times? Self-crisis? Due to very strong constraints and expectations. 1PolarBear wrote: In a narcissist personality, the false self is idealized so much so that the true self is denied, so there is an integration, but in the wrong manner because it denies reality. Reality being here the true desires, the true longings, but also the true capacity, the true morality, character, habits, etc. So everything is invested in the appearance of such, and this is what I mean by idealization. It's a kind of delusion. And because that false self is considered \"good\" absolutely, the goal is to play the part the most perfectly possible but not from some internal drive, but by some external drive. So you end up with moralities of the sort: \"you can do whatever you want, as long as it is not known\". Idealization as delusion makes sense. 1PolarBear wrote: But of course on the outside, everything has to be perfect, like a Potemkin village. The words and actions you do have to be perfect and no mistake allowed. But the reality behind is usually a mess and the opposite. Plus, the narcissist will denounce his own real flaws, his own true self, that he projects and assume in others, thus the splitting. Cheaters see cheats everywhere, and denounce it, which gives them some moral altitude. So the person ends up thinking they are gods of some sort, or at least it is the image they are selling. So normal people, they see that, and think the person is delusional and grandiose, which is true objectively. Not only what they pretend to be is impossible to attain, but claiming or suggesting they have reached it even worst. So the person acts like a god, perfect, and commanding. It's essentially arrogance, delusional pride. It's what the DSM more or less defines, or what people call primary narcissism. That makes sense particularly with some of the people you gave as examples later. 1PolarBear wrote: There is a pretty good interpretation of it in the movie \"American Psycho\" if you haven't seen it. As for what people call the vulnerable narcissist, Fight Club is pretty much a good take on it. Both are quite similar, but there are subtle differences. Like in Fight Club the guy is not grandiose himself, but he creates an imaginary friend that is, which turns out to be himself. I recently saw a film about a con artist with an analysis which also seemed to make sense with some of the explanation points, but was presumably more about the person maintaining their true self, rather than the primary example given above. 1PolarBear wrote: Yes, but the process is the same, it's just a matter of degree. Some people can act, and they know reality still, so it's fine. Might be a problem in the long run, but it's not pathological. They also are free not to act, which is important. It creates some balance. If you can only be your act, then it's pathological. That's why people say it is a spectrum. There is no clear cut categorization that can say this is good, and this is bad. It's got mostly to do with how it interferes with every day life and what the prospects are. Presumably most people only act if they have a reason or requirement for it. 1PolarBear wrote: But yes, it is idealization. The problem with idols is not that they are idols, it's when they take too much place and blind from reality. You can see it in normal day and political \"thought\". People will think in terms of \"left\" and \"right\", or some other binaries. Those are idealizations that have become idols, and depending on the part of the fence you are in, everything good you will attribute to your side, and everything bad to the other side. So that is splitting in action. It blinds from reality because those words are meaningless, just placeholders, and they resist strong attempt to define them, plus they shift all the time. So it's whatever people feel they are, their own emotions, good or bad. Not sure how idealization or the creation of an idol is not a \"problematic item\" in itself, if an idol by nature has weak or poorly defined boundaries because it is not the item itself which is focussed on, the item is a function of something else, be it guilt, ego, self-image etc. I'm not sure what causes the B&W other then e.g. the idea is right or that the person can use B&W in that way (self-justification of an idea) which is not generally going to be the correct explanation. The splitting /B&W depends on the idolizations? So the idolizations are control structures or mechanism through which the splitting operates. 1PolarBear wrote: So it's the same here. A narcissist might have an idol of looking good, so it is what they will focus on, and want to be the best looking. Or the more logical, or the more this or that. There are plenty of idols, but here, look is subjective and vain, logic can is meaningless and can be garbage is badly used, etc. Every idealization has flaws, which is why usually black and white thinking inevitably leads to a loss of reality, and in the end, pure emotional drivel, but unassumed. Like its the best because I wear it, or it's logic because I thought it, and of course, all the others are inferior since they don't agree with it. It's idealization plus black and white thinking that is the problem, not just idealization itself, because everybody does it. Any word is an idealization. But one word can't explain all of reality or encapsulate all possible human experience. The actual idol is probably the narcissist's self image itself? B&W thinking leads to a loss of reality because reality has already been lost in the individual's operation of logic - is true, is not true, is operated rather than observed. (would normally seem to require contextual aphasia which I have heard of occuring in PD.) 1PolarBear wrote: I think so yes. Although when it comes an idol, comprehension takes a second seat. I mean, comprehension of reality. It stops happening because you know everything already. You have those handful of values and idols, and you can explain everything and justify all your intents. Or if comprehension happens through those values the individual would have the idea they are open to comprehension when they are in fact doing what is described. 1PolarBear wrote: It's even better when those idols are self-contradictory, then you truly are a god. Nobody can refute you ever, and you can justify every action. Particular schema underneath, I wonder? 1PolarBear wrote: Government are starting to figure this thing out, and they also figured out people won't be able to tell. It's not even sure if they can, so perhaps they just lucked on the concept. Was that an analogy...? 1PolarBear wrote: I mean the admiration is in the narcissist first, so he will not see why anybody else would think different, and his image is perfect, he embodies that image perfectly. So if others don't admire him, then it means they simply are jealous and failures, and since nobody's perfect, it is easy to see the flaw in others, which distract from self-awareness. When you are busy finding flaws in others, you don't attend to your own. That's what I mean by being totally invested in the false self. Like any personality disorder, it is self-reinforcing behavior, and there is no obvious way out. That's what I thought about how Narcissism/disorder of self worked - the person's ego is in control of the devaluation of the concepts the other person has and the person or value is judged on the first person's ego. The individual is totally invested in the false self. 1PolarBear wrote: Here, I am even going to go further, I will say it is a narcissistic theory. Because how easy it is to accuse everybody of being \"defensive\"? I could easily say to everything you say that I disagree with that you are being defensive, and if you defend yourself that you are being defensive, then you just proved my point in proving you are defensive. That would be the idea if an individual said other persons always reacted in a certain way (provided they do not actually do it for their own reasons rather than as a result of the first person's behaviour) 1PolarBear wrote: And behind it of course, would be some idol, like being transparent, or genuine, or authentic, and so on. I am a free person, I don't ever defend myself, and I have no boundary, I am a person of the world, I am everything, I am one with the world in some symbiotic state and things that are different, are having defense mechanism, which is bad and needs to be condemned. So behind that ideal would be something else? For example the moral person example I gave would have a potential other motivation other than morality? 1PolarBear wrote: You could have the same pattern with \"rationalization\". People that give reasons are defensive, and are hiding their true motives. Surely the reasons would have to be different every time, and the reactions to each would have a subtle difference? 1PolarBear wrote: Again, there is no need for boundaries which is what rationalization does, it creates division, and everybody that would rationalize them is different and therefore inferior to the true instinctual being that is one with the world and in harmony. All reason must be condemned because they fall short of the ideal. And of course, I am totally free of that flaw, I am a story in the making, totally in the flow, etc. This reminds me of what I couldn't get my head around when I was thinking. I figured everyone would have to be disordered to rationalize deny etc. And I then realised this would actually mean people DON'T HAVE Id, Ego, Superego, it is just a description of what is built one on the other in comprehension; First understanding of personal desire, then comprehension of self, then comprehension of social responsibility, getting more complex piece by piece. Contradictions to these only mean a person \"wants not to have to stay at work half an hour late due to a headache (Id) but does so anyway (Superego.) All very simple. No complex psychology. Then I ask is Rationalization inferior, but if I am loading an incorrect schema myself when I think that (the ability to edit data is not meant to be seen as an advantage) But its the way people edit data which makes me think they are not necessarily doing the same thing, for example as you get older your theory of mind gets better, perhaps so does a person's rationale. You don't have to evade concept if you do not really use it. - No that might be a bad argument. Instead of imagining Id Ego Superego as conflicting false and true selves? 1PolarBear wrote: They are two examples of what i would consider a narcissist personality. They have that one ideal that explains everything and can't be countered except through common sense of a sort, but logic by itself won't cut it. You can see how easy that carrot can drive everything. Complete self-justification, perfect image worthy of admiration, etc. You can do whatever you want, and destroy anybody you want, so what's not to like? I was going to go with Logic won't cut it because it contests itself (And requires e.g. CBT as Schema therapy to cut through it?) If there are any two conflicting issues and false self-true self is a conflicting issue. 1PolarBear wrote: Anger is totally normal though. People get angry when someone else does bad things. If you want the person to die, then it's hatred. Again fairly normal reaction to badness, although hatred starts to come up in the idealization. Because now it is not the act itself that is the cause of the anger, but the person in its entirety. So yes, a case could be made it has something to do with a kind of narcissistic response. I mean, ultimately, it is like playing God, deciding who lives and who dies. Playing God deciding who lives who dies; \"you are my object, I am your object\"? 1PolarBear wrote: But also, it is again about porous boundaries. Going from anger to hatred usually shows some boundary problems. Lack of differentiation between the act, that can be changed, or the person, that cannot be changed. Boundary problem as in I am alive-you are alive (you are an extension of me,) therefore I have the right to change data about you. But the person is right or wrong in the same way as the act, therefore the person could be changed or edited if you would also change the act.? 1PolarBear wrote: So there was this guy that killed his wife because she kept putting the milk in front of the butter. The guy snapped and killed her. Probably he took it personally every time she did that and he thought she was doing it on purpose to spite him. Now I don't know if it is narcissism. Could be, or could be something else. He could have been paranoid or a puritan. All that I could say for sure is that he did not deal well with boundaries, either too rigid or not enough, and lacked justice because of the disproportionality of the act. On top of being illegal of course. There is just not enough data to tell the reason. It could be the upbringing too, if he was punished in the past for doing the same by parental figures, or it could be the other way, the parents always did that too and the killing was a way to free himself. I don't think I would put hatred necessarily in the narcissism construct on the face of it. But it happens. The part above got me thinking. So boundaries between the act on the person and the person become blurred which seems semantically impossible if looked at scientifically, but semantic aphasias can occur across the PD spectrum (and psychologically, obviously.) - the blurred semantics would surely have to affect other things as well. Exactly like the guy with the milk and the butter, but where it could have been something particular about what he did, not just it being done to spite him or being something which had been done to him before. Something very particular in his thought process, but what would depend on what it was. 1PolarBear wrote: Right, it could happen that way. The moral self is always part true, part false, it's a compromise. I mean, by it's essence, it is social. A man alone is never going to do things he does not want to do, out of some social consideration of good and evil. As soon as you start acting morally, there is some falsehood that creeps in. There is always the ideal, and the truth. Most people keep both fairly close together, but not always, due either to circumstances, feebleness in resolve, or just that sometimes you have to make hard choices between two bads. Well, I don't know if it is most people, but let's say healthy people. It's when you start thinking you are completely good that it gets deluded, and you become basically the false self, irrelevant of what you actually do. Almost inevitably it is justified by saying you have good intentions. So the deluded person always has good intentions, because they are a good person with good ideals, then whatever bad happens, you can't be blamed for it, nor the ideal itself. It's the joker card everybody uses. Yes, I may have bombed Hiroshima, but I had good intentions, not like those other people that bombed Pearl Harbor. Yes that's exactly what I meant, but it also depends why Hiroshima is bombed, if it is a wartime justification it can remain correct, moral etc, but if it is an illegal invasion/aggression surely the rationalization falls apart and the false self has to disintegrate in some way? OR the person would end up feeling shame about their self-action? (If not or even possibly if, the person would be found to have a different schema underneath the first.) 1PolarBear wrote: It's my opinion, yes. I think Hitler had that personality, but lots of cult leaders are narcissists, like Hubbard, that one is a classic. Mussolini in the same period clearly was as well. Basically the kind of super socialism where everybody has shiny shoes, is an obsessive compulsive ideation. But then again, it will also happen with narcissists, because they want people to be a perfect representation of themselves. Whereas those persons with the obsessive compulsive ideation would see themselves as perfect because they are innately perfect themselves and do not require a representation?(Their ideals are perfect.) Because the focus is not on the person's self, errors are human error and not in the ideal; the idealized self-image is projected onto the ideal and not referenced to the person. In fact the person becomes irrelevent? And therefore any mistake can be made by the person without damaging the ideal? 1PolarBear wrote: So Hubbard, he thought he was a sailor and an admiral, so everybody had to dress like that in the \"org\". They became extension of himself, and those that failed were discarded, like his son who was homosexual. Or just all those that decided it was not for them. He was even making them sign their soul to him in a billion year contract, which justified whatever he would do to them afterwards. \"Consent\" right? So presumably if this is an example, his values were that he was a sailor and an admiral, the values are pushed off onto those values rather than literally being about his self, he believed himself to be those things and for those things to be the right application to the situation (himself, everyone else, etc.) makes sense of the billion year contract, other than lifespan. (Although the contract is probably seen differently by many persons in those settings?) 1PolarBear wrote: So you see the desire for control, but it's all based around his personality. He did not like psychiatry for obvious reasons, so everybody have to not like it. It is the enemy of the religion and he tries to replace it with his own stuff. So then, all drugs are bad, and so on. It goes from there, but it's all based on one person's desires, himself. The argument would be if a person believes something to be correct they would support it? Some people would argue against things they believe to be incorrect in logistic terms (and would outlaw them) - to the point of editing the people concerned? 1PolarBear wrote: Hitler I think was more of a perfectionist that wanted unity, he was not into building a personality cult. I haven't studied him much though, but it's the impression I get. Stalin was a narcissist big time. He basically became the Revolution, so whatever he did was the Revolution. The personality cult because of the focus on self? Whereas Hitler's narcissistic ideal if he had one would probably be pushed off onto the ideal of the Aryan Race? 1PolarBear wrote: It's what I think, or it's a possibility. It's more a question of what you can rule out or not. It can be many things, including narcissism. It could be normal too. I just did not see anything specifically based on narcissism in it. Because the ideal is pushed off onto something else, not on attention/admiration toward the person's self or feedback to that self? The involvement of \"self\" is not about the person. If in Narcissism the discard happens when you break the person's ego schema (false self) the discard happens when the person's Agency is interrupted (the person sees their right as being the Law,) then the person's false self is interrupted when the discard occurs - so the individual rationalizes (or diverts the idea to) the idea it is correct? The person is still in the Right even if the discard results in an action which makes no sense? (I think I am oversimplifying the last part.) 1PolarBear wrote: Well, if you think someone is your property, it is poor boundaries, unless you are in a place where slavery is legal, and that person is actually your slave because you bought them, and you have papers to prove it. In which case it is no longer poor boundaries Reminds me of the NHS criteria for diagnoses. (Only a disorder if disruption is noticed.) 1PolarBear wrote: Otherwise it is simply delusional. Right, stealing is poor boundaries that don't imply codependency or a relationship, at least not in the common sense of the terms, but if you think about it longer, the thief is in a relationship with others. He does need other people to steal, so he is also dependent on people allowing him to steal, or on people not being good enough to stop him. So in order to be a thief, he needs a whole system that allows it. He needs property, and property laws, and a whole bunch of things. He isn't independent, he is playing in a bigger game with set rules he can cheat on. And those rules are the boundaries, so he has poor boundaries and is in a relationship with society in general and the people he steals, and he needs them to be as they are. Of course, but these are all practical dependencies. 1PolarBear wrote: Keeping in the psychiatry realm, the antisocial construct has the notion of parasitic lifestyle. A parasite, in biology is an animal that needs others to survive, and it does not give anything of value in exchange. So it is dependent, and has poor boundaries, because it cannot give back, it is not independent and therefore cannot be just. Now, narcissism is not antisocial so it is not parasitic, but exploitative. So it gives back a minimum, but takes more than it gave. Just like Hubbard, he takes your whole soul for a billion years, and give you some self-improvement courses. I would have thought narcissism does not have a particular bearing on being parasitic or not, and in some cases exploitation is not central other than as a result of any function of narcissism? Unless exploitation and the ability to do it are associated with positive ego. 1PolarBear wrote: Some people think it is part of normal development of the child, as language develop and experience is gained. It seems that way to me. Younger people don't know much, don't have too many tools, so if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, and getting idols is quite normal. Most people grow out of that phase, while some don't. What's not normal is not to grow out of it, to cling to omnipotent ideation or black and white thinking. There was a quote by Churchill. \"If you are young and not a progressive, you have no heart, and if you are old and not a conservative, you have no brain.\" It's because as you grow older, you acquire more tools, and more experience, so you can relate to others more readily, get a better theory of mind, and realized everybody before you were not such idiots after all, they simply knew things you didn't, or dealt with life situations you never had to deal with. So that's how people grow out of narcissism, by becoming independent, having to take decisions, taking responsibility, etc. Sounds like a different sort of narcissism to the type which is built into a person's personality structure? Perhaps Less good theory of mind would allow a person to be more \"frivolous\" by doing things like putting on an act without it being pathological? (Playing with ego as a mode of interrelation to have a 'good life'?) 1PolarBear wrote: Not necessarily, the tests are designed to be done in a session by a qualified psychiatrist. The reason people autodiagnose is mostly to find an identity, they aren't really interested in the pathological part, and since most of those personalities are vague and common, everybody can see whatever they want. So it either gives identity, justification or both. Or it can be used, which is even more common, in justifying rejection or failure in relationships. So people diagnose their partners. The criteria are also a nightmare to work out and understand properly, but not all psychiatrists seem to apply an understanding of the criteria, some just ask the patient questions to see if the patient agrees with the question (with no clarification for the nature of each). I am surprised though because one of the criteria for PD is that it causes damage in the person's life in one way or another. So unless the person is recalcitrant about change/therapy, even if only information, it would surprise me that not many people seek assistance. 1PolarBear wrote: Ok, I see, it is in the context of violence. Like how to explain violence out of personality disorders because there are some correlations. I usually resist that type of approach, especially since the biggest correlation is with antisocial personality, and it's a chicken and egg problem. People get diagnosed because they are violent, then turn around and say that they are violent because of the personality. And in that context, narcissism is mostly seen through the psychopath, so it's an added feature that may help predict future behavior But not so much so if you see it as a secondary feature perhaps, like the guy with the butter and the jam - perhaps the reaction is violent and could have been something else, but the trigger is specific and the trigger may not be antisocial. (But surely all PD has psychology.) 1PolarBear wrote: But in that case, it is fairly simple. The ideation is actually about violence, so the person sees herself as violent. Rather than seeing them self as Correct and being violent or the disruption of another schema(butter and jam), regardless of whether the individual is Rationalizing/valuing violence as strength? 1PolarBear wrote: It becomes the false self and the personality, anything else being weak. It's also self-reinforcing, because any act of violence will show the strength and independence of the person at least in the ideal self. Doing violence therefore proves the others are weaker and that you are in control, which in turn justifies the violence, because it is what weak people are for, being victim. Not only that but in some case, it can be seen as altruistic, as in being tough forces the victim into responding and making them less of a victim. It makes the victim into the image of the psychopath, or it is discarded and dies out. It's about culling the weak to keep the strong. The weak will of course be blamed for being weak, thus blaming the victim. But the question would be what would make the strength and independance ideal a narcissistic or false self rather than a belief or value the individual has? Like avoiding the concept of immorality, the individual would have to be avoiding something through making the individual a victim rather than simply reinforcing for there to be a false self? Not suggesting the avoided issue has to be vulnerable, only that it has to be rationalized out for some reason to do with self. 1PolarBear wrote: Sometimes it is some other thing, based on some moral value, like pretty much all activism does. Animal rights activism especially, is full of very violent people who think it is fine to do violence on humans, because animals are the ideal here to be preserved. The nice little innocent animals. Of course it proves good intentions, and justifies violence. Surely if the individuals involved believe in it there is all sorts of psychological error going on unless they are actually psychotic in some cases. 1PolarBear wrote: Well, just take the animal activists. They reject being carnivorous animals, because it exploits animals, give them possibly pain, is bad for the environment and so on. So instead of accepting you have eaten meat, have participated in exploiting animals, are able to give pain and are dirty, then you find a cause, and you project those things on others, which gives you the justification to do the same thing they do. It's just easier to do violence on animal killers than on some innocent people. I don't know if it is a syndrome, but for some people it passes as morality. If you can convince yourself some people are bad, reciprocity will justify them in doing bad things to them. So you paint black and then attack what you just painted, because you are white. (classic projection) 1PolarBear wrote: There was some experiment, they took a bunch of people, divided them in two, and gave each group a flag of a different color. It did not take long they were attacking each others. They were sworn enemies. Surely that doesn't happen every time... 1PolarBear wrote: It's said of people acting in the beginning of a relationship. They idealize the other, and send a lot of love, and the other can do no wrong. So love bombing. Some people with poor boundaries will do that. They are all in for awhile, then it stops and the devaluation comes, and it adds up, until everything you do is wrong and your existence itself is an irritant. So love bombing is the all white phase which usually attract people to the narcissist, or psychopath, or whatever. They can do that because they don't care about the real person, the other is an idea. So they will tell you who you are, in flattering term, with lots of intensity. It's what happens in self-help guru things, and cults. They all love bomb you, tell you how great you are. Of course it's not true, they don't know you, but it works. I've actually noticed quite a few people doing that.", "hash": "9471e71ecc71177c320d3a1a6b896326bca1c41d40fdf30f3cd339d7bec83cdb"}

Is this a description of one? by 1PolarBear » Sun Jan 30, 2022 5:41 am user1357911 wrote: I wonder if presumably most persons with personality disorder won't recognize splitting and for some reason it would be self-reported by persons with other personality disorders less frequently than in BPD? It's a fair assumption. The rapid cycling and direct contradiction makes it more obvious in BPD, so they know it is part of the problem. In narcissism, it can be hidden, because it may be always in the same direction, the direction of idol = good, others = bad. While in BPD it will be idol = good, idol = bad, and then again in cycles. So quite clearly in BPD, it will destroy relationships pretty fast, but not in narcissism. user1357911 wrote: Presumably it could happen if a person contradicts any schema but the schema involved in each are unique to the person, unless a split or discard are specific to some modes of thinking. (Though isn't it the case that in BPD, splitting does not necessarily impact the worth of the individual who has been split, and a loss of worth is more in keeping with a discard because the person is discarded? I am not an expert, but what I saw in BPD, is that the cycling is not clear. There is lots of doubt in it, so it is more ambivalence than total splitting. As soon as the other is split in a way, the contradictory idea comes to mind, and then another split, so making decisions and sticking to it becomes impossible. Also it usually ends up tearing the person apart, and then they will do the same to themselves, which eventually leads to low self-esteem. I think in the end, they blame themselves for that ambivalence. So discards are not real discards, but the BPD mind ends up being afraid of itself and will flee the other, or others. But then there are some that use this in a predatory manner and a way to manipulate. user1357911 wrote: Implying the discard is in fact deliberate not just the result of the schemas involved? The person finds their own decision to have the right to perform the discard? I don't think splitting is deliberate in the strong sense of the term. It happens, and the person may not know why at first. Later on perhaps the blackening becomes deliberate, like it is indulged in. It's hard to tell really. I see people that clearly brings narcissistic injury for a long time and it becomes their poles of identity, and they will split the bad object forever. How much of it is deliberate and bad faith, I don't know. I think it varies, but if it is pathological, I would say it isn't. It can be both too. The initial blackening might be instinctive, but the details deliberate. You just add to the stuff. There was an example in WW2. Basically, Jews would be split for some reason, either because they were bankers, or not Germans first, or not Christian. So then there would be punishment, and then the result of that punishment, misery, would be used as further proof they were worthy of despise. So in that case, probably the first was not deliberate, but the second was. You see the same happening today with the covid superstition. At first there was a split. The vaccinated blamed the unvaccinated for being non altruists, not part of the group, not getting with the program, etc. Then they were punished and excluded from those activities, so the vaccinated propagated infection through their licensing passes and getting back to normal. Then some of the unvaccinated ended up in the hospital, which was further proof they were causing the problem, which means they needed more punishment and a final solution. Again, I think the first split is not deliberate, but the second is for most people. user1357911 wrote: However for this to be a discard your Theory of Mind would have to extend to Economic Value in line with the lives of others because otherwise the items cannot have worth. Not sure what you mean. The value of a thing is not primarily economic, it is simple usefulness. Some object are useful, even if they are not perfect. What I meant here, is that the idea of \"caring\" in the ideologue is simply not there. Like if you want to clothe yourself, you can figure out stuff that will do the work, but may not be the best looking, and won't be in fashion, but it works, and it is cared for for what it is. When it becomes an ideal, then it is not the thing itself, but it's representation that matters. So you don't buy a car because it gets you from point a to b, and it is useful for that. You buy it for the image it puts on you, so it might be the girl on the hood, or the freedom or whatever, but the car is secondary. If the car stops doing that, if it is now seen as for old people, or not as free as others, then the car is discarded like trash, even if it still can go from a to b. So the car was never cared for as a car, bur for an ideal. A used car is just as good as a new one if what you want is to go from a to b, but not if you have it from other purposes. In the same way, you can care about the care to make it last longer to go from a to b, but you are not likely to be able to improve it to get girls or to be more free. It's why the image is black and white, while the reality is more on a spectrum. But a lot of people also do extend the value of people in the economic realm. Take the covid example again. After having excluded people from being useful economically by ostracism, the next logical step is a discard. To let them die basically, since they have no more value. So you see how the original split, which is only based on one difference and assertion of independence simply goes down in a spiral pretty fast. It works at individual level as well as the collective level. You idolize health, and then it goes down from there in a self-reinforcing pattern, until discard. user1357911 wrote: Yes, diagnosis without causality through psychological process doesn't seem of much use other than for those working in those fields although perhaps traits being highlighted could point people in the right directions. Yes, that's how they are used. Communication between people, professionals. user1357911 wrote: Yes, so the Id Ego and Superego are ways of describing/categorizing functional personality aspects, but would surely not be false self? As I understood, In a healthy person the superego only conflicts with the Id in internal debate (The superego is not a false self, it is more of the individual's social responsibility and conscience.) I think they are pretty much the same practically. In a healthy person, the false self will be pretty close to the true self. But in some people, the social takes over and they loose themselves. It's not the exact same, but they relate quite strongly. Just think about it as if someone would always loose the debate to the ID. Then practically, the ego becomes the superego, and the ID is \"lost\", forgotten, repressed, whatever you want to call it. And that is what happens when you identify strongly with an idol. You start repressing your own agency and put it at the service of said idol, you become a worshipper. So now, the idol works for you as the superego, and your ego becomes the idol. So you become a false self proper, and all your interactions are through the idol, and admiration for the idol becomes your own, and vice versa. Now usually in narcissism, it goes one step further, and the person becomes the idol, it's best avatar/prophet and so on, and then the idol itself is lost and the ID takes over and becomes the idol. So the true self reaffirms itself, but has to stay hidden, because what people admire is the idol. So to the outside, the false self becomes a kind of role, but there is cheating, because there is the belief in the narcissist he is the idol ultimately. So it's different than let's say a zealot that would put themselves in the total service of the idol as you would a superior. It's why you often see the two together. The zealot will give narc supply to the narcissist through the idol. The zealot is blinded to the cheats because he has his eyes only for the idol. The narcissist can then exploit the believer by having eyes only on himself and projecting the good on the idol and the bad on the unbeliever. So by being the best exemplar of that thing that is being worshipped, the narcissist can have admiration and superiority, all the while being free themselves as long as the image can be sustained of course. The more cheats and the more delusion, the more likely it will fall down and be exposed. There is a similar thing happening in paranoid schizophrenics, like those that hear voices that command. Now it is the superego taking over and asserting itself. It becomes an image personalized, and it plays the role of an aggressor, and some will identify with it and become it, following the voice. In this case, they play the zealot role in their mind, but from the outside, it's just the same as narcissism. Charles Manson was on that line. In part victim of society, in part being the whole society, and he switches between the two states rapidly in conversation. Sometimes he sounds like a narcissist, sometimes like a helpless victim. user1357911 wrote: (Or what you would be if you had no superego.) To need a false self, either society would need to be incorrect or the individual would need to feel or find them self constrained in some way. I don't think there is a \"correct\" here. Any society will be correct in some ways for some, and less for others. It's the point of politics to be correct for all at minimum and the best for most, but there will always be a false self. It's actually part of the game, everybody has a role, everybody has a personality and a false self, and it actually adds value to life and gives meaning. So the false self is not bad, it is a good thing, as long as it aligns with what the true self truly wants. That's why I say in a healthy person, they cohere in some way and are close by. In unhealthy people, they don't, and it's not necessarily the fault of the person, it can be a bad social script. People get miserable if they play a bad script not for them. When both are the same, you get narcissism, when the boundary between the two is not conscious let's say. user1357911 wrote: Description of what mid life crisis is about reminds me of the comment on society and enforced ideas of self or functioning. Society creating too much socialization seems to cause problems - I think there was more of this around in Victorian times? Self-crisis? Due to very strong constraints and expectations. Probably yes, the social fabric was a lot stronger, and roles were a lot stronger, especially in England. I think it went overboard, which then led to a contrary backlash, first in the 20s, then the 60s. Now it's the opposite, people don't have roles, so they have to create idols which is what marketing does. Throwable idols as it were. So people fall into nihilism, so the problem is the opposite, which is also why you see more narcissism. People simply choose to be whatever idol, which may or may not be realistic. So if there is mid-life crisis, it is mostly self-imposed. It solves a problem and creates a new one. That's why I say there is no good and bad about the false self, it's not a moral thing. It's more in the realm of a relationship. user1357911 wrote: I recently saw a film about a con artist with an analysis which also seemed to make sense with some of the explanation points, but was presumably more about the person maintaining their true self, rather than the primary example given above. It's possible. There are different type of cons. Some will be con artists like jesters. Or the Joker in the Dark Knight. He is true to himself, but he is also nobody. Basically he is what he does, nothing more, nothing less. So when they try to know his identity or origin, there is none, or many. Batman on the other hand is the narcissist, he plays another type of con which has to do with being a symbol and create fear and admiration. He wears a mask and has a true self and a false self. The Joker simply wears make up. The Joker is a bit like the total true self, that does not care about society's morals, which he sees as schemes. So he is an anti-narcissist, but also a complement to it. It's another good movie to see the concept. user1357911 wrote: Not sure how idealization or the creation of an idol is not a \"problematic item\" in itself, if an idol by nature has weak or poorly defined boundaries because it is not the item itself which is focussed on, the item is a function of something else, be it guilt, ego, self-image etc. Well, I make distinctions between ideas and idols. Ideas are not necessarily bad, idols are bad, but only because they are worshipped. So even then, it is not the idol that is bad, it's what people make of it, plus, somethings you do need to be deceived, that is how any society works. You simply have to be deceived in a good way. The noble Lie as Plato was saying, it is necessary. But think about ideas in a more general way. Every word you say or write, is an idealization of something. It's never the actual thing, it is a bad copy of it. But you need it to conceptualize and live, and communicate. So idealizing is part of life as human beings. It can't be bad in itself. But it regularly has to be corrected, so you have to keep your eyes open to reality and correct the image, or reject it if it is not working out. If it is too wrong. So an idea that is true is a good thing, or an idea that is good enough representation of reality is also a good thing. It's also good in the sense that it hides useless stuff from consciousness, all the imperfections of the world, they disappear once you idealize something, so it makes decision making possible, while if you took always all reality and all possibilities, you would be stranded and paralyzed. That is why caring and cultivating reality is important, it's about having better ideas, either in truth or usefulness. So it's a process and a good one, it's what humans do. Now, when it is an idol, then it is the image itself that is worshipped, not the thing itself. That's the difference. It's the image that is cultivated, but images don't change, they are eternal. So there is no correction possible, since now you have no reference point, no reality. So it's called a delusion. It's an image that has a life of its own if you will, not based on anything true. It usually simply starts with an idea, but then things get added to it, or taken out, and it looses its meaning. Like the examples I gave. Left and Right in politics. They used to be simple ideas, two groups of people in a parliament. But people forgot who those people were and they are long dead, and nobody cares who they were, the image itself, the idea is now disconnected from reality, but people still identify to them, and they just put whatever they want under them, and it changes all the time. That's what I mean by idols, and people worship those idols, group around them and give sacrifice, pray to them, etc. But it's just a word, just an idea, and since it is nothing and everything, people stop looking at reality, and try to find words that actually mean something. Communication breaks down, lines are drawn, and people fight over nothing. And sometimes, you need ideals, even if they are not totally accurate. Like social scripts, which give identity and meaning. It does not matter that much if they are true, as long as they fulfill a purpose. Every strong nation has those. So in itself, those ideals are not bad, and you can also worship them, but that is where the danger line is. It still has to be close to reality, or the whole thing falls apart. Then it becomes idols, the way I use the word. user1357911 wrote: I'm not sure what causes the B&W other then e.g. the idea is right or that the person can use B&W in that way (self-justification of an idea) which is not generally going to be the correct explanation. The splitting /B&W depends on the idolizations? So the idolizations are control structures or mechanism through which the splitting operates. It's because ideas are just words. So if I say \"left\", then anything \"right\" is the opposite. So if I say left is good, then logically, right is bad. Also if I say pizza is good, therefore pizza is left, and hot dog is not pizza therefore hot dog is right and bad. You can see how fast things can get out of hand and totally outside reality. And I am not even talking about ketchup. Now, someone actually in reality would actually taste the hot dog at least to know if it is good, they would not just logic their way through it. Assuming all hot dogs are bad because they are not pizza, would be splitting and black and white thinking. user1357911 wrote: The actual idol is probably the narcissist's self image itself? B&W thinking leads to a loss of reality because reality has already been lost in the individual's operation of logic - is true, is not true, is operated rather than observed. (would normally seem to require contextual aphasia which I have heard of occuring in PD.) Right. Eventually, the narcissist will become the idol itself, yes. It probably does not start that way. It just gets that way through investment in the image. Don't think it is a PD thing, it isn't. Everybody does it. The loss of reality is not a narcissist thing either, it's a normal thing people do when they learn language, talk and listen. You start noticing narcissism when the person talks about themselves all the time, and you realize their ideas are but a projection of themselves, and the meaning is lost for the most part. It stops being something others can objectively verify, there are big contradictions again objectively, and that type of thing. So a loss of connection with some reality. But not totally, sometimes there will be flashes of very insightful things, about others especially, and that is because of the projection. Just imagine someone that looks at themselves all the time, then they will be experts, so that expertise can be projected out, and since humans are all similar, it can show great awareness of reality, funnily enough, but it is not based on it. So it becomes hard to tell if the person is a genius or a complete moron. It's because the generality might be great, but it simply does not apply to reality, unless you want to believe. It's like I could point to a cat. And I say. This is not a cat, it is a furry animal with four legs and those type of animals are companions of men and great at purring. But you look, and it's really a dog. So one person might say, this guy is a true cat lover and knows everything about cats and is a genius in seeing cats. Then another will say: this guy can't tell a cat from a dog, clearly an idiot. Then the first person will say: Ah, but he did say it was not a cat. user1357911 wrote: Or if comprehension happens through those values the individual would have the idea they are open to comprehension when they are in fact doing what is described.

Same with the media or the academia in general. Justice too. I just spent two years trying to convince moronic judges that two laws can't contradict themselves and you have to choose one and not the other, but they don't care, or actually they can't even understand it. If they say something is true today, they can say the opposite tomorrow, and it's always true. It can be done in the same sentence as well, no problem. I think they call it post truth, and it's the latest fashion. Or actually, one philosophy professor called it truthiness.

I have a headache, ID, but have to stay at work, superego, then you have to decide, ego.

You don't have to evade concept if you do not really use it. - No that might be a bad argument. Instead of imagining Id Ego Superego as conflicting false and true selves? I am not sure I understand the first part. ID and superego will conflict at some point in life, very often in fact. Like in the example you gave, the false self might take over, so the person self-sacrifices, but it's not what they truly want, they would rather go home and get well. So at some point they might break or keep living miserably. Of course if they never have headaches, all is great, and there is no real conflict usually. The distinction is still there though, if not in act, in potential. You could have a headache. That's why the false self not necessarily bad. If it's in sync with your true self, it is a virtue. It still is if you make efforts, but it will cost you, so you'd better accept to be a martyr. user1357911 wrote: I was going to go with Logic won't cut it because it contests itself (And requires e.g. CBT as Schema therapy to cut through it?) If there are any two conflicting issues and false self-true self is a conflicting issue. Depends on the issue. Some people have bad script that are not coherent, so logic might work. Most of the time though, you are dealing with desires that are not accepted, so in that case, it is more about talking and reimaging those desires, or reimaging the necessities. Knowing what is truly important and what is not. So it deals with emotions more. I think the latter is more common than the former. Like did you ever really choose to be an astronaut, or was it forced upon you when you were young? because if it was forced and you never chose it, you won't own it, and if you don't own it, you won't be good at it. you will self-sabotage, because it's not you. Sometimes also people will make choices, but won't accept the consequences, and that's probably even more common, but they keep making the same choice, not realizing they are creating what they don't like, then they will project and blame something or someone else. Society, or whatever. It's another way you get splitting. You get an idol that you chose, but it isn't a good one, or it has cost.

I don't know if it is just semantics. People do it with their stuff, and it's not an issue. It only comes to be an issue when it is another human being. Nobody really cares is someone throws away their own stuff while it is still good. Might be dumb, but it's the life of the rich and famous. When it is other people though, that are \"objectified\", then it is seen as unjust, because it is. But even then, parents do it all the time with their children, and it's a serious issue. It's why adolescents revolt, they have to cut the tie and gain independence, and often the parents don't realize, or are not ready, or don't know how to deal with it, etc. It's not a PD thing, it's simple life. Parents are gods to their children for awhile. What's not normal is an adult being god to another adult. It's where there is a pathological thing going on, assuming of course they are equal.

In fact the person becomes irrelevent? And therefore any mistake can be made by the person without damaging the ideal? No, obsessive-compulsive behavior don't see themselves as perfect, it is usually the opposite. It's based on anxiety. They want to do things perfectly, but they always fall short, so they try again better, so it builds up. It can turn into an unhealthy desire for control. The idol in that case is superior always, and stays separate, but there is worship, and stuff is done to make the idol better, happy, etc. But you have to get rid of the unworthy, the filth that does not worship the idol just as much.

(Although the contract is probably seen differently by many persons in those settings?) Right. Well a normal person does not claim to be an admiral if they stop serving.

Some people would argue against things they believe to be incorrect in logistic terms (and would outlaw them) - to the point of editing the people concerned? What I mean is that everything revolves around the person. Correct does not matter anymore. Correct is whatever Hubbard says is correct. It's up to you to rationalize why. People that are stuck in a narcissist relationship will eventually try and rationalize their behavior for them, in part to defend them, in part to save the image. So it looks like a cult to people outside, and it is a cult. user1357911 wrote: The personality cult because of the focus on self? Whereas Hitler's narcissistic ideal if he had one would probably be pushed off onto the ideal of the Aryan Race? Right. Well Stalin was the whole show, and there was a personality cult around him too. He even help create it. As far as I can tell Hitler didn't do that. One of the ideal was the Aryan race, yes, but it was something objective. People were going around measuring skulls or whatever, it was not whatever Hitler was, because as people like to point out, he did not fit the ideal. I never saw pictures of him in people's houses and stuff you usually see in a personality cult. user1357911 wrote: Because the ideal is pushed off onto something else, not on attention/admiration toward the person's self or feedback to that self? The involvement of \"self\" is not about the person. If in Narcissism the discard happens when you break the person's ego schema (false self) the discard happens when the person's Agency is interrupted (the person sees their right as being the Law,) then the person's false self is interrupted when the discard occurs - so the individual rationalizes (or diverts the idea to) the idea it is correct? The person is still in the Right even if the discard results in an action which makes no sense? (I think I am oversimplifying the last part.) Basically, anything \"different\" is subject to discard. Just like an arm that would not be good enough, you just cut it. If it acts on its own, you cut it, because it is not part of the ideal anymore. The ideal of course is the self, ultimately. Pathological self-love ultimately, but if you say it like that, you kind of loose the process, and how normal it is up to there. user1357911 wrote: In which case it is no longer poor boundaries Reminds me of the NHS criteria for diagnoses.

You take care of it just as needed for it to do arm stuff, but you probably take it for granted most of the time. user1357911 wrote: Sounds like a different sort of narcissism to the type which is built into a person's personality structure?

But sure, plenty of people act out narcissism and it is a good thing socially, or at least it is liked and is an asset. People call it healthy narcissism. There is no real way to draw a line just from the pathological process. I put it at delusional thinking and poor boundaries, but even then, it can end up being fine. I guess it is more of a moral demarcation. user1357911 wrote: The criteria are also a nightmare to work out and understand properly, but not all psychiatrists seem to apply an understanding of the criteria, some just ask the patient questions to see if the patient agrees with the question (with no clarification for the nature of each). I am surprised though because one of the criteria for PD is that it causes damage in the person's life in one way or another. So unless the person is recalcitrant about change/therapy, even if only information, it would surprise me that not many people seek assistance. Right, well, the questions are designed that way. If you clarify, you loose reliability. People don't seek assistance because they think it is normal and everybody is like that, and it is partly true. It's just when someone compares from the outside objectively, like this person is more like this than the average, then you start seeing there is a problem. Subjectively though, the person will blame others before looking at themselves, in part because it is hard if not impossible to do it properly. And in this case, ironically, the more the narcissist looks at himself, the more he becomes narcissist. So there is no way to tell all alone. And of course, it takes some good sense of self to accept criticism in that regard, some humility, but then you are not a narcissist anymore. So I would say it is the opposite, I would not expect people with narcissism to seek help, and it's the same with other PDs, but the reasons will be slightly different. user1357911 wrote: Rather than seeing them self as Correct and being violent or the disruption of another schema(butter and jam), regardless of whether the individual is Rationalizing/valuing violence as strength?

Like avoiding the concept of immorality, the individual would have to be avoiding something through making the individual a victim rather than simply reinforcing for there to be a false self? Not suggesting the avoided issue has to be vulnerable, only that it has to be rationalized out for some reason to do with self. Values are ideals too, and false selves. No, there is no need to avoid anything. I mean, it is avoided automatically, logically. But it's a chicken and egg thing too. It could be the person despises victimhood, or it could be the admire strength. Most likely it is both, so who's to say? but lot's of psychopaths enjoy playing victim too, so if they actually wanted to avoid it at all cost, they would not do it. But if it is strength, then you can play victim if it gives you an advantage. Take Bundy, it is how he was drawing his victims, by playing victim. People would see victim = harmless and would get caught and eaten, or whatever he was doing with them. He clearly enjoyed having power over people, it was not to avoid being powerless. user1357911 wrote: Surely if the individuals involved believe in it there is all sorts of psychological error going on unless they are actually psychotic in some cases.

It's a fair assumption. The rapid cycling and direct contradiction makes it more obvious in BPD, so they know it is part of the problem. In narcissism, it can be hidden, because it may be always in the same direction, the direction of idol = good, others = bad. While in BPD it will be idol = good, idol = bad, and then again in cycles. So quite clearly in BPD, it will destroy relationships pretty fast, but not in narcissism. That makes some sense. (ish) I wonder if it, coming back to codependency can depend on whether the people involved are codependent, (people can be as a result of personality style, personal experience/trauma without having a PD as such so I wonder if people with PD are the same in that sense? That the diagnosis is not all about the relationship stuff although for some people it is a major problem? 1PolarBear wrote: I am not an expert, but what I saw in BPD, is that the cycling is not clear. There is lots of doubt in it, so it is more ambivalence than total splitting. As soon as the other is split in a way, the contradictory idea comes to mind, and then another split, so making decisions and sticking to it becomes impossible. Also it usually ends up tearing the person apart, and then they will do the same to themselves, which eventually leads to low self-esteem. I think in the end, they blame themselves for that ambivalence. So discards are not real discards, but the BPD mind ends up being afraid of itself and will flee the other, or others. But then there are some that use this in a predatory manner and a way to manipulate. You mean the splitting is uncertain because it is ego dystonic and unsettling to the individual concerned? Whereas if the person believes they are right (in BPD or NPD or any other) the B&W (fact cancelling) reaction can be absolute? I would have thought multiple splits would be confusing not just lead to low self esteem because the person does not know whether they are coming or going? 1PolarBear wrote: I don't think splitting is deliberate in the strong sense of the term. It happens, and the person may not know why at first. Later on perhaps the blackening becomes deliberate, like it is indulged in. It's hard to tell really. I see people that clearly brings narcissistic injury for a long time and it becomes their poles of identity, and they will split the bad object forever. How much of it is deliberate and bad faith, I don't know. I think it varies, but if it is pathological, I would say it isn't. It can be both too. The initial blackening might be instinctive, but the details deliberate. You just add to the stuff. The mechanism occurs (involved with the individual's own ego or splitting?) then after that there is reinforcement - even if the person is aware of it, would imply the person has given them self license to edit fact? (Another conflicting mechanism because editing fact does not technically make sense.) 1PolarBear wrote: There was an example in WW2. Basically, Jews would be split for some reason, either because they were bankers, or not Germans first, or not Christian. So then there would be punishment, and then the result of that punishment, misery, would be used as further proof they were worthy of despise. So in that case, probably the first was not deliberate, but the second was. You see the same happening today with the covid superstition. At first there was a split. The vaccinated blamed the unvaccinated for being non altruists, not part of the group, not getting with the program, etc. Then they were punished and excluded from those activities, so the vaccinated propagated infection through their licensing passes and getting back to normal. Then some of the unvaccinated ended up in the hospital, which was further proof they were causing the problem, which means they needed more punishment and a final solution. Again, I think the first split is not deliberate, but the second is for most people. Fact editing among the general population - do you think most people actually believe it though, or do they have their heads in the clouds? The idea is, is there some sort of mechanism going on where the person genuinely psychologically believes what is going on (or is invested in it) or is it \"casual attitude to data\" where the person has no sense of responsibility to reality - the two seem different. 1PolarBear wrote: Not sure what you mean. The value of a thing is not primarily economic, it is simple usefulness. Some object are useful, even if they are not perfect. What I meant here, is that the idea of \"caring\" in the ideologue is simply not there. Like if you want to clothe yourself, you can figure out stuff that will do the work, but may not be the best looking, and won't be in fashion, but it works, and it is cared for for what it is. When it becomes an ideal, then it is not the thing itself, but it's representation that matters. So you don't buy a car because it gets you from point a to b, and it is useful for that. You buy it for the image it puts on you, so it might be the girl on the hood, or the freedom or whatever, but the car is secondary. If the car stops doing that, if it is now seen as for old people, or not as free as others, then the car is discarded like trash, even if it still can go from a to b. So the car was never cared for as a car, bur for an ideal. A used car is just as good as a new one if what you want is to go from a to b, but not if you have it from other purposes. In the same way, you can care about the care to make it last longer to go from a to b, but you are not likely to be able to improve it to get girls or to be more free. It's why the image is black and white, while the reality is more on a spectrum. I tell you what I miss my car like hell for going from A to B, its really inconvenient not having a working vehicle. I suppose in the social use of fascia or trend things are discarded quickly, yes you have a point, surely a narcissist would consider them self in a slightly desperate hole if needing to discard things that constantly for the sake of image - surely it would be like having an addiction? The people involved in that sort of behaviour seem overpriveleged in attitude, shallow, unable to connect reality and the importance of ordinary objects? Not meaning those who do it without thinking properly, (out of carelessness). I meant Theory of Mind would extend conscience to the Value of the Economy as argued in Old Fashioned Communism etc. (due to the people in it). 1PolarBear wrote: But a lot of people also do extend the value of people in the economic realm. Take the covid example again. After having excluded people from being useful economically by ostracism, the next logical step is a discard. To let them die basically, since they have no more value. So you see how the original split, which is only based on one difference and assertion of independence simply goes down in a spiral pretty fast. It works at individual level as well as the collective level. You idolize health, and then it goes down from there in a self-reinforcing pattern, until discard. Yes that would be a strange example, you're healthy and you're worth something, health is idealized and funding is throw at it, until you become unhealthy at which point you're devalued or discarded and can die. 1PolarBear wrote: user1357911 wrote: Yes, diagnosis without causality through psychological process doesn't seem of much use other than for those working in those fields although perhaps traits being highlighted could point people in the right directions. Yes, that's how they are used. Communication between people, professionals. I always find it easier to think \"schema x schema y\" if I want to understand something instead of \"so and so said this then that happened\", because if you choose the second you stay in the dark about what is actually going on instead being involved only in the occurrences. The relationship language seems to appear everywhere at the moment but is less easy to follow because it often ties in with \"chasing the rabbit\" on the disordered thinking the individuals are engaged in - obviously not always but there is less distinction if I am correct probably because of the way it developed? 1PolarBear wrote: I think they are pretty much the same practically. In a healthy person, the false self will be pretty close to the true self. But in some people, the social takes over and they loose themselves.

Then practically, the ego becomes the superego, and the ID is \"lost\", forgotten, repressed, whatever you want to call it. And that is what happens when you identify strongly with an idol. You start repressing your own agency and put it at the service of said idol, you become a worshipper. So now, the idol works for you as the superego, and your ego becomes the idol. So you become a false self proper, and all your interactions are through the idol, and admiration for the idol becomes your own, and vice versa. So the ego becomes the superego (Superego functions are Egotised.) but what gives the Id License? (why) in Narcissism what gives license to the Id? You mean agency of the individual as a living person is suppressed in favour of agency of ego? (The person's Agency depends on their ego values not on their living value? I worked out the example I was thinking of earlier. If it looks like Narcissism secondary to another disorder The idea of \"id\" is licensed like a sadistic twist. \"Id\" is a mockery. What is the motivator. Why e.g. fascia > to show power (but to the narcissist it is about a false self,) is power a false self. No. It is a way of Life. It is Correct. Therefore attrition must be a false self. (To defend against guilt/shame in ToM or is that a double Negative?) Ego, e.g. false displayed self, fascia etc. or whatever is a Rationalization. Its not an ego function, the person in the example just sees it as an ego function. Why the Id takes license would surely have to determine the subtype of narcissism??? 1PolarBear wrote: I don't think there is a \"correct\" here. Any society will be correct in some ways for some, and less for others. It's the point of politics to be correct for all at minimum and the best for most, but there will always be a false self. It's actually part of the game, everybody has a role, everybody has a personality and a false self, and it actually adds value to life and gives meaning. So the false self is not bad, it is a good thing, as long as it aligns with what the true self truly wants. That's why I say in a healthy person, they cohere in some way and are close by. In unhealthy people, they don't, and it's not necessarily the fault of the person, it can be a bad social script. People get miserable if they play a bad script not for them. When both are the same, you get narcissism, when the boundary between the two is not conscious let's say. Or the opposite if you look at it the other way - I used to hear people say people with no false social self were the healthiest (most genuine) nothing to have to put on if society functions as it ought to. The more social script, the less genuine people are with each other unless some people are very sensitive and require particular responses - e.g. Man A thinks sending Birthday Cards is idiotic, but everyone gets upset if he does not do so. 1PolarBear wrote: Now usually in narcissism, it goes one step further, and the person becomes the idol, it's best avatar/prophet and so on, and then the idol itself is lost and the ID takes over and becomes the idol. So the true self reaffirms itself, but has to stay hidden, because what people admire is the idol. So to the outside, the false self becomes a kind of role, but there is cheating, because there is the belief in the narcissist he is the idol ultimately. So it's different than let's say a zealot that would put themselves in the total service of the idol as you would a superior. It's why you often see the two together. The zealot will give narc supply to the narcissist through the idol. The zealot is blinded to the cheats because he has his eyes only for the idol. The narcissist can then exploit the believer by having eyes only on himself and projecting the good on the idol and the bad on the unbeliever. So by being the best exemplar of that thing that is being worshipped, the narcissist can have admiration and superiority, all the while being free themselves as long as the image can be sustained of course. The more cheats and the more delusion, the more likely it will fall down and be exposed. What if the narcissist actually IS the idol in the way their personality is built? Why Primary Narcissism would have been considered to be \"primary\"? Meaning supply for a person with a narcissistic personality structure would be \"back up or agreement to that integration to their character,\" and disagreement with the person's character would not leave the person feeling \"lacking\", only that the other person were lacking an understanding? In those cases the exposure would be as to whether the Narcissism is Correct, and the Narcissist would find them self feeling hard done by in relation to their construct being denied or taken away when they were in the Right? 1PolarBear wrote: There is a similar thing happening in paranoid schizophrenics, like those that hear voices that command. Now it is the superego taking over and asserting itself. It becomes an image personalized, and it plays the role of an aggressor, and some will identify with it and become it, following the voice. In this case, they play the zealot role in their mind, but from the outside, it's just the same as narcissism. Charles Manson was on that line. In part victim of society, in part being the whole society, and he switches between the two states rapidly in conversation. Sometimes he sounds like a narcissist, sometimes like a helpless victim. Considering everything everyone thinks has an underlying cause it would make little sense to think of something like delusion as being a disembodied chemically induced disorder and not a reflection of the individual's thought process. Its possible that some individuals are playing out a narcissistic rationale in their heads when engaging with a delusion or fantasy? 1PolarBear wrote: Now, when it is an idol, then it is the image itself that is worshipped, not the thing itself. That's the difference. It's the image that is cultivated, but images don't change, they are eternal. So there is no correction possible, since now you have no reference point, no reality. So it's called a delusion. It's an image that has a life of its own if you will, not based on anything true. It usually simply starts with an idea, but then things get added to it, or taken out, and it looses its meaning. Like the examples I gave. Left and Right in politics. They used to be simple ideas, two groups of people in a parliament. But people forgot who those people were and they are long dead, and nobody cares who they were, the image itself, the idea is now disconnected from reality, but people still identify to them, and they just put whatever they want under them, and it changes all the time. That's what I mean by idols, and people worship those idols, group around them and give sacrifice, pray to them, etc. But it's just a word, just an idea, and since it is nothing and everything, people stop looking at reality, and try to find words that actually mean something. Communication breaks down, lines are drawn, and people fight over nothing. Differentiating an idol as something which performs a substitute place? Rather than an idealization? which is idealization of something which can have meaning, but there is still some substitution if the thing comes from ego? 1PolarBear wrote: And sometimes, you need ideals, even if they are not totally accurate. Like social scripts, which give identity and meaning. It does not matter that much if they are true, as long as they fulfill a purpose. Every strong nation has those. So in itself, those ideals are not bad, and you can also worship them, but that is where the danger line is. It still has to be close to reality, or the whole thing falls apart. Then it becomes idols, the way I use the word. Absolutely Re value system, but that is just a personal opinion. Having said, if there were none, there would be no effective laws etc. and where the value system is wrong, the same can occur. 1PolarBear wrote: It's because ideas are just words. So if I say \"left\", then anything \"right\" is the opposite. So if I say left is good, then logically, right is bad. Also if I say pizza is good, therefore pizza is left, and hot dog is not pizza therefore hot dog is right and bad. You can see how fast things can get out of hand and totally outside reality. And I am not even talking about ketchup. Now, someone actually in reality would actually taste the hot dog at least to know if it is good, they would not just logic their way through it. Assuming all hot dogs are bad because they are not pizza, would be splitting and black and white thinking. That's interesting because I'd find it to be the other way (the way I described) when psychological errors occur - I mean what gives agency (permit in the person's logic) to the idea of hotdog or ketchup changing? The hotdog is tasted but the thinking becomes skewed. There has to be a rationale for the hotdog not being pizza, if it isn't rationalized and pizza is not a strong ideal... (The error seems to occur in a different place unless its just being experienced differently by different people?) 1PolarBear wrote: Right. Eventually, the narcissist will become the idol itself, yes. It probably does not start that way. It just gets that way through investment in the image. Don't think it is a PD thing, it isn't. Everybody does it. The loss of reality is not a narcissist thing either, it's a normal thing people do when they learn language, talk and listen. You start noticing narcissism when the person talks about themselves all the time, and you realize their ideas are but a projection of themselves, and the meaning is lost for the most part. It stops being something others can objectively verify, there are big contradictions again objectively, and that type of thing. So a loss of connection with some reality. But not totally, sometimes there will be flashes of very insightful things, about others especially, and that is because of the projection. Just imagine someone that looks at themselves all the time, then they will be experts, so that expertise can be projected out, and since humans are all similar, it can show great awareness of reality, funnily enough, but it is not based on it. So it becomes hard to tell if the person is a genius or a complete moron. It's because the generality might be great, but it simply does not apply to reality, unless you want to believe. Sometimes people only understand themselves, its harder to understand different people if they think in dramatically different ways - not just different ideas on one or another thing but complete psychological differences. So people talk about them selves a lot, or from their own perspective - but then again sometimes it is self interest. 1PolarBear wrote: It's like I could point to a cat. And I say. This is not a cat, it is a furry animal with four legs and those type of animals are companions of men and great at purring. But you look, and it's really a dog. So one person might say, this guy is a true cat lover and knows everything about cats and is a genius in seeing cats. Then another will say: this guy can't tell a cat from a dog, clearly an idiot. Then the first person will say: Ah, but he did say it was not a cat. Exactly, differing perspectives... 1PolarBear wrote: Not really, the principle of non contradiction is the first principle of language. If you break it, you can say whatever, and it will always be true, or false. True or false simply don't apply anymore, because you are not playing the game right. So you can cheat, and people that don't know any better will believe it, while others will call BS or get crazy trying to figure things out. Depends if what you means is, you understand exactly what you are saying. (No doubt about any of it.) Tactic, or comprehension makes a difference.? [quote\"1PolarBear\"]No. Authorities have totally stopped caring about not contradicting themselves. Same with the media or the academia in general. Justice too. I just spent two years trying to convince moronic judges that two laws can't contradict themselves and you have to choose one and not the other, but they don't care, or actually they can't even understand it. If they say something is true today, they can say the opposite tomorrow, and it's always true. It can be done in the same sentence as well, no problem. I think they call it post truth, and it's the latest fashion. Or actually, one philosophy professor called it truthiness. But everybody sees it now, which is why nobody trusts the media or authorities. There was a time where people would simply lie, and those were the good days. Now, they don't even know what is truth.[/quote] Last time I checked e.g. Justice they had done away with Prosecution and Defence. A Lawyer is meant to ask questions to help defend your case if you are arrested, but I came across a situation where there was no double-checking of data through defence and prosecution. 1PolarBear wrote: Yes, their true self. Or someone else's desires. It depends how you take it. If you worship an idol that is an ideal man made, you are following someone else's desire. If of course you are the idol, then it is your own desires that are in display and the idol is now just a cover. But isn't the individual self-invested in the idol/ideal? (Does it depend as I was thinking above what gives license to the ID? - No wait I understood what you meant, the idol is a lie to yourself and a cover for your own motives. (A bit like I mentioned when I explained the example?) 1PolarBear wrote: Well, yes, if they are true rationalizations. It's just that some people might see rationalizations everywhere so you have to be cautious with those concepts, and it's something you want to use sparingly so not to be led astray yourself. They are rabbit holes, perfect idols. If the conceptual structure is flexible or changeable. If the issues are fixed however, not so much? 1PolarBear wrote: Right. I have a headache, ID, but have to stay at work, superego, then you have to decide, ego. When it becomes habits, your ego becomes an identity, so you might be someone always sick, or someone always heroically sacrificing yourself. Identity or personality. Well, in that you actually do it, not that you see or imagine yourself doing it (Id-Ego integration) 1PolarBear wrote: I am not sure I understand the first part. ID and superego will conflict at some point in life, very often in fact. Like in the example you gave, the false self might take over, so the person self-sacrifices, but it's not what they truly want, they would rather go home and get well. So at some point they might break or keep living miserably. Of course if they never have headaches, all is great, and there is no real conflict usually. The distinction is still there though, if not in act, in potential. You could have a headache. That's why the false self not necessarily bad. If it's in sync with your true self, it is a virtue. It still is if you make efforts, but it will cost you, so you'd better accept to be a martyr. In some people who are particularly healthy, the person wants exactly what they do? There is near-seamless integration but the person has all concepts built one on top of the other in perfect integration? Some people might see the person as a martyr when they value a superego decision but in fact the person has just chosen what they truly value as a person? 1PolarBear wrote: Depends on the issue. Some people have bad script that are not coherent, so logic might work. Most of the time though, you are dealing with desires that are not accepted, so in that case, it is more about talking and reimaging those desires, or reimaging the necessities. Knowing what is truly important and what is not. So it deals with emotions more. I think the latter is more common than the former. Like did you ever really choose to be an astronaut, or was it forced upon you when you were young? because if it was forced and you never chose it, you won't own it, and if you don't own it, you won't be good at it. you will self-sabotage, because it's not you. Sometimes also people will make choices, but won't accept the consequences, and that's probably even more common, but they keep making the same choice, not realizing they are creating what they don't like, then they will project and blame something or someone else. Society, or whatever. It's another way you get splitting. You get an idol that you chose, but it isn't a good one, or it has cost. So you keep the idol and reject the cost, you make others pay. Sounds like a pretty broad area. I get the impression reimaging is a bit further down the line if a person has comprehension errors as it is not usually accepted immediately, or maybe sometimes changing the image is not the solution because there simply shouldn't be an image in the first place, or the person is not suffering from a disorder of image so much as one of self-image? For example if someone thinks they are being strong, and actually are, but are doing it in the wrong way in the wrong place (for example staying at work with the headache.) quote=\"1PolarBear wrote: I don't know if it is just semantics. People do it with their stuff, and it's not an issue. It only comes to be an issue when it is another human being. Nobody really cares is someone throws away their own stuff while it is still good. Might be dumb, but it's the life of the rich and famous. When it is other people though, that are \"objectified\", then it is seen as unjust, because it is. But even then, parents do it all the time with their children, and it's a serious issue. It's why adolescents revolt, they have to cut the tie and gain independence, and often the parents don't realize, or are not ready, or don't know how to deal with it, etc. It's not a PD thing, it's simple life. Parents are gods to their children for awhile. What's not normal is an adult being god to another adult. It's where there is a pathological thing going on, assuming of course they are equal. If society has classes and roles, it might be normal. The Semantic idea; Cancelling an idea is like; If person A is weighed against person B Usually when denial happens in a narcissistic defence I found the two concepts were completely unrelated to each other, so weighing concept A against concept B and cancelling concept B would be an aphasia of the two concepts. (Concept A and B cannot be weighed, it would be like weighing Sheep and Apple and expecting a number in response.) But the Superego should understand responsibility to self, and if the person is likely to break, that they need to stop, the ego is in line with the superego and the ego supports \"understanding of own needs\" in the Id? - Or does that technically define the Id (A mature Id has understanding of its own needs?) 1PolarBear wrote: No, obsessive-compulsive behavior don't see themselves as perfect, it is usually the opposite. It's based on anxiety. They want to do things perfectly, but they always fall short, so they try again better, so it builds up. It can turn into an unhealthy desire for control. The idol in that case is superior always, and stays separate, but there is worship, and stuff is done to make the idol better, happy, etc. But you have to get rid of the unworthy, the filth that does not worship the idol just as much. I mean, it can get there, it does not always do, it depends on the person. I thought anxiety was more OCD than OCPD where OCPD is about being overly rigid, wouldn't that be OCPD from avoidance-sensitivity and not from somewhere else (surely rigidity probably also has its varying motivators? 1PolarBear wrote: Yes, personality disorders are social in nature, it's not a moral thing that is absolute. But the effects of a person's behaviour are usually seen in moral terms. For some reason I am warming to Millon slightly on this one because personality subtypes are described in terms of how the person thinks. 1PolarBear wrote: Well, you exploit your arm, you don't ask for it's opinions, so its the same. You take care of it just as needed for it to do arm stuff, but you probably take it for granted most of the time. But missing out in the obvious sense in case the arm has an opinion. 1PolarBear wrote: Different in intensity, not in nature. It's pathological when it affects everyday life negatively, and you can't change it. But sure, plenty of people act out narcissism and it is a good thing socially, or at least it is liked and is an asset. People call it healthy narcissism. There is no real way to draw a line just from the pathological process. I put it at delusional thinking and poor boundaries, but even then, it can end up being fine. I guess it is more of a moral demarcation. Isn't \"healthy narcissism\" a different type of functional structure, for example self-value? 1PolarBear wrote: Right, well, the questions are designed that way. If you clarify, you loose reliability. Well not really, they're meant to be clear for example \"Does your leg hurt, where does it hurt, is the bone protruding,\" isn't even an accurate diagnosis for a broken leg. It still has to be investigated further. 1PolarBear wrote: People don't seek assistance because they think it is normal and everybody is like that, and it is partly true. It's just when someone compares from the outside objectively, like this person is more like this than the average, then you start seeing there is a problem. Subjectively though, the person will blame others before looking at themselves, in part because it is hard if not impossible to do it properly. And in this case, ironically, the more the narcissist looks at himself, the more he becomes narcissist. So there is no way to tell all alone. And of course, it takes some good sense of self to accept criticism in that regard, some humility, but then you are not a narcissist anymore. So I would say it is the opposite, I would not expect people with narcissism to seek help, and it's the same with other PDs, but the reasons will be slightly different. So the ratio of people who actually have PDs on places like this may be lower than would be expected? Depending on how many people have had it brought to their attention externally? Some PDs can be very disruptive, not just to relationships but to personal safety etc. that is what made me think more people would seek help - I've met people who have done, and there used to be a PD helpline here in the UK - I am sure people used it. Or alternately a Narcissist can avoid looking at himself to ensure he does not have to attend to his self image? 1PolarBear wrote: Values are ideals too, and false selves. No, there is no need to avoid anything. I mean, it is avoided automatically, logically. Exactly. 1PolarBear wrote: But it's a chicken and egg thing too. It could be the person despises victimhood, or it could be the admire strength. Most likely it is both, so who's to say? So the automatic value becomes reinforced. 1PolarBear wrote: but lot's of psychopaths enjoy playing victim too, so if they actually wanted to avoid it at all cost, they would not do it. But if it is strength, then you can play victim if it gives you an advantage. Take Bundy, it is how he was drawing his victims, by playing victim. People would see victim = harmless and would get caught and eaten, or whatever he was doing with them. He clearly enjoyed having power over people, it was not to avoid being powerless. I tried to look up what he had but it came up with all sorts of different things. But when I found it a bit odd when the search engine said he had psychosis/bipolar - surely unless the guy was hearing voices in his head telling him to do it that couldn't ever be an explanation. One link said he was diagnosed with narcissism. 1PolarBear wrote: Not really, the only error is to consider animals superior to humans, but that's an opinion. It's the whole point of having an idol, it is superior. The rest like violence follows quite naturally. The same way violence requires the breach in conscience to commit the act, superiority requires the concept of worth - unless the individual has just \"decided that\" with very little involvement?

That the diagnosis is not all about the relationship stuff although for some people it is a major problem? No, it's not about codependency, it's simply social problems. Like lots of them, schizoid, schizotypal, avoidant, are quite independent, possibly too much, which in itself causes social problems. There is only one that is dependent, and it's dependent PD. It's because strictly speaking, it is a problem of the self in relationship with others. If the self is adapted to the environment, you won't get a diagnosis, so it's primarily social, but the cause is partly in the self. \"Relationship\" is a broad term, it's any interaction you have with others, so it includes jobs and any interaction you have with others. Psychiatry is based on the medical model. You go there because you have some issue. In proper medicine, it's about your body, but in psychiatry, it is about being social in the broad sense, which includes stuff like anxiety, learning problems and just about anything. The diagnosis is based on those things first, to see the is an actual actionable problem. The personality is mostly causal, like if you would do a test and find a virus. user1357911 wrote: You mean the splitting is uncertain because it is ego dystonic and unsettling to the individual concerned? Whereas if the person believes they are right (in BPD or NPD or any other) the B&W (fact cancelling) reaction can be absolute? I would have thought multiple splits would be confusing not just lead to low self esteem because the person does not know whether they are coming or going? Yes. Well I was specifically talking about NPD. In that case, it has for goal to save and protect the self-image, or reinforce it, so it is ego syntonic. It's just that for most people, they can deal with people that are different, and some even enjoy it. All differences are not an existential threat. But yes, it is confusing if it is not ego syntonic. I mean, it is always absolute, it's the point of it, it's the definition of it. It's all this or all that. Normally, reality is not like that, so there will be back and forth, unless all you see is yourself or some idol. So in ideological groups, it will be ego syntonic as well, because it protects the image of the group. But if the group is not homogenous, of is facing something that is not part of the group image, then there will be some back and forth, some will split one way, others the other way, some will try and integrate. It's what we see in nations with strong immigration. Some split one way or the other towards foreigners, others try and find a compromise between identity and openness to others. And yes, it's confusing. It tears societies apart. In something like BPD, the person tears itself apart in that same way. user1357911 wrote: The mechanism occurs (involved with the individual's own ego or splitting?) then after that there is reinforcement - even if the person is aware of it, would imply the person has given them self license to edit fact? (Another conflicting mechanism because editing fact does not technically make sense.) Well, it's not really editing facts, it's picking and choosing. Let's say, you eat an Hawaiian pizza, and you don't like it, then you split and you find those type of pizzas are the worst and will destroy pizzas in general if allowed to exist. Then that type of pizza becomes a symbol of what's wrong with the world. But then you look at the ingredients, and you have to focus on the pineapple mostly as being the cause, because other pizzas might have cheese, so cheese is fine, dough is fine, jam is arguable. It's in that process of demonizing pineapple that it becomes more deliberate. Then you might want to destroy all pineapple plantations as a preventive strike. user1357911 wrote: Fact editing among the general population - do you think most people actually believe it though, or do they have their heads in the clouds? The idea is, is there some sort of mechanism going on where the person genuinely psychologically believes what is going on (or is invested in it) or is it \"casual attitude to data\" where the person has no sense of responsibility to reality - the two seem different. Yes, they are different. One is superstition, the other irreligion. I see both, and they usually come together even in the same people. Some believe, then some others just don't care about finding out, as long as it goes their way. It's like any virtue, if you lack it, you will go to the extremes and go back and forth, one extreme replacing the other. So people that lack courage, they won't always coward, they will also be reckless. They might viciously attack someone when they think it is safe, and then retreat once they see it isn't, which might be too late for them. So it's the same here. Care too much about pineapples, or not care that much, as long as the plantations are destroyed, which is now the true enemy. I see this a lot in the environmentalists. Some care a lot about carbon dioxide and warmth. Others don't but care about destroying oil or just messing up the system. So there you have the superstitious and the irreligious. Or take the covid, some people believe in the measures and want them whether they work or not, because it's about doing something, anything. So that's the superstitious, then you have people like Boris J. that will impose the measures, but does not really believe in them, so in private, he will not follow them, which creates a scandal once known. It's also a good example of the false self as I use it. Boris was presenting the image of a faithful, but really all those measures was him and what he needed to manage things around, so it's the classic narcissist trickery. People get blinded by the idol, so whatever he does is attributed to it, while in reality he isn't really doing anything except his own agenda. user1357911 wrote: I tell you what I miss my car like hell for going from A to B, its really inconvenient not having a working vehicle. I suppose in the social use of fascia or trend things are discarded quickly, yes you have a point, surely a narcissist would consider them self in a slightly desperate hole if needing to discard things that constantly for the sake of image - surely it would be like having an addiction? The people involved in that sort of behaviour seem overpriveleged in attitude, shallow, unable to connect reality and the importance of ordinary objects? Not meaning those who do it without thinking properly, (out of carelessness). Right, well it's vanity. And yes, again it is the opposite of carelessness, it is caring about the wrong things, things that are not real and can't be improved through cultivating. It's the same in relationships, they need cultivating if you are dealing with a real person. If you are dealing with an idea of a person though, it might be great until it reflects that ideal, so the idealization phase, but once it stops being that, it needs a discard, and you find the next \"true love\". Careless people don't discard, they neglect, which isn't the same. user1357911 wrote: I meant Theory of Mind would extend conscience to the Value of the Economy as argued in Old Fashioned Communism etc. (due to the people in it). Oh, ok I see. There is some similarities in the concepts of capitalism in the marxist sense and the narcissism I describe, yes. In fact it's the same, you are correct. Both are exploitation of the other, with the small difference than the capitalist only uses the other person's work, not the whole thing. It may have come from there originally. It's a bit more subtle than that though, it's a bit of a gross approximation. Like in the myth, Echo essentially validates everything Narcissus says, but it would of course extends oftentimes into the physical in practice. But take a corporation, the people have to reflect well on the company, or they are discarded. It's probably even more important than the actual work value. user1357911 wrote: I always find it easier to think \"schema x schema y\" if I want to understand something instead of \"so and so said this then that happened\", because if you choose the second you stay in the dark about what is actually going on instead being involved only in the occurrences. Yes, but then you idealize a behavior and therefore runs the risk of having it disconnected from reality over time. But yes, it's easier, which is why narcissism is a common thing. It has a natural evolution. There were whole discussions about this in the Medieval Ages, turning around literalism and metaphors. Usually the consensus was metaphors are fine as long as they don't contradict the literal. But of course you have to remember the literal or have a way to refer to it. If you just forget about it, then the idea gets a life of its own, which is where things start getting delusional. user1357911 wrote: The relationship language seems to appear everywhere at the moment but is less easy to follow because it often ties in with \"chasing the rabbit\" on the disordered thinking the individuals are engaged in - obviously not always but there is less distinction if I am correct probably because of the way it developed? I am not sure what you mean exactly. I usually like staying close to the original data. You can have the best map in the world, if you can't link it to the territory, it is useless. If I show you the territory, you can make your own map. To take your analogy, it's easy to dig rabbit holes, but if you can't tell a rabbit when you see one, and can't tell how it runs, the holes will be pretty pointless unless lucky and some rabbit falls into it. But even then, you may assume it is a rabbit because it fell into a rabbit hole, while in fact it was a snake. It's the whole problem with idealization. user1357911 wrote: So the ego becomes the superego (Superego functions are Egotised.) but what gives the Id License? (why) in Narcissism what gives license to the Id? Good question. It's because you go up, and become one, then you go down and apply the one. So there is a moving up process from the individual to the one, from material to the idea. Then both become one, the distinction disappears, then after that, everything move from the one to the individual is a matter of finding imperfection in the individual. Now reality becomes an imperfect copy of the ideal, which must be rejected ultimately as false. Since there cannot be any correction from the world, there is license for everything because inferior to the truth. Basically, in the process of doing the map, the territory becomes obsolete and the cartographer king. You can look at Fauci in the US. It's the typical process. First he looks at scientific papers and experts, and creates a map, then he becomes Science. Like he says himself, contradicting him is contradicting Science itself, so his ego had become the superego. He has become his idol, and the best exemplar of that idol, so he goes everywhere and gives himself the right to lie to people and take whatever measure he deems necessary or better. Then people have to obey. People see through his game, but the delusion is so strong, he keeps going, never correcting, because who can correct him? He is Science, and everything else is fringe. So in the end, whatever he wants is law, as long as it keeps the image he projects. Lots of people see through those games, but not everybody. He will get defenders that give him the admiration he seeks. user1357911 wrote: You mean agency of the individual as a living person is suppressed in favour of agency of ego? (The person's Agency depends on their ego values not on their living value? Yes. If you are Science, you get stuck in it, and you have to sacrifice a bunch of things normal people who aren't Science can do, like thinking for yourself, being critical of others, and so on. The investment can become big, because you have to play the part all the time. It's even more obvious in institutions like the Royal Family. You see, the Queen is the perfect example of someone stuck in the superego, she has become her function. And it's not to say she is a narcissist herself, personality wise, but she has to play the part. In fact she is quite the opposite from what it seems, being at the service of others, and being humble. It's what Harry complains about, that he does not want to become the superego, he wants to live his own life, so you see the problem here, and how people respond to it. They will claim Meghan is a controlling narcissist, which may be true, but may not be, but if she was playing the part, nobody would care. So funnily, it is because she isn't acting as one that she is accused of being one. Or perhaps they are but have broken the image. In any case, it's good for them to liberate themselves and focus on what matters, which is their own lives. I mean psychologically I think it is the right thing to do. But quite clearly it is also a really hard thing to do socially. Harry is a bit like a narcissist that became self-aware. So he tries to break free, and you get splitting and all sorts of things that are not pretty. user1357911 wrote: I worked out the example I was thinking of earlier. If it looks like Narcissism secondary to another disorder The idea of \"id\" is licensed like a sadistic twist. \"Id\" is a mockery. What is the motivator. Why e.g. fascia > to show power (but to the narcissist it is about a false self,) is power a false self. No. It is a way of Life. It is Correct. Therefore attrition must be a false self. (To defend against guilt/shame in ToM or is that a double Negative?) Ego, e.g. false displayed self, fascia etc. or whatever is a Rationalization. Its not an ego function, the person in the example just sees it as an ego function. Why the Id takes license would surely have to determine the subtype of narcissism??? Yeah, that's your map, I can't really say. But like in the example above with the Royal family, for them, the superego is everything, they are born and raised into it, which is why Harris calls it a prison they are unaware of. But William says that he does not feel like in a prison, but that is normal because he is unaware. But one thing for sure, they have to deal with narcissism at some level that is critical, all in their own way. Like I said, the Queen, she denies the bad parts, like arrogance and exploitation and in fact exemplifies herself in the opposite role. So she is a bit like the perfect Christ. I am sure she also does not get license to her ID and try to be responsible. So she avoided the narcissistic personality in those ways, even though her role is narcissism itself. But that is the Royal family and they have a long tradition of dealing with that obviously. But if you take an outsider like Meghan, and put her into that environment, she can't cope, she does not have the tools, so if the rumors are correct, she ended up being arrogant, exploiting the people below her and so on. Then when she was criticized, she split, and discarded the Royal Family, but keeping Harry, because he is part of her. He defends her like you would expect. \"Whatever Meghan wants, she gets.\" said Harry to the servants. And that's now the ID gets license. Now, I don't know exactly the details of how, and you can explain it is many different ways, but it does happen eventually. I tries a general explanation above, but you could put it in other ways I suppose. But really you become the image, and everything else is but an extension of yourself, albeit imperfectly, thus inferior. It's probably that inferiority that justifies, and the delusion does not allow correction to reality. I mean, if you think a king of princess is about giving orders around, it's your image and nobody will be able to correct it. Others know there are limits and dangers to that even if the power is there. user1357911 wrote: Or the opposite if you look at it the other way - I used to hear people say people with no false social self were the healthiest (most genuine) nothing to have to put on if society functions as it ought to. Yes, it is a typical narcissist trope. Blame all of society if you are not God. It's not to say there isn't some truth to it, but like Aristotle said, \"men are social animals, and if not, they can either be gods or beasts\". Beasts are also very genuine, especially Polar Bears. user1357911 wrote: The more social script, the less genuine people are with each other unless some people are very sensitive and require particular responses - e.g. Man A thinks sending Birthday Cards is idiotic, but everyone gets upset if he does not do so. Yes, it's all true. But what is \"correct\"? Do you avoid all birthdays? that's what I do. But plenty of people would say it is incorrect because they like birthdays. So then they have to play the part and be social, and false. It's a choice people make, I am not ready to say which is correct or not. It can only be correct in some context, and for some people in relationship with that context. Birthdays are a social construct, and a fairly new one at that I believe. I think I saw somewhere it was never a thing in the past. People would be festive as some moments in life, like coming of age, marriage and things of that nature, but not birthdays. I don't know if it is true. Perhaps it is an extension of Christmas. user1357911 wrote: What if the narcissist actually IS the idol in the way their personality is built? They are, but socially, it does not work, so you need an image to hide behind. user1357911 wrote: Why Primary Narcissism would have been considered to be \"primary\"? I don't know. I don't really use those terms. I know about primacy psychopathy, which has a narcissistic component which happens to the be same as the DSM definition. I think it is more aptly called grandiose narcissism, but there are types of narcissism that aren't grandiose, and plenty in fact are grandiose victims, which is a kind of inverse grandiosity. But it's possible to have a narcissist personality without grandiosity at all I believe, as long as there is delusion and an embodied image. People sometimes call it covert narcissism because the grandiosity is not apparent. It's there, but kind of in the mind mostly, so in that case, direct admiration is not the thing, but can be gotten through others, or perhaps through work or something. user1357911 wrote: Meaning supply for a person with a narcissistic personality structure would be \"back up or agreement to that integration to their character,\" and disagreement with the person's character would not leave the person feeling \"lacking\", only that the other person were lacking an understanding? In those cases the exposure would be as to whether the Narcissism is Correct, and the Narcissist would find them self feeling hard done by in relation to their construct being denied or taken away when they were in the Right? The narcissist is always correct, at least internally for the things they care about. Someone that is lacking is an existential threat and needs to be corrected, or destroyed. It's the black and white thinking. It's kind of the whole point. It gets into a nice synergy with the antisocial absence of guilt, because now not only the feeling's not there, the conscience, but you get an added justification for said lack of conscience, that you are correct. user1357911 wrote: Considering everything everyone thinks has an underlying cause it would make little sense to think of something like delusion as being a disembodied chemically induced disorder and not a reflection of the individual's thought process. Its possible that some individuals are playing out a narcissistic rationale in their heads when engaging with a delusion or fantasy? Well yes, everybody does, but it takes some special salience in some people and not in others. If someone is already disconnected from reality in general, it would show more. user1357911 wrote: Differentiating an idol as something which performs a substitute place? Rather than an idealization? which is idealization of something which can have meaning, but there is still some substitution if the thing comes from ego? Not everybody becomes an idol. Most people don't. They can keep differentiating themselves from their ideals, or their ideals from reality. The normal worshipper will think they are not worthy of the idol, and bow in its presence. So they put themselves below the idol. Of course there is some substitution, there is a longing to be like the idol, but it never gets there. That is also why reality is not an existential threat, because the idol is superior to everything, so if something does not fit, it is just something to be avoided or integrated. But the idol itself is safe from corruption. Here, there was some example some time ago. You may know that the principle that nothing can go faster than the speed of light is pretty much an idol in physics. Now at some point, someone claimed they had made an experiment that proved otherwise. It created quite a bit of commotion, plenty of scientists actually looked at it, and showed that in the end, it was not the case, so they went and looked for the errors. That's a sensible approach, and they could do that in the firm belief of their idol. Now of course, I am sure plenty simply split and rejected it because it was an existential threat to themselves, that it was impossible and so on. So they probably never cared to check in reality, or may have looked at some other reasons, like those scientists were not authoritative enough, or something along those lines. user1357911 wrote: Absolutely Re value system, but that is just a personal opinion. Having said, if there were none, there would be no effective laws etc. and where the value system is wrong, the same can occur. Yeah, I don't like the name value or value system. They really are stories with some ideas in them. Value system is like a pizza you would put together just based on the ingredients. But stories have protagonists, desires, context and a lot of other things that give the ideas meaning. Stories based on values or value systems are usually terrible, and everybody rejects them. Laws are based on rights, not values. We know what's right in a story, no matter the values. In fact, most often the villain has values, but the hero does the right thing. Like the villain wants to control the world, that's his value, but the hero knows the right thing is to stop the villain. It's not a value, just the right thing to do. Now you could say he fights for freedom, but it usually looks silly and the hero ends up just as bad, bullying the villain for no reason, because he has different values. Or sometimes it is just his name or how he looks. Like DrEvil, clearly is bad and needs to be stopped, even though he just minds his own business. But his name sounds wrong and we go along with it. Now of course if DrEvil collects people for experiments, it is something else and some rights are being trampled on. Values are little idols. Rights aren't, although lots of people think they are values, which is problematic. user1357911 wrote: That's interesting because I'd find it to be the other way (the way I described) when psychological errors occur - I mean what gives agency (permit in the person's logic) to the idea of hotdog or ketchup changing? The hotdog is tasted but the thinking becomes skewed. There has to be a rationale for the hotdog not being pizza, if it isn't rationalized and pizza is not a strong ideal... (The error seems to occur in a different place unless its just being experienced differently by different people?) Well, yes, there is a rational, like I said, you taste the hot dog and it tastes different. You can also touch the texture of the sausage and compare to the cheese, or give a quick look at both and see the different forms, one is round, the other is a thick line. You could analyze them further with instruments, like decompose in their chemical elements, check with a spectrometer for the radiations. Basically you have to look at the essence of each and since they are different, they will be defined differently. Or just ask the waiter for the definition. Like: \"what is a hot dog?\". Chances are he will tell you the truth, and knowing what a pizza is, deduce the differences and the commonalities. In black and white thinking, you only look at those two things separately, instead of together. A real definition is both positive and negative. General and species. It's basically a mistake in using categories and definitions properly. Mistaking specie and genera, and vice versa. That's also why I don't like Millon all that much. He takes different generas and mix them together to create subtypes, but the ingredients he takes here and take out there, it simply creates bastards that may have nothing to do with the thing itself. I approach narcissism as a genera, and I try to explain what it is, how it works, how it cooks, and what temperature and so on. Looking at the ingredient is useless if you can't cook or know what a pizza is in the first place, and what it is not. That's how you get Hawaiian pizzas, they do not know what they are doing. user1357911 wrote: Sometimes people only understand themselves, its harder to understand different people if they think in dramatically different ways - not just different ideas on one or another thing but complete psychological differences.

Keeping boundaries intact, self introspection and so on. It's a major problem though, I agree. user1357911 wrote: Last time I checked e.g. Justice they had done away with Prosecution and Defence.

Sometimes you can tell in extreme cases, but not most of the time. But you can tell it is delusional, so it does not matter. So you can call out the delusion, of the lie, it makes no difference. Most of the time though, it really seems like a mesh of both. user1357911 wrote: 1PolarBear wrote: Well, yes, if they are true rationalizations.

No, it's because it is a closed system, that's what makes them a rabbit hole. Realistic systems are open systems. They take input from the outside, and depending on the input, will churn out something different. Closed system always churn out the same thing no matter what happens. You know the joke about Freud and the cigars? https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/08/12/just-a-cigar/ The unconscious is a closed system a rabbit hole. It's a perfect idol like I described. So in the end, it is up to Freud to decide if a cigar is a cigar or not. Also explains the license of the ID. Now was Freud a con man or did he believe his stuff? impossible to tell. Probably both. Whatever the case may be, he was totally invested in that idol, and became it, and really you have to ask him what is a cigar and what is not, so it's his own feelings and desires. Not all idols are perfect like that, so less dangerous. You need an operator in a closed system, otherwise you realize the con. A person that will switch the machine on and off. The magician behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz. It's a great example of an idol run by some narcissist. The narcissist is the small dude operating the big machine, which represents grandiosity. Toto is the small dog that can see behind the curtain. user1357911 wrote: Well, in that you actually do it, not that you see or imagine yourself doing it (Id-Ego integration) Things can be integrated in image only or fantasy.

Habits are potential, they happen in the mind first and are a disposition to act readily. So there is a bunch of work that can be done just in fantasy which corrects the mind and makes doing the right thing an automation of sort. So the ego is not just in act, it is mostly in potential. That's why we have stories, they straighten the mind, if they are good ones of course. So if you get in a situation, you know how to act. user1357911 wrote: In some people who are particularly healthy, the person wants exactly what they do? There is near-seamless integration but the person has all concepts built one on top of the other in perfect integration? Some people might see the person as a martyr when they value a superego decision but in fact the person has just chosen what they truly value as a person? Right. I mean ideally, that's the goal to aim for, imo. If something is truly a virtue, there is no effort, so if the good thing, let's say the superego is integrated, it's not difficult to act on it, and the ID is fine with it too and actually helps by giving pleasure. If doing the right thing hurts, there is lack of integration, or its too new. It's like physical training, at first it hurts, but eventually the activity gives pleasure. user1357911 wrote: Sounds like a pretty broad area. I get the impression reimaging is a bit further down the line if a person has comprehension errors as it is not usually accepted immediately, or maybe sometimes changing the image is not the solution because there simply shouldn't be an image in the first place, or the person is not suffering from a disorder of image so much as one of self-image? For example if someone thinks they are being strong, and actually are, but are doing it in the wrong way in the wrong place (for example staying at work with the headache.) Yes but how do you fix it? You have to tell that being strong is also taking care of yourself, having the courage to do it, and that in the end, you are more useful when healthy than just being a martyr. I see that type of reimaging in sports. It used to be that people would just endure pain for no reason, out of some sense of duty and the image of being strong. Now people are reimaging it and say things like mental health is more important, and so on. The sacrifice is still lauded, but the reverse is not seen as weakness. They aren't \"errors\" to speak of, it's different stories. It works, but is a slow process, and some people may never buy into it either. user1357911 wrote: The Semantic idea; Cancelling an idea is like; If person A is weighed against person B Usually when denial happens in a narcissistic defence I found the two concepts were completely unrelated to each other, so weighing concept A against concept B and cancelling concept B would be an aphasia of the two concepts. (Concept A and B cannot be weighed, it would be like weighing Sheep and Apple and expecting a number in response.) Ok I see. Yes, it happens, because people are focused on the pineapple. At least in the narcissist defense concept, one small part can be compared, but then it is generalized to the whole. So there might be the idea that apples are good because they have vitamin C, while the sheep does not, or something of the sort. So all sheep are bad, even if they have healthy fat the apple does not have. I don't think it is aphasia, but could be. user1357911 wrote: But the Superego should understand responsibility to self, and if the person is likely to break, that they need to stop, the ego is in line with the superego and the ego supports \"understanding of own needs\" in the Id? - Or does that technically define the Id (A mature Id has understanding of its own needs?) I think it is a reimagining of the superego. That is how I would see it. An ID is the own need, it's all it is. So the superego would say: \"need to be strong\", the ID says: \"pain\". So it's the ego's function to either reimage the superego so it is understood differently, or you have to make choices between the two. Either go with one or the other and own it. Basically the ego is the will in older philosophy. The superego is the intellect that can be from the outside or an internal fabrication. So when someone follows the ID, what they really are doing is making a superego that is not in sync with what was learned from society. Either that or they are already in sync, so then there is no difference. For most things they are relatively in sync. You might want to wear clothes because it is cold, and society says the same. Or you might be hungry, and society says it is good to eat. user1357911 wrote: I thought anxiety was more OCD than OCPD where OCPD is about being overly rigid, wouldn't that be OCPD from avoidance-sensitivity and not from somewhere else (surely rigidity probably also has its varying motivators?

How you want to call it, I don't really care. I kind of assumed they were causal, but I could be wrong. I mean, what causes the rigidity in the first place? I find people like that usually afraid of changes, which is anxiety. user1357911 wrote: But the effects of a person's behaviour are usually seen in moral terms. For some reason I am warming to Millon slightly on this one because personality subtypes are described in terms of how the person thinks. Yes, because his book is a psychology book, not a psychiatric one. But what he describes are not personality disorders, they just borrow the names from them. So that's where it gets messy. The DSM borrows stuff from psychology based on some archetypes described in length in some places, it simplifies them and idealizes them. Then Millon comes and take those little idols and make a pizza out of them, but does not explain the pizza itself, or the original. It's best to go to the originals if you want to go that route. I mean, if you've followed what I said so far, it is itself a narcissistic ideation quite removed from reality. Now, the next logical step, is you become a Millon expert, and start seeing those subtypes everywhere, or try to see it, and then you stop interacting with the person itself and instead interact with the idea you have of them, and if they don't fit the pattern force them into it, thus doing damage and in the end, exploiting people. So it's a dangerous path, which is why being process oriented is better, the ideas are smaller and more amenable to change according to circumstances. It can be broken down by behavior, instead of painting the whole person with some label. Since it is broken down, it is easier to find the issue and fix it, while changing the whole person, you can forget about it. So all it gives in the end is something for entertainment value, which is what you see quite a bit in expert videos on youtube about those things. Ok, you see personalities, but then what? So I get what you are saying, and I agree, I just don't think Millon is the right guy for it, but he might give you some ideas, it's a good book overall. it's only an introduction though, not much more. user1357911 wrote: Isn't \"healthy narcissism\" a different type of functional structure, for example self-value? Yes, it is what people say, or it's how it has become, but I think it is the same. There is nothing wrong having a narcissistic personality here and there. Like comics, they use it to great effect. If you want to be in business, it is a must for sales, etc. Again, it is this idea that people are special monsters, I simply don't buy it.

It's a discussion between the practitioners and the scientists. Plenty of practitioners will do like you say, but in theory they are not supposed to. Even with the new DSM, they were supposed to rate each trait independently and there was a revolt against it. Of course the scientists want that in order to do research, while the doctors oftentimes have other priorities, and for the therapists, it is again another reality. user1357911 wrote: So the ratio of people who actually have PDs on places like this may be lower than would be expected?

Well, I am not sure if it has changed. But usually, people would go for some other reason, so they aren't self-aware. They might thing there is this little thing bugging them, then it ends up being a big thing. Yes, they can be disruptive, but lets say an antisocial, almost none go there for it. They get caught by the Man and get diagnosed against their will. It's the case for a lot of others too. Or people might go for some marital problems, job issues, etc. People with PDs won't go for those reasons, because it is ego syntonic, it's their personality. Nobody in their right mind go to psychiatrist to change themselves entirely, but they might go for small fixes, like any normal person. user1357911 wrote: Or alternately a Narcissist can avoid looking at himself to ensure he does not have to attend to his self image? Oh, they attend to their self image, it is all they do. It's the true self that is in trouble. It's just they can't tell the difference because they are joined. So it looks the same as an integrated person in their own eyes, even healthier than anybody else, if they were to look at it because they are so joined. So when I say it is a problem with the true self, it would mean nothing for a narcissist, they would think they've got it already. It's why it is a delusion. user1357911 wrote: I tried to look up what he had but it came up with all sorts of different things.

One link said he was diagnosed with narcissism. Yeah, I don't think he was hearing voices himself, but his defense mechanism are interesting, and yes, in his case, they clearly are. He is like teflon, so anytime people try to connect to him as a human being, he deflects, and then throws back the stuff at the other person. So he is a mirror to other people, and he even says so himself. That allows a complete lack of responsibility, even though in reality, everybody says he was the boss, and ordering people around. So in everybody's mind, he is the leader, while in his own mind, arguably, he is the biggest victim. In any case, he shows a lot of narcissism in that regard, plus he is clearly grandiose and shows it in a virulent manner, and then there is the antisocial element he seems to have incorporated in his self image. But he is more detached from reality than your average psychopath, and he does not even try to look sane. So I think it's more than just a personality disorder, but you could say it's there as well. That's why those diagnosis are not particularly useful, but the behavior is. user1357911 wrote: The same way violence requires the breach in conscience to commit the act, superiority requires the concept of worth - unless the individual has just \"decided that\" with very little involvement?

Well, I used to think so too but I’ve changed my mind. I know exactly what you mean, as I said, I feel that even if I got all the attention and adoration I desire I still wouldn’t feel fulfilled. But there’s also nothing else I desire. So I’ve decided I’m just going to pursue it in whatever way I can. I mean, it’s narcissism but I’ve not been diagnosed with npd. But I also feel uncomfortable with it a little I guess as I really don’t care about anything anymore. All I care about is getting the recognition I feel I deserve. I used to care about things but I’m so sick of watching human beings behave with such stupidity I just feel I don’t care about humanity anymore. All I care about is me. And I hear myself saying it and I think that I must be such a bad person for feeling that way. There’s another side of me that is highly empathic.but lately I’m thinking well maybe I was never the empath I thought I was because I really don’t feel empathy for anyone at all. People are irritating me. All the conversations that are happening about the safety of women for example. I find myself being angry at them and thinking they should shut the hell up and stop being whining little b*tches (I am female). Yet I am someone who has been badly abused by men. I don’t know. Maybe this isn’t even narcissism maybe it’s some kind of trauma response. But basically I feel like I must be a completely selfish asshole but I’ve reached the point where I no longer care about being one because screw human beings anyway.

Back home I practically have no friends, well I haven't really had a friend in forever. I think I am too good to socialize with people and hate doing so. But I feel extremely lonely. I don't have any plans of working or getting a job anytime soon because I think I am too good for it. All my life I have had a sense of entitlement and having a relatively well-off family didn't help. I have never had any long lasting, meaningful relationships or friendships. I have been thinking that I might be autistic but after researching narcissism; I am sure that I am a narcissist. I don't care about anyone else, only what I can gain from that person. I only associate with people that have a higher social or financial status compared to me. I lead all conversation topics to a problem I have or I stay quiet. I constantly fantasize about becoming successful or wealthy, getting revenge on an ex or someone that have wronged me. If I don't constantly stimulate myself with alcohol, parties, or activities I get depressed. I hate socializing but I also hate being alone. My only personality is that I can blow money and ###$ hot girls with no personalities. I get stages where I am obsessed with my looks and get to a point where I feel confident then I slip into depression again. I have a major pornography and sex addiction. People won't share anything negative about me or criticize me because they know I will drop them or lash out. I don't even know how to socialize without alcohol or drugs. I can't hold a conversation that isn't about ######6 girls, material things, or overall show-off $#%^. I don't think I have ever had a normal friend that wasn't as ###$ up as me. My new friendships last for weeks at most, and they end when they realize I have nothing to offer, or have absolutely no personality or interests.

It sounds really ###$ up but, I do not want to use someone I just don't want to be this lonely anymore. I know if I continue I might end up taking my own life. I am living in hell. I see people having meaningful connections with their friends that they have had for 10+ years, able to enjoy each others company just sitting around doing nothing.

But have just been reading up on Covert NPD and I literally tick every box! Sensitive to criticism. passive aggressive, self critical. self absorbed, appear shy, but am also subtly manipulative, defensive, hyper-sensitive. I do see myself as different, special and often have low tolerance for others. Hold grudges for personal slights... for years!! Personal disrespect makes triggers sudden anger. I have had continual cycles of depression and anxiety for decades and also highs when I am praised. While I can be charming for a while I have discover a lot of my humility may be an attempt to seek kudos or favour including charitable acts. However I still can be genuinely kind. I have had to work on being empathic because I know it is the right thing to do as a human being. I think this type of NPD is a little different to the `classic` Overt NPD. I believe that I do have a type NPD and I DO care about it and it depresses me that it seems intractable no matter how hard I try.

Hope you're still around, and I'm sorry to miss your posts. I very much doubt you have NPD. It is definitely NOT a spectrum disorder. It is part of a spectrum of personalities, but once you have the disorder, it's a binary proposition. You are or you aren't, and there's mostly not a realistic chance of getting rid of it. Mostly. Checking boxes is not a reliable way to diagnose NPD. What is needed is a consistent history of behaviour (positive) or an inconsistent one (negative). What I would like to ask you: have you ever done any of the following without feeling forced to do it by outside influences: Admitting you're wrong, apologizing for your actions, devoting considerable effort or risk to helping others?", "hash": "c43f4f92acf4cfd4d04daefb97c0cb1c6e20e20268c8b85aace3719323dd953f"}

I've come to realise I'm in hell with covert narcissism. I've recently broken up with my girlfriend because I cannot handle being forced into social situations and have people patronise me, reject me or bully me due to my shyness. I'm hyper sensitive to not getting the recognition I deserve and so being shy I am never going to get the response I think I deserve from people. I can feel people withdraw, wretch, patronise me once they see me not saying much and being glaringly introverted and it is the equivalent of having a hot poker shoved up my arse. I feel the depression and rage sweep over me and I aggressively and passive aggressively force my way out of that situation no matter how awkward I make the situation. My girlfriend cannot handle the social abstinence and solitude I placed our relationship into so we had to break up and I understand now that I can't be in a relationship. I must live alone which I don't want to do but know I have to. The reason why I argue that covert narcissism is hell is that there is no solace. No warm blanket. Overt narcissists at least can use other people for their own means and get what they want to the best of their ability and also get the respect. I cannot. As a shy person, people treat me like a dog. I realise that normal shy people can accept this but I absolutely CAN NOT. There are no people to make me feel better. Go round this forum and see oodles of threads of people falling over themselves to give other OVERT narcissists advice after they don't know what to do after their latest heinous abuse they've inflicted on some poor bastard. Nobody gives a ###$ about me. I'm a freak and not only am I a freak. I'm a freak who cannot accept that he is a freak so I basically have to hide from life to avoid the bleak despair I will inevitably feel.

Etzel, one of my best long term friends since almost 20yrs ago speaks just like you, hes also a non, so like you he doesn't have a clue who this process works in our lifes. And since my old teen age we been over a lot of social events and he is very sociable and that maybe why I was his 'wing', although he didnt even had a car and I was most of the time the guy with most 'independence' and success compared to him in terms of having money and a job, stable life... (we are from low social class). We had some fights along the way, most my fault, usually motivated because at these times he didn't mean much of a supply to me anymore, cause I had gf or simply was more interested in other people supply. I wrote all this just to give you a clue how my social interactions were, I had the chance over more that a decade to build a personality and a healthy social circle but all I always wanted was my supply. I ditched a lot of people, and that is obvious in the way we both meet people and he held a stronger connection to them vs the one I accomplished, to be honest my connection to these people were very artificial and not genuine (oh! that word again), or to describe better: fake. One trait of our narc ways is the ease of moving on with the ability to have zero guilt, remorse over friendships/relationships. we have talked about my shyness a lot and ways to improve, and this guy make the same exact reasoning you do. Im actually considering telling him about my narc traits as we are close friends(in his perception). so let me put this in a manner you can understand, we consider social interaction a very complicated matter, in our views you nons are very disturbed and have arcane ways of socializing, its stupid. I can tell you this cause over my whole life i've been unconsciously 'playing the game' (yes, the one you say we suck and suggest we go learn and fix from ground zero if necessary) in order to get my supply, but now I know my real motives why I need to socialize and it doesn't make sense anymore unless for supply. This will not create healthy relationships as we know from experience , so (in my case) part of the shyness come from the fact that I acknowledge the non race discern us as scumbags, crazy, disturbed and so on. The other part is the fact that we need to be viewed as great and better by others or sometimes just be looked at and ear some compliments or some kind of attention, and thats not always the case. perfectlynumb22, sorry for derailing your thread, but I identify myself with the shyness traits you describe.", "hash": "0765dfa2bccde0642635e2cf79a2c808668c10224379e87c6d4c77047ab413b8"}

Hi all. I want to explore this a little. I am aware that I am either NPD or I sit on the borderline between extremely high narcissism and NPD... I'm currently in a rather depressed state, so I'm just going to write what I am thinking and feeling and would welcome comments from anyone who wishes to give me their opinion. I believe that I have NPD although I believe it is quite complex. As I have been aware of it for many years I've attempted to train myself out of it... And something occurred to me recently and it is that NPD actually allows the sufferer to survive. Our brains always grow and evolve the way they do to best protect us from our environment. So perhaps narcissists trying to 'heal themselves' is not actually a good thing. Perhaps we should embrace our narcissism. I think that in trying to cure myself of it I've actually broken myself. There will probably be some who read this and think that I am not actually NPD. And you may be right. I have never been told I have a diagnosis. I have a BPD diagnosis but the psychiatrist also hinted at an additional diagnosis that would 'not be beneficial for me to know about'... I am I believe a 'vulnerable' narcissist. Which is the worst type as we spend our lives completely unsuccessful and angry about all that we should have been and had in life. Not getting what we 'deserved'. I blame others for my life. And I don't think I'm wrong in doing that. It is their fault. The misery I've had and the pain I've experienced, including the irritation and numbness I currently feel, is all their fault. And I have had a great deal of very real trauma and pain. I am deeply, deeply unsatisfied with my life. And I am angry because I am not who I want to be and have not achieved all I wanted to. I do fit my BPD diagnosis also. Except the self harm part. I've never been big on self harm. But I've been frequently suicidal throughout my life. I mean this whole post, I am reading it and it sounds so bleak, so awful. I am ashamed of it. There is so much more to me than this. As I mentioned, I'm currently incredibly depressed. I'm a void. I feel nothing except irritation and dissatisfaction. I feel as though nothing will ever be enough. I'm incredibly bored and all I want is stimulation. Or to be perfect. I want perfection. I want to be that ideal self I feel I really am. I don't think there is going to ever be any getting away from that. I suppose that deep down, I feel there is nothing to me. I have no identity. I am a void. And it's awful. I created this false ideal self that I had to live up to to be happy because deep down truly, I know that I am nothing. That there is nothing much to me, as a person. Perhaps there could have been, but it didn't happen. I did not develop properly. And that's the part I can't deal with. The narcissist within doesn't want to reveal this. She wants to believe that I am exceptional and special. And better than 99% of people. To be honest, I do genuinely believe that. So, perhaps that is what I should embrace. I should just embrace my narcissism. Accept that I am better than other people, and I am exceptional. And go after becoming my exceptional self. I honestly can not deal with being ordinary. I want to be extraordinary. I have to be. Else I will never be satisfied. But then, why am I here? Why are any of us here?

I have a BPD diagnosis but the psychiatrist also hinted at an additional diagnosis that would 'not be beneficial for me to know about'... I think all low-level disorders have the potential to become more problematic if one tries to get rid of defensive mechanisms too soon. So while there is of course an array of very problematic defenses, including things like self-harming, drug abuse etc, a lot of this one can only outgrow over time, if one grows and matures in other parts of ones self; parts that later play there role in stabilizing a personality that originally turned to those destructive things for stabilization. Narcissism itself though is not a bad thing anyways, it just means you like yourself. How you do that and how much it might interfere with your objectivity, interactions with others etc, is much more important imo than classifying some label as implying something pathological. I am I believe a 'vulnerable' narcissist. Which is the worst type as we spend our lives completely unsuccessful and angry about all that we should have been and had in life.

Well projection has two sides. One side is that you can empty youself of negative states and really feel that those states are now outside of you or part of somebody else. The bad side of it is, that now it is not you anymore that is responsible for your situation, but somebody else. So with projecting out things that you dont want to look at as parts of yourself, you also let go of your agency, of your power to change yourself and your situation. In the worst case, like in people with paranoid disorders, this can turn into feeling controlled or persecuted by others.[/quote] I should just embrace my narcissism. Accept that I am better than other people, and I am exceptional. And go after becoming my exceptional self. I honestly can not deal with being ordinary. I want to be extraordinary. I have to be. Else I will never be satisfied. Well the question is, can you embrace it really? When I read the text you wrote it seems like a lot of oscillation between void / fullness, worthlessnes / perfection, devalued bpd / idealized narcissism. I would argue that to fully embrace something you need the capacity to fully see it, so including the good, bad, and in-between aspects. And in my experience that requires a longer development, possibly needing aid from a professional or somebody that is more \"developed\" than you, so your brain can actually build the complexity necessary to deal with this stuff on a more detailed level; in other words not to oscillate between absolute good and bad stuff, but to becoem more relaxed, accepting and perceiving that there is a spectrum with a wide array of things that can co-exist, while they were originally seen as dichotomous and necessitating dissociation. dx: SPD", "hash": "95f90e1db26f7935cec5601076e092c42478639d7934a3486fc0677579a0e788"}

Personally, I can understand that you want to make sense of your own psyche, learn to understand yourself and rectify or even learn completely new behaviours that are less toxic. My layman advice is as follows: Don't focus too much on a diagnosis, don't get rid of your narcissism altogether, there are healthy narcissistic patterns as well that are potentially life-saving. Ask yourself in all honesty which behaviours you find rather toxic, you may also ask close ones who \"know\" you relatively well what they think your flaws are (under the premise you can handle this, this is a hard pill to swallow for non-narcs as well, so beware). Try to modify toxic behaviour and turn it into something less toxic, for instance, take responsibility for your actions, know it always takes \"two to tango\", accept your flaws, learn to truly love and cherish yourself. I like to think the opposite of toxic narcissism is true self-love because actual narcs don't \"love\" themselves, they are the personification of unaware self-loathing in my honest opinion, they overcompensate A LOT and usually come from a non-loving home, they were never loved for \"just being\". Also, consider therapy, admitting your flaws and working on them is the first step to healing and self-improvement. I must admit I admire some of the traits narcs possess, they can be extremely charming and engaging, they are great at dreaming and it can be quite exhilarating to indulge in their fantasies. The problem is the toxic ones want it all without putting hard work and effort into something, they simply expect too much from the world. Healthy narcissism would be for instance that you want to stand out and be admired, however you put in a lot of hard work and effort and are naturally prosocial, there is nothing toxic in aspiring to achieve this. It only becomes toxic when you exploit others to achieve this goal, get irate if it doesn't work out or worse take said anger out on others for having wronged you, making them responsible for your own failure (classic projection...) As you can imagine, it can get quite blurry at times, there is a fine line between healthy self-esteem and narcissism all the way up to NPD and even NPD is a spectrum and every individual is different (obviously). It's good that you are aware of your narcissistic tendencies, as I've stated previously try to discern which behaviours are toxic and which ones are more on the healthy side. Moreover take it slowly, one step at a time, if you do a \"personality striptease\" too quickly it may get quite dangerous and turn into something really unhealthy the opposite of what you desired to achieve.

My mother (whom I HATE so much but need so much at the same time) and my husband keep telling me I'm a good person, good wife, caring, etc. Husband says who cares if youre a narc if you have a conscience and try not to do the wrong things you're ok. I don't think he understands the pain of operating under a false operands. Even now the pain I feel as I type this is too too much. I'm not going to talk too much about my predicament. I'm going to ask - does any form of therapy help with this at all? Maybe developing a new ME? A HUMAN me? I hate not feeling human, that everything I know and believe about myself is just a defense mechanism against intense childhood abuse and shame. And, I have a month old daughter I have to take care not to screw up too much. Thanks.", "hash": "c7fba09a05548b56b6564b4d707e807e236a00b97dd005f2dbfc3272cc3e7771"}

Being open in that context means the willingness to talk about your feelings, issues, weaknesses, etc. If a person holds back from sharing, they won't get better because they won't be exploring new ideas about themselves. They'll just be in the same mental space. Being mindful will reveal your weaknesses. When you find these weaknesses, do your best not to put yourself down. People with npd can be highly self-critical so be on the look out for how well you treat yourself. Be aware of when you are treating yourself badly.

Sorry for not replying earlier, yesterday I had a lot to take in. I am almost certain of my DX. Why I am conflicted about it is because to me, one of my \"values\" is to be true to myself. To be authentic. Learning that I don't really have a sense of self, that what I think is me is not true, is very disturbing. But my values, mannerisms and likes/dislikes are always changing. It's not that I CHOOSE to change these to cover things up as pop psychology loving nons say on the internet. It's just that I don't have a real, genuine sense of who I am. These feelings come up every so often but somehow I just repress them. Learning about N parents I don't want to pass the BS to my daughter. I honestly want the best for her, what I don't have, and that's authenticity and a good state of mind and emotion. I don't think I completely lack empathy, I just believe it is deficient. It is circumstantial and most of the time I have to actively put myself in that person's position. I honestly believe that everything will turn out all right. How can it not? I will always have a roof over my head, food on my plate, a place to sleep, etc. Everything will be okay for me. The most disturbing part of myself is my systemizing. Evaluating everyone as potential friend or foe. Who will approve of me, who will disapprove of me? My existence depends on some form of approval. Maybe not full blown \"I'm a pop star millionaire\" approval although being recognized as great would be nice. If I am not perfect, how can I be a worthwhile human being? How? HOW? Okay getting off this tangent now. I'm going to see a therapist later today. I'll let you all know how it goes. He specializes in PDs, \"trauma\" and \"psychodynamic therapy\" among others. Maybe others can learn from what I learn. And nmind, I read some of your older posts yesterday. Good stuff.

I'm pretty much in the same place as you right now, being a self-diagnosed narcissist. And yes, it's painful to know that you are basically nothing - but that doesn't mean that's all there is to life. Focus on the healthy part of yourself, you have much more to give than you think. Right now you're probably dismissing everything good you ever felt and did, chill out a bit. Even if it was for the wrong reasons, it doesn't take away value from it. And now you can actually start living beyond it. You can start doing things for the sake of doing. You'll see how much joy and pain and whatever you can feel once you stop focusing on yourself and your needs so much. I suppose it will always be sort of like this for us, hopelessly circling around our wound, but life is still out there. Focus on what's happening right in front of you and let things in, even if it's narcissistic crap - you will *know* it's naricssistic crap. And that gives you freedom, as opposed to before. Open and mindful, as nmind said I feel so much more alive (even though I feel bad most of the time) since I just gave in. So now I'm this little stupid Narc in pain but it's going to be better. It already is way better than the emptiness I felt before when I was just repressing my feelings, I feel I'm moving away from it. Consciously turning negativity into positive thoughts and being open should do the trick.

I don't know, but I do now that pain is unavoidable, and numbing it out only encourages people to act like blunt instruments. If you want to be true to yourself, perhaps your sense of identity has more basis in feeling than anything else? I mean, everyone's sense of identity is a fabrication. That's the point of it - our roles in the play, (the word \"person\"' actually stems is from the latin word for a stage mask hah)...but some people define themselves by what they accomplish, others by who they associate with, some by their completely neurotic thought patterns...maybe you just want to live in harmony with your feelings, instead of repressing them or invalidating them via poor action? “The mystery is this: There is one right thing to do at every moment.

Someone on this forum, from a search I did mentioned ACON and I looked it up and all of it describes me to a T. I'm wondering how much of that fits coverts/hypervigilents/vulnerables? And whether the covert DX is real or just ACON with strong N or BPD (or both) traits? After reading how \"toxic\" people treat their children, I'm sure my mom may be pwBPD and my dad pwNPD (overt). My mom is a perfectionist (she wasn't always) because I think she has my problem, that she is an inner perfectionist, striving for some standard that she can never meet. Like me I don't think that standard is necessarily grandiose just some inner critic that criticises anything and everything she does, she can \"never do right\". But deep down I think she wants to be loved. Yeah she had rage problems in the past, problems with but I think she's trying to atone for that. She tried to hug me yesterday but I said no (I have unresolved problems with her I guess) and she started to cry. I was moved and told her she was a good grandmother, good mom and don't worry, she is loved. She felt better. My dad? Well, I'm not sure what he wants. Respect I guess. It's very hard to be myself around him because he will rage very hard and discard me until some months down the line when to keep face he will pick up the phone. He uses religion as a tool as he is one of the \"good\" and \"real\" 100,000 Christians that are going to heaven and the rest? Well good bye then. He told my brother and I a lot when we were growing up and being kids that \"you're going to hell!\" if we didn't stay in line. That didn't work on his dog though so he physically abused his dog to the 9th degree. I literally become paralyzed at the thought of telling my dad today that I am not religious, in fact I am an atheist. I cannot fathom the outcome of that. I literally cannot be myself. I'm wondering if any of this resonates with anyone else? ACON, covert/hypervigilent, narc, pwNPD, etc? Regardless of what I am or who I am now, I have to set things right. I have to break the cycle of abuse, selfishness and toxicity and do right by my daughter. She cannot turn out like me, I hate me!

What are your thoughts on this? I'd think they are totally different concepts. Narcissism psychodynamically can mean everything that concerned with the self, with turning onto the self or with self-esteem regulation. A \"narcissist\" psychologically-speaking doesnt exist. Pathological narcissism is used for problems either with the self - my therapist uses narcissistic disorder as a word for self-disorder f.e. - or with self-esteem. Vulnerable narcissism for example can be seen in this light as a person who's self-esteem modulation is vulnerable etc. More specifically with NPD several theorists haev held the idea that in the creation of the self certain aspects of which would turn into ideals to strive for are merged with the self in such a way that they become unconsciously perceived as aspects of the self - this was coined by some the grandiose self, setting apart an NPD proper with pathological narcissism of other sorts. Psychopathy on the other hand side points way more to a part of the self-structure, namely the moral-system or super-ego and specifically defects in that system or its complete absence. Otto Kernberg, who Esmoke already mentioned, saw the two disorders as a spectrum, with the super-ego defects being the thing that differentiated them the most and also gave a big implication of the treatment prognosis. NPD itself though for Kernberg was a complication of what he called borderline personality organization, which set him apart back then a lot from Kohut who saw it as a sort of developmental arrest. Anyways, while his theories have been influential in the psychodynamic field and also in the conception of DSM, this rather strong dichotomy between neurotic and borderline self-structure is not widely accepted anymore afaik and I dont think there is clear evidence for his spectrum idea, but I'm a bit out of the loop these days with the current study situation. dx: SPD", "hash": "c1aed82c8326ba403d3d6a094e3ceb65197664f140d6c7e0dae81714176d8240"}

Narcissism psychodynamically can mean everything that concerned with the self, with turning onto the self or with self-esteem regulation. A \"narcissist\" psychologically-speaking doesnt exist. Pathological narcissism is used for problems either with the self - my therapist uses narcissistic disorder as a word for self-disorder f.e. - or with self-esteem. Vulnerable narcissism for example can be seen in this light as a person who's self-esteem modulation is vulnerable etc. More specifically with NPD several theorists haev held the idea that in the creation of the self certain aspects of which would turn into ideals to strive for are merged with the self in such a way that they become unconsciously perceived as aspects of the self - this was coined by some the grandiose self, setting apart an NPD proper with pathological narcissism of other sorts. Psychopathy on the other hand side points way more to a part of the self-structure, namely the moral-system or super-ego and specifically defects in that system or its complete absence. Otto Kernberg, who Esmoke already mentioned, saw the two disorders as a spectrum, with the super-ego defects being the thing that differentiated them the most and also gave a big implication of the treatment prognosis. NPD itself though for Kernberg was a complication of what he called borderline personality organization, which set him apart back then a lot from Kohut who saw it as a sort of developmental arrest. Anyways, while his theories have been influential in the psychodynamic field and also in the conception of DSM, this rather strong dichotomy between neurotic and borderline self-structure is not widely accepted anymore afaik and I dont think there is clear evidence for his spectrum idea, but I'm a bit out of the loop these days with the current study situation.

I would classify empathy more into the realm of mentalization and not think of such abstracts as true/false self. But there is such a thing as emotional contagion. In German we have this weird dichotomy between \"Mitgefühl\" vs \"Mitleid\", which had been a topic in therapy a while ago. \"Mitleid\" (Co-Suffering) I would say is the same thing as emotional contagion, it shows that some internal feelings gets triggered in you, you feel an emotion, might be overwhelmed by it. It can be caused for example by being in a bad way yourself, or by having small ego-boundaries... AProphet comes to mind and his constant idea that he was \"telepathically\" feeling other peoples feelings. It can also be caused by other people [subconsciously] trying to make you feel a certain way though, as in projective identification. \"Mitgefühl\" (Co-Feeling) is in contrast an ability where you investigate anothers state in a more complete sense, based on knowledge and curiosity and you are not overwhelmed by \"their\" (read your own) emotions. In Kleinian terms Mitleid is more a part-object thing, Mitgefühl is more a whole-object thing, where you realte to the person as an adult and you might feel bad for them, but you are also having enough distance to be helpful. A caricature of a contaged (?) therapist would be a therapist for example who hears your story and then starts sobbing uncontrollably. Aside from being evry unprofessional it also shows that he has a very all/nothin state now and he is being overwhelmed by something that is not clearly yours and not clearly his. If that makes sense. Mitgefühl is a outcome of a lessening of narcissism and strengthening or accurate mentalization capacity I feel. So maybe if you are uncertain if its emotional contagion or empathy, you could try to see how clearly your conscious/unconscious boundaries to that other person have been in that situation and how much you felt of their emotions were in you and vice versa. Also if you have the required knowledge to know if he was actually suffering for example, or if that was just your idea. dx: SPD", "hash": "9d8385f5b8451f974f3a27e510e2e5e13a451200013bba0c71c5d83988473cf3"}

Are you for real, Philonoe ? There are many ways to relate to people: 1) you may quite literally feel their feelings because you experienced them, a manner of relating through reminiscence and association 2) you may mirror people's feelings to validate them without having experienced them 3) you may understand, as a logical calculation or deduction, what they are going through All of the methods above have strengths and downsides: in terms of appraising the situation accurately, in terms of responding accurately... They all require some adjusting: as someone grows healthier, they also develop an ability to mix and match. But Number 1 remains, by far, the most accurate and shortest way to get through to someone's pain and motivation, because that's literally what it was designed for!! Basically what Akuma is saying above is that number 1 is not a valid expression of empathy.

There are different themes involved in the discussion. One is the ability to \"feel\" when someone lives something. it can be related to your own experience like we said. it can be related to your own state of mind. for instance i can totally miss someone's feelings in case i'm myself preoccupied. i become very selfcentered and sort of don't see people or people's needs. What i find interesting is to relate it to boundaries. if i have no good internal boundaries i become fragile with other's feelings. Some people can't listen to other's feelings because they become too involved or depressed. If i have no good external boundaries i can project own feeling on the person for instance. in both cases there are no two persons in the room. in one case i disappear. in one case they disappear. that doesn't mean that i don't feel. Boundaries make possible to relate to someone. accept they exist, they have feelings, some of them i perceive or share, some of them i don't. People who are able to listen and to relate - be therapists or not - are very precious. they make dialog possible. So yes Akuma's post opens interesting directions it seems to me", "hash": "42869f70905354e9d3a23ffa30217b2f03af1caf666b5f130f7f9172ea8f1513"}

Going back to Self Serf's post, which is supposed to be the focus, remember? So going back to Self Serf's original post, it sounds like Self Serf experienced a genuine moment, if only fleeting, of consideration or empathy for someone else. Something worth celebrating more than anything. Now, I don't know, in this post, where one can find a hint that this could constitute emotional contagion. In fact, Self Serf is being forward, explaining that, because of is unwitting current state of self-absorption (\"my own suffering\", \"absorbed by that\", \"my own loss\"...), they may struggle to take in people's feelings. Either you possess such bad boundaries that you let anyone and anything affect you, or you stand like a fortress in regard to other people's suffering, it can't be both. With this in mind, the whole emotional contagion tirade seems bizarre. At the very best, it's a rather passive aggressive jab, taking away the focus from the original question. If you are concerned with poor boundaries, perhaps an area to investigate is how you may contribute to supporting negative or destructive behaviors? If you seek figures to enable? Perhaps you could remind yourself, and I mean that in the kindest way possible, that narcissism is a drug, and that by supporting a projected image instead of the person behind, you come closer to being a figurative dealer supplying the drug than to helping them.

Basically there was a series that I am watching which essentially talks about abuse and the family dynamics that come with that and the attempt of the people to get out of it. So theres this moment where one of the characters that I like very much is depressed. A girl who was in love with him for a long while has just admitted to him that she realized she really never loved him but she needed someone she can pity and who had it worse than her; and he told her that he will never love her, and never love anyone for that matter anyways. So he comes home and doesnt speak and doesnt eat. So the other main protagonist is wondering what to do when one of the younger guys comes running to her saying \"You know he is feeling down but that doesnt mean we have to, right? Right? Lets do something fun!\" And they both walk off to have fun outside. I was perplexed, because I couldnt react that way, I immediately feel bad when he is feeling bad, I see someone I like very much suffering and my impulse is to go after him, to not eat either, to not be able to \"do something fun\", probably I would just want to sit there in silence but if I actually went out, I would probably feel guilty all of the time. Of course the problem is that if I go after him, that is not necessarily what he wants, and even if he wants it, its not necessarily what he needs ; his current situatioon is a moment in his development and might be necessary; at the very least one has to clarify and to be able to accept the result. On the other hand side, the little guy is right; theres no need to feel bad because the othe rperson is feelign bad. And just like that weird girl, I might not really act out of love, but out of pity, maybe even out of fear. This is also what incited the inspection of the difference between Mitleid and Mitgefühl in my session with my therapist and I think this is what triggers Vini here, because really realizing another person is seperate is a pretty big step, and one that cant be gotten to by narcissistic means and which doesnt just spontaenously develop out of nowhere; realizing other people have hidden thoughts you will never know, feelings you will never have access to, that of course you cannot feel others feelings is a scary thing and not without reason this shift is called \"depressive position\" in Kleinian terms. And I think in a way this relates also very well to the question of SelfSerf about the False Self in a way. When the True Self (staying with Winnicott) is the untainted aliveness of the biological organism and the False Self is the hindrances to that aliveness implanted by our parents. And in a way that lack of boundaries, as Philonoe calls it, that necessity to be \"there\" for others is such a False Self aspect. My caregivers for example brought me up in a way where it was not always clear that they were seperate, and in I learned to be constantly wary of their feelings and their states, feeling responsible for their inner world, feeling unable to just let them be and \"do something fun\" a lot of the times, I would think. And I think in a way SelfSerf is still in the same position. I remember \"just going away\" (both from certain people in his family and certain inner states) and having fun is something that he struggled with tremendously.

Are you able to keep up appearances well enough so as to go for a 9-5? Basically I’m finding out the hard way that I couldn’t handle a l”normal” 5-day workweek at this factory any longer. I’m simply too bad of a mixture of schizoid/antisocial/paranoid combined with BPD/derealization to handle what I deem simple tasks on some days. Like I might get super anxious and my panties in a twist so some mechanical stuff might suffer due to forgetfulness or being hazy, not to mention my incapability to have proper relationships. I got a job through one of my longest frienda/acquaintances (there’s been alienation) at his co-founded company that is a very progressive tech-minded reputable one that really has all the potential to be the next big thing and grabbing a considerable market share worldwide. So after a year or two of struggling and being in a very dark place. This really felt like the only real thing to give my life any real purpose because it actually felt like I was doing important work (Im covert so it’s always been am-special-through-association but after 6months am pretty much exhausted and so it seems that Ive worn out my welcome). Otherwise the vision of the company is something I can get behind and there are a lot of perks to staying there, but my mental issues have got in the way enough as to render attempts at staying futile. But overall my life is a sham and in such a deteriorated/decrepit state that am considering offing myself daily anyhow. If I lose this job it seems like a done deal. Basically prior to this been going off for around two years on what one would call secondary supply, trying to charm, entertain people to make my company worthwhile and all-encompassing self-loathing but I finally feel like am done. Am not a team-player and that company is really into tying together the whole workplace in a team-based way so I’ve been an immediate outlier. Tried my best to fake going along with it but it doesn’t come naturally at all and I keep defaulting (no real interest in others, do-my-work,go-home, repeat). Not capable of proper relations. I’ve also had quite a few ###$ (mostly Ive been more harsh as it pertains to these than my actual supervisors) and have reacted either too hot or with other issues too nonchalantly. The thing is I simply dont truly care enough and if am not doing anything challenging (it’s routineous work, although not arduous) I get bored very easily and the work suffers. Basically as much as I need to be surrounded by people for keeping sane, I’m finding it impossible. Am too delusional. People have surelt taken note of my mental health or lack lf thereof. Some trying to accomodate, some simply evade now. I have already had a few talks on my behaviour throughout the time Ive spent there and got final notice to pick up my act (being on time, not late every day) until their final verdict and if so might be able to stay but today I overheard a conversation not meant for my ears about basically not keeping “just any sort of people” there so I guess am done.

So I've started putting stuff into motion to get more money and do some work in the near future. Im not sure yet though what works best for me, I assume beign self-emplyed is better and I'm aiming at that direction, too. I think doing several things would be the most useful to me, as I would probably consider a desk job or something to be like a prison. As with apperances I think youre overthinking stuff as usual :p.

Aspergers by Psche » Wed Sep 16, 2020 3:27 am This is really mortifying for me to admit to these feelings, so please go easy on me. I really hope that nobody I know comes across this thread. I need to say that I have a diagnosis of Aspergers and struggle with expectations in society, my expectations, body language and people’s intentions. I don’t have any friends and am often seen as being stuck up and aloof. For the last year I have secretly wondered if I am a narcissist due to some of my behaviours but also behaviours in myself that I see in my father who I think might be one. Though I honestly think he is much, much worse than myself. I have to firstly say that I don’t see myself as being a manipulative individual or someone who tries to upset others. I don’t gaslight people. I don’t ignore them. My father does this constantly and it greatly lowers my confidence. So I know how this feels and would never intentionally do this. However, there are some aspects of narcissism that I wonder about and see in myself: - I want to be admired or feel special. I have always felt this way and don’t like being in the room when other people are getting attention and I am ignored. For ex, as a child I would get jealous and resent my baby newphew when my relatives would fawn over him. - I get jealous of everyone and everything very easily. - I am extremely insecure and feel inferior to everyone and everything. Not to the extent that I am an eggshell, more just that I feel everyone’s life is better than mines. - I lack self confidence. - I want to be admired but I do not like attention. I don’t understand why this is and I am confused by it myself! - People always perceive me to be stuck up. - I find it very, very hard to emphasise with certain things and others issues. I can’t understand their issues or how they would be a difficulty. - I have deep fantasies of becoming wealthy and living a well off lifestyle. I fantasise often. I think in a way this helps with depression. I do not fantasise about power. I know that fantasising often is a trait of Narcissism. - I am extremely defensive and cannot really handle criticism at all. Criticism to me feels like an attack where someone is running you down. - I am not keen being second best or not performing to a high standard in every field. (I know this sounds childish but it is the reality) These are feelings that I feel on a daily basis. I know they’re inappropriate because I don’t want to admit them. I feel ashamed to have these feelings but in a way I feel it’s just me and I don’t have any control over the feelings. I think my Aspergers contributes to this in some way. I do not know if I am a narcissist or a heavily damaged person. I often wonder why I have turned out this way. I would like to be able to improve. I want to be able to live my life, feeling secure in myself and not feeling inferior to everyone. I also want to rid myself of these emotions. I am now a grown man in his 20’s, I don’t need to and shouldn’t feel the need to be admired by others to feel confident and loved. I shouldn’t be feeling jealous of everyone or everything. Yet I have this constant worry of blending in and being an average person who does not achieve anything special in his life. Yet here we are. And I don’t really know what to do about this? Are my emotions abnormal? Am I a narcissist?", "hash": "d9cb37d919c5cc2b5f6e313e6fe5ba26500917f10ca72e7265e6a07428ef5cc9"}

Aspergers by Akuma » Wed Sep 16, 2020 12:36 pm Well narcissism has a lot of different meanings, usually boiling down to some pathology in how people see themselves or how they regulate their self-esteem. \"Narcissistic disorder\" can mean any personality disorder and a \"narcissistic personality disorder\" is again a different thing, and can be described either by consulting the DSM, or by looking at psychodynamic explanations for example by Otto Kernberg or other authors, and describes very specific structural changes based on early experiences, and is again subclassed... So- aside from the forum rule not to diagnose people - that always complicates the situation. Normally you would go to a [psychodynamic / psychoanalytic] therapist for a few probatoric sessions and there you would get a diagnostic estimation, most likely from the perspective of their school of psychology. He also would then be able to give you options and directions as to which treatments might be available and how much sense they make for you. In that context he will probably also give you an approximation of the prognosis of such treatment in your specific case, based on said diagnosis, some quick structural / neurotic assessment he has made in the talsk with you and stuff like how psychology-minded you are, your motivation and other things. That being said - without evaluating any diagnosis here - a lot of what you list seems reactive to me; specifically reactive to someone who didnt have enough opportunity to learn interacting with others and regulating his self-image in relation to others in a more healthy way, perhaps. Ive also heard from someone else that theres a range of behaviors and stuff that can be similar in ASD compared to some other mental disorders including pathologies in narcissism, so there again, a differential by a professional seems the best choice. Last but not least, surprisingly many people seem to somehow link manipulativeness with narcissism, which isnt the case. Manipulativeness / Conning etc. are aspects of antisocial disorders. While there is the \"interpersonal exploitative\" point in the DSM for NPD, that has more to do with an unconscious using of others or taking stuff for granted, compared to an actual goal-oriented scheming to exploit them as seen on the ASPD spectrum. Hope that gives some pointers. dx: SPD", "hash": "5ee997f42aaac4491a490757af56d2446dfd0c0fb9a9e94e30155b24472984f1"}

Just so that you know, in case you are indeed struggling with narcissistic issues, most people with NPD would not readily see themselves as manipulative. This forum's history is filled with posts from people who admit to manipulative behaviors without realizing it, then go on the next sentence justifying how they are victims of circumstance or others. It's a classic. People with ASPD, in contrast, aren't as focused on how people perceive them, so they are naturally more forward about being manipulative. But NPD, being an image-based disorder, is always escorted by a strong need to rewrite the narrative, both in the eyes of the world and one's own eyes primordially. Which in itself constitutes manipulative behaviors, but likely to fly under one's own radar. On other Cluster B forums, you might come across a lot of disbelief as well, but this is unique to NPD: the undercurrent tinge of desperation to appear a certain way (good, wise, poised etc.), to a point of redefining the disorder if needs be.", "hash": "06e3efbc8ebf73483a6ed542c04b6c7c69915c453cd6aa01e82d5f9bb8cca288"}

Anyone else? Ive not read about any connection between shame and DP / DR. Ive had this a lot as a kid and still have it on and off nowadays, but I cant really find common causes to it - last few times I had it just wandering around town when I went to the grocery store. When I was looking at it a few days ago, it seemed to me like it was quite the opposite of a narcissistic activity, it seemed more like an amplification of the flat nature of experience, in a peculiar way almost a lessenign of positive self-investment. I think emptiness is a result of an absence of [good] internalized early objects. So a regression to a level of emptiness will naturally lead to an experience of that same emptiness. That inner emptiness might originate in a sort of a nondual reality, so when that emptiness was \"formed\" when inner and outer werent clearly established, now the inner core of all internal and outside reality is ultimately empty. DP I think can be an attack on certain connections, so a form of fragmentation... but I suppose can be also an awareness of that emptiness... possibly also as a result of having been brought up in an environment where you were supplied physically but not emotionally. So you are in a way an automaton, you can eat and $#%^ but you cant relax; a factor might also be something like insecure to fearful attachment, the basic absence of the good caregiver which leads to an inability to \"withdraw\" into the good internal caregiver womb. So theres nothing there, theres just emptiness. But its not the good emptiness of nonbeing that is the goal of the death instinct, but In that emptiness there is a formless consciousness that exists before god so to speak. In that way its not at all narcissistic. dx: SPD", "hash": "d7c46b6844fd8470980e90308573ccaacf23c66a0699f55e78049862d348218c"}

I just found out about this and sort of felt like it captured the sense of total ennui I've been experiencing lately. Except that it's not quite that but a combination of being collapsed/deflated, i.e losing all sense of agency, being very desperate, using people as objects even more than before. But then again am unwilling to fold and settle to looking for help (because I'm obsessed with my ASPD traits) that get augmented every now and again. The NPD part of me is actually the better half, go figure huh? What this mortification entails for me is sort of he grandiosity gap between what I envision my life to be and what it actually is as grown into the size of a canyon to the point of where I feel a strong sense of derealization. There is a part of me that is kind of keeping feet on the ground but when it gets dissociated my sense of being present really takes flight and I fall into some low-level psychosis type thing. Currently I seem to spend all my weekends (free time) in a total haze of depression, unwillingness and lack of agency to actually take up anything. It feels like childish pouting except the concepts I'm struggle with seem to be very Shakespearean (to be or not to be). (Preparations for) uicide hangs very high on my to-do list. *Disclaimer Personal story* Like yesterday I had a very odd situation with a girl who I was kind of taken in by (she is a gorgeous girl who is really conscientious, ambitious and also very intelligent and creative, basically everything that I wouldve aspired to be were it not for my mentall illness and it screams high status to me, not really my type but fit the bill of ideal supply. I knew I had no chance with her so even her taking a liking to me as a person was a win in my book.) So she fell in love with someone and when I inquired in a roundabout way who her new love interest was, she said something that the new guy is 10% of the reason why she wants to move out (we share an apartment) because from this guy she found out something through a random mention that kind of alludes to my past somehow and I immediately felt a sense of impending doom (because my first girlfriend of 4yrs and then my second of 2yrs both used to live in that same house once upon a time (big communal building) and I done both of them so wrong. Even my third girlfriend had connections to that house that I still rent a room in so basically it's all connected and makes me intensely paranoid. It felt like a sudden loss of control over who she thought I was because I had no clue what she couldve been told by this person who she did not want to divulge the identity of. So being left into the unknown felt extremely imposing and immediately rattled the thoughts of the necessity of suicide in my brain. /had too little sleep and too much coffee today, hence the rambling “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "8c7c879c9f21eba0ffebfe00afbbf170926dee36fdbb12468b7cf041d56fa49c"}

Ps: not totally sure, but my personal idea is that mortification is a death simulation, more than a real death. The subject needs to believe it's real 'though: differently, it wouldn't work. The goal of mortification is to protect the whole person from social exclusion, and from the real death that would come from that exclusion - considered that our survival depends on others, and even more when we are children. Then, if the Self isn't “right” for a particular social contest, the Self “kills” the Self, denies to exist in order to allow the individual to survive. But who is the individual? I think that the division between “Self” and “not Self” is more apparent than real: it's real from a superficial pov, not so real if you consider it deeper. The Self divided the Self in two parts, one part becomes something different, ignoring or acting against the Self; the masked Self looks like a second nature, but it's basically a derivation from the Self.

The situation I described in my initial post was really more like being close unmasking. As it pertains to that girl I referred to, she was kind enough to stil offer her acceptance and understanding (even if she in all actuality did not at all understand why I started acting odd and tried my best not to pry further i to the identity of the person and continue the conversation. It was near impossible though because it just completely enveloped my being. To discuss with her my shortcomings in previous relationships would have been just too much, hence mortification. Nice Selfserf. I wasnt aware the term existed in Freud. Yes, this Is what I experienced as well, an overwhelming lack of focus/drive, following my first period of isolation and intereflection, retreat into inner world (period of introversive libido, Jung). I can see you are using that time to reflect as well. Any signifcant dreams or hypnagogic visions? Can you write in more detail this grandiosity gap you speak of, what are your expectations? So this came as a sudden realization on the party? You said you started acting odd, and felt somewhat not in control of that? The Unmasking, you mean shame or what exactly?", "hash": "d89b1368847c25be519fe5ba0aa388655e6dbc6bbb45cbf747c3a5c0f5d1a820"}

I'm currently being assessed for a range of things and I wanted to see if I could speak to people with NPD to get your take/opinion on this. It's really hard trying to find any actual help or neutral info on NPD out there, it's all articles by supposed empaths talking about how evil narcissism is. Bleh. Anyway. I've always thought I had ADHD and anxiety, then when my doctor started talking about Personality Disorders, I did some research and thought hmm, alright. I can see how I could be a Cluster B, probably BPD. However, I've been unable to shake the idea I might have NPD. This is why.. I do have a very cultivated self image. I'm very aware of it and I lie to maintain it, all the time. I don't feel guilty for lying. I'm happy to lie to most people, even close friends or family. I behave in... I don't know, I don't think it's necessarily abusive ways, but then, of course I would say that. I suppose if I try to objective about it, then yes, I can see how my behaviour can be abusive. Obsessive. Gaslighting people. However, I think my empathy levels are higher than you'd have for a diagnosis of NPD. I don't think I have abundance of empathy, but I have some. Maybe less than your average person. I can be quite self centred. I'm insecure and it really bothers me if people don't like me (even if I hate them). I will be literally obsessed if I think someone is one-upping me, to the point of self destruction. I guess I do think about being powerful and successful, not I'm not that bothered, if that makes sense. I like a daydream as much as the next person but I don't seek out material stuff. If you asked me if I think I'm better than others... not necessarily. I go up and down. I think I'm unique but not necessarily better than everyone. Someone who hates me recently mentioned to a friend they think I have NPD and they had all this \"evidence\". It made me kinda pissed they were doing all this research on me and giving me this diagnosis. But to be fair to them it did make me think about it and I can see some of their points. But, they're also a bit messed up themselves and got a lot of wires twisted so I can't take them 100% seriously. I do like praise and admiration, sure. I guess I do seek it. And it's very much like \"woah!!\" like a rush, a hit, getting that good bit of admiration or something, and then it passes fast. So I feel like I'm always looking for that next hit and not appreciating it when good things happen. To be honest I think I'm probably going to end up with a diagnosis of BPD. But I am intrigued by the traits I have that correlate with NPD symptoms because I can see it. It's just goddamn hard finding neutral/supportive stuff out there for people with NPD. Even if I'm not NPD, I think I could benefit from it. My ego is so ridiculously sensitive and I do think it would do me good to be humbled a bit, and to feel bad when I hurt people even if I personally think they deserve it. Thanks for reading!

In addition its against the ruels here to try diagnosing someone anyways.

Are you able to keep up appearances well enough so as to go for a 9-5? Basically I’m finding out the hard way that I couldn’t handle a l”normal” 5-day workweek at this factory any longer. I’m simply too bad of a mixture of schizoid/antisocial/paranoid combined with BPD/derealization to handle what I deem simple tasks on some days. Like I might get super anxious and my panties in a twist so some mechanical stuff might suffer due to forgetfulness or being hazy, not to mention my incapability to have proper relationships. I got a job through one of my longest frienda/acquaintances (there’s been alienation) at his co-founded company that is a very progressive tech-minded reputable one that really has all the potential to be the next big thing and grabbing a considerable market share worldwide. So after a year or two of struggling and being in a very dark place. This really felt like the only real thing to give my life any real purpose because it actually felt like I was doing important work (Im covert so it’s always been am-special-through-association but after 6months am pretty much exhausted and so it seems that Ive worn out my welcome). Otherwise the vision of the company is something I can get behind and there are a lot of perks to staying there, but my mental issues have got in the way enough as to render attempts at staying futile. Basically prior to this been going off for around two years on what one would call secondary supply, trying to charm, entertain people to make my company worthwhile and all-encompassing self-loathing but I finally feel like am done. Am not a team-player and that company is really into tying together the whole workplace in a team-based way so I’ve been an immediate outlier. Tried my best to fake going along with it but it doesn’t come naturally at all and I keep defaulting (no real interest in others, do-my-work,go-home, repeat). Not capable of proper relations. I’ve also had quite a few ###$ (mostly Ive been more harsh as it pertains to these than my actual supervisors) and have reacted either too hot or with other issues too nonchalantly. The thing is I simply dont truly care enough and if am not doing anything challenging (it’s routineous work, although not ardoua) I get bored very easily and the work suffers.

The truth with narcissistic people is that they constantly need an audience to fulfil their image. Think of you and I are like a mirror to them and without this mirror (us) they are nothing special. Narcissists have this pseudo talent to make us feel disempowered and they play on our unwavering allegiance to those close to us for them to get their kicks, but the sad truth of the matter for them narcissists is that they are afraid of not being immortalised by existing in conversations way beyond their death’s. This master manipulator deep down is scared all the time that they won’t be remembered so they over-compensate and bully because of this paranoia, in turn giving us the true power and control over them; like my mum always says to me when I get stroppy and dig my heals in, she says “you’ll need me before I’ll need you.” and that has come to bite me in the arse on more than one occasion in my younger years.

This always surprises me. Apparently there is a lot of stuff I am missing out on that goes on between long-term partners...that I would not otherwise know about because they are, well, missing. My baseline is indifferent....or 'deadly calm.' Everything I do is cold and calculated. There's a lot of \"feelings\" I imitate for calculated reasons which I have gotten through observation...sometimes having a fake persona is like also being a director where I cue myself as to what I need to convey in a given moment and then I deliver. Anger is one of those feelings that I have gotten a lot of practice with imitating to the point I can pass it off as real, because it can be ideal for manipulation...however there is nothing real about it, because if somebody walks into the room who, for tactical reasons, I do not want to get that impression of me, I can instantly turn the \"anger\" off and maneuver into an outward presentation of positive and friendly, and then just instantly change the narrative, \"oh hey thanks for joining us, we were just discussing such and such...\" I'm big on the it never happened if nobody but my accuser witnessed it happen...but after awhile, these kinds of transitions can lead people to talk and they figure it out, so I found its better to just maintain a consistent mask of corporate and businesslike, unless in a more social atmosphere where humor, charm and something more prosocial is more useful. That said, I think I feel stuff genuinely, but they do not connect into my actions, and I can turn it on or off. I can like somebody and still, if I have an opportunity to take something I want from them, I'll do so, and then I'll get push back from them about \"I thought we were friends and had built a great rapport\", and I'm at a loss for what any of that means...at the end of the day, it's nothing personal. It is sort of the same with right and wrong.

She was also very open and forthcoming which was refreshing and told me about how she had dated a sociopath before who had been rough in bed so it had been odd to her that someone could actually be soft and caring to her instead (like it was odd to her that she was deserving of it, maybe?) In general I feel pretty numb to touch, (unless it comes out of left field, like spontaneous from others. then I get flushed with warmth for a second, if its like a random unexpected hug. But am not the cuddly type really, as I often feel like a piece of meat. I think that is just from objectifying myself for years on end. I don’t let people through my defenses these days anyhow so when it happens, I almost feel like a normal person (for a second there). Then I realize it’s completely at odds to how normal people react to such things. Like the pleasantries of social life that follow am not capable and completely resume (as was already notes) that formal-like way of interacting. The excitement of a welcoming female body nearby fades fast because I get stupored and don’t have a clue of how to act and basically retreat back into my detached state or shell. I think it’s like a way of being unassuming and unthreatening but that also means almost lifeless. Empathetic girls (esp. those I am into) have that effect for sure. Also, I often sense my body language and the way I go about things can be taken as aggressive (and downright solipsistic am often afraid).I’ve noticed a friend with ASPD to be somewhat similar in that regard. I’ve seen the non-scientific term “selfosexual” being thrown around somewhat on Quora which refers to the closed-down libidinal investment into our own Self. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "56abb0ff238c19518937fb38bc3c9c11b29adf7c1bf60bea7543d32faf62471c"}

Rather as someone who is subject to intense, almost overwhelming, primitive drives which I hold under rigid control as they aren't really fit for public consumption. As I've said before it's more Mr Spock in jackboots than Ted Bundy. This is a more in depth post on emotional poverty The situation of having to keep a large aspect of yourself under raps at least partially lends itself to the ingrained sense of alienation which is such a large part of my own make up. Though I suspect that some of the psychological aspects of interpersonal connectedness, particularly those involving group behaviours and concepts, are broken at a more fundamental level. I've always been subject to a fairly high level of addictive sexual behaviours, largely driven by a need to overcome my own sense of alienation. Sex itself is just a means to an end, the goal is and always has been intimacy which usually requires physical affection of some kind. I'm consistently very tactile with romantic partners, a big fan of 'soft touch' and one of natures natural cuddlers. My sexuality has such a heavy emphasis of sensuality over aggression, that there is a long running joke amongst my friends that I f*ck like a girl, albeit a proficient one. I like to revel in physiological sensation and place a high value on my sensory experience of another person. Unfortunately I find that the sense of intimacy diminishes rapidly the longer I am with a person and I end up using more and more intense methods to retain the experience of closeness, including, but not limited to, the infliction of pain and trauma. Generally it's better for all concerned if I cycle romantic partners frequently, usually to the tune of 14-18 per year, as it's not a good idea for any one person to be responsible for providing me with a sense of connectedness. That said I tend to be very 'other' focused so some sex acts, receiving oral sex for example, have less appeal unless under a very finite set of circumstances. Banging a couple of call girls whilst admiring my muscles in a mirror à la Patrick Bateman, is about as alien to my character as it is possible to be.", "hash": "5765c5d7f0ef9ca5070a7b7e16f13d9b424de8c2b4c51d85f34650a1da73b5ad"}

(All take, no give) I think you’re either overthinking this or heading off in realms of crazy for which I have no frame of reference. The business about wishing to postpone orgasm, is very reminiscent of Gilles Deleuze‘s notion of the underlying dynamic behind masochism. The psychosomatic pain because you’re irritated by someone touching you is not something I’ve ever even read about. My own reasoning was rather more banal. I find blowjobs a bit lacklustre (probably as the result of circumcision), i feel they’re something a lot of women do as a matter of course because it’s expected of them, I personally wouldn’t want someone’s nob in my mouth so I feel a bit bad for them and at the end of the day I like to be able to interact face to face, either verbally or through touch. Frankly blowjobs always feel a bit impersonal to me and i’ll take a suitably affectionate kiss over one any day of the week, though I appreciate I am likely to be in a minority in this regard. Penetrative sex itself can suffer from the same problem if approached too mechanically. My philosophy in regards to sex generally is that it should be relaxed, based in good communication and for the most part, fun. If you can’t laugh when someone’s genitalia makes an amusing flatulent sound or someone falls off the bed, to my mind, you’re doing it wrong. Even messing around with blood and other weirdness, it pays not to take it too seriously. Passion is something which ebbs and flows on its own, which you can ride but never force or hold on to. And good sex, first and foremost, should flow. I’m usually going to be against anything which feels too forced, scripted, mechanical or contrived which I what I was trying to get at in part with the Bateman remark. What you’re describing sounds far more complex and intense, sex as a surrogate for some other kind of interpersonal dynamic or similar.", "hash": "9c9f4ff1da969455074af51d1ea2a6fef92d18bff17d3f1beff68e1bdd5575d8"}

First of all sorry for the late reply, I didnt see your post at all. Usually its customary to tell the new therapist about diagnoses and about your past encounters with therapists and forms of therapy, as it can make categorization for the new one easier. But it depends a bit on the therapist. An experienced psychodynamic therapist for example will not really require information about the diagnosis as he will diagnose you on the fly while in probatoric ssessions and their diagnosis can be quite different in how its achieved as comparing to diagnsoes based on the DSM etc. Its also true many peopel in the field have issues themselves that they project onto certain disorders, so if you are uncertain about it, maybe just give him the information about yourself that you feel you want to share at this point. You can share more later when youve realized some form of trust. So in any event, I wouldnt stress about it too much. dx: SPD", "hash": "a15a465691c39c2ed00430a54c99cfce4083a34489bcd6bd224aac331115d8a3"}

The problem was that as soon as I was able to take off, fly around a bit and land without assistance, that was enough for me. I can now fly a plane (tick), so the extra effort required to do the exams, get my license and talk to boring people about constantly changing CAA regulations just didn't seem worth the effort and was very, very dull. I also have issues with repetitive tasks; they drive me insane. If I play games on the PS4, I play them on the easiest setting, as I want to get through the game, not repeat the same section over and over to beat it. ###$ that; usually I just give the controller to the wife and go do something else while she finishes it. I'm currently waiting for her to be in the mood to finish a part of Tomb Raider that's making me want to break things. However, my biggest block is doing ###$ all. The more I do the more I feel motivated to do; the less I do the less I want to do. There is an upside though; I've done considerably more than the average person, as I tend to be very impulsive and will go and do stuff that others will carefully consider and possibly decide against. I'm not arguing; I'm explaining why I'm right.", "hash": "512426b00560ac8273b77b5d2d3d322ff5df4d3ee544570756f50c1d83d2651b"}

Though my husband had issues, one (far from the only!) reason I wanted to leave him was that he’d initially made me excited by checking all the boxes of the admiration I wanted- proposing with a fancy ring, showing plenty of PDA to make me feel loved around family and friends, going on fancy vacations with me- but once I “accomplished” all this and was left with day-to-day life with him, I got bored. I promptly became involved with a very high-status and rich guy. I love associating with him; I feel special. He also makes me feel special because he is very difficult to “handle”; he says he isn’t sure he’s ever capable of love again, but if there’s anyone in the world whom he’d love, it would be me. This attitude means that even small positive gestures from him give me a tremendous high: I reckon I must be extremely special if I cause him to break down his stone-cold nature. He went through a random phase recently of becoming very religious and saying we couldn’t have sex outside of marriage, then totally withdrawing from me and spending basically all his time either at the office or home alone (I know he was actually home alone, not with another woman, bc I have a friend who lives next door to him and other reasons). I decide I’ll start moving on. One night he wants to meet for dinner; I cry a bit about how much I loved him and he says that he’s just haunted by past breakups and just doesn’t think he can do it again. I say “well I guess that’s it,” but suddenly he’s back constantly wanting my attention and to make plans. I’d mentioned talking to a new guy, so he asks to come over, then he asks me more about this new guy while HE has sex with me. We then have a nice candlelit dinner etc. I feel this man is also a narcissist; he gets a high from my attention when he knows I’m forsaking him for other options (and I’m honestly super attractive and successful myself). I realize I could find many men, very quickly, without this man’s issues. But I DON’t WANT TO. All I want to do is figure out how to keep this “relationship.” So here’s my question- since I’m clearly a narcissist and prefer unhealthy choices, how do I ever find a “happy” relationship?!", "hash": "5976480d06e0c55ac6a1c41fb20b3ba6905ec7b4fe4119991be62693f62fdb80"}

All I want to do is figure out how to keep this “relationship.” So here’s my question- since I’m clearly a narcissist and prefer unhealthy choices, how do I ever find a “happy” relationship?! I think a lot of people with narcissistic issues have this kind of trouble, not only people diagnosed with NPD proper. You have a certain \"learned\" way of interacting with your significant others, maybe even in the form of a trauma bond, and maybe its desctructive, or always fails, or always feels like a dead end, somehow the brainw ants to go there nevertheless because its such a well-trodden path. I would say that getting out of this is actually a quite long and hard path, because it either requires you to try forcing yourself into something that might feel awkward, insecure or wrong, or it requires a basic change in personality that you kind of grow into... actually desiring, tolerating and hopefully finally even enjoying a more healthy relationship. In that regard not wanting unhealthy ones anymore is a good first step I think. I am not sure if one can do much by oneself though. Narcissistic issues are always issues after all where we are very much in our own head and we require some outside perspectives to rearrange our thought processes over time. So - eventhough I dislike boring people with such standard replies - I would always think that looking for a capable therapist to support you in such an endeavour is one of the top choices. in that process you can over time try to mold yourself into a person which is more open to peopel who are not destructive in the long run. dx: SPD", "hash": "623aa0cf68e6dbbb80b252badcb4dbff65ebd77c270c479242bfd55aa7dfc91c"}

My boyfriend and I have been fighting from the start of the relationship. I think, in the beginning, he didn't treat me correctly and since then I have become tyrannical in a sense. I don't mean to be but I guess it could be said that I am. He has said to me a number of times that I snap and it scares him and I've gotten more violent. As soon as that happened, I called my psychologist and psychiatrist immediately and scheduled an appointment. I understand that being violent is not the solution. However, it is a reaction to what I explained as being broken to the point of where I keep giving him chances to make amends and he says he will and then tries to hide that he has broken them. I found out something he did. At first, it was a hunch so I asked him directly. He told me that I was being paranoid and delusional and that I need to be institutionalized again. A few minutes later, he came out with the truth and I lost it. It's like a domino effect where all this stuff just keeps happening. Neither of us are in a situation where we could just leave due to COVID 19. This makes me feel like I'm keeping him hostage as he really has nowhere else to go due to being retrenched. I feel like he is just pulling an act until he can just run away. I feel awful. I've said to him a number of times that if he wants to leave, he can. That I would find him somewhere to stay. But I don't think he believes me. I feel like an absolute monster. He says he would have been long gone if I was anyone else, but I'm charming and pretty (basically low self confidence on his part) and intelligent so he keeps getting pulled back. I can't believe I have transgressed so badly since my dropped assault charge. I really don't want to be this way.

When I look at the intro of what you wrote, you say, that he didnt treat you well initially and you turned into what you call tyrannical, so when I read that correctly you are trying to control him a lot. But why did you stay in the relationship if it was clear to you from the start that something was wrong? This might be just me, but I actually have quite a black/white view on this kidn of thing. In my opinion a relationship is quite a fragile thing and you need openness and trust for it. So if one person cant speak openly, or there is abuse or fear involved that is not only problematic, in my view one instance of that damages the whole relationship. Irrepairably. So while I would second ESmokes idea, I would look at it a bit differently. If you want to try staying together, and if there is an option for you to somehow pair your therapy in a way - also if you two are even open to that idea - then I would maybe look at the relationship issues more through the lense of your personal psychologies, and vice versa, in contrast to trying to repair the relationship or to regain control over it; so trying to shift the focus away from you vs me towards a more internal view of whats going on inside you from moment to moment and how it connects to your past experiences etc. But I guess if thats an option is also something that requires you to sit down and figure it out together. dx: SPD", "hash": "7ff12898b3cf55f823db7fdf8ca6d9a845f810113b5462169c5ab7a49a9eead4"}

The problem really lies with this underlying foundation of mutual distrust. This has created from my point of view a polarity in his personality. One moment he can be utterly fantastic and the next he can be horrid. Sometimes this can swing in seconds. It makes me utterly confused. I can handle someone being fully stoic or fully emotional but I don't know which one he is because it swings with very little variance. I'm not sure if the trust he broke can be fixed at this point. I don't feel as if you can look at a relationship from a day to day stand point. You need to look at it holistically. I feel that I put myself into his shoes when we fight and that he doesn't care to put himself into mine. He will apologize and then do the same thing. I asked him what sorry meant to him and he said that sorry meant that he could understand how I feel, not that sorry meant any sort of remorse or that the word itself means nothing in comparison to making amends to the person. I'm not saying that I am being treated fairly. I'm just saying that I am getting violent and it's escalating. It's not consciously intentional but more a subconscious reaction. It is an impulsive action that seems almost like an emotional defence with a physical offence to get him to feel the pain he is putting me through. He doesn't try to understand me, as an individual. He piles me into \"all woman\" and fits me into that narrative. For example, he hid a lot of things from me in the beginning... Well, he still does, and in one of our mutual things that we do together in a group, I saw someone with a female name that he has always referred to as a male. So I phone him and ask him. He believes my motives are jealousy but my motive is to understand if there has been a misunderstanding and if so, why he tried to hide it from me intentionally. Additionally, we clash in terms of I will outright say what I want to say and want to settle a matter. He will avoid saying anything until he acts out. He said yesterday that there are a few things that I do that we can speak with the psychologist. This is still making me feel uneasy in terms of stuff once again being hidden from me. I feel very much deceived and confused as to whether this is paranoia or not. It doesn't help that he made it out that I was paranoid when it turns out I was not as it just muddies the water. Datura is asking if he acted back with violence if it would deescalate or escalate the violence. It would definitely escalate the fight. I'm not sure how much it would escalate the violence. It just depends on what the fight is about. Anyway, for a number of factors we cannot be apart for now. He is also involved with business within my family so that makes it more difficult.", "hash": "5cb04d0209979cbf30f589ea5399a5054671c24b4e49a6e115d67811b785c718"}

I also want to be back in my old city in a place with a playroom for my snakes and a patio that I can sit outside privately and have a couple planters on. As for material possessions, the only thing I can think of at the moment is to still have my (or a) car. Recently, I realized I'm no longer capable of relationships. A little while back, I started talking to someone very nice and as soon as I felt like I was getting mentally/emotionally close and vulnerable with them, I started having panic attack after panic attack after panic attack after panic attack. I stopped sleeping, dissociated worst than normal. It was so bad, I stopped talking to them because I wanted the $#%^ I was going through to end. I think I'd be better at being a therapist than doing support work type stuff. It ######6 blows though because to be able to counsel as a social worker, you don't need more than a bachelor's to get work, but places won't hire anyone psychology based unless they have a Masters or PhD or PsyD. Even then, there's very few jobs for them. Social workers are too busy being feminists, etc. that they don't focus enough on research or how the mind operates, biology or interpersonal dynamics or any of that. Also, I find feminism, sjws, and social work extremely triggering (probably one of the most enraging things in my life) If I got a proper education, I thought it would be cool to do research and put together a coping and effectiveness skills kind of thing for people who are institutionalized due to being in the prison system (and want to stay out), etc. As for self-improvement, I'd like to work on my emotional intelligence among other issues I've recently discussed around here, I want to be able to ground myself/practice mindfulness, do more things based in nature and be able to sit quietly and peaceful when I want to. I'd like to be willing to meditate again too.

I've noticed mine sometimes develops a different personality without me intending it to, and I don't I realize until afterwards. My mental health caseworker left me a voicemail some time back and I didn't call back, so he dropped me which meant I no longer got a small associated financial supplement. I didn't want to call him back because I acted in a manner that made him really uncomfortable and maybe feeling angry or threatened or upset. I justified it (aka to avoid feeling guilty and needing to apologize) by thinking of the number of times I've been victimized by people in positions of power in the mental health field ---- and the fact that even though I had a letter from my psychiatrist from my old city saying I needed therapy not antipsychotics shoved upon me, he wouldn't help me get it. ( After almost a year of asking, I went over his head right in front of him to my psychiatrist, and a therapist who dealt with me in group, in order for me to get into therapy which also pissed him off. ) The thing is, if I'm honest with myself, it wasn't intentional and I don't know why I did it to him. I became another person without meaning to and didn't notice until thinking about it after his voicemail. Then I noticed it with my psychiatrist around the same time frame. I was still being honest, but my mannerisms all switched into an entirely different person. Again, I didn't mean to become that person. Then I think about my therapist which I adore, and I become very agreeable with, full of admiration and put her up on a pedestal. I have reason to admire her because she's actually very impressive, but it's not who I am in real life. To note: she's aware of who I am in real life because I talk about it; it's just weird that I become a different person in my interactions with her - almost childlike. Very sweet and docile, if I'm angry and low on patience, I avoid her to make sure I don't lash out on her. It's like, instead of consciously figuring out how to act in situations that are stressful to me, I unconsciously step back into autopilot and let some other aspect of me step in and take the wheel. I'm as surprised as anyone as to which part comes out. Also, when I was taking my courses I tried to act very friendly, nice, dumb myself down and clown around - which is genuinely part of who I am at times. But a huge part of me acting like that was more because I knew I didn't see eye to eye with them and I come from a completely different place than them. Part of my personas are that if I come into something with a really strong personality (when I have it), people will instantly become defensive and want to try to challenge me - sometimes a whole bunch of people all at once. I don't have the desire, energy or willingness to even attempt to engage in pissing contests (I'm not smart enough on how to \"win\" at doing so anyways) so I try to enter in very passive and polite and friendly and bubbly, but I can't always be that for very long. The contrast of me switching from being really docile and agreeable to a more aggressive and intense person probably made it even worse with them. That's when there become problems for me. I really do wonder if my social retardation is because I have aspergers/high functioning autism sometimes (among my cluster ###$ of other disorders)", "hash": "3ed20457e7cb566b4c8d91b7418e1130dbf07af32a95ff1e762c23f34cd3ac06"}

In so far as I know I’m aware of the impression I’m trying to give and why I’m doing it. it’s difficult to catch yourself doing something deliberate. Having had a brief look on wiki here’s the paragraph about the absence of the persona: The alternative is to endure living with the absence of the persona—and for Jung \"the man with no persona... is blind to the reality of the world, which for him has merely the value of an amusing or fantastic playground.\" Inevitably, the result of \"the streaming in of the unconscious into the conscious realm, simultaneously with the dissolution of the 'persona' and the reduction of the directive force of consciousness, is a state of disturbed psychic equilibrium.\" Those trapped at such a stage remain \"blind to the world, hopeless dreamers... spectral Cassandras dreaded for their tactlessness, eternally misunderstood.\" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(psychology ) I mention this because of an irony some of you may not be aware of: Cassandra is the OP’s previous username, she’s one of the forum’s resident “empaths”.

Empathy isn't a pathology any more than intelligence or physical attractiveness are. Declaring that you have superhuman levels of any of the above could probably be called grandiosity. In my view the key issue is that not everything which is called empathy actually is. In psychotic projection where a schizophrenic projects their thoughts or internal monologue onto other people the afflicted individual may end up believing they are telepathic, when in reality schizophrenics have some of the poorest social cognition of all groups of the mentally disordered. The less extreme defences seen in personality disorders also occur below the conscious level and are often experienced by the disordered person as an intense form of emotional intuition, which can conceivably be inappropriately labelled as empathy. People diagnosed with BPD are particularly well known for the belief that they have some sort of highly tuned emotional radar which has little bearing in reality.", "hash": "1d6ee1eefa22939cbed134ff7069898d4f287888cc227ad76ae841d4d0a28843"}

Its an anonymous forum, nothing to worry about. Simple example of such a omnipotent fantasy is I am suddenly surrounded by a pack of wolves growling at me. I somehow know exactly how to behave and know to turn to the pack leader and somehow this wolf sees I am strong and respectful of him and respects me back and they don't harm me. (in writing it seems pretty ridiculus, somehow somehow somehow it all works out miraculously and i feel all is well) Having these fantasies empower me, I can handle anything and I feel strong. I think the explanation for them can be found in object relation theory. The baby sees the world as either all good or all bad. When mother is present all is good, when she is gone all is bad. And baby's defence against the bad is by sort of locking it out of himself, in his imagination having full control of the situation so the bad cannot reach him. So these omnipotent fantasies are a defence mechanism. I'm certainly no expert on these thing but to me this seems to fit. Unfortunately this defence mechanism isn't working so well for me anymore.

Do you just consider yourself to be narcissistic? This seems like the words out of someone who has obsessive compulsive thoughts about these power fantasies and perhaps being a narcissist rather than a PD. Firstly, normalise your behaviour. Thinking about something and actually doing something, or going out of your way to plan an action to make your fantasy a reality, are two different things. Everyone has fantasies of power and doing harmful things to someone or taking revenge. They are completely normal and a healthy way of letting your brain come to terms with social interaction that may have hurt you. However, when you start writing a 400 page manifesto on how you intend to take revenge is probably when you need help to deal with underlying feelings. However, if you were that willing, I doubt you would ask for help to not have fantasies if you are already making plans for them to become reality. You would pose the question as help in not making your fantasies a reality. Seek a therapist and use CBD and DBT to normalise your thoughts and perhaps help with some of your anxiety. They may even suggest going on a mild antidepressant and diazepam. This may help with dealing with anxiety around social interaction. Honestly, we all are different people on the outside to what we are on the inside. If we all went around saying exactly what we think about people, it would lead to conflict.", "hash": "188770d05a5d8413e5eb9bfe4b79ec4d94282cd834b8e76c0a8b6e9d6fdb1269"}

Is this what they mean when they say other people are seen as an extension of the narcissist and if so are there any other good examples of it? I feel like this is another thing that gets misunderstood a lot, but I’m not sure Projection is used by all sorts of people. You could call it a narcissistic defense, but basically everytime someone projects, depending on the level from which he projects from he will either see himself, or parts of himself in another person, group or object. Certain self-help groups are a good example of externalized functions of conscience for example, that both stabilize the personality but also make it more rigid and hard to evolve. Borderliners project, too of course. Its that combination with rapid splitting which makes it especially hard for them to get better, as its always that absolutely horrible other persons fault. Anyways in case you dont have access to it, I'll just post you two relevant quotes from Kernberg, eventhough his ideas are of course only his take on it, maybe its helpful -> Kernberg, Borderlien Conditiosn and Pathological Narcissism, pp322 wrote: \"In general, all neurotic conflicts interfere with the optimal relationships of the self with the various instances and structures mentioned. At the same time, the establishment of pathological character patterns as defenses against direct conflictual relations with others and direct confrontation with the forbidden oedipal impulses protect the functioning of the ego and the self; they also protect self-esteem, that is, they have a narcissistic function. Therefore, all patients with neurotic reactions and character pathology have \"narcissistic problems\": there is a pathological vulnerability of the self, defended against by the pathological character traits, so that when these traits are explored ~nd resolved analytically, narcissistic frustrations and conflicts become activated. (...) A more severe type of narcissistic disturbance can be found in cases where the self has developed pathological identificatory processes to such an extent that it is modeled predominantly on a pathogenic internalized object, while important aspects of the self (as relating to . such an object) have been projected onto object representations and external objects. This severer type of narcissistic pathology refers to individuals who (in their intrapsychic life of object relations and in their external life) identify with an object and love an object standing for their (present or past) self. (...) It needs to be stressed, however, that within this more pathological relation of the self identified with an object to an object identified with the self, an object relation still exists namely, a relation between self and object, both intrapsychically and in external interactions. A still severer type of narcissistic pathology is characterized by a more profound deterioration of object relations, in which the relation is no longer between self and object but between a primitive, pathological, grandiose self and the temporary projection of that same grandiose self onto objects. The relation of a pathological grandiose self to a temporarily projected pathological grandiose self is characteristic of the narcissistic personality, a specific type of character pathology representing the most severe form of pathological narcissism. ibid p265 wrote: The difference between narcissistic personality structure and borderline personality organization is that in the narcissistic personality there is an integrated, although highly pathological grandiose self, which, as I have suggested earlier, reflects a pathological condensation of some aspects of the real self (the \"specialness\" of the child reinforced by early experience), the ideal self and the ideal object (the fantasy of an ever-giving, ever-loving and accepting parent, in contrast to the child's experience in reality, a replacement of the devalued real parental object). (...) The integration of this pathological, grandiose self compensates for the lack of integration of the normal self-concept which is part of the underlying borderline personality organization: it explains the paradox of relatively good ego functioning and surface adaptation in the presence of a predominance of splitting mechanisms (...) Now the distinction between what constitutes a grandiose-self proper from a \"normal\" projective mechanism is a bit unclear and I dont have time to look for a good explanation. It might suffice to say that what is pointed at is early represantations of primitive inner images that can be a bit psychosis-like / toddler-level and who are more like precursors to \"person\" and \"thing\". So in a way saying that another \"person\" is an extension is inaccurate because on that level it is exactly not a person but a conglomerate of early self and object representations that have not much to do with the other person or with personhood - which is exactly why it can lay the ground for paranoid or negativistic projections as seen in PPD or ASPD f.e. Just for the sake of some pseudo-completeness I would point at a book by Bernard barnett called \"You Ought To\" which goes into the history of the super-ego concept and which might explain parts of these things a bit more accessible than kernberg and the likes. dx: SPD", "hash": "a34c5eb7b8a51fb89e6673c1482c53b288365d897f5b2ae2f0b1f9aa4b40b6fe"}

I suspect we may both be narcissists (grandiose him, covert me) but I have an alternative explanation for both of us and I have difficulties in choosing between the two. Let's start with him since it seems easier, maybe I'll do another post for my own differential diagnosis later. He seems a textbook narcissist and I don't understand if he has an insecure core or a psychopathic core. Please, don't question the options I'm considering because I'm not writing everything (of course I have a lot of evidence of him being very manipulative, lacking empathy, pushing boundaries and being extremely charming and unable to bond -not only with me-. I don't know if he is antisocial. I know that he changes jobs often and that he has a huge need for stimulation. I also saw a little of his carelessness amd impulsivity but I don't know the extent of it). I'm just writing a tiny sample of things that make me difficult to choose between the two options... If there is any way to differentiate the two without looking at a brain scan. I was hoping other narcissist could help, because you know how you yourself look like. -When criticized he devalues me and shifts the blame. He never loses control when doing that, he is just quick to become patronizing and to put me down while smiling. A typical answer to (unintentional/imagined -I never told him something with the intention of hurting him-) criticism would be something like \"Oh, the crazy fantasies of little girls always make me laugh\". Is he doing that because it works (psychopath) or because he feels threathened (narcissist)? Is it a projection of bad intentions or a manipulative tactic to keep me insecure? I never catched him overtly defensive. -We were searching for another woman in order to do a threesome and we failed. He told me something like \"it's her loss\"... Well, if no one was interested maybe we weren't offering that good of a deal. Does he believe he is a gift from God himself (unassailability of psychopaths) or was he protecting himself from the pain of failure/rejection (compensatory narcissism)? -Before having sex for the first time he told me, unprompted, he was \"pretty big\". Did he said that because he lacks inhibitions or because he thought this would improve his chances to have sex with me or because he needed to regulate his self esteem? -He seems fearless when considering non verbal cues. He never fidgets, he talks fast (so I would think he is not concerned with finding the right thing to say), we both have a slightly weird way to manage eye contact and it would seem like it's not natural for him to break it under pressure... Is he fearless because he is (psychopath) or because he feels superior to me (narcissist)? He always puts himself in situations I find a little risky, but nothing over the top as far as I know -not that he would tell me-. -He refused some money I offered to pay for a prostitute for him (don't judge) because \"We don't pay for sex. We don't need it\". Was it because paying for sex is humiliating? Because he wants to be in control and if I'm the one who pays, I'm the one in control? Because he thought that refusing was more fun and spectacular and pleasant? Because he wants to be seen as noble? And does he want to be seen as noble to be admired, to gain my trust and loyalty or just because it's the first thing that he felt like doing and it seemed fun and why not? -He uses a lot of big words. Is he trying to sound intelligent/royal or it's just that he doesn't care about rules, let alone implicit ones? I avoid big words because I'm inhibited and I care a lot about the judgment of others, so maybe he doesn't because he is the opposite. He seems to care about being elegant/proper (he refused to go with me to do some outdoor activities that can be seen as \"for poors\"; he is always well groomed and takes care of his body, takes a lot of selfies... Once he even told me I wasn't being elegant, but he also wanted to stop me to do what I was doing, so maybe it was instrumental)", "hash": "cf200488d289c186b6ff4af1b8e045b8a03f9f11fec5645a9d6d27daea995bc4"}

I am not sure if you are asking me, or if you are looking for it by yourself... However, it's a subtle sensation, it's hard to articulate. Mainly, I perceive the common narcissist (not the pathological one) as a structured “personality”: the body is well- structured, and the behaviour is quite constant, conditioned by the need to confirm the fake self-image. My perception can change when the narcissistic personality is so strong that it turns towards psychosis.

I read a book half a year or so called \"adult children of emotionally immature parents\" (i think ?); since then I find the term emotionally immature is quite fitting for an array of behaviors and structural deficits; moreso than \"narcissism\" or other terms actually which might be too broad to be descriptive. Exactly this. The difference is just that emotional development stops at a different age; I suspect that it's really archaic for psychopathy. Moreover, there is maybe another difference (as you mention too): for someone it's an arrested development, for others it's a regression. Not an expert, but as far as I know for some psychosis (for example, schizophrenia) it's a gradual regression, and it mainly concerns logical and cognitive skills. “Humor is reason gone mad.\" “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”", "hash": "7c85e4bae88ed49facefe838a20a97b5a40f6c9e7e540e496b671cfac66eda37"}

In general, I get very happy and bubbly. Friendly. If I straight continue to black out drunkenness, there is this line where I cross and I get super sad and cry. I think its tiredness. Or hunger. Well, I can't drink now anyways so thats over. But if I sober up with coke, or mix with X, it doesn't go into that landslide. On both coke, X and speed I am super talkative and bubbly. Weed - is a no. I get really bad anxiety. Honestly hate the stuff and people on it are just stoopid. This whole thing about it being awesome is ridiculous. If you have any sort of anxiety, it tends to worsen it and naturally makes you more depressed. 0/5. I used to enjoy it when I was younger but it's never been the same. Acid is a coin toss. I can get bad anxiety. But I have had some good trips where I went around skipping and making \"for tonight\" friends, being bubbly etc. I had a time where I really connected with a Bonsai tree. Shrooms are such a hit and miss. Hardly ever get visuals with them and the one time I was convinced half my brain had shut off. Or I was dying. And all my friends were running around screaming like chickens. So, I would say I stick to the things that make me bubbly and extroverted and stay away from the things that make me want to be in a straitjacket. I also stay away from jagermeister (although drunk me tends to sneakily order it) and tequila because its just gross. Whiskey, neat on rocks or Vodka with water is generally what I used to enjoy. Being an H addict. All I can say is I ended up listening to a lot of music, lost track of time, wrote a lot of #######4 and was unable to go to the toilet or orgasm.

Very occasionally I can be brooding and cranky. In either event I'm less harsh than I am sober. I should also mention that the men in my family tend to have bad reactions to beer and get quite violent. Consequently we're all big spirit drinkers. My uncle Hans can tuck away a couple of large bottles of cognac and still hold a cheery and polite conversation with his in laws but after a few pints he's apoplectic with rage and trying to hit people with the furnishings. In all honesty I've never really got drunk on a lot of beer so I've no idea what effect that has. I'm usually a fan of scotch, Brandy and liqueurs. Also cocktails, the more offensively effeminate the better. Weed: Probably the best for me as it dampens down the background hum of aggression which I experience most of the time and makes me less sharp. It comes with a serious downside in the form of the reduction in physiological sensation, a bit like having your senses wrapped in cotton wool. Sex on weed for example, is a waste of everyone's time and energy. I smoked a lot during my late teens early twenties and only ever got a mildly euphoric floaty sensation, no paranoia. Coke: I usually avoid it as it's a bit of a weird one for me, generally it just makes me feel sharper. I'm pretty certain I could successfully operate under its influence. The downside is that it removes the brakes, so that the mile wide streak of sadism that runs through my personality and is normally nailed well down gets to run around naked in the rain making rude gestures at passers by. I'm can be gleefully cruel on coke and will take any opportunity to get nasty. Opiates: Not recreational but I've had tramadol, morphine, fentanyl and diamorphine in fairly high doses. They just make me spaced out. I was given an overdose a couple of times which had me visually hallucinating before passing out, no delusions though, I knew full well I was seeing things. Drugs alway strike me as fundamentally social things, or for a specific type of socialising which involves clubs, house parties and the like. Chucking myself down the side of a mountain, round a track,out of a plane or just generally roaming around the back of beyond is more how I like to get my jollies.

Sorry, but a lot of them were extremely unempathic when it comes to certain problems. I have recognized it a lot.. Personally, I think it belongs to the human/the character. So, isn't it a bit naive and dumb to expect empathy in all areas (family, relationships, job..)? Sometimes I think that this empathic people do not know what empathy means? Especially that there are huge differences between the cognitive/emotional (affective)/somatic. A lot of them do not know that, lol. You know I have recognized affective empathy a lot in the faces of people, mostly when they experienced something similar - despite the psychotherapist I had. She was really emotional empathic (and didn't experienced the same). So isn't empathy based on our morals (right/wrong)? Oh, and a lot of ,,normal people'' expect empathy, but do not have it at all. lol. I have just narcisstic traits (however my cognitive empathy is quite good), but my former friends and work-mates were kind of that. I think that they are just weak people (in case of beeing that needy), because of needing help, but not giving that engagement back. They are much more egotistical than me, and didn't had my analytical thinking/methods. I was extremely good at solving their problems according to get to their core problematique (they were too stupid/too afraid for that..). However, I know that people are complex (they do not... lol).

She mostly socialised with quite brutal people or people bordering on having learning difficulties. If anything needed sorting out, a shouting match or one party or the other walking away was how it was done. I haven't made a career of getting an average-ish degree though I did publish writing modestly for a time. My time isn't spent on highbrow pursuits. I don't parade my learning and have certainly let myself go a bit. We began this friendship after meeting in a cafe, and it would often be therapeutic - just to have company, trot out some funny lines, kill time - but all the while she was on the verge of mistrust, expecting the worst. I was sympathetic and would tread lightly. But then what was apparent was what in other contexts would be called 'inverted snobbery'. I used the word 'cutlery' once and even that made her angry. She didn't know how to bracket me really - this man who was neither browbeaten or fooled nor ever going to shout or get violent. There was something she couldn't have or couldn't be, or so she has been led for decades to believe. She would demonise these things outside her. Worse, one of her daughters was dyslexic also, and she'd start to mock me in front of the daughter and poison her, basically. It was as if she was starting a little subculture, establishing its parameters, kind of what a lot of dysfunctional families do in their four-walled Republics. I think it's a mistake to start to formulate a demonised view of traits and behaviours that are for the most part virtuous and beneficial that you maybe happen to struggle with or that seem to be alien or something synthesised or that seem impossible to synthesise - this way one can only compound being unreachable and compound difficulties in reaching others. That is a dead end. I don't know - is this a case of turning frustration to aggressive-defensivity? On the internet, talking to strangers across the world, despite the trolling nonsense no one is any real harm or threat. I'm nearly 50 and have nothing, have remembered my friend reading your post, and am typing this calmly with fraternal feeling. Can you talk yourself down from deconstructing empathy in this unhelpful way? Yes, a lot of people are awful and hypocrisy exists, but going from specifics to coalescing a worldview in abstractions based on this in a fixed, overly defensive way is something else. I have recently resumed speaking to someone with NPD who I care about. I don't know how we will navigate what comes next, but I'm open, I think she is approaching openness.

I think we're drawn to change; it encapsulates everything that we're about. Even touch needs to have change to be felt. Having money doesn't make anyone happy. Getting money and spending money does, so it's the change in state that motivates us. Power represents our ability to overcome something or someone else, but if that becomes the status quo then we have nothing to be powerful over. So, we either set bigger and bigger goals, which will eventually become unachievable, or we knock what we've built down and start again. Maybe we cause conflict because we want something to fix. Maybe we ###$ ourselves up because it gives us a lower platform to build from. Everyone damages themselves, which should represent a failure in evolution. So, is it a failure or a way of finding meaning in what would be a mundane world if everything was working perfectly? Do we need to be self-defeating to be successful?

Originally, I dealt with him when he facilitated a couple of group therapy sessions and he'd use way too many personal examples involving his childhood and the many ways women have hurt him (an extremely inappropiate level of self-disclosure in a therapeutic setting for many reasons). The part I played in the experience was agreeing to work with him. Even when I was I waiting for a referral for one on one, all I hoped for was \"not him\" That level of discomfort is not how you should start off with a therapist. I remember him complaining about \"those types of girls with their tits hanging out of their shirts\" and then looked at me, eyes widened as if shocked by what he just said, and then exclaimed, \"Uh oh. I shouldn't have said that.\" I have to admit that I was entertained by that level of (still relatively innocent) faux pas. When he started directing his criticisms of women at me it became a problem and soon after that, he ended up in a situation that led to him giving me a referral to someone else. I was actually really proud of myself because I was able to recognize that he was triggered and that it wasn't personal which is extremely rare in regards to me experiencing personal issues with others. On a tangent (of course), Sometimes I get weird invasive images or feelings that come up for people, and with him, I saw him naked wearing nothing but a diaper with a thing on his head and a rattle too like in the fetish porn, lolz. I found it strangely entertaining and fascinating to try to psychoanalyze him - and myself given that babies freak me right out (after I stopped working with him, of course).", "hash": "31ae4d12566b5a352df7596ceb2362529ce5246c80fda6fd5180841d780b5ba5"}

Well thats the big drawback with diagnosing with those lists like DSM, NPI etc. there is always overlap and ultimately all you will show is that a persons answers correlate somehow with a given set of \"symptoms\".

Although you don´t actually act that way. Blatantly it´s malignant NPD.

As I understand the born-ASPD brain is completely alien to the neurotypical one as opposed to someone who has gone through what some dub the sociopathic process, so actually hasving the makings of a neurotypical but most all emotions have just been shut down. How I understand it is that there´s a capability to reach those underlying sheathed feelings but there is a strong unwillingness because they are essentially not constructive in any real sense. Emotions aren't shut down, they're just not seen because most people reference emotions based on how they're shared with others. Psychopathy leads to a callous disregard for others, and so those \"others\" won't see emotions or any real emotional motivation. It doesn't mean that they aren't there. People who are \"driven\" to AsPD by personal experience do have the neurological capability to express emotion, but the mechanism of their condition means that they probably lack the ability to demonstrate them because the events that put them there in the first place haven't allowed them to develop the emotional skills needed. There's a lot of conditions that put a limit on emotions, psychopathy and AsPD being only two. I've never heard of borderline psychopathy and I'm struggling to work out what that might be. As most conditions are based on an increased or decreased level of normal behaviours to the point of abnormality, I'm not sure what you'd get with someone who's a \"bit of a psychopath\" - probably just a selfish arsehole. I can understand why someone with a mental condition would want to turn down the emotional responsibility to others; it's the psychological version of putting your fingers in your ears and going \"la la la.\" It stops the conflict, but it's a response to a condition, not the condition itself.

It isn't schematic, even if you consider physical factor only. I guess that psychopaths' brains differ a little from one person to another; if someone's brain is less \"altered\" than most psychopaths, he would have a “crossed” brain, and you would have a borderline-psychopath person. There are infinite shades and combinations in a neurological asset: nature doesn't create clones. Moreover, psychopathy is assumed to be inborn, but what does it mean? A child, whose brain changes while he isn't still able to interact (fetal and neonatal life), will become a different adult. We can't know if the variation from usual development was caused by a genetic disposition or by a psychological factor. We can't know for sure the destiny of a brain that develops, and the fetus and the new-born baby can't interact, so their emotional life is a mystery. Genetic could predict one's development, but we still haven't an extended knowledge of our genetic map and, in my limited knowledge, a genetic difference isn't proofed for psychopathy definitively. Different researches gave contradictory results. An epigenetic factor would be possible for psychopathy, but psychological traumas and environmental difficulties can produce epigenetic alterations - and that it's proofed. Then, problem NOT solved. My two cents: these are assumptions only. They should discover something, and then formulate a theory, and not the opposite. “Humor is reason gone mad.\" “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”", "hash": "497f4e31136f8a4dce571205727fb9e018889b103111d6d8e683025eff620b8b"}

The term may not be used in the context of BPD, those are (as far as I know) just triggers. The shadow (as per C.G. Jung) is the collection of personality traits we've rejected about ourselves, so they now operate on an unconscious level, having it root in formative upbringing, when we are being taught by our parents what is good and bad, allowed and not allowed. The shadow side gets triggered and leads to lashing out, which the conscious mind is not aware that the behavior is irrational . One other example of this I know is for girls that had to compete for daddy's love (big families), they get extremely triggered by intimate partner choosing to spend time bowling with friends instead of with them. Its an unconsious self esteem threat in that case. Just a loose example for some context. The general term were looking at is unconscious triggers. Now, what I realy ment to contribute to the thread. This is a repost but its higly relevant here.

My false self never asked the question if shes reading them becouse she wasnt allowed thoughts. Everyone knew what I know. Only the narcissist has thoughts. This gave me a big psychotic episode, those have become a lot more intense since I revived the true self and theres all this conflicting information about whats real. 7.not being able to tell the twin sisters B. and J. apart, I raged and stalked them, few days psychotic episode after 8.telepathy between me and my twin flame (wont explain this, was reinterpreted as chat messages and gave me a few day psychotic episode) 9.an example of my NPD collegue: telling everyone at a party that he wants to \"come inside\" his girlfriend and his dick didnt stand up becouse he was high on MDMA, so he retreated from the party 10.an example of another colleague, I told him his girlfriend was angry with him, he raged at me even though I was helping him (him not knowing something, doesnt exist other people have feeling)", "hash": "0886e6dc811b080c2b02321ccab97839e6cd6b60d786c14125c3a61036331947"}

This \"ability\" of the common folk to be manipulated by people seems to depend to a high degree on their inability to step back from their emotional perception and see it as merely that. On top of that is a very problematic ingrained disability in people to question and to be rational. They did a few tests here a while ago with students, and teachers, to find out if they can fact-check and how they deal with news stories. One of the most memorable was showing them a picture of a mutated flower ( something like this ) and saying these flowers were found near Chernobyl. In utter disbelief I had to witness that every single one of the probands thought the flowers had turned this way due to radiation. Another aspect became rather clear due to aunt Corona in the past months. There have been quite a lot of people here who have gone insane by being told to stay home for a few weeks or by being unable to go to the gym for that amount of time - including the cream of the crap who beliefed children were held in underground bases by satanists to extract some drug from them and to veil that ongoing war under the earth the corona crisis was invented... While I could probably explain this in a lot of psychological terms, on the top-level I find its quite astoundign how entitled people have become, how unable to just bear with things for a while and how egocentric and emotion-driven they are. So yea, \"narcissism\", in the sense of some weird, unfounded egocentricity might be a thing, but frankly msot people are really just plain dumb and are very easily fooled. Im not actually sure if this has become worse, or if the contrast is just bigger nowadays, I'm pretty sure a few hundred years ago it was just like that, just on a smaller scale. It might also be a factor though that people nowadays who are already incapable of rational thought, are just overwhelmed by the complexity of everything on top of that and so become additionally unstable, both cognitively and psychologically? Ultimately of course being overwhelmed might then again trigger additional reactions like regressions, or using more primitive defenses like splitting. dx: SPD", "hash": "6b2c29b828e970613d3483580bc25a7b8d9141ec263f5185e49abc88b1f57354"}

It's anything that provides this anchor, where people can abdicate personal responsibility of thought to an idea. If you get a bunch of people agreeing with you, that's all that most people want.

It´s a way of being turned off. It fits into the general picture of pwNPD quite well but in a certain sense it goes almost directly opposite some of the general populace´s methods of describing NPD. In my mind all of this talk speaks poignantly on the narcissistic/schizoid ondition: lately (and really throughout my whole life) I find myself being irritated by the mere existence of others and the claims they make onto my being (the necessity of somehow accomodating their existence,). The truth of the matter is of course much more horrid to accept (and truly, I am incapable of realizing it), i.e. that I am unable to adapt, lack the social skills and truly do not care enough. Am unadaptable and stiff as a personality, so I refuse to partake, only to the extent that is necessitated from me by surroundings so everyone becomes a threat. (Alas I have become a threat to others´ [emotional] safety myself but that is a nother subject. ALl of this also alludes to why a lot of pwNPD get sweeped up by the booze (I, and every other pwNPD I know of, sure has a tendency for it) because it brings a reduced sensory input, acting pseudo \"return-to-the-womb\". Later on, he also speaks about the condition of the inability to relax (intense anxiety), which is also way too familiar. Which is accute of being incapable of relinquishing control and trusting your surroundings.

I'm not sure if this is helpful or not, as the mechanism behind your behaviour may be very different to what I've experienced. I have no real idea how schizoid / NPD works. That said, I think your issue may be around your comment, \"lack the social skills and truly do not care enough.\" You've probably heard this a fair amount and had experience of its effects and so see this as the key issue, which you have no control over. Realising you can't change it puts you in an impossible situation where you can \"never win.\" However, there are alternatives to caring. Take a paramedic for example. They don't care; inasmuch as they don't know or care personally for the person that they're treating. They care because it supports their own internal motivation. They'll see someone die with horrific injuries and then go off and have a sandwich. Their care is a series of processes and training, which is no-less real than those of people who cry over dead kittens. In fact, it's seen as more valuable because it has a constructive purpose. I think you need to start focusing on your own \"principles\" rather than those being pushed onto you and develop a system where you can harmonise your behaviour with the expectations of others, rather than fight against yourself.

If empathy encourages prosocial behavior like species or tribal cooperation, reciprocal (and other forms of false) altruism, kin selection, etc ----- and if they choose to, people who lack it can use perspective taking to achieve similar results, how could this translate into guilt as an emotional motivator? Like empathy, some people cannot utilize guilt as a motivator because they're frozen, or so much has accumulated it's not safe (for time being), or because they're not capable of feeling it, or they just plain don't want to. I also know, from observing others and from personal experience, that trying to moralize or trying to force people into internalizing \"wrongness\" is an ineffective way of teaching people because they often either shut down or act out even more (variety of reasons). I've seen and experienced the 12 steps to be effective for addressing this, but that's obviously reserved for those who are receptive to it rather than having it shoved down their throats. It would be interesting to recieve input as to what could be a couple gears down from, or an alternative to, guilt as an effective motivator (to create wanted changes within oneself).

Guilt and empathy are complex conditioned responses to others' behaviour. I think the reason I don't have any real empathy is because I failed to learn the connections when I was young, so they didn't properly form. Therefore, I have had to learn this consciously since. I didn't care about my parents or other family members and so their opinion on my behaviour had little effect. For most, these behaviours are so well inculcated, before they had the ability to rationalise the link, that it's seen as instinctive or even divine. This is the reason I think that people internalise wrongness; it's built in them before they've had chance to develop critical thought. We know that it's learned, as people in different cultures find different things to feel guilty about. Having a beer or a bacon sandwich causes few issues in Christian-based countries, but would cause emotional chaos to someone from a Muslim background.

I see this is an example of an (albeit vague) gear down to guilt as a motivator. If there was ever a time in your life where you experienced a pattern of behaviors that did not work and had serious consequences for you + the sincere looking apologies didn't work + you no longer wanted to repeat those patterns, how did you get yourself to address it? I think I accidentally had a double connotation when I said \"internalizing wrongness\" One connotation was that as a motivator, it's supposed to get one to feel regret for the behavior and a desire to try to make it up somehow which leads to overall changes in behavior or personality. The other connotation being guilt trips and even switching over to shaming others and pushing them to feel inherently \"bad\" - which is unhealthy for anyone In one of my psych classes last year, we learned about studies that found that shaming children or acting like they were \"bad\" (instead of focusing on the undesirable behavior, why it's undesirable, and how to make reparations) decreased their ability to feel healthy guilt for doing something they knew was wrong and empathy towards people they hurt. + I think it's important to step away from any of this being seen as a \"divine\" quality because it's a cop out in so many situations.", "hash": "e7b9a16a41f58b9f00f64844bd6fc697c69faf0bd796affe461423fcda37e988"}

Guilt is perhaps the obvious one since it is associated with morality. People with BPD have plenty of guilt on hand. In this case, the challenge may be to discriminate between toxic guilt (for instance, when you keep dating someone abusive) vs helpful guilt (for instance, if you act selfishly and manipulate people into looking after you). People with NPD don't deal with guilt as much (they sometimes confuse shame with guilt), but they do have plenty of shame on hand. The trick, I'm assuming, is not to runaway from it, although it's very natural to try to runaway from uncomfortable emotions. If you don't feel shame, there is always anger left. For example, people with ASPD are perhaps less prone to shame than people with NPD (the latter more likely to trick themselves into thinking they care), but that does not mean they don't have strong emotions. Emotions are always a point of entry, but I don't believe therapy/recovery/progresses have to be an emotional process in the dramatic sense of the word. Stoic people remain stoic. Emotional people remain sensitive, you just don't hurt as much or anymore. So the ultimate motivator is to eliminate discomfort (guilt, shame, anger etc.), but the fact that to eliminate discomfort you might have to go through a bit of discomfort can act as a strong deterrent. Guilt-trips are always wrong. Emotional appeal is bad strategy if your interlocutor does not deal with emotional empathy. And moralization is only occasionally OK to draw a boundary, for example if someone is encroaching on your space of freedom or someone else's. Even in this case, it is indeed never wise (not to mention brutal) to expect someone to grow a moral system out of thin air. Instead, It's to signal to your interlocutor that they're hurting you and/or sucking the air out of the room, to remind them of the world outside of their own. It's purely pragmatic if you will and can, at best, elicit curiosity but the goal should never be to elicit compliance. I don't know if people who were not taught empathy can grow one at an adult age. Should be possible based on the literature.

I was wondering when I wrote it, if, when a child learns, that attention is gotten by mostly questionable means (being a trainwreck, being hysteric, being overly eroticizing whatever), that on one side a connection is created in the childs mind, between these two things. Then [getting / asking for] attention always somehow leads back to these people and behaviours and gets tainted by them. When one doesnt learn - which in those circumstances could probably be expected - to ask for attention / to get ones needs met in a more healthy way - so when you might already be the type that doesnt ask for much - you feel - albeit unconsciously - that changing that would turn you into a childish trainwreck, while in reality you would turn into a more mature adult probably. Im pretty sure some connectiosn like this are in my mind at least. And ive certainly always found that, not only do I despise histrionics and certain types of neurotics, but I do so of course because of negative connectiosn in my mind towards f.e. my mom.

This level of attention will be more sustainable because it will give you a reason why you're getting it.

Carrying on the masturbation analogy: if you want a relationship because it means you can have sex then wanking into a sock isn't going to satisfy your general loneliness, because you've boiled down the whole process to getting your rocks off.

Only when they've found the meaning can they figure out ways to go there... and might find that attention has never been imporatnt to them anyways - or yes, find ways to actually get recognized for achievements that are real and that might be useful to not only parts of themselves. dx: SPD", "hash": "3074bb9f796f3f10717f717c5b4e26b57a7e819afb5033c96f38e272a39366d1"}

One of my parents was very demanding, I wouldn’t say attention seeking in the traditional sense but more like caused so many problems that you just couldn’t help but pay attention. I did grow to hate that about them and always found them to be stupid and childish. So are you saying that this is the only way I have of gaining attention but I detest it and would rather suffer in silence? In a way yea. I was wondering when I wrote it, if, when a child learns, that attention is gotten by mostly questionable means (being a trainwreck, being hysteric, being overly eroticizing whatever), that on one side a connection is created in the childs mind, between these two things. Then [getting / asking for] attention always somehow leads back to these people and behaviours and gets tainted by them. When one doesnt learn - which in those circumstances could probably be expected - to ask for attention / to get ones needs met in a more healthy way - so when you might already be the type that doesnt ask for much - you feel - albeit unconsciously - that changing that would turn you into a childish trainwreck, while in reality you would turn into a more mature adult probably. Im pretty sure some connectiosn like this are in my mind at least. And ive certainly always found that, not only do I despise histrionics and certain types of neurotics, but I do so of course because of negative connectiosn in my mind towards f.e. my mom. So I think over time one has to carefully detach from those connections and \"inner people\", to have a better chance at realizing that there might be something between 0 and 100. I think there is something like that in my mind also. It’s a disturbing connection to make but one that I suppose must be made to make progress. I knowingly rejected that parent for those reasons and I can remember saying I will never be that way but in understanding psychology better now I think I was mostly taught by this parent and by rejecting them I also rejected those parts in myself as well, basically rejected myself and who I was, creating an identity disturbance in the process and the longer time went on the weaker the connection became with that part until it was all but lost.

Am desperate for some ass but I ain't really got any game and things are getting dark. Tbh, my mindset frightens me at times because am looking at every female as a piece of meat. It's tough not to stare and I hate perving out. It's really a hypersexual way of being and it sucks because the urge is insane and I guess some aphrodisiacs like ashwagandha and cordyceps aren't really helping. (ramping up the T badly. good for exercise, TOO good for libido) Reading this thread from a while back, it's kind of eerie how much the Elliot Rodgers thing fits to describe me narcissistic-personality/topic163836.html So goddamn it's Spring and quarantine is over so there's a dazzling amount of fine women around. I also understand that it's prime-time to get with someone because ladies are probably dying to get it on as well but... Problem is the girls I've been with have all been longterm gf's and I've basically relied on accolades to draw them in, being the extremely quiet/reserved type but sometimes odd/quirky exhibitionist/peackocking when necessary, so it seems very difficult for me to redefine my sexuality in a different setting. In my head, it works and am able to sexualize girls when detached but when it comes down to it, I know that it's not in my wiring to have sex with anyone who takes an interest in me. Girls who give off the open/slutty vibe actually turn me off quick. Since I've become heavily schizoid and sheltered (well, aren't we all nowadays) for the past few years now am easily intimidated and that is helping me in the least as I seem to creep people out easily, especially when am feeling less-than (which is the majority of the time). Deeply covert/vulnerable but also increasingly ASPD. My relations of late are almost non-existent and have been heavily dwindling so it's tough to hold up appearances. Am like a walking-talking example of toxic masculinity plus I really need to stick around capable people because I feel like a worthless piece-of-shit majority of the time. There are moments where I sense I can still charm but the settings are not right because I don't want to lay the charm on someone at work. Short of paying for sex (which carries with it the same invulnerability issue am sure, couldn't imagine doing that), any suggestions on what could be done?

Both shame and sadness would have made us willing to conform. Some people consciously practice rejection (and shaming) to try to get people to conform, and it often works (at least in our early years or struggling times) specifically for that reason. Also, it can be offensive if one is not included in something on purpose because it's relational-aggression. There are lots of reasons for \"relational-aggression\" - including to reduce competition (sexual viability or attention in general, etc.). In which case, you'd need to learn to conform well enough to not be seen as a threat (and you may never be able to do that) or you'd have to accept that's what you'll get with that person and seek the type of interactions you want elsewhere. If there are ways in your thinking and acting that play a part in the exclusion, then it's worth addressing that if it's something important to you (while keeping in mind that being left out / rejected doesn't necessarily mean you're doing anything wrong). For me, being rejected due to be relational agression (being competition, asshole-ism, etc.) could lead to anger or disgust. If done respectfully because I was unwanted, it would lead to sadness. Shame usually results from people thinking it's them rather than the interactions not being a good fit. Also, with exceptions obviously, my dysfunctional answer to most interpersonal issues that matter to me (or my energy levels) is to distance myself even further - even when it comes to experiencing rejection from others.", "hash": "f23777252839c06efb9a6cfee66d36c63fbc9902a5e9dd9f76e4e5922141e2e5"}

If you get overly connected to rejection events, it probably stems from a lack of confidence in your own decisions, so you require inclusion from others for confirmation, and see it as a personal slight when that doesn't happen. @Manners: it would probably be useful to examine how you're processing the rejection at the time, before you kick off, to try to identify what you're feeling. Is it hurt, anger, confusion? Confrontation is giving you a mechanism to deal with the event, while distracting from the underlying cause. You're effectively blaming the one excluding you, rather than trying to work out why it's so important to you in the first place.

It's unlikely that someone with major / chronic depression or PTSD or c-PTSD would feel remorse, so why would NPDs, AsPDs, or any Cluster B be the ones to feel it? A situation like someone with bipolar disorder who was normally well adjusted and had a healthy family life, who went off the deep end for the first time, might feel regret or remorse once they were properly stabilized and back to their \"normal\" selves. ^ That's a different situation though because usually suicide is either a result of chronic, unrelenting depression/crisis/stressors or ongoing lack of impulse control with or without an ongoing lack of \"distress tolerance\" I tried twice as a youth, but I never regretted it or felt bad for doing it.

I think that love has a few requirements pwPD dont usually meet. One of them is being anchored in the depressive position, aka realizing the other person is actually seperate from you and realizing their actually a person, not [idealized] fragments or split halves. In addition I think it requires a pretty stable sense of self and internal world. Another is - i think - that you need to have somehow incorporated love as a schema or as a function, especially for yourself; and that it - if it does - naturally develops in line with other developments inside of you, like the aforementioned cognitive abilities. In my own experience I realized realtively early actually that what I called love was a mixture out of idealizing, projecting parts of myself and unmet needs onto others. I cant say if this is repairable, but if it is then learning to love - just like learning to feel I suppose - cant be the first goal, as theres a lot of groundwork to be prepared beforehand. I don't even know if I'm missing out on it or not. Pretty normal if youve never experienced it. But even figuring out if its worth the hassle might require a internal stability that isnt present. Like with the therapist really, one day you say you want somebody to talk to, then you say you dont. Stabilizing that is hard and I think the reason why so few people on here over the years have actually tried it lies in the same problem, namely being unable to imagine what they would be working towards - and keep that image fixed. dx: SPD", "hash": "4e87ae80c291c2a1bf91ba511ac6009df6a7d5a3d3e9f9b4c937417b3bdedb73"}

In addition I think it requires a pretty stable sense of self and internal world. I’ve read this dynamic and I’m trying to completely understand it. Do you think the person with the PD is aware of this dynamic, do they actually see the other person as an extension of themselves and idealized parts of themselves or is it more of an unconscious thing similar to projecting where you may hate another person for showing the same traits that you actually hate in yourself but are unaware that is why you don’t like them?

Also looking at anxiety/stress, which are modulated somewhat by some of the same pathways. General discomfort and dissatisfaction feeding into that loop. I quite obviously have problems with keeping at a task (get restless quickly and need variation often). Obv this ADHD aspect will probably be a part of my personality for keeps but just hoping that could offset it somehow. My ASPD traits have been giving me (but more-so others around me) trouble for quite a while now so am really thinking if there is a good solution here chemical wise (have tried to postpone a visit to the psychiatrist for long now but am thinking I can´t put it off forever). Mainly this is due to my aversion to psychiatric drugs and their side-effects (*tips hat towards AProphet*). It was a little more than a year ago that I tried taking 5-HPT along with correlating doses of L-dopa and L-Tyrosine (these agonists have to be taken together in order to not deplete receptors inequeally) but at times I really sensed that I got more boldened, which is why I don´t want to get on antidepressants (in fear that it will enhance grandiosity and make me even more obtuse toward others) Found the information provided here in this following video to be quite enlightening. It´s quite a long watch but goes in depth about psychopharmacology https://youtu.be/bNW2N4XWWzc There´s also research that shows dopamine to promote paranoia in individuals prone to it (can confirm). Definitely need to eliminate caffeine intake and no alcohol also. I´m already microdosing psilocybin according to the Stamets protocol 5 days on (2 off) along with Lion´s mane for more neurogenetic benefits and feel that it has helped me somewhat, at least as far as aggression goes. Of course it does not change my underlying belief system or the emotions that feed them, which are very twisted and skewed (and psilocybin at times puts me right in touch with them, i.e by relinquishing some control) but am doing damage control more than anything. It´s been a month or so now I think and am going for another two months at least. I´ve felt for long now that am going to snap and been unmasking near random people (unintentionally) because under huge amounts of stress I tend to get dissociative. Before anyone suggests, meditation I have yet to gotten back into but somewhat considering. It is said that it´s not good to meditate when your brain is in a depressed state anyway, as it only sets these pathways stronger into your brain, so really my.

Yeah it was bit of a mixed message. For me these things correspond in the sense that anger is an impulse. I have been losing/breaking a lot of stuff lately and that has to do with impulsivity. If I just took it easy and didn´t want everything so immediately, I might be less quick to anger (when things don´t go my way at that very moment). This is absolutely an ASPD trait. Couldn´t find my keys to leave the house this morning (which made me more late) and just got irate (I even considered the option that my dad had hidden them, as per that recent thread and got legit paranoid that he might do that at one point:mrgreen: Basically, my question was posed more as it pertained to agression at work. The preferred term overimpulsivity might be pathology perhaps. Since I am what the literature would suggest ´supply deficient´ and pursuing some new avenues to feel somewhat fulfilled (work related, I take great second-hand pride in the company I am at - special by association), but in general I am constantly attention starved. For a long while when I was doing my other menial job (which I abhor oft because it´s in service and I deem myself above it.), my mask would often slip because I felt a constant need to be the perfect service guy, e.g. put on a fake smile for the client. Nowadays the job I am at leaves me more time by myself (alongside others) and brings the necessity of interacting with coworkers (whom I try to generally avoid as much as possible). So basically I´ve noticed myself giving the mean look to people who I kind of needed to hold my hand a bit or who I wanted to welcome me more into the group (whatever that means). I become aware of some nagging need but it felt inappropriate to expressed it to them because because I am wary of bein just being an entitled jerk. Also generally my body language is probably somewhat agressive/offputting and I´ve already probably made coworkers think I´m somewhat off. I just don´t want them to think I´m an absolute psycho (nearing that level though). I´ve become such weird mixture personality wise (sadistic/masochistic) but also take offense quickly if anyone else puts me down. I don´t like kindness essentially, not sure if it´s my paranoia or my necessity to not be perturbed in my shell, if anyone asks something about me personally I start squirming, not really wanting to give them the gist of how things really are. An absolute contradiction of sorts - like I want the attention but abhor it if people show genuine concern and interest in me, I scoff them. Especially if they are female coworkers, I hate when I am catered to and put them down without being aware of it in the moment (only after the fact) (It´s this whole inverted narcissism/schizoidish trick: almost showing others that I am so resigned from my needs so much so that I don´t even want them to be addressed or answered to by others]. **random aside**I´ve pinpointed that this dislike of kindness is the deep conditioning of my covert dad whose subtle intrusions (such as to put things in a certain place or do something a certain way) are just ways that he can feel good about himself, not true helpful acts of kindness or concern (Like \"oh, if you need this thing for tomorrow, be sure to put it here\"), but it is actually a very covert way of making himself feel important in situations that would in normal circumstances not warrant a mention. [He needs to remind me somehow of his agency somehow, like he is allowing me to do something, it is he that enables me to do something that I would otherwise come up with myself anyhow.] So I have grown to detest when someone of a position of authority tries to help or een guide me because my initial reaction (schema) is to take it as a way of them controlling my actions. [yes, it´s ###$]. This also makes me agressive. Then at other points, with people that have taken a liking to me initially but have kind of shrugged me ´from their circle´ I become obtuse pretty quick into the relationship. Like today I wanted to ask a favour from a coworker and thought long and hard how to approach him, figured the best way would be to assertive to get him to do it but I was too engaged and it was more as like a confrontation because of my body language (like asking him is such an ordeal am already set in fight mode beforehand/expecting him to refuse, but am not aware of it in the moment) to the point where another coworker stepped in (he noticed something was up. And the situation just got awkward. Since I also gain ego strength from putting others down, I have to be very wary about that and I think so highly of myself that I want to boss others around. Especially those that are higher up from me (it´s a subverting authority thing). And in a workplace that stuff can get ugly fast.

Definitely can see where that would stem from. I am flat most of the day tbh and I am often concerned that my boredom/lack of care shows too much. At points am somewhat aware that I am dissociated from my feelings and body (I´ll have mind-surges, just racing thoughts, going in circles) but can´t really do anything about it if the work is static and just involves repetitive action a lot. As for self-medicating, silocybin helps for sure but the correct dosage is vital if I´m around people because it also makes me somewhat less aware at times, like I´ll be enjoying myself a bit too much and I´ll start to drift from (either lose myself in some grandiose fantasy or just be high on my own Self) and lose track of others. I think it is helping, definitely honing in the anger, like putting another filter above of my usual reactions. And I´ve felt somewhat okay with being in harmony with others, being okay with subjecting to their will and not having to always go against the grain. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "a0afb73fa012d25d520c0d2d80efc3e01a1d375eeae20b795112e3ba97b1c24c"}

If I just took it easy and didn´t want everything so immediately, I might be less quick to anger (when things don´t go my way at that very moment). This is absolutely an ASPD trait. Couldn´t find my keys to leave the house this morning (which made me more late) and just got irate (I even considered the option that my dad had hidden them, as per that recent thread and got legit paranoid that he might do that at one point:mrgreen: I dont think \"ASPD traits\" are a thing. I've recently had the \"pleasure\" to be on a project with a real pwASPD. The amount of aggressivity, lack of concern for any other perspective, manipulation, the simple scale of how naturally they use people and the trail of destruction in both projects and other people they leave behind is on a totally different level and every gangster movie or psychological description pales when you experience that first hand. If you realize you have impulse control issues, why do you have the urge to give it some fancy name at all? So basically I´ve noticed myself giving the mean look to people who I kind of needed to hold my hand a bit or who I wanted to welcome me more into the group (whatever that means). I become aware of some nagging need but it felt inappropriate to expressed it to them because because I am wary of bein just being an entitled jerk. Also generally my body language is probably somewhat agressive/offputting and I´ve already probably made coworkers think I´m somewhat off. I just don´t want them to think I´m an absolute psycho (nearing that level though). I think youre doing this on the forum, too. At least youre oscillating between being a suicidal hysteric a pseudo-spiritual drug-freak and a horrible \"psycho with ASPD traits\", which makes it hard to take you seriously - or more healthy people would probably say it makes it hard to get a clear image of you and connect to you. Guess youre ambivalent about that and have trouble tolerating [that] ambivalence. o basically I´ve noticed myself giving the mean look to people who I kind of needed to hold my hand a bit or who I wanted to welcome me more into the group (whatever that means). I become aware of some nagging need but it felt inappropriate to expressed it to them because because I am wary of bein just being an entitled jerk. Staying with the same quote and looking at another dimension of it, I really think you should try working on that hysteric self-labelling. Just because you have needs doesnt make you entitled ; just like looking our for yourself doesnt make you NPD or breaking stuff when youre angry doesnt make you ASPD. If anything your ambivalence towards needing others might be understandable due to your past experiences and veiling them with useless labels just disconnects you from both the current situation (which might be a wanted side effect of course), but also from putting stuff into places that makes them easier to understand and manage. dx: SPD", "hash": "e7883411c78694bfaa1723c774a2060cf3d359acf160a19c6842034ab3973b53"}

Thanks Not sure on the machiavellian - I would assume by definition it has to do with playing the long game and being cunning, Niccolo Machiavelli professed the good statesman to being capable of using both a mixture of cunning acts with also a node of justice in order to gain power. Not sure how that translates to everyday behavior. As far as that last part, I would say it´s possible to be less narcissistic if that person has low-self esteem in some wider sense for their facade to seem less-so. Anyone as a covert/vulnerable subtype would abhor the extra attention gained from being too eagerly narcissistic so they might not flaunt it. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "da91300594ee788ffddb3e394d03b5b629f95fb958a486fcd80a6a56cc2511a3"}

How different is machiavellianism from narcissism and why does is it not correlate to any of the known personality disorders like NPD, BPD or ASPD? I would be surprised if it doesnt relate to ASPD, cause thats kind of a central aspect of ASPD. Narcissism is a bit of a problem, since it has different meanings depending on context and school of thought its used by. So it can mean self-love, or something that pertains to self-esteem modulation or in contexts like narcissistic withdrawal it can mean withdrawal into the self or into fantasy. NPD also is a different thing and is based on the DSM definition and the discussions underlying that whatever they are. In that context the simplest answer would be manipulativeness etc are not part of the diagnostic criteria of NPD or BPD. Also, slightly off topic but does anyone know what moderate psychopathy means in real terms? Does it mean sociopathy and did I make a mistake in answering the questions? Wouldn't someone who is psychopathic be inherently narcissistic as well? Thanks Psychopathic and sociopathic arent clearly defined terms and there, too, it depends who uses them. Someone like psychoanalytical therapist and theoriest Otto Kernberg has seen ASPD and NPD as a spectrum f.e. based on comparable faults in the super-ego and other structurs of the psycho on different levels and degrees. But that isnt widely followed. dx: SPD", "hash": "7fc4a0cfa0e146bee53e25215d4d3d6e302cb75b5fcc856f38036e0f8a86eac1"}

The best girlfriend of my fallen star, Ive been messaging her a lot over the course of a few months with realy my findings, reflections and what I learned, firstly dialogue, later just checking the messages, just out of convenience I knew she probably doesnt read them but it didnt matter. I planned to keep sending as long as I could, untill she ignored me like the rest. Maybe I get a chance to say my sorry. So she finally responds: Will you please stop messaging me? Now notice, this is deception. Becouse what she realy wants is to prove how stupid he is by writing messages to soemeone who doesnt read them. She realy wants him to write something. She knows the narcissist is stupid and doesnt understand prior context. So he responds, narcissisticaly injured that she wanted to see him and then didnt, unexpectedly, with narcissistic rage: ok why hate me so much im the most amazing person anyway bye ######6 had reality break from grief im hurt im sorry I HAD NO ONE even the imagination that someone cared was a lot okk ok i had very little and a lot of hurt ok my own sister cant write back right here in xxxxxxx when im going threw you saw what i was going threw didnt exist self abusive hated the one one that mattered ever no choice I COULD HAVE EASILY BE AMAZING had community first time .. im over it its over He wrote Amazing becouse he just thought he cured NPD And realy he was a lashing out little boy who didnt understand anything. And realy And then his true self strated dying from grief 6 months after the girl he loved, broke her heart (both girls are friends), he realy didnt want to, he had an abusive false self. But he had no choice. And that girls still is everything, Then hyperspace event 2 started, on a very weak true self. This one came with prior warning from a dream, which said \"wank off and wet your feet\" he knew that wet your feet means dmt, he just didnt know its going to be soon day. Yes the dmt tells you, and even takes you there without smoking dmt its just stronger when you smoke together with event. Becouse he didnt know that he has as much time as he wants to respond. He is an automaton, he doesnt plan. A few hours later he then compulsively just admits. But he purposefully self-defaces himself. He didnt write the messages becouse he thought she is reading. Just becouse she didnt ignore him yet. And realy she wants to write and is decieving him. And realy he had a psychotic episode/event2 the day before telling him not to trust her. He still trusts her even though she hates him becouse he is an automaton and self abusive. Put in this kind of situation, he always reacts the same way. And you wont tell me narcissistic supply defficiency isnt real. The day after the dmt my false self was disintegrating. I DIDNT EVEN NEED TO WRITE ON THAT DAY. I JUST NEEDED SUPPLY. u realy did never read any its ok made me felt good and the others were on it too So he says hes an idiot instead of what he wanted And realy he had all the time in the world to respond. To talk to her and say he is sorry. And she is waiting for him now to write. Or write something meaning full But he just cant, even though he learned it all, wrote plenty of it with this girl even. Will you please stop messaging me? Why you keep checking.? and then maybe guess what she wants. She wants him to tell her, why he wrote them. But he never gets to that. Then she threatens him with ignore and he cries. When realy she cant ignore him and waited hours for a response. But he couldnt just think of any solution, except what he did in that place in 3 different cases, always the same: be retarded. Its called not having self-awareness. You have no idea of the situation you are in. And how am I suposed to live this way? Being abused like this. I didnt even feel anything. I just didnt care anymore. I was allready aware of the severity of my condition, never felt ashamed again. But being cheated and abused like that is just trash. human trash. Just ###$ you.

You yourself said that even the gods could not tell you anything. They could say anytinhg but nothing that you would accept, no information that you would be capable of making anything of. Yes the false self (in the case of narcissit codependant) \"supplies\" on others abusing you, like a script. Its 'prime directive if you will'. You should be well familiar with the steps ive taken. At first I learned everything there is to know about the nature of the condition and developed my true self as much as I could. Its difficult with an arch rival in your head. In Jungian terms that would learning about the condtion would be 'shadow integration'. The narcissitic personality is full unconscious, so you have to consciously integrate it and go threw his individuation process, using dreams and reflecting upon your actions. I did that not knowing what I was doing yet, just following my intuition, nor knowing the dream representations of your aspects (afore mentioned shadow, anima, self or archetypes). Jung is considered pseudoscientific by conventional psychiatry, he is known for the theory of the collective unconsicous. I bypassed conventional psychiatry alltogether, they couldnt even diagnose me correctly, but now Im going to enroll in some kind of therapy following the latest narcissistic injury. About the DMT. Yes, breaking threw on dmt is a cure for the condition. And the best experience you can have is by doing it on acid, it prepares you for the blastoff, by the way. The problem is as you said, the false self will never let you do that. It fears the dmt, It knows that it supplies,feeds, strenghtens the true self. It will never let you break threw, like in my example where Mila Angelina connected to me a second time, she said now or never, AGAIN. And the insufferable false self said \"now is not now or never, now or never was back then\". What I most regretted, It still didnt register. It will lie to you and abuse you, never learn or change. And the dream images involving the dmt were the most apparent to me, \"wank off and wet your feet\", soul sister telling me to eat food before I return, from a 3-stove chandellier, but I took no note of that . And the dream where even small ammounts supply the true self (doctors with a constant supply of fetuses), so small ammounts are good too if you dont think your ready for breaking threw into hyperspace. Also meditation, the true self likes that. But the false self makes you (at least me, In comparison to my friend thats been doing it a long time and advising me) incapable of entering, sustaining the meditative state. Its realy difficult to meditate normally, but is easy when I have a surge of the true self, like when O. fell in love telepathicaly. I understand that what I write might seem delusional but its the truth as best I understand it, I cant help that. I couldnt make it up even if I wanted to. So what we have left are the spiritual solutions I mentioned above and one more, being in love. When the true self Is in love it is stronger than the false self. Also I think the false self is vulnerable during psychotic epsides, thats its one moment of weakness, but thats yet to be verified. The true self hidden under wraps (even someone seeing the true self, like in the moment I fell in love, my jaw dropped, gives narcissistic injury) like you say, is undeveloped, too weak to function on its own. And emotional pain can cause you to \"die\". Its in quotes becouse it never dies, it just becomes weak, but all the capacities that were evolved are still there, but it has to be supplied. The ways to supply it (that Ive discovered) once again: self love, being surrounded by people that care about you, dmt and psylocibin (for certain, maybe other psychedelics included), being in love, meditation, and twin flames telepathy. Ofc you will be challenged and denied all the way by the false self, and its realy powerfull. Powerfull beyond imagination. It knew to run insuferable and discard pattern when O. even for telepathy.

How do you deal with simply not being able to be around people?

Am male and 28 though, was in talk-therapy (gestalt psychotherapy) for around a year and a half but she never gave me an official diagnosis. I quit that therapy with talks of signing up somewhere else and getting on meds. Also now considering it strongly because otherwise things are getting darker and darker. The way I see it my dominant structure used to be NPD but the ASPD traits got so strong that it´s bascially interchangeable. Mainly sadistic and paranoid definitely, might be schizoid or dissociative at times on top of that though because when the BPD hits, $#%^ gets real and real tiresome fast. PTSD perhaps. Mostly I distract myself with things. Sometimes self-destructive to sort of \"reset\" me to a lower point so I can keep climbing back up to ground zero again, knowing full well nothing´s really tehre. I tend to hink in a childish way that it´s all just a game we´re playing here anyhows. There are times I become aware that none of what I am doing is really the long-term solution. Tbh, I know that´s not really encouraging but coping mechanisms are just that... If you have some well-adjusted family, I would suggest finding some support from them with the caveat of not overstaying it and using them. (*ok scratch that you specifically noted that wouldn´t be an option) I would say it´s good at least that you are married but I do understand the frustration of not being capable or willing of other relations. Have to acknowledge your husband being a hero also for keeping with it thus far. I guess trying to find some way of doing something fulfilling while avoiding the potholes of your own personality and self-effacing behaviors would be the way to go.

Its always a third person thing. Idk, I always it possible to get drugs by merely asking around. Not the least-dangerous method but It works. Ask and you shall receive especially applies to shrooms. I still carry a magical belief that these things are an amazing tool given to us or left here by a ahigher form of consciousness so I tend to think of it as a sacrament (it is odd since I dont consider anything else much holy in this world, sadly) so once you put the thought and intention out there, they will come to you. Also, they are really not to be messed with. If you havent had a full-blown trip I would first advise you against that. Scientifically Psilocybin is said to mimic psychosis in the brain but the assumption is that is because it activates communication between parts of the brain that otherwise do not. In the wrong frame of time and mind this can be ill-advised and lead to permanent mental issues. In general it is said it’s a good idea for anyone with a personality disorders (since we have more like Self fragments, parts of our Self is immature, parts are archaic and so on). Having communication between all these parts can either be healing or scarring, depending on integration. But as of now they have not made a therapy that involves psilocybin available other than for PTSD, so microdosing is the way to go, mkay? That said, Terence McKenna’s advice is that it’s mandatory to have a deep trip this at least once in your life (but to put strong emphasis on set and setting. it is vital). Prior to this, it is however best to be acquainted with the substance well in advance. Anyhow. It’s good if my post helped you some. It seems the least we can do is offer alternative perspectives and at best some insights. It is ironic though because a lot of responses to me here I have glazed over and only after visiting later I see the real gist of it. I dont have any answers here tbh at all, being amidst one of the biggest circlejerks of my whole life. There are a lot of topics on here to look through also, which mention a lot of these themes. As far as paranoia, it ranges a lot. Mainly the general of (people are talking bad about me behind my back, think am crazy, theyve taken a disliking to me). And these are all quite well-founded thoughts since I can be quite abrasive. Since I’ve become aware that I objectify myself a lot (80% of the tome) I tend to do the same towards others (people on the streets) and am afraid they will notice. Also, since I am out of touch with feelings I feel like my body is just a vessel hauling around my mind. I fear the mask of sanity slipping in a general sense. Am trying to be aware that I don’t freak people out (because I literally often feel like I don’t give a damn whether they are there or not) with my obtuse mannerisms or haughty behavior.

Therapy needs to address the structural deficits, basically you go through the development that you should've gone through as a kid and it takes an awful amount of time, but is necessary, because a lot of the issues that are caused by borderline disorders will only vanish when the mind has matured enough.

Compensatory narcissism is a subtype coined by theodore Million. I dont think it has been used anywhere else. For him that type \"captures the psychoanalytic view of narcissism\", where a person who has grown up with a very negative and inferior self-view compensates by a grandiose yet brittle way of acting, including portraing \"every small certificate and placque\" on the walls [Personality Disorders in Daily Life 2nd Ed p339]. Covert or also closet narcissism has originally been used interchangably with hypervigilant, hypersensitive or vulnerable narcissism, as the latter for example by James Masterson or Ralph Klein, as the former by Shalman Akhtar, but has lately been used in research more to describe purely the way that certain symptoms show or dont show. So the first difference is that for Million his subtype captures the character, while the latter term describes the degree to which pathology is observable. But yeah if we accept the older definition of the latter and if we accept Millions conviction about his theory then they would be seen as complementary. In Ralph Kleins presentation even the object relations are inverted in what he calls closet narcissism, so in the grandiose self the \"external\" object has become the idealized one. If we stay with him for a little more another difference might be that Klein is saying that the child hides its natural grandiosity, its too painful to be naturally grandiose so that part of psychic development gets arrested (Klein, Closet Naricssistic Disorder p.14). So personally I'd argue that from that it follows that Klein describes a more low-level development compared to Millon. But there, too I am not sure how many people have followed this idea, plus its too abstract for personal use. Even \"narcissism\" itself is defined so differently in different contexts (which adds to heaps of overlap and contradiction), its descriptive ability is very limited imo. dx: SPD", "hash": "69b60355f3f013047f69b5483b491dc56f0a876e988ef38f04d9f2e06aa6d7cc"}

USAs president is a great exampel for this, if they admire him hooray, if not theyre out. Akuma, do you use social media?

I.Self image is not constant. It fluctuates depending on what happens within and arround us, very many different reasons. Self image abstracting from reality is NOT uncommon. The narcissistic case is only the extreme pathological example, where that image has no relation to reality whatsoever. It is not the defining feature of narcissisitc personality [self image], just one of the related issues.

One important difference you highlight is that narcissistic traits are something entirely different than pathological narcissism A certain ammount of narcissistic traits is healthy, and not all with NPD possess all narcissistic traits. Once again. Nothing wrong with having a \"wrong\" (not realistic enough), or even looking for your true, authentic self image, being lost a bit on the way.

Here Sam Vaknin says. Some narcissists are raised by weak or inaccessible mothers and harsh, rigid, or sadistic fathers. They tend to bond with males in male settings (army, sports, police, bodybuilding, the Catholic Church) and to seek empathy, warmth, support, secure friendship, and love among their male peers. This macho bonding masks repressed and latent homosexual tendencies, the result of incestuous or simply pathologically excessive love towards the father (or father figure). Most male Narcissists are misogynists. After all, they are the warped creations of women. Women gave birth to them and molded them into what they are: dysfunctional, maladaptive, emotionally dead.

It also has to do with sexuality that is underdeveloped and not integrated. So in that sense it´s close to a child´s, with high opennes. That doesn´t necessarily mean they will swing both ways in most situations. In my experience, someone´s attractiveness or lack of it sometimes overrides my capacity for friendship because I feel less motivation to associate with people who I deem in some objective sense lesser than (or in my eyes). They might have attractive personality qualities but I am extremely image focused so it´s tough for me to hone it in. The opposite is true also, I getvery self-conscious about handsome men. With ex girlfriends I had extreme insecurity when someone attractive was around them but tha´s more like a comparison thing and I don´t think this has much to do with homosexuality. There might be some homoerotic aspect to some friendships but I don´t deem myself homosexual by any sense of the word. Am simply not into dick. I think one would know that one a visceral level, even if some of the narcissistic construct sometimes might veer towards borderline flirting with a male. The misogyny seems to indeed be inherent to the narcissistic personality structure. Definitely has its beginnings in childhood and faulty parenting on part of the mother´s side. I only knew my mother until 9 so it´s difficult to attribute any importance. But the misogyny is largely the entitlement to garner unearned attention from the opposite sex. I also attribute some of it to quite a strong conservative undercurrent (quite primitively assigned gender roles) as quite deeply held beliefs that I would much prefer not to admit to myself.

Has avoided people helping them for years due to rage that ensues when trying. -Can rarely ever feel happy for others if they achieve or have something the want themselves. -Pursues vengeance, usually with extremely hurtful words and the occasional physical violence. The violence is only hindered at threat of punishment. Has once lightly bitten a toddler in anger to hurt them, often gets an “endorphin rush” from punishing children and making them cry despite being taught to be kind. Will use people’s insecurities against them. Is quick to be on the offense if feeling slighted. -Hypersensitive to criticism, but will be very callous towards others. Will not acknowledge one’s own mistakes or offenses without deflecting the blame on anyone else. -Tries to manipulate and argue with others to do their work, and if it fails, will guilt trip them despite knowing its not fair. -Often low cognitive empathy. For example, has asked excitedly asked rape victims to recall the details of their trauma without knowing it would hurt the victim, or once whipped a sibling but got offended when reprimanded because they didn’t realize it would hurt them. Often has to actually imagine someone doing to them what they do to others to feel their pain instead of it easily coming naturally. Won’t often do this. -Generally unempathetic, but not entirely. Examples would be when a friend was suicidal, they asked the friend to text instead of talk verbally for the comfort of said teen upon the verge of suicide. When friends have trouble, friend will offer advice but little to no emotional comfort. Will only deal with facts. Will ignore friends and family problems entirely if they can’t solve it with a step by step process that doesn’t account for extreme emotion. Regularly threatens to hurt siblings (though doesn’t act on it due to fear of punishment). Will empathize with people if they suffered the same pain they did, but refuses to empathize with people who don’t have the ability to empathize at all- considers empathy a transactional thing. Other examples include brushing off people’s health problems, even potentially dangerous ones as “their fault”. Is annoyed when people feel heavy emotions, has been called “robotic”. Enjoys taking advantage of “doormat” type people, only hindered if they can’t get away with it. -Is driven by their own form of justice. They have tried to subliminally influence many people online they deemed not worthy to live into killing themselves, and is regularly aroused by others’ pain- the most extreme example is arousal from a video of murder- the teen claimed it was justice because the victim deserved it for allowing themselves to take sexually risky endeavors (the victim was pulling a stunt and got taken advantage of, ending with brain damage.) Is best sexually driven by fantasies of people being forced into extreme submission/subjugation. -Often black and white thinking, won’t tolerate grey areas easily except for their own benefit. -Has guiltilessly shoplifted multiple times, only hindered by fear of being caught. -Seemingly shallow friendships, often asocial. -Often has narcissistic fantasies, often lives in their own head where they are happiest. -Enjoys collecting people they find interesting but can’t emotionally connect with them much- merely wants to be entertained by them. -Can often feel empathy for others but won’t act on it/lack of compassion", "hash": "79c4b2afe4378e8cebc99d2080aa63ee85c74f50d9a1a50659d3fe2b4f5a5b54"}

A doctor got his sentence halved with an apparent diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome. I and others including one friend who worked with people with ASD for years don't believe the diagnosis. I think he is a victim of child abuse who came to self-medicate with strong dope which has blunted him in a way that makes him seem cut off in that way that might colloquially be viewed as psychopath-like. I think this neighbour and the person you describe both illustrate how these medical terms are at best - not that this is exactly a criticism and certainly not a damning and cynical one - working models that provide a literature to assist in management of the behaviours and symptoms. I personally don't believe so much in the terms as these working models of understanding. Where I live BPD is now 'Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder' and I was tentatively diagnosed with it myself by a psychiatrist who then immediately relocated, breaking the dialogue that might have coalesced this. I don't recognise myself at any age from what you describe. Having exposed myself to various 'working models' of psychological understanding for thirty years whatever it is that I have seems to be changing. I'm more stable but the stability is not positive. Mostly I'm not aware of people with an autistic spectrum disorder being criminally violent. But supposing they grew up in a neighbourhood where violent crime was normal. Maybe they'd model that behaviour in the same way people with ASD can model usually more socially useful and acceptable behaviours. Similarly a survival thing, but with unfortunate outcomes. If there is something in this then maybe my neighbour's doctor might have been hoodwinked in the same way that some of us meet people with NPD who we at first think have high-functioning autism, because we want to believe they are at sea, that they've in no sense meant us the emotional harm that arises. I believe the neighbour's doctor was hoodwinked because my neighbour's parents, living on an estate here known for child abuse, incest and domestic abuse, know what led to the start of his behaviours, whether either or both of them were the perpetrators. They've been negligent with the doctor whether with a secret agreement with their son for fear of legal reprisals should child abuse come to light. Do you know enough about this person to know if 'things happened'? To me it sounds like there is too little mask to be talking about narcissism or NPD. It seems to me that insecurities are much better masked there with a narcissism problem. What is the drug situation, do you know? This strong laboratory-altered dope is doing serious damage which sadly only those who don't use it and therefore have no denial about it seem to be able to recognise. One friend I had a decade ago is unrecogniseable now behaviour-wise and I'm certain it's the dope. The paranoia and paranoid misunderstandings are the key sign, and I get the impression inconsistent supply of it makes for extreme anxiety that tips over into anger, like someone with a messy coffee habit. I think once the strong dope is involved a person will be unreachable for a very long time. I'm inclined to avoid people who use it altogether these days. What I've said leads away from a certainty but I think that is not a bad thing - it acknowledges the openness of the person's future.", "hash": "3fcca5f6435a36cf75dbc1119afc6ea6bd95f1e06dc13128078cd57c72307713"}

I am a BPD patient, now cured, after many years of therapy, which I still attend, nonetheless. Thing is that I have an NPD brother. He is not officially diagnosed because he refuses to go and see a therapist, but I have talked about him with a number of PD-therapists (including mine) and the off-the-record diagnosis is NPD. Let me talk about him a bit. First of all he really thinks he is perfect. A perfect person, entitled for each and every good in this world. He is the smartest one. He is the best driver. He is the BEST in any case. His NPD traits begun when he first suffered from acne, which he still does. Whenever a pimple shows up, he is full, literally full of rage. He abuses mom verbally, he bumps his fists on the doors and walls, he says that in reality he worths nothing and then, when the pimple disappears, he suddenly believes he is the most handsome man on earth. He also manipulates people and especially me into believing that he is superior - as a man, a person, personality, everything. He tries constantly to downgrade me, especially in front of others and girls. For instance, me being almost 6 ft tall and him being around maybe less than 5 7, he constnatly states how short I am and that in reality I am a \"bit\" taller than him. I am not saying that because it annoys me but just to show you his attitude. I have a lot of gray hairs in my head, although I am just 29, still, when he discovered (literally) two gray hairs on his head, he panicky said to mom \"will I become like him?\", full of disgust, as If I had syphilis lol. He cannot accept criticism AT ALL. When I tell him something wrong he did, he retorts something wrong I did too, so yeah, like, I should shut up because who am I to criticise him, mr Perfect? If I insist, he starts insulting me and verbally abusing me, full of sarcasm. He even takes my clothes without asking because \"I have too many, so why would I need this particular sweater?\" The other day we had this huge fight. I have unfortunately lent him my earphones. After an hour I really needed them cause i had to speak with my girlfriend and it is always more convenient for me using them while speaking on my mobile. I politely asked for them 5 times. Then, the sixth time I asked for them he stood up more slowly than a sick turtle and intnted to go get them. So, I was like \"Yeah, I don't see you going getting them, hurry, I need them\". And he literally exploded: \"YOU WILL TALK BETTER TO ME I AM NOT YOUR SCLAVE!! OKAY AM I CLEAR, YOU A*HOLE?\". I was speechless but, I got angry as well and we started this huge fight, where he was gaslighting me, telling me that I was sarcastic toward him (while what i said was a humorous embellishment, obviously) and that he refuses people talking to him so badly, that I am an a*hole for talking to him like that and so on. I became very very very angry an strated trembling, begging him to leave and he was like \"No I will stay here cause I so enjoy you being so mad, I will even make you madder\" with a sarcastic smile on his lips. I cant and dont wanna remember more. Just stating an example. I could use a number of examples of such a behavior but it is pointless. I don't know if all this is narcissism in the sense of a PD but, since all people have narcissistic traits, I do need your help and opinions guys. I know that most people suffering, like my bro, seek help but he refuses. He said that he wont go to a shrink because he is not crazy like me!! Imagine. Do you think that a good strategy would be to avoid him in any case? We live under the same roof. I can't even. Thank you in advance.", "hash": "7d0a676e971c2f00fe58aa8f25435b67d67e693dfcb83d1b6b402be77aff360a"}

That would have the most positive sides for you in any case, not only due to your family, but for your life overall.

Another thign is, you can look at the way that he interacts as externalizing - we have some people here, too, from time to time, who show up and they dont really want help or want to get better, they need human toilets basically. They just want to take a huge dump and then they leave until their mental bellies start acting up again.

Hey Akuma. Thank you very much for your reply. I just realised that there is a thread about Nons, and I apologize for not having posted there. In any case, I just remembered that his whole you-will-talk-better-to-me- attitude applied to other family members too. For instance, he has this disgusting thing not flushing the toilet after taking a dump (lol- sometimes at least) and when dad once scolded him for that he was like \"I will not reply anything till you stop shouting to me!\". Instead of apologizing he demanded a special behavior. Oh God. My BPD is coming back in forms of impulsivness and self-cutting because of his behavior and no-one here respects that. I am that close to start cutting myself again in order to release the pressure. The bad thing is that I am still dependent on my family cause i am studying and do not have a steady income. Not to mention the corona-quarantine.

I think its understandable that you getting stressed out. Part of you might feel a bit trapped there, especially when you are being forced to have contact with people that you perceive as toxic. So frankly I think that getting aggressive and having trouble containign that is maybe normal and not necessarily a BPD thing. What I would think is though when your brother (and perhaps other family members) are needing you to contain their $#%^, too, that this becomes too much; it gets stuffed inside of you and you are trying to get / cut it out again? So I guess its a good thign you are still in therapy, maybe you can explore ways to make it easier for you or more successful for you to set clear boundaries. Clarifying this to both yourself and to the ones around you that you are not their soul-trashbin or punching-bag or toilet. that brings its own challenges with it, but in the longer run its much better, it supports your own cohesion, self-respect and other things.

I'm married to a full-on vulnerable narcissist! We were best, best friends and team roping partners for three years before we ever dated. At first I didn't want to date him because he's friendship was valuable to me and I didn't want to risk it. Those three years, he appeared he was very much in love with me (I know, don't say it), he was protective, kind, helpful, a knight in shining armour and very invested in my opinion of him. When I finally said yes to dating, I fell madly in love with him and a year later we were married. It hasn't been easy, of course and he does cycles through every narc pattern to a T. Again, it was a rough start but a lot of learning and educated came along to help us grow. Here's the deal, we are great, amazingly happy, repectful, mature and solid 90% of the time! He does get triggered, and does the ghosting thing, and silent treatment's, but few a far in between. They're short lived (2 months is the longest, and I'll explain). What's crazy is even during his \"detach phase\", he goes back home to dad, and he stays completely faithful to me and our marriage. He knows that's the one thing I will not forgive him for. By society standards, I'm out of his league (I don't feel this way, so please don't judge), but we truly compliment all aspects of each other. I'm very strong, independant and confident, I'm happy, positive and successful. He has no self-esteem, he doesn't find value in himself, basically he thinks he's a complete failure. I believe this is why we are so strong together! I'm very good at naturally empowering him. I do believe in him, I find so much value in him as a person and I strongly appreciate everything he does for me. I keep his supply filled and with ease because they're true things I feel and show him. On the other side, and its taken a lot support and education, but I don't need him to validate his feelings for me. If he hurts me, I handle it respectfully and in a way that's attacking and I know not to \"expect\" him to understand my feelings; and we've learned to communicate this aspect very well. This was a hard thing grasp, originally, but being strong and confident, I know where he stands in our lives, our marriage and about me (trust me, I'm not being nieve or making excuses for him). He's definitely my person and I am his! We are truly awesome together! Before passing judgement, he see's 2 professionals, on his own accord, to for the tools he needs in his tool box to keep our marriage in the right path. So why am I writing this? You see, my husband's narcissism isn't the problem, it's my father-in-law's narcissism that is the whole issue. His entire life mission is to destroy our marriage. He lies and manipulates my husband so bad. Remember me saying that he only runs back home to his dad. The relationship between that father and son is heartbreaking. His dad does not validate him, praise him, nothing. His dad treats him like he's 12, and my husband's maturity drops to a 12 year old when they're together. My husband cherishes his father, and I don't dare say one bad word about his dad...oh no, massive trigger! My husband has grown in his life's successes since being together with me. He now has a career, instead of being grunt labor. Its a fulfilling career that my husband is so proud of and works hard at it everyday. He has a nicer vehicle, credit score and saving; his competitive side and confidence with team roping is growing and he's getting more successful in this goal. This causes my husband to always blirt out things to his dad for praise and validation...like \"we had amazing sex last, I was so studly!\" Or \"I roped like this, or I did this at home for my wife, etc\". His dad just responds with an \"oh ya\" or shoulder shrug. Another problem is that his dad loved me at first! He was proud I had their family name, praised how truly happy his son was, how he loved that I spoiled his son, etc. Then, out of no where, that switched flipped to pure hatred! So, now that there's this horrible tension between the two most valuable people in my husband's life, there's a lot of turmoil in his head. My husband started lying to me and hiding just to have beers with his dad, the more he snuck around, the more evil things his dad would put into his head about me. His dad convinced my husband I stole 21k from him? What, we share and account and there's no way to steal money, he can see everything transaction. Yet, my husband believed him for a few weeks. Then realized it couldn't be right, andhad accountability for that mess. Then one night, my father-in-law demanded my husband divorce me and \"get that ring off my finger.\" He left me the next morning! His dad has also got physically violent with me, slamming me against the wall! And my husband justified it by just standing there, almost in shock or torn? This move out and daddy justification only lasted a few weeks. What's crazy is that his dad goes through all the narc phases but to my husband and towards our marriage. I think he pulls my husband home for his own supply and manipulation. Then the second my husband says wait, what I am doing, no, no, no...he gets really hurt and scared. Then his dad turns it all around and tells him I'm the best thing he's ever had, don't let me go, take good care of me, how much he loves me for his son, and how could you have ever thought about leaving her...ya, ugh!! The first of this year we moved 700 miles away from our hometown, then 2 weeks in his only brother was killed in a bad wreck. Firstly, this was the first and only death my husband has ever had in his family. Oh man, what an emotionally challenging ride this was, he was very overwhelmed. Of course, he goes home and his dad convinces my husband he has to move home because they lost their only other child and they have no children left but my husband (my husband is 45 years old), and he needs to be back in his childhood room. This was a deviant and sick move. So, my husband comes back to me, on the fight, very mean and nasty and moved back home, per his daddy's demand. He's been gone since the end of January. Now, he is starting to pattern back around, because he truly can't and doesn't want to live without his wife and the lifestyle we have in common, I fulfill his life/supply! I filed for divorce once, and it scared him so bad, that's when he found help, and went to his professionals. He doesn't want any one else! So, here's another piece to my problem-puzzle. My husband is ok and understanding that he's a narc, it doesnt make him perfect, or our relationship easy, but he tries very hard to keep our balances level with me being an emotionally driven person and him not knowing how to process that people have such feelings; however, don't you dare imply his dad is a narc, has flaws, or point out things his dad does to him and us. This causes a war! Is there anything I can do to end this cycle with his dad, or help my husband be aware or see the patterns there? Honestly, if I decide to divorce him, at this point, it'll be 100% because of his dad and the games he inflicts on my marriage, my happiness and my life. If I divorce my husband it will destroy him! Also, like right now, at this moment (per patterns), my husband is teetering between I've got to start talking to my wife, before I lose her, but he's afraid too, because what if daddy finds out, or hears me? It's crazy to me, that my high level narc husband isn't even the toxic one, his dad is! I recently \"suggested\" a plan that when my hubs has to run, since he cannot control that urge (and he'll likely always have that negative dad influence), to try and do it with maturity, no silent treatments and shorter terms. If he'd learn to skip the hate-my-wife phase, it'd shorten this to about a week. Honestly, it doesn't bother me that he has to run, he decompresses and comes back with power. Missing me keeps that spark and relationship good, especially for him. It also keeps reminding him that I am valuable in his life! I know, I'm probably sounding a little crazy, but we work, truly! Maybe a rare couple, I hope! So any help, please, regarding his dad? *I posted this on another forum and they lit up bashing my husband for his lack of accountability with his dad, they were very brutal and mean. Please don't do this, although my husband is a narc, he is aware and he tries, but he is genuinely a victim of narc abuse himself! It's a really tough triangle especially for him. He needs validation from his very emotionally and mentally abusive father and it's very toxic!! So please don't bash my husband, remember he's a victim on this spectrum! Also, my.husband, through his 2 professional ladies, knows how he developed narcissism as a kid, he knows it was his dad, but like a victim, he makes excuses for his dad during that phase of his life!", "hash": "a85e3b45e3c5a1968d21889a893edf15da535374079355c898dbe57542018823"}

I am taking tentative steps towards repairing a 'friendship' with someone who shows the traits and behaviours of NPD. I haven't jumped the gun in deciding on the viewpoint - the more I read and watched, the more ridiculous it seemed to not conclude NPD was the fair term for how she is. I had very little idea two years ago when things were going wrong and I blamed myself and apologised when in retrospect I shouldn't have. I succumbed to manipulation and gaslighting, and I was silent when this woman dealt in narcissistic and otherwise obnoxious gestures. I went through the thing, that seemed at one time just something I'd hit upon, of wondering if she had high-functioning autism. I've since seen a few videos talking of NPD and ASD being confused. (I've read many articles and some decent books too on the subject - a lot of it is rubbish and too geared up to 'turning and running', right though that very often may be.) I couldn't consider her to be just an awful person. I still believe a small number of details about her that seem in part to explain the reason for her difference, to do with childhood. I mean, if those were lies too ten she is a psychopath, and I don't believe that. Enough was said at times to show the possibility of growth. I've written a letter that tries in about two-fifths of its content to gently express what I feel I've learned. Some if not many wouldn't try this. I'm partly thinking our lockdown situations might make people see our current cocoons as places of not just self-protection but change. People seem to get that in some ways. In my letter I've 'unilaterally' apologised for not understanding what was behind her behaviours. I've included a reserved but articulate apology and my reasoning is that it softens what I'm putting to her, the accusation aspect of saying she has NPD, and more importantly perhaps because it is a different kind of apology to giving in to manipulation. I think. I've said alongside the apology that people do sometimes get undeserved power from being apologised to, and that they can misuse it. This is part of tentative boundary-laying. This letter I've written from scratch five times in the last nine months. I've deleted all previous versions. 'Fail; fail better.' I'm thinking I will post it tomorrow. I had left a gift for her last week, a film that I believe shows I've been listening to her. I once thought I was in love with this person. I have love for her but I am satisfied with the platonic basis of it now and genuinely would not even want to risk exposing myself to more given what I now know. It could go wrong, even messily. I will give up if so - I do need to feel I've done my best for this person, who is in her mid-40s, and who I can see continuing to wreck everything for herself for twenty years if her habits keep her alive that long. I am a quiet person who showed her patience and willingness to share time and to help her with an academic matter and some practical, techy stuff. I never 'used' that, as if I was bargaining. I gave willingly and only later made any kind of muted comments about her apparent ingratitude and the one-sidedness of things, once she'd blown up and made a load of quite feral, self-contradictory, self-deceiving statements. The fifth version of the letter I'm otherwise sure of now, but I don't know whether to excise the apology or find another way of saying that I regret being at sea before, without causing antagonism through the conspicuousness of the nearness of what I'd say to an apology. I do believe I knew someone twenty-five years ago who is very similar to this more recent friend. The way the matter has gouged into my life has probably been why I'm so heavily invested in trying something for this woman, being twenty-five years older and wiser at least after a fashion. What do people think? Thanks for any feedback. I hope that people here can see that I'm investing a compassionate approach, and I strongly believe in that, at least for now. I admire anyone who's accepted they have NPD or that NPD literature is a working model of understanding and who is tackling this, if it can be done.", "hash": "32c2b91cd5da0be6c5bb539047de6b4b94c65b2fea30d201a97c51f9d4fc6fa3"}

They just aren´t capable of corresponding with like, at least it isn´t first nature and will feel ´wrong to them\". Apologizing will show that you are willing to make yourself subservient in this relationship. Remember that a pwNPD doesn´t view helping them as necessary you, but it is a form of relationship where she will feel \"less than\" because she needed help and either feels indebted to you (and deep down resents it) and in the worst case, feels like they´ve duped you so they could use you as help. If it´s a question of boundaries that have been violated, it is a bad idea. By apologizing you are moving the boundaries even closer toward her court. Taking the higher road might seem to you like a noble thing but if she is really narcissistically disordered, it is a show of hands how far she is allowed to push you. So if you are actually looking for raising the bar in the relations between you two, you might try to rationally (as opposed to emotionally, we tend not to don´t speak that monkey language, rather refuse even if we understand) set boundaries as to what is acceptable to you. Keep in mind though that for a narcissist, making the first move to make amends is damn near impossible. Their pride doesn´t allow that. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "5b0df7449525f15136ee76689c4fcfb34087f0544bd928f327327bf4fed46959"}

In addition on some level what you are trying to do is devaluing her, because you are basically saying \"you poor thing, I didnt understand that you just have an illnes [I just googled]\" - which doesnt seem empathetic but condescending - especially in light of your obsession with that person, which doesnt exactly make it look like a selfless act of love, as you seem to try convincing yourself that it is, but about you having finally found some explanation on why you werent treated the way you wanted.

I posted the letter with the apology removed, first ensuring with a couple of edits that this did not go in the direction of creating any harshness. I appreciate both replies, despite the disagreement. I'm not a young man, am not inclined to take even well-written journalism at face value let alone glib and faddish internet content like many of the articles and sketchy ebooks available, and have been digesting what I have read on NPD and watched for quite some time now. Part of my letter refers to this, how I find a lot of the material, particularly the YouTube videos and comments under them, mean-spirited and short-sighted. I've said in the letter that all too often the people writing are so affected by what they've experienced with someone with NPD (or with a convincingly high proportion of its traits) that their conclusion or the phase they're at only sees abuse and malice. In many cases, especially where there is violence, that is functional of course and you can hardly blame them. I do believe that it is healthier, even if retreating, to arrive at a compassionate view of the person with NPD. Yes there is a perceivable 'selfishness' involved in this but that's just one element. I don't now take what happened quite so personally, mentally, though I am still weighed down with what I experienced - am depressed, to some extent, and with damage done to my capacity for trust. I'm having the self-respect to own my own condition and to view with self-awareness what of that condition arose from or was contributed to by this experience with my former friend. But if that was all I wanted, I could just think these things and not communicate. To me that is negligent and solipsistic. I chose instead to spend time trying to hone rhetoric to express something my friend might at some point click with. I also hoped that with the lockdown situation she might have more quiet time to become receptive, that she might be taking stock better with her avenues of narcissistic supply - which are glaringly obvious as such - lessened. Akuma, do you believe that it is only selfishness behind my motivations? If I say that I had hoped to at least try to plant a seed, for this woman's potential benefit, do you not believe that at all? I can appreciate that you might see patronage in this, and I appreciate that it could be perceived as 'devaluation' for me to attribute what happened to my friend's NPD. It may well be that that is how my friend responded in her mind, which would be a great shame. Isn't it also possible though, that the idea of devaluation comes from the set of responses someone with NPD has evolved? That this is dissembling? I am pretty good at criticising myself, sometimes accurately, with the benefit of forcing evolution, but also neurotically. Sometimes when rejected I'm at sea as to the reason, sometimes it's not truly an insult but reasonable defeat of an unnecessary infatuation and sometimes there's a neurotic component, even if that isn't the whole explanation. I do appreciate that as far as a romantic relationship goes there are things wrong with me or that are problematic that she could fairly cite or that she will have had in mind. But, more relevant the purpose of the letter, what hurt in a more lasting way, and what remains, are those experiences that occurred once we had still pursued a platonic relationship, which I wanted and which she says she did, that are echoed in the material on NPD, too often and too resoundingly to ignore. I would not risk looking merely like a psychobabble addict without deliberation. Once we were meeting as supposed friends, there was still a diabolical amount of obliviousness, rudeness (to waiters, taxi drivers and myself) that for some time I just did not understand, or refused to see for what it was well enough to question myself about it. I think this woman and I are fairly unlikely to talk again or possibly at most that she may shout at me or at least remark passing in the street that I'm wrong or to say words to the effect of \"No, it is you, not me!\" If my letter fails I accept that. I hope that I'm not the first to say at least some of what I did and that there will be others, that at a later date she may have a clear enough mind, or that enough has gone wrong as a result of the traits, that she becomes open to thinking about it. Akuma, is it possible that you identify with this woman and that therefore your response is like hers may have been, perhaps tellingly? Is there not something you can consider in this? That your view of how I've seen this is a defence that you could benefit from deconstructing? I feel this is possible, but I am at the listening stage, I've listened to you and am happy to listen more. Your tag refers to NPD in a way that suggests you accept the diagnosis - but do you still experience conflict between what led you to that and the discomfort and criticism of it? I mean no offence by asking about this here, and I understanding the strong moderation norms here are necessary and wise in the circumstances. I'm hoping that it's appreciated that I've posted here conscientiously and knowing that this sub-forum is used by people with NPD, or who suspect they may have it or are exploring the possibility as well as people who are interested, hopefully compassionately. I've used forums for 23 years and only very briefly did anything as daft as trolling or venting when I was young. I'm a quiet bloke, I don't listen to aggressive music and I've never acted maliciously towards anyone outside of that brief stupid bit of online folly in the late 1990s.

I was actually a bit surprised by the onesidedness of my perception, too and a bit scared of your reaction to it, which is weird but normal for me if I \"disagree\" with people on the forum. For me this also indicates though that - as cliché as this is lol - you reminded me of my caregivers. Especially my mom has had a habit of being very convinced she is interested in me, and has - now that I aborted contact with my family - started writing letters and emails in which she is pathologizing and infantilizing me, but in the tonal content of \"I am there for you\"... which for her probably makes her feel better after such projection. I see this in your post. In addition to that such reaction is almost a bit automatic, as after many years of the forum, the usual suspect coming [erroneously] to the NPD forum asking for assistance with relationships is not necessarily of high insight and good mental health and to be frank a waste of time. Akuma, do you believe that it is only selfishness behind my motivations? If I say that I had hoped to at least try to plant a seed, for this woman's potential benefit, do you not believe that at all? I dont think I have such positive perception of humans, no. I have an aquaintance for example who is a typical externalizer. Its always the other peoples fault. Ive been for 20 (sic) years trying basically every method in every book to get him to do that less. And I mean hes very extreme about this. Hes a diabetic, too. So situations arise where he goes in under-sugar-mode and I tell him he should maybe test his sugar and eat something and he will wonder if he should call an ambulance for me because I am \"having problems\", refusing to eat somethign until he can barely walk etc. But I've also realized that all this helpfulness from my part is also an inability to accept him; or more specifically a deep wish for someone to be clsoe to me perhaps who \"fits much better\" with an additional fear of lookin for someone who might actually fit better. Not saying this might be your motivation, too, just putting this on the table as an option. Also because in my experience really, trying to \"help\" people can be not only motivated by stuff we fail to realize for a long time, but also completely useless.

I am glad I haven't made things worse by continuing and I do regard these exchanges as some kind of success. I have some upset at the idea that my friend may have reacted in the way you suggest, though I'd anticipated the possibility - this is no criticism of you of course but a case of facing facts or strong possibilities. By chance I had found myself in another online exchange yesterday that fed into this. This woman has probably had a lot of male attention though this is not as a result of anything purely superficial. I think things have gone awry in relationships a lot whether it's down to the men's behaviour or hers or a likely fatal mix. We chatted briefly and regularly for two years before any meet-up - she is a waitress (downsized from a more academically informed career) and on Facebook when I intermittently had an account. (I do need to make her not quite recogniseable here, just in case.) I think she probably expected the worst of my intentions, and that prior experience attuned her for that. I haven't been able to defeat that. In the time I've known her she has been around brutish men including someone who threatened a disabled neighbour of mine. I think this is a case of her fearing less the 'devil she knows' than what she imagines must be lurking behind my quiet attentiveness. I have been near to cutting ties with my own families for various very legitimate reasons. I don't know where you are but in my country there have been policies in the last decade that have messed things up very impractically and dangerously for many people and my parents voted for this while seeing the condition those policies had left me in. They seem to have achieved a slight understanding of this all too late and I've seen signs of something like guilt or a wish to make amends. It's a very odd thing having been treated violently or with verbal abuse as a child, to develop a mental health situation and then hear unguarded expressions of approval of these policies and politicians, whether it's malice, passive-aggressivity or extreme naivety. I can't quite say stupidity. I have a very specific conception of what love is and have seldom seen anything like it in others but I do feel that this couple in there mid-to-late 70s have some kind of not overly shallow feeling for me. They can forget having me as deep in the family as my siblings ever again and it's possible a new experience could wreck things for good. I would think you know best what is working for you but I suppose I'd also hope that you can stay open to accepting signs of concern even if it is a clumsy mess peppered with their unresolved issues. I don't know you but I honestly had an amount of tear brimming in my eyes reading your second response and I do personally believe we as a species can have a capacity that is an irreducible fraternal feeling that is awareness of others, of others' stories, and though agnostic I have experienced something fair to call boundlessness that feeds this true awareness of others that seems on the face of it to be just a name and some words. (Are your parents overbearing, moralising types or just crassly insensitive and oblivious? In the latter case, though I suppose my parents have gone from the former to the latter with age, the latter seems something towards which it's easier to bear and tamp down the exasperation.) So, based on that, best wishes to you. If there are developments that might be of mutual interest in discussion I will post again here but will continue to read the forum in the meantime. I emphasise also to SelfSerf if they're reading that I read both replies attentively, finding - I suppose because there was less concordance and some resultant anxiety - more immediate questions to bounce off of Akuma's comments at that point. Certainly the last two sentences of your post remain in my mind. Thanks.", "hash": "ef377bd59ad7ef6ec86f26e7ff65cb9929ffd62f75fdb2291544baf2c3c9f7a3"}

I believe the question you are asking is in itself a fallacy. Apologizing is the expression of regret over one’s own actions, meant to let someone know you didn’t mean to cause them hurt or prejudice. As such, it should not be based on who the other person is or how you feel about the other person—it should be based on whether you sincerely believe you have done something you regret doing that might have caused the other person hurt or prejudice. It should be based on your conscience. It sounds to me rather like your real question is whether it is okay to try to manipulate the person to get the relationship to go where you want it to—just because you believe that person to be a narcissist. That actually sounds like something a narcissist would do... The answer is no. It is not okay to manipulate a person in order for your relationship with them to go where you want it to, independent of whether they are a narcissist or not. When a relationship gets to the point where you feel the urge to manipulate, it’s time to question the existence of that relationship. If that person actually is a narcissist, that doesn’t make it any more fair game. Saying they deserve it because they are narcissistic is also a fallacy. Narcissists don’t choose to be that way, and they are mostly not even aware of the damage they do because they can’t see themselves for who they are. Saying that a narcissist deserves to be manipulated back is like saying that a handicapped person, an amputee or a person with a chronic disease deserves to be treated worse than the rest of us. Narcissists are people too, and trust me, they suffer more than enough, precisely what their narcissistic ways are meant to be the painkiller for. If you send her that letter, there are two likely outcomes: it will have absolutely no effect and she will only laugh at it, or you will have declared war on a narcissist, and you really should know better than that. You can’t win with a narcissist. Sounds like it’s time to let go for good.", "hash": "80bfa4c1e26dd26845b905dbbe1275a7e37096381aa90cfb13e4a079ba3595f5"}

The narcissist will in fact go to extreme lenghts to justify his behavior and never learn anything from his mistakes, make belive, pretend he is perfect and infallible and it was all his plan from the begining, that he foresaw it. The infalliability trait is pathologicaly ingrained into the narcissistic personality remember. So like SelfSerf said, self deception is the rule, the default mode network of the narcissistic mind if you will.

I have just walked away from my GF since I believe she is one, if I describe her behavior, can anyone tell me if she indeed a narc? Or the problem is with me? When we first got together, she seemed overly controlling. I had to delete all my dating profiles, I wasn't allowed to speak with my ex before her, she was not happy me having female friends, etc. etc. She would have temper tantrums over little things like me using my cuttlery wrong, but at the same time, she was constantly sending me love letters, little notes, it seemed over the top, and she seemed upset if I didn't match the amount of cards and love letters that I gave back to her. Then came the first major problem; I had a female friend call me drunk one evening and I ignored it. I explained it was only a friend. As a consequence, my GF then got up in the middle of night and while i was sleeping went through all my phone messages. She then found a private discussion I had with my sister about getting money back owed from my ex (whether I should or not because it was over $1000) - it was only a discussion I had not interacted with my ex in anyway, just a private conversation with my family. This triggered my GF to go insane, and she had an explosive temper tantrum in the morning when I awoke. I then went to work and then found I was blocked by her on every form of communication when I got back to my own place. No matter how many messages I sent asking her if we could talk/resolve, or explaining that I had no feelings for my ex, she would not reply. She did not communicate IN ANY WAY with me for TWO WEEKS. It was only when I had gone to hers for the third time, written a letter, and loads of flowers she finally gave in and talked to me. During the silent time she would unblock me on messaging, only to block me again minutes later, then deny she had unblocked me in the first place when I questioned it. When I had turned up to her's for the third time, she \"pretended\" she was on her way out to an important \"work\" meeting, but I knew this wasn't the case since she drove off up - what she didn't that I knew - was a dead end street. Now the most recent episode. Valentines night. I had sent her a card in the post, got flowers, chocolates, but unfortunately a personalised gift hadn't arrived (I explained that I was sorry about this). However on the eve, I felt like I was being interviewed. She seemed to give the impression that I was at fault because I had not talked about marriage or possibly proposed that evening (I only know her 8 months) etc. I then told her that if we were to get married etc, we need to live together first, and this requires her to get a job (she has not worked for nearly a year and I had been paying for 99% of our outings). We then got back to mine, and she had a temper tantrum saying that I had bullied her about getting a job (I had not, and had been very calm and rational about it) and said she was \"going\". This time, I did not try to stop her this time, and her temper tantrum got worse and worse while I hid under the bed sheets trying to avoid confrontation. She then repeated the same behaviour as before, blocked me on everything, ignored any messages from those channels of communication that weren't blocked. 4 days later it was my birthday, and still I heard nothing from her. The sad thing is I had got her an engagement ring, but she just didn't know. I then gave up and stopped contacting her after sending quite a few upset messages seeing as she had ruined my birthday (I had booked 2 nights in a hotel with champagne but instead spent my birthday completely alone because I had no time to make new plans). She then (2 weeks later) unblocked me from facebook. I gave her the ultimatum and said if she doesn't contact me tonight I am going for good. In response to this blocked me again! This triggered me to drive to hers, and her mum was there and handled me at the doorstep while my GF hid upstairs. Her mum then told my GF to call me later, we spoke, and she apologised saying she was under a lot of stress at the moment (her mum is ill) but I said I would not tolerate such childish behaviour anymore and the damage emotionally and financially she was causing me. Her mum then started screaming for help from upstairs (even though she didn't appear that ill at the doorstep), and the call ended. I am still blocked on everything and do not know what to do. I am torn because I am worried she is overburen with her mum being ill, yet she has shown to me she has deep narcissistic traits. Also, I believe her mum is a narcissitic parent, pulling the strings, because her daughter is now looking after her, and she ignores me. It's like her mum doesn't want to lose her to me? Can anyone tell me if this is what I am seeing here? Or is this just normal human interaction and I have been overly upset by her need for space after arguments etc.?

I've only just joined and don't like to see a thread go unanswered in any forum... I have had an insecure-seeming girlfriend who had periods of verbal aggression, and a platonic female friend who almost certainly has the behaviours we associate with NPD. Your girlfriend sounds more like the first type, as difficult to work with as this is. Maybe since posting you have gone round in familiar circles and find yourself in the same place. With the virus situation you may be using social media more than you had for communication. I think this is a big problem. My friendship with the woman with NPD is probably in the finished-looking shape that it is because she was over-reliant on Messenger. Last February she walked up to me on the street, said, \"Can you unblock me on Messenger, I want to talk to you,\" and then walked away. To a 48-year-old man this seems almost funny (and she is 43, with the tastes and habits of someone half that age) but it's not really. This thing of apps messing up communication instead of aiding it is a disease that will outlive the coronavirus. I had sixteen sessions of counselling last year with the best counsellor I've ever had, and have learned that some mixes of neurosis just cannot work in relationships. The wrong buttons can only be pushed, unintentionally or otherwise. I have wasted a long time in my life missing people who I shouldn't; I've persevered with friendships that were never healthy. I would want to say to a lot of people, seeing the same kinds of thing being replayed everywhere - by all means never give up on anyone immediately and don't act in a fickle fashion as soon as anything goes wrong. But months of pointless pain and aggravation show that the polarity is wrong. There people just need to accept that things can't work and move on.

I am not sure when that became a requirement, lack of introspection, maybe it's implied. On a personal level though, I realized I was keeping myself at a great distance from others, judging them, really believed I am better, analyzing life vs living it. Starting the get over myself part was hard, but it's taken a LONG time to stop believing I am better than others, and I still revert to that in groups. I stand off, am very selective who I will speak with, over analyze what I will say before I say it, expect others to win my trust, dismiss others based on nothing much but a first impression... The bad part is that I am the only one who loses when I go into that mode. Everyone else enjoys themselves, while I am sitting there alone in my self-created bubble of superiority. I am a male and my choices seemed to be full on BPD, or NPD (AsPD was out of the question). I got most rewarded for NPD thinking, and behavior. Accomplish things, prove your worth, get first place or at least try, do not feel but do, be a leader do not follow. NPD thinking is what I got rewarded for. But again, is lack of introspection a requirement for narcissism? Or is it just the more common case? p.s. it appears that most everyone here introspects, so if lack of introspection is a requirement, then maybe few or nobody here is.

I feel like the passage of time and life can be described as a building going upwards. Your earliest formative years are the base and then as you get older you build more and more levels. Life hurdles can be translated as winds or other issues and you're either strong enough to withstand or you crumble. I feel like my building was structurally flawed, a flimsy internal build of planks lazily nailed together. And yet I was shielded by my spirituality and perhaps other things that kept me safe up until a point. A proper breeze wasn't just going to knock down my recent level, but knock down my entire tower. Everything wasn't built properly. It was a weakness in resilience. You may not have known from talking to me, I don't seem like a weak or shy person. And yet one, proper life knock would have teared me down completely. But luckily in the knick of time I removed myself from my emotions. My spiritual path changed to Machievellian and \"Satanic\" ideals, I read a memoir from a diagnosed sociopath describing the invulnerable way they view and navigate the world. Now I understand there is no point being sad because it accomplishes nothing, I avoid listening to songs that give \"feels\" and instead listen to dance/happy or dark/malevolent music most of the time. I was almost destroyed and it was so good, so horrid and twisting and mind-bending, and addictive... and I have this hole in me from codependency which just is pitch black and physically aches at times. And I want to be useful and used, but also I wish I could be needed (a common desire of codependents, but they seem to always be despensible). God... I wish I could be needed and belong to another... Like a yandere possessive boyfriend fantasy... Anyway something cruel happened to me. This isn't what almost unhinged me, and this didn't hurt me at all. Maybe because I didn't actually care about my boyfriend and the relationship was so new. But... he slept with another guy and sent me pictures! And the other guy was bragging about how it's the funnest relationship he ever ruined! And I know that was just #######4 talk, cause he seemed dumb but like... in my toxic warped and emotionally invulnerable mind... it's just so delicious. That would've ruined the old me. Utterly ruined. I still have pride so \"exposed\" them on Facebook and I reckon I got my little revenge or justice. That was more of a necessity than anything else. But !@#@... If I could do that to someone... or be with someone who needed me. I don't know. I just, like toxic and cruel things now. Can anyone relate to this?", "hash": "56864eeb755d740312ea6c064abcf0027e93e47d3a468d4e2060b1d572e63803"}

It would make sense to be hurt (even if it's just via experiencing disgust or finding it insulting). _____ I'm currently quite fascinated with 'reenacting trauma' because there is a lot of variety. Unfortunately, due to this whole extremist feminism movement, it's not necessarily politically correct to acknowledge anymore. With conscious or unconscious reenactments, one can range from becoming a perpetrator of abuse / violence, it can be a possible reason for developing an interest in sadism, or seeking out those who fit the profiles of their abusers for relationships or as an attempt to 'master' the event/person that hurt them (sometimes a reason for sex trade work), etc. -All these things can be seen as attempts at \"resilience\" or resistance.

I believe I extremely enjoy how I've become because I finally feel resilient. But more than that, I feel a lot more invulnerable. Sometimes I wonder if my state/condition or at least my moods and feelings, are malleable. So it makes me less of a victim. I can try to adopt the proper mindset and feelings. Now invulnerable and also happy for the most part. About the current thing that didn't hurt me at all. It didn't hurt me because SOMETHING ELSE already happened before that, that caused me to obsess and be in my head. But that other thing wasn't malevolent at all. I look back at it, and it was like nothing. And yet it did so much to me. Cause of the intrinsic flaws I was carrying. To do unto others what has been done to you... I was ALMOST destroyed and by that I just realised I need to clarify, it's less of a poison scenario and more of a speeding car almost hitting me. I recieved no damage, but I almost died. That tricky emotional terrain that unhinged 'empathic/apathic' people go through. So I want to 'do unto others what was ALMOST done to me' Yes I want to be needed in an extreme way. And yes possessed by someone, so long as secretly I'm in control of myself. Stockholm syndrome I think about a lot. Someone hurting you is like them dominating you, and if you find yourself having fondness for your abuser it just means they've dominated you to such a deep extent that you can't even rightfully hate them. No I don't think this particular recent event hurt me. Though I did act out of pride, enacting 'justice' by exposing the screenshots and people shaming them publically. But my pride is confusing due to the changing nature of the inverted and then the covert narcissist traits. I think what they did could be principally, logically labelled as a disgusting thing to do. Reenacting... um... yes. I seem to crave extremes to compensate for the years of codependency loneliness damage. My own narcissism traits caused an ego that prevented me from 'dating down' or 'chasing too hard' and 'getting used' so instead I suffered through, and it was the right decision cause back then I was vulnerable and I just know a single hit would have made my proverbial tower just collapse.

On the other hand, if narcissism is a behavioral disorder that has been acquired, then there is some hope, albeit rather weak, that these behavioral disorders can be corrected If I may, I think that citation lives in the past a bit. Noone uses the nature/nurture dichotomy anymore. There hasbeen lots of research now into how adverse childhood experiences affects the developing brain and also the childs physiology as a whole. This isnt limited to narcissism, it can range from psychological distress of different levels of course to a lack of frontal lobe development (read lack of impulse control, proneness to drug abuse), lack of different brain functions including intelligence - but even to diseases like cancer. Maybe Nadine Burke Harris TED talk about the ACE study might be an interesting starting point here or the talk by Kwame McKenzie about the causes of psychosis. When we are talking about neglect for example it is I think most obvious. The developing brain is hardwired to need certain kinds of inputs and responses and it develops based on those. If they are absent or dysfunctional, the brain of course cannot wait with developing until they appear, but it just grows in a way where the connections formed on the base of these interactive schemas simply are'nt there or are faulty. What we can see as an outcome is people with psychostructural illnesses, like the lowlevel personality disorders, dissociative or psychotic disorders, which come into being because often primitive mechanisms have become stuck in the mind, which would have normally been changed into more mature ones, but couldnt. The flip-side is though that, as we also know, certain genetic setups change over life due to our actions and beliefs and our brain also keeps on changing itself - else we couldn't learn new things. So this, too, I find is a rather hindering perspective, to say it's either behavioral or structural, because from the physiological side behavioral and structural are both based on brain-structure of course. I think what lies in this quote is the neurotic/borderline dichotomy, which in my view is a real thing, but this can't be broken own just into disorders where you need CBT and disorders where you cant do $#%^. After all non-behavioral psychotherapies like the psychoanalytic/-dynamic ones are also evidence-based. dx: SPD", "hash": "0d738b63f670b17c20428a9cfd8104c9b6d3306b1cd281cbae1d10b21bb2a0e9"}

Overt/covert are misleading labels, overness is realy a scale of outer/inner psychic energy focus. Unless you understand the label as who the pwNPD is abusive towards, then outward and inward abusive differentiation makes perfect sence, but that is not widely agreed upon. So better terminilogy would be grandiose/classical vs inverted/codependant narc. Causes of the condition are mostly developemental, not genetic, they stem from upbringing. If the child was not accepted as it is, with its strenghts and weaknesses, when the child aquired trauma, narcissitic primitive defenses evolve above the personality structure, designed to protect the self from further pain and trauma, so that the person may continue functioning. I might add here that these primitive defenses are NOT the self and are NOT even a personality, and those are fully unconscious. In jungian terms an unconscious complex takes over the functioning of the personality structure, stemming from the relationship to one or more parents (I'n my case was mother,oedipus complex, for inverted NPD). To the latter relationship I would atribute the degree whether the child aquires inverted/grandiose strain. There is no reliable research on this that I've found, so we cant conclusively say if the precondition for narcissistic personality is that one of the parents is narcissistic, and uses shame-based introjection as a propagation mechanism.", "hash": "1126712e69e1a21d399e774c1f811eb7a4d1dc04f89441def12f03525dc32f16"}

Hes right about that, those labels are $#%^, and people, even in serious research have no idea what they are talking about . So what I gathered theres essentialy two types of the narcissistc personality, you can cathegorize who the narcissist is abusive towards: overtly abusive or covertly abusive , the former being of course classical or grandiose, while the latter being narcissist-codependant, inverted or \"covert\", vunlerable NPD subtypes. But considering the shortcomings of DSM and that NPD shares lack of object relations and splitting emplyed as primitive defenses with Bipolar disorder (also called manic depressive), I must conclude that often NPD-invert gets diagnosed as bipolar. This is just a working theory becouse sometimes the patient is realy stupid (doesnt think at all actualy), like my new neighbor living upstairs, he says hes bipolar but I suspect inverted-NPD. He similar in this stupidity to one more case study of a colleague I know, and Im wondering whats that about. Becouse me and my sister were never this stupid. Its true, I didnt understand other people have thoughts, that makes you pretty stupid. They dont think at all . Impossible to have reason and arguments with them.

I base that on his thought patterns, certain revealing quotes \"...when Im going out of the house\", \"did make that noise then and there\", those are the quotes but what I mean is that he assumes I know everything he knows (only the narcissist has thoughts), I dont have thoughts and cant know things so he just projects his thoughts onto me, that I know when hes in the house and he isnt. No I dont know, I dont watch for him or care. So to delve further the is the covert type which is usually intelligent (me,my sister, SelfSerf?) , albeit not possessing self reflection and/or the covert type which is totally stupid, and even if he tries to educate he falls into retarded conspiracy crap like Bashar and mayan callendar, bibble verses, fish people (atlantis), ancient aliens etc., no ability to think and reason at all. Also one more important Jung says is that the patient tends to recall artistic images not at random, but that indeed the unconscious is purposeful and the brought up artistic representations are the ones relevant to his case study. So my neighbour Gary pulled up these images: Kestrel, an old french movie, but he showed the scene of a boy being bullied on the football field. In fact he played this scene more than one time, commenting that he \"realy liked it\", The scene want that special, it was just brutal bullying, no cinematic value whatsoever. The other example he pulled up was the movie \"Memento\" , now thats a very excellent movie which I recommend you should all watch. Thats why I'll wait a few posts to say what I think Gary is trying to say with that symbol, how it applies to him.", "hash": "151a54d0677b9c27662cf71d310e15eb09c14077e415e3ab70ed3bf1851fd507"}

Today I met a woman at happy hour, it turned out we dated the same guy!!! What a small world! I thought my ex only messes with women from different neigbourhoods, you know, far less likely get caught or involve in same social circle. I never run into him ever since we broke up. The conversation with this woman piqued my interest in womanizer or player's mindset( someone reponsed to my post said he is, I'm not sure what exactly is womanizer in this age, I have polyamorous friends, but they are very open and honest to all parties and people around them, it's different from this situation). She has totally different impression of him from me, he sounds like a narcissist in her description (I said it more like name calling, not in PD sense, I know nothing about PD, that's why I come here to learn), but I saw him as a clueless and insecure kid screaming for attention. In retrospect, I think I might let our relationship last longer than it should be because I was curious if he has any real personality, he always seems like an empty shell to me. I know, stupid me. But thanks to this conversation, I don't feel angry towards him anymore because it's pointless. we were dating at different universe, he played and married women speaking his love languages, and he mistook me as one of them, while I was trying to show him how to love from a different world that is completely foreign and scary to him. If you have the patience to read the gist of my side of the story with him from the other post. I see him as insecure, secretive, and socially clueless and annoying, though he was very gentle, quiet and sweet when only the two of us toegher. I did love cuddling with him and reading a book together or just playing guitar. He said he can be himself with me. We never fought, never raised voice to each other, he did walk out on me once when I confronted him, but it's not like a fight, I stated my stance very gently. He is very non-confrontal, says sorry a lot (while I'm very firm with my position and boundaries, I don't do it in a pushy way). So it doesn't sound he is a narcissist, right? The woman told me, he acted like he was king of our city, a Casnova. He chased her down the street (I first asked her if he met her this way, she gasped, yes! lol). He mostly texted her and went to her neigbourhood, she never went to his, and never met his friends (I was silently shocked she didn't mind this in dating, but as we compared notes, she got a bit upset said he seemed really like you, so I stopped asking too much of their dating details). They dated a bit then she got annoyed he would flirt with other women, she started to have no string attached sex with him (why women still settle for less when they want more, and they can actually find it elsewhere easily?). He was very flamboyant, fun, and sweet, and got upset when he doesn't get what he wants. So all in all, she said he is a narcissit and hardcore player. I'm a bit puzzled by the different perceptions and different behaviors towards us. Yes, the flirting and chasing women on the street pattern is always there. But when we were dating, he always called, we probably had no more than 10 texts over 4 months. I asked him if he likes texting (before revealing I hated texting), he said he doesn't text. He never acted arrogantly to me, maybe because I always took the wind out his sails whenever he did something superfical, though I did see he appeared like that in front of some people, when he talked to them, it sounds like interrogating. Later when she asked him for hookups, he said he was with someone ( probably me, or with his now wife, the timeline was a bit confusing, that woman dug out the wife's instagram, we found something connecting the dot.) So she stopped contacting him. He contacted her again in August and September! That's when we broke up and just one month before he got married! I kinda feel bad telling her he got married, I hope she don't get bad hangover tomorrow. This woman certainly did a thorough dig of his romance history. She didn't know he got married though because the wife's instagram has no picture of him nor them together. She found out the wife's instagram sometimes ago where there was a picture of them together but somehow she deleted that pic around September, weird. When she showed me all the instagrams of the wife (I wish I had an account to catch this early, but then cheaters are going to be cheaters, what's the point?), I realized the wife was never just a friend all along, she must have been one of the FWB. For him, it's not lying when he said he wasn't seeing anyone, FWB is not gf; It's not lying if he omits some facts, he didn't tell me it was her he went out town in June, it was her he went to the out of town wedding with in July. Clearly the wife had been infatuated with him for a long time, there were so many posts hinted her longing even though there were no pic of him. She follwed every friends (not many) of him, none of them followed her, she followed an account with his name(he doesn't use social network, probably she thought it was him initially). Several posts on the same dates about her inner struggles and love when he and I were out on a date since her moving in, like \"when there is love at least a drop, there is a patient ocean\". On one post she dedicate to her brother, giving him advice on how to love a girl, she wrote: give her all of you, in bits and pieces, despite the thousands of girls you may have entertained before... I'm deeply touched by their true love! Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding is nobody compared to her. I don't feel angry anymore, I have my closure. They deserve each other. I wish they stay married so he can be kept in cage. I'd like to hear real and fake narcissits opinions if he is narcissist - or if you are just a \"womanizer\" or player without PD - and what's in your mind and why do you do it instead of forming genuine loving relationship, long or short, like polyamorous or open relationship? I don't get why people have to sneak around or fake interest for sex or love, in this time and age, people are more tolerant and non-judgmental, you can always find what suits you without lying, cheating and breaking-hearts.", "hash": "a79b52e13e0cb2fc41d97e74643717f3f8c868172a28dda8515bfda0205feb83"}

It´s inherently fraught with how messed up the way of thinking is for a covert (plus most likely malignant) narcissist as opposed to neurotypicals and people capable of true empathy. Whoever wrote it is a genius or perhaps JN really put himself into the character, just playing himself (as his whole life and especially recent rapport of him seems to allude to the fact that he might not be far off from being one himself) Melvin Udall is a mug, self-centered, misanthrope of a writer who lives a sheltered life in a world that he has complete control over. It´s over other people that he doesn´t so they are allowed only to play along if they fit the plot. He uses people only to the extent that he needs, (as extremely distanced self-objects) while he goes on in the world looking for a mother(ly) figure. When his character finds it in the form of Helen Hunt, her self becomes moot immediately. She becomes a prop in his life or a sort of trophy for him to adorn his already perfectly miserable life with and already in the movie there are moments where Carol tries to hold Melvin accountable for eroding her sense of self-worth. (She is not blind to it, but is being blinded through flattery and compliments [which Melvin understands is a ticket into her life]. Now this character is not without some redeemable qualities. There are moments in the movie where he seems to actually have sincere positive emotions (shortfelt) but they are mostly from a passive, receptive position and even then his mind is just overactive and keeps narrating his life so much he doesnt really experience it. It all is simply an exceptional illustration of how a narcissist is not actually living in the real world. Being a professional writer of romantic novels, he takes great pride in the fact that he is capable of swooning the girl. And even though he has none of those qualities himself (probably fantasies only), as a narcissist, he still sees himself as the life of the party and the main character in everyone else´s story. He actually spends quite some time in the movie elucidating his lack of emotional understanding of life (some of the things he alludes to are the basic gist of human social interactions or rather shows what his expectations is of how people should behave but he himself is of course superior to all the typical niceties and social cues expected of people. He also often uses projection and calls others out on being a villain when in all reality, he is the one in the wrong. He has all the schemas going on his head and he knows perfectly how the world should work as he is actually going along truly living and breathing other people as props. So it is with his gay artist neighbour who he has berated since the opening scenes. His neighbour who Melvin actually deplores, becomes the secondary supply for Melvin to sustain his newfound relationship with a woman who is obviously struggling and is shown to be in a vulnerable position. He is alive only to the extent of all the narration going on his head, concurrently wearing a mask just as long as it is a good fit for the role he has set out for himself, mirroring and waiting for cues from others to know what his next act should be. (It´s all good as everything goes smoothly along, unless it doesnt after which he will be immediately upset by it and make others around him acutely aware of the fact that he is not pleased with how things are at that moment). He has extreme OCD (which I think quite a few members of this sub-forum do), which is almost like ´magical thinking´ tics. As if he continues on doing them, his world will keep from falling apart. He also seems to be extremely paranoid with how he is perceived by others, to a certain extent, always scanning around (also during his proud moments). Alluding to the fact that he is only there experiencing them if others see it happening. He is of course rude to butlers and any others he deems lesser than him. He puts them down to gain any sort of self-esteem, which remains ever-elusive to him. I could pick any number of scenes from that movie but it just reminded me so much of how narcissists are with their (un-)significant others and the way the movie ends is actually tragic, because his character played his way into this unassuming woman´s life and he knows the right poetic things to say, even if he doesn´t truly feel them. The narcissists truly remains a mere observer in their own life. If anyone would want a an affirmation of really how sad and confined a narcissist´s life experience is, I would recommend this movie. A 10/10. Also, found it hilarious that someone had written a case study on his character and prescribed prozac for the OCD as a couch psych. http://blog.udn.com/joannaliu/224925 “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "4344620cecc78b4f90c8a3ee64aceaf18ed80d23995f023e947724f08eb8eed0"}

I constantly make friends with people who fall victim to other female Narcissist friends and ditch me. I must be doing something wrong in my interactions with people to attract those that then attract narcissists, fade me out for the narcs while keeping in mild contact, then realize what’s really going on and come back to me, after which I no longer want or desire their friendship b/c they can’t see what is in my eyes blatant wickedness from normal. Or, worse, the Narc manipulates them in cutting me off, until they cut the Narc off….This has happened to 50% of my female-female friendship from grade school to now. There is NOTHING sexual about this post, I’m just saying this is how I always lose female friends and It’s annoying b/c I’m genuine and a Narc isn’t. I’m straight and Not lesbian (no offending, just clarifying the platonic nature of this post) This is something I'm doing wrong as True Narcs, especially female Narcs, are a few percentage points of the population. I know I'm not supposed to judge people as Narcs but these are people who have at times mentioned they've taken tests for it (albeit online, but they seriously show symptoms) I’m not talking about the pop psycology definition of people who are self-obsessed. I’m talking about the clinical definition, where it’s an iceberg-their need for attention is what you can see, and their lack of human emotions like empathy and sympathy, and grandiose self entitlement and lack of guilt is what really hurts people around them. To a Narc, you are a drug/toilet paper. Their brain chemistry needs your attention, but they resent having to pretend to be ur friends and care about you to get said attention, hence the eventual “discard”—throwing you away all of a sudden like toilet paper, since you were just an object without human emotions to begin with. AND THAT COULD BE WHY THE GUY YOU DATED OR YOUR EX BEST “FRIEND” RANDOMLY GHOSTED YOU! A NARC in hiding! No genuine emotions but a mask of it that became to much burden. Obviously, when you warn them they don’t believe you b/c Narcs are real good at making you feel close to them. I’m a nice person, genuine, empathetic, and people who naturally befriend me seem to be Narc’s target! I guess I have that sweet doll face look going on, I’m pale, I’m short, blah blah LOL But, I’m kinda a tomboy, just don’t look like one. I’m not real good at emotional stuff even though I’m female (INTP?), so obviously I can never win over a charismatic, emotionally intelligent and evil Narc. On a related note, ppl also constantly attempt to scam me. I think b/c of my look, I either A) act tough then nice ppl get turned off by me or B) act nice and normal and scamming attempts ensue. I mean, what should I do? Should I just give up and learn why Narcs are so successful? Are people stupider than I give ppl credit for? Should I find a way to find more street smart people? What am I doing wrong? Is the secret not keeping friends (I lose female friends when they move away or a Narc female get possessive over them), but rather making new ones constantly, on a very superficial level? When I’m a mom, I only suspect it to get worse, as you have to worry about bullying, PTA dynamics, neighborhood mom dynamics, the whole slew! And the narcs always are in the mix of these things! I have a side story to share: I used to attract Narcs until 10 years ago (I was 25 then) when my childhood best friend (“kate”) randomly stopped contact with me, her fiancé of 5 years, and our mutual friends with no explanation, and acted as if she had moved on all of a sudden with 0 remorse. Prior to this our relationship start being more one-sided and she just wanted us to all hear her talk about herself. She could care less what you were going through. She was raised correctly-so sadly, a better mask of fake humanness and more victims. Her fiancé of age 30 tried to commit suicide over this, he was deeply in love with her and a great guy. He ended up failing and is now paralyzed for life. Kate expressed no remorse and later popped up trying to sell her ex-fiance time with her specially trained emotional therapy dog at a 50% discount. she bought a small therapy dog for $3000 to take it to senior centers for attention/narcissistic supply. She let the dog loose in her apartment community after she realized the dog was getting all the attention, not her, and the dog later turned up at the animal shelter and was adopted quickly. Kate then proceeded to join civic volunteer organizations and meetups in the community so she could prey on kind-hearted older married men for validation. Rumor was she broke up 2 marriages. She was the “Community Narcissist” subtype—using community nonprofits as a tool for attention and hunting ground for married males to sleep with for attention. I went to therapy over this ordeal and learned what Narcisissm is and how to spot it/avoid it. The Therapist I saw over this issue, basically gave me a disclaimer that Narcissists/sociopaths can only be diagnosed if they are themselves in front of the therapist. LOL. That's not realistic in most circumstances. BUT, she told me that if kate was a sociopath/narcissist (\"Narcopath\"), then what happened was Kate was raised right, but brain chemistry wise/or trauma wise, didn't have the full range of human emotions like guilt/empathy/morals, so, being raised right just allowed her to wear a better mask and blend into society better. Then, she turned 25, and decided that wearing the mask all these years was too tiring, and she would just go on and be her true (nonhuman) self. SCARY. I believed the therapist b/c it's not as if Kate got cancer and fell of the face of the earth, she literally did a 180 and popped back up with ZERO remorse, completely healthy and annoyed that everyone was upset with her. Half of her family also got freaked out and cut her off. That was the last I heard of her... Looking back, she was always kinda low on empathy and loyalty and very self-absorbed. I recall her saving a kitten in the middle of the road--she documented her saving it in a series of instagram posts. A total attention tactic. I mean, the kitten could have easily gotten run over while she was photographing it from the curb!?! Needless to say, I'm doing something wrong here, to attract people like that, But the question is, what?", "hash": "a59acad5945bdd9a520003b4221ea77689ae2a61d28866c037964a591bdcf083"}

I want to be kind, but ultimately the advice there will tend to turn into 'why are you choosing people who have narcissistic traits?' We can only change ourselves, and if that seems impossible, well of course we cannot change others. Make a list of what you find attractive, because there are attractive traits. Could be an appearance of confidence, life of the party, charming, driven, energetic, they showed you much attention at first, etc. SOs of people with NPD are likely to end up disappointed in the long run. Ask the person with NPD and they will tell you, it is not some malicious intent. You fell for the show version, the idealization. Sometimes people with NPD can be an ideal, for a while, but why... well there is no understanding that but to be NPD. They can't keep up the idealization forever. It is what others approved and fall for, but it's really not malicious that the show collapses eventually. Once you have a list of what is attracting you, then you'll know what to be wary of going forward.

If so then just take my previous post and see if you can explain it to them, but... Most people learn by doing, explanations often don't work. They have to go through the experience themselves. It's ironic though. We are often quite content at times that some people are narcissists. Take work as an example. It can be a strength, that personality type that runs or sells the company, from which others benefit. Personally I am of the mindset that if a personality type exists, it's probably because it works in some cases. It's what others approve of in context.

Hopefully I can be of help. Are you actively seeking friends or passively accepting whoever approach you? I'm the kind of introvert who doesn't care about socializing, so I tend to be passive. But if the quality of people approaching you is not good as you mentioned, then maybe try to reach out to people you like unless you are a shy introvert, which might take some effort, but it's not that hard. I often approach strangers when traveling and had made some good friends! What kind of friends you are looking for? Going out or BFF? 1. For going out, it doesn't matter if they are narcissists or not, just enjoy the good time when you are together, don't expect anything more, if a friendship comes out of it, great! Otherwise, at least you have a great time! Say no when you are not comfortable with anything, if they take offense, it's on them, not you. 2.If you are looking for BFF, then look for people share similar temperament and hobbies with you, it's more comfortable and low maintenance. Also accept that people and relationship changes, it's sad, but that's life. I had a childhood BFF whom I cut off several years ago because she has became someone the old her would have despised, I tried to help but she was very nasty towards me, so I had to walk away. Make friends with kind people who have standards. Friends with people very different from you is possible, it takes work, just like any relationships. You have to know your boundaries, be kind, but know that you don't have to live up to other's expectation. It sucks that some people think you are easily manipulated just because you have a friendly face and temperament, that's why it's very importance for people like us to have strong boundaries. It's a painful learning process, but very rewarding. Good luck!", "hash": "d9cb9fd28628d96340ff724c8e9b9eb85963129738df138f39e194e5e4c3fccf"}

There are many disorders that semi-apply to me: depressive, anxious, OCD, narcissistic, autistic, paranoid, sociopath.... and i was wondering if you all would like to help me diagnose the main character in the popular series \"You\", it's also based on a novel if you want to do some research... the character has these traits: -he's very manipulative -he kills people -he gets easily obsessed and possessive with beautiful women -he's very good at stalking and researching -he has a high amount of empathy and an ability to blend in, the \"nice guy\" So yeah i'm aware this character is not a real person, but if he were a real person, how would you diagnose him? I would guess some combination of narcissist (he always thinks he's saving the girls he's stalking from worse people) and sociopath for obvious reasons, but to be honest i have my beefs with the DSM. Psychologists say the disorders are only supposed to be tools, but if the said disorders are not actually disorders and are just a diverse set of personality characteristics, then how can they even be tools?

Nobody can say for certain who is right. I am talking from experience, and the downside of that is that its subjective. What you call shame I would call self-denial, not accepting your strenghts and weaknesses, gravitating towards an ideal image, ideal self. Becouse the feeling in the strictest sence, shame, I didnt have that, before I cured myself. And thats how they describe the narcissistic personality. Shameless.", "hash": "8200c9700a1016603574363895bb76857f8ff7237537cacdbd1d64eb7025edeb"}

Yet, what exactly is a one? Someone on a different forum who became self-aware about being a vulnerable narcissist described it as feeling like an android who has just realized who and what he is for the first time. When I felt self-aware, and believe me this is going to sound strange, and I don't know if this is due to identity issues or what, but it felt like there was this hidden aspect of myself inside of me, almost like a 'monster' of sorts that was always there with me but I never realized it (please tell me you know the feeling), so I get the whole android analogy. I felt mini-panic during that time, it's less of a fact that you dislike feeling narcissistic rather it completely conflicts with who you really are. I guess I project a lot which is why I never knew before, but when you introspect you know there's something up. So what is it? If someone just told you \"it's required for healthy self-esteem\" for the covert/comp type or for the overt/NPD type it's caused by upbringing or whatever, then that's fair enough but deep down in my own mind, it means something completely different.

What I went through after self-awareness was almost completely like that. Although the sad part about is actually that maybe on a cosmic, objective level you might be thought of as innocent in the sense that the lack of awareness was a defense a child’s psyche built as a layer in order to ward off the horrendous nature of the world that was given to him by faulty, abusive parenting. And by that I do mean the less traditional parts of the definition as well, such as neglect, emotional incest, engulfment, parentification, seduction into inappropriate rolls (kind of like trapping). By the time awareness of it as a layer comes in, the hurt and the enormous weight of guilt that narcissist hauls around (acknowledged or not) makes it near impossible to empathize with their own self. If the superego is sadistic, then it has oft been said any recovery is a hopeless cause. When the truth is unsheathed it’s really a horrible realization. When before it seemed like the world just did not agree with you as the main character, suddenly you become implicated as the villain and source of all your woes. And worst of all, you KNOW you deserve every bit of misfortune that comes your way. It’s become a way of life. So in my experience, the narcissist is a true pariah. Now this can be argued but often through their own choosing. How I find some of the better descriptions of a narcissist to be is as someone who has an aversion to Truth. Since their whole cognition is based on a falsehood, their interactions with the world are limited to only the extent of interactions that they accept, i.e how they like to be perceived. As a pw/cNPD I know firsthand how that is congruent with developing strong aspects of AvPD and schizoid traits as well. And when they do actually come to the same leve as everyone else, i.e. when they are not so disconnected from reality through their false selves, they nevertheless are someone who is deeply cynical and disillusioned about life, to the point where they seek either consciously or unconsciously to sow misery and disharmony everywhere they go. A narcissist’s consciousness is actually pruned toward seeking out the potential negatives (initially because the constant state of alarm that their upbringing brought with it to their safety and wellbeing, a constant threat). By adulthood this threat is the baseline for every interaction and becomes constant, because their ego protects a fragile or truly non-existent sense of Self that can by swayed by the least of negative responses. What most every relationship is to a narcissist is essentially a prey or be preyed upon. In this sense anyone with cluster C is by definition predatory in nature because of their affinity to smell out weaknesses and social dynamics in a way as to benefit them, or further their agenda. Therein comes the automaton or android part, because all these machinations become a front for the hollowness/underdeveloped inner life. The person him/herself becomes more and more vacuous as the years pass and anther layer of defense is added. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "def379f0492106455da19ee7d494eba50b1a7255dbe270c1331ebc568a71bda0"}

I must admit I always thought it was me, however in the last few weeks I have been reading up on NPD and Sociopaths and Disorders and the NPD stuff I have been reading, I just look at it and think \"thats Her, she does that\" and \"thats me, the victim\", not a survivor yet as I am still with her.... So here is the gist of it and yes I am booked for counselling although im looking at the EXIT door as I don't think things will change..... She has suffered from childhood, abusive father, controlling, she is Bullemic, Then various boy friends and husbands abused her mentally and physically (apparently as I only hear this from her), she is the victim and has a lot of ex's(loads in fact) all had issues (apparently).... She has sexual issues, Sex is just for gratification and she regularly will have an affair and fling or an extra boyfriend, when caught out its not her fault. Se has relationship issues. She has food issues (bulimia). She has control issues and has to be in control and when the isn't you can see in her face its all going wrong and she is getting anxious. She is a pathological liar and even when caught out she says she will change and sobs forgiveness however the lies continue. She is manipulative, She is outgoing and the soul of the party, She attracts men like bees to honey, she flirts in front of me constantly, she is as jealous as hell about me and has a rage that goes with this. If it's going wrong for her she is overwhelmed and makes me feel guilty or pushes me away. She will toss me aside every six months or so and then beg to have me back like i'm on a yoyo or being flushed down the toilet constantly. She has a therapist - apparently its HER therapist (like its HER house, HER car, HER friends and HER Family) and we cannot see him together as its unethical as agains its HER therapist - My view on this is he has no clue as to her problems (3 years now) and she lies to him like everyone else. She Lies to friends and family and has a grander attitude but also plays a vulnerable part very well. She never says sorry or apologises and if she is in a corner just goes quiet, then after thought a day or so later comes back with a tiny point and magnifies this and now its all my guilt as my fault. Im constantly put down in many ways and she hardly ever uses the words I Love You, she says she is scared and cannot open up. She also convinced me that her infidelity is just her and I have to live with it or leave. I constantly feel like I am treading on eggshells with her. One time when in a corner and it all looked like she was going to implode she accused me of raping her when we were on holiday, which was a complete lie and threw me into turmoil as I didn't see anything like that coming. I'm not sure she is npd as I am no expert but like a say when I read up on it (2 books from amazon and a load of internet articles) all is see is 70% of what I read is her to a tee. I wrote to her and expressed everything I had been going through over the last year and she has agreed to see a joint counsellor (but not HERS) however she also agreed to stop lying and hurting me and that lasted about 1 day. So I will be seeing a counsellor in the next few weeks, just needed to type this up and ask what people how know about NPD think of all the above (there is a load more but thats the gist of it).......

This is something about having this that's probably the thing that bothers me the most (I really mean that it's horrible). After all the years of wondering why I have mood swings now I know. People with this supposedly have mood swings related to attention/lack of attention, introspection, external life events etc. I guess this applies more to the compensatory type but could also extend to all types as well. Take from online: \"Alternates between feelings of emptiness and deadness and states of excitement and excess energy [Forman]\" \"The average person high in the trait of narcissism, Dawood and Pincus argue, isn’t particularly likely to become depressed, but should depressive feelings set in, they would be experienced as plain sadness. The person high in pathological narcissism, by contrast, should be subject to feelings of a particular kind of depression “characterized by anhedonia [feeling empty and useless], feelings of worthlessness, nihilism, and boredom with life.\" The Penn State researchers believed that those high in pathological narcissism, with its dependence on feeling important, would show variations in mood corresponding to their perceptions of whether other people were recognizing and applauding them. These variations should occur on a bigger scale than the normal variations in mood most people feel. Those high in pathological narcissism should also show greater emotional lability, or more frequent variations in positive and negative moods.\" What goes up must come down and I mean that describes me to a T, most of the time shame, emptiness/lack of feeling, self-loathing (collapsing) thoughts, and sadness dominates my day, bar the short time I can okay about what's going on. Sometimes I'll be smiling, next minute slightly tearful, others irritable, edgy, stoic, down on my self, resentful, depressed etc. It's not as severe as in bpd, more like a mild case of the emotion fluctuations and not as intense but it's more emotionally liable than people who have very little to no narcissism, apparently anyway, from what I now know. Just how coverts will present in therapy for depression but leave as soon as the therapist validates them and sorts out there problems (which probably aren't as bad as they think inside their heads, it's easily to be down when your always absorbed in your own thinking and can't regulate that image of yourself in your head easily).

Freud describes this mechanism in Mourning and Melancholia 90 years ago. So while on the toplevel I think the distinction is funny, there is no explanation here why there would be emptiness and so on in pwNPD. But all these thigns seem rather close together anyways, Meltzers explanation of cyclothymic states for example is also about idealized objects but afair there it was about triumph over them or the lack thereof (?). In any event, mood swings as whole seem to depend mostly on unconscious splitting - which is also why they cant just be put away, because the reasons for the splitting and the inner objects its pointed at isnt usually in your consciousness. You could argue as a person prone to ego-fragmentation questions of idealization and devaluation are not really my concern. But dealing with this is I would assume done in longterm therapy, as there is no dealing with this in any other way. The mechanism always splits botht he self and the object and your ability to deal with the whole is therefore hampered. dx: SPD", "hash": "ba638a65a53ea3916ddb9fee96323eddd8f7fe4baa3ba53974f0d8053bda55e6"}

I agree that the term narcissist is wildly overused nowadays. The fact that most studies on the prevalence of NPD estimate only 0.5-1% actually have the disorder shows that the chances you are in a relationship with one aren't especially high. But, I was thinking about this the other day. Wouldn't it be fair to say that the rate of NPD varies dramatically between different families? For example, if there really is one narcissist in a given family, the chances are far greater that there will be other disordered individuals within that same family. As NPD originates in large part from dysfunctional parenting, it would be fair to say that a dysfunctional, disordered parent would possibly produce a son or daughter who grows up with a personality disorder also and their siblings may suffer the same. Then, there is the question of how much genetics play a role in the development of NPD and other personality disorders? As not all children raised by disordered parents will become disordered themselves. And similarly, not all children who are abused go on to become murderers or pedophiles. It is widely accepted by psychologists/psychiatrists that it takes both nature and nurture to create individuals with PDs and other pathologies. So yes, the term narcissist is way overused and the actual disorder is pretty rare (1 in 100 people at most), but the disorder and other PDs probably group together at quite a high rate within particularly dysfunctional families (that's my theory anyway!).

What is also messy is that people may outwardly appear to be similar, even if their underlying motives are very different. I am going to make a generalization, a story, it's also a simplification - A.) You disagree with what I learned, I am special/entitled, I learned I was special/entitled, I am right. B.) You disagree with what I learned, I am valueless except for what I do for others, I must fight back, I am right. Outwardly it appears the same, but the motives are very different. Even more murky is that some narcissism probably is healthy, but then again so is having a desire to eat food, to have sex, to compete, etc. Is there an I eat too much to the point of being ill, my life has gotten into trouble due to sex, have I lost my friends and loved ones being overly competitive, etc.?

Did your shame/anxiety manifest itself once you became more self aware of your NPD tendencies? For me, it's always been there, I think. Even before I knew anything about NPD or my possible tendencies. I can distinctly remember moments of my childhood of this anxiety; for example, there was a time in HS where I did well on a test. I congratulated myself in my mind, and then the thought popped in my head that I was better than everyone in the class. That thought was followed by extreme anxiety; even now, I can get a little anxious just thinking about it. I do agree about the OCD though. When I'm anxious/ruminating about another \"theme\" other than NPD, my belief that I have NPD is less of a problem. So I know that there is an aspect of my OCD that is amplifying my worries. xdude wrote: Interesting question. I get misleading messages though.

Just wondering how folks here deal with this? Other than just forgetting about it and not dwelling on it, and then wake up the next day and all is fine and forgiven, you know the drill. I've noticed my vision changes after having experienced an injury, it either goes red/orange (anger and shame) or I space out severely (emptiness), just wondering if anyone here relates. The advice from one of my closest friends is: \"Well, grow some thicker skin, would you really care though? Is it really worth putting your emotional energy into something like that\". I guess he has a point, it's possible to not care but then again I'm sure many people here know the feeling of what it's like to have someone say something about you. Please excuse me but I'm having trouble with certain terminology on NPD. I'm assuming by injury you mean after a fight or emotional struggle where you feel you've came off worse. I'm quite an optimist so coming off worse for me is short term as I fight to the death. However there are times when I lose a round and for a day I do feel kind of spaced out and detached. I kind of like it though. It feels like I'm floating through the day. The day after that I'm OK and ready to start again.

It's particularly exacerbated by being out in the world and not being noticed, not having the glass of admiration filled up. If I'm not being admired or noticed, I often feel worthless and nonexistent. I then do space/numb out, which makes it even worse, and I panic and scramble for anyone to notice me and pay attention to me. I then feel/become even more ignored and get very angry, so then I lash out as a desperate last-ditch attempt to get attention. Rinse and repeat. People really do ignore me when I'm in these states, so it's self-defeating, but maybe it's my mind's attempt to teach myself that I don't really need their attention. I'm still alive and relatively healthy without it. I know pwBPD numb out or disconnect a lot of the time. Maybe it's what's happening to me, or maybe it's a form of narcissistic deflation/depression when the False Self isn't reassured. It's worthlessness, a feeling of not existing and not being important to the world. But unlike pwBPD, I guess the emptiness isn't overwhelming enough to self-harm. I've never in my life cut or did any other explicit physical self-harm. I'm too scared.

This is what I have been suffering with for the past 12 years, relating to my OCD. Definition of DP/DR: Depersonalization-derealization disorder occurs when you persistently or repeatedly have the feeling that you're observing yourself from outside your body or you have a sense that things around you aren't real, or both. Feelings of depersonalization and derealization can be very disturbing and may feel like you're living in a dream. Symptoms of depersonalization include: Feelings that you're an outside observer of your thoughts, feelings, your body or parts of your body — for example, as if you were floating in air above yourself Feeling like a robot or that you're not in control of your speech or movements The sense that your body, legs or arms appear distorted, enlarged or shrunken, or that your head is wrapped in cotton Emotional or physical numbness of your senses or responses to the world around you A sense that your memories lack emotion, and that they may or may not be your own memories Symptoms of derealization include: Feelings of being alienated from or unfamiliar with your surroundings — for example, like you're living in a movie or a dream Feeling emotionally disconnected from people you care about, as if you were separated by a glass wall Surroundings that appear distorted, blurry, colorless, two-dimensional or artificial, or a heightened awareness and clarity of your surroundings Distortions in perception of time, such as recent events feeling like distant past Distortions of distance and the size and shape of objects Episodes of depersonalization-derealization disorder may last hours, days, weeks or even months at a time. In some people, these episodes turn into ongoing feelings of depersonalization or derealization that may periodically get better or worse.

I feel kind of bad/uncomfortable admitting this online, even on an NPD forum, but it's something I fear is getting worse (superego not controlling desires?) and despite being a good guy sometimes I'm afraid this will turn into a bomb. Every now and then, mainly if someone said something to me, or I feel resentment towards someone else for having something I don't (this is been getting worse as of late and it's killing me) I feel cold-blooded anger (and other people can probably see) behind my eyes. This doesn't really ever erupt into an explosion but instead this internalized anxiety and 'quiet' rage. I am scared, scared of what I am (vulnerable type) and scared of having these feelings which I apparently don't have much control over. I've seen that look in my eyes in my reflection, it's down right bone-chilling, and I need to do something about this. Tell me you know the feeling. If someone had a severe case of narcissism (not me) and was self-aware, where would they even go for immediate help for it if they knew it was coming?? Example, in my town (uk) there is an outpatient mental health place which I've been to recently for other issues, but the waiting list is almost a year long, if someone knew this was coming this clearly wouldn't be a solution so what would be? Doubt my gp/doc would know much about it. Just a question I had. How do you get over the feeling? . I want help for this but there is nowhere really to go, expect maybe seek help in the local loony bin (which is actually apparently a really nice place) but this isn't ideal and can be resolved in easier ways.

I hope you respond so I don't feel ignored or like I'm wasting my time. Lately I've honestly been feeling like I'm wasting most of my time on this forum because people usually rarely even acknowledge what I say/respond. Makes me feel dumb and even more worthless, tbh. Okayyyy, now that that's outta the way... My anger, and often rage, is often intense and barely (or not at all) controllable and containable, like I'm on the verge of just going apeshit on everyone. Usually it is triggered by unmet and entitled expectations. I was just at the grocery store and a guy that was 100% my type \"failed\" to notice me, or simply wasn't into me (my default assumption). I was extremely angry, almost to the point of rage. Often it extends into full-blown rage, but I am trying to distract myself, painful as it is. I am still very angry and upset when I think about it. I think there is a major distinction between anger and rage. Rage is a very primitive reaction, like what you describe. My eyes often become animalistic. I feel it in my eyes and others IMO clearly see it because they avoid me big time in those states and I want to lash out at anyone and any living thing nearby. Everyone is a target and I feel like I could do anything, even to the point of homicide. Luckily, I have never killed or seriously injured anyone, but I feel like it's a matter of time if I don't get it under control. It's like I \"split\" the entire human race black when I'm in those states. While anger is a more reactive and rational response to a perceived injustice or as an externalized form of frustration to protect the ego, I think the rage results in large part from dysfunctional object relations and a feeling of being devalued in comparison to the other. For example, when I was ignored by the guy today, I felt absolutely convinced he had the upper hand, and since I have poor object relations, I extrapolated this to ALL people who are my type never being interested in me, feeling worthless, etc. My self-esteem and is so heavily dependent on what other people think of me that rage is a natural consequence. I've never been a chronically angry person until the last ~ 5 or so years, and it's pretty terrible. Not only does it affect your feelings about and relationships with others, but it literally is physically very unhealthy, releasing large amounts of cortisol and literally making you age faster and more prone to mental and physical illness. I would strongly suggest you see a therapist to work on this. I am seeing one (the method is called transference focused psychotherapy). I can't speak for you so I'm not saying you are a ticking time bomb, but I think I was/am one unless I work on this.", "hash": "a01ba8124cf85fda345ab478d86fcc6bfe66e8ce68777bc4200a2382d6dbd21c"}

Going off the adage, I´ve been feeding the wrong wolf and he´s grown into a beast the size I can´t handle.

What I meant to write connected to the notion of adrenaline was that my job as a courier is essentially running on adrenaline and dopamine most of the time. Otherwise it´s a really rough getting going. If I´m not sharp and wired once I throw on the backpack, I think it might be for me to get into an accident as there are legit times when I kind of phase out and become foggy on the bike cruising through traffic. The other end of that is that after some time of going intensely, am so overwired I legitimately lose the sense of danger. When I´ve got on the steed in a somewhat vulnerable state, being amidst cars actually felt somewhat frightening, so as to counteract that, I just numb myself out (overstimulate) and go all buckwild insane pedalling amidst cars. Am sure it can´t be good for a fragile brain to be in a near-constant state of fight-or flight (I know am the hypervigilant style). Other than for the reason that it´s easy, uncommited earning, it´s almost like I´ve chosen this line of work just so to prove myself am not who I am. A part of me thinks I should quit caffeeine and try to actually settle down with but I don´t really wanna stop as I like the constant action. And am afraid of feeling even lesser-than once I do that. In order to keep up with earning tantalizing amounts of money (that I´ve ramped myself up for), I treat my body as just an object (I´ve read this as being somewhat common for NPD) to get around which leads me to treat other people like objects as well.

But if you want to push the first steps away all the time, rushing back into your inner world of self accusations until youre an old man, suit yourself. Ouch, a rough but honest one from you there. The thing is, my ASPD traits are so augmented nowadays and my self-esteem so low that I find it very difficult to actually socialize with new people, let alone find a new job. The housing situation is actually in a rough place both ways because I am situated between two cities. If am not staying with my dad (pw cNPD) The place I currently rent a room at is in a student town and the house is known as a kind of communal housing. The rent is sort of cheap, it´s a shared apartment and it drawns in people from other countries and those only looking to rent for a short while. It has the benefits of random parties and joviality but lately I´d rather avoid those as I´ve actually disliked the spontaneity The way I´ve rationalized it was to have more options available just going inbetween towns but I´ve noticed being inbetween two cities is not helping in the least due to the lack of object constancy (I´ve started noticing this for the past year more and more how it takes me a while to sort of ´warm up´ again towards people). I genuinely seem to forget them and our history together. Then again, it´s also been a way of keeping others at a distance. I And that has been fine by me as if I´m not here, there is no way they can get close and find out what a bummer I can really be. But it works the other way as well. People I´ve met, friends I´ve made in the other town I´ve become estranged from as well. Largely because of this newfound awareness of not being like others (in a bad way), i.e. capable of real friendship, I´ve alienated others. Before it used to be in a good way, i.e. thinking I was special. These self-attacks actually stem from realizing what a negative influence I can have on others and not seeing myself as being able to contribute in a worthwhile way. The other place I am currently housed entails living in a communal apartment with a shared WC and kitchen, which is not ideal, as the tenants change often due to the nutjob of a landlord. It´s owned by a sociopathic couple, and the landlord and her husband have a record of shady real estate businessing, skinning people to the very last cent, evading taxes and even having actual physical confronted previous tenants. I took it as my a mission for a while to undermine their rule but it´s more-so a delusion of mine to think that one is able to. I´ve somewhat relished the drama of hassling with them but I know they would kick people out of the house in a heartbeat for the smallest of disagreements. I guess it doesn´t help my fight or flight situation in the least to know that there is are such misers breathing down your neck all the time “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "fa1fa7d37491cafb5ff0d61a300c1314c1c05c73bbf2593abdc1f4f2afcfd176"}

They have an urge to get external confirmation to their self-deprecation and that makes them see insults in the behavior of other people. They suffer from every slight because they seek the real reason for them in themselves.\" Basically that.

Someone disposes on some food I was going to have in front of me, \"oh did you want that?\", think they're trying to get under my skin by slighting something I wanted. \"Do you want help with that?\" obviously must imply (at the time) that I'm incapable or doing something. Self-centered thoughts about being talked about others treating me with hostility. etc. Mild stuff like that, and so on and so forth.

I would trust people were my friends and then hear from other people they were being two-faced and didn't really like me etc. It feels much safer to assume the worst in everybody in case I am let down yet again. This is why I also find myself very uncomfortable when somebody appears to genuinely take a liking to me because, for one, I don't believe I am worthy or deserving of positive treatment, and secondly, I eagerly anticipate the inevitable moment they will turn on me. It is a vicious cycle, a self-fulfilling prophecy, where I am uptight and defensive, avoid eye contact, avoid any kind of commitment to anybody through fear of the uncertainty of how they will treat me in the future.

But this is far more emotionally charged and angry. As an example, I had an issue with a vendor earlier, who simply charged my credit card without my authorization and did not call me first as they promised. Rather than assuming simple disorganization or human error, I interpreted this as a direct attempt to subvert my \"authority,\" request, and agency as a person and as a massive power struggle that I needed to win. Naturally, this led me to act out and possibly over-express my frustrations to someone who isn't in that department. This often seems to lead to a chain reaction in which my own paranoid, worst-case presumptions actually end up manifesting in the other person. Craziness. I often know at some level that my paranoia may be irrational, but it is hard to control. I found one study about what might be this phenomena here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2069198 Not sure if it's related. Does anyone else experience this kind of paranoia? And if so, how do you deal with it? This sounds like me. I wouldn't call it paranoia but it makes my head go west the same as it would with paranoia. I go loopy when there's a lack of communication at work and I take it completely personal and I immediately think I'm being undermined. This is something I'm working on really hard lately because the emotion I feel comes out as absolute fury to the point where I feel like my heads going to pop. The thing is, I truly believe that it's everybody else's fault and that I've got every right to react in this way so I've started to try and think in different terms.

I remember reading about the self-insecure personality: \"According to Jaspers, such people experience inner humiliation, brought about by outside experiences and their interpretations of them. They have an urge to get external confirmation to their self-deprecation and that makes them see insults in the behavior of other people. They suffer from every slight because they seek the real reason for them in themselves.\" Basically that. Go and get some vape juice, guy sells me nicotine-free ones, presume it's because I supposedly look younger than my age then feel insulted. Someone disposes on some food I was going to have in front of me, \"oh did you want that?\", think they're trying to get under my skin by slighting something I wanted. \"Do you want help with that?\" obviously must imply (at the time) that I'm incapable or doing something. Self-centered thoughts about being talked about others treating me with hostility. etc. Mild stuff like that, and so on and so forth. Half the time, at the time, I really, irrefutably believe I'm right about these sort of things, the rest of the time I'm not so sure. Horrible crap to have this, makes daily life miserable, and that changes depending on your mood and how much time you spend dwelling over these sort of things. If this problem for you gets any worse I would really encourage you to speak to someone or seek mental health help, especially if you stop questioning these beliefs, some level of mild 'paranoia' as you call it, is probably in the normal range, or may even be a narcissistic defense that re-enforces your self-importance, but if it gets worse that's a horrible mental place to be. Of all the defenses against lack of attention or whatever, this is the worst. How do you think the self-insecure personality relates to pathological narcissism? It's funny, I haven't read much about narcissists being paranoid. The study I linked to above is the only one I could find talking about this. I do think it manifests for me in an almost psychotic-like state where I'm almost convinced the other person is trying to undermine or slight me, to the point where it affects my ability to be rational. Is it like this for you or is it a more measured, strategic approach of retaliation or introspection or self-/other-criticism and devaluation? When I first started driving at 16, I'd get road rage when someone cut me off and I assumed they were trying to undermine ME, it was all about ME, and I was absolutely compelled to get them back and \"win.\" In reality, I likely CREATED the situation out of the paranoia. I don't see how it can get much worse. It's been like this since I was an adolescent. -- Sat Dec 14, 2019 3:45 pm -- Akuma wrote: Technically though I dont think this classifies as paranoia, but is the opposite of it.

No, when they appear. From my perspective you have quite the wishy washy approach to your mental health atm and eventhough you are an expert in staring at and obsessing about certain stuff that does not seem to translate to you really looking at it clearly. I assume sooner or later your therapist (or parts of yourself even) is going to point you towards becoming more aware of your defensive maneuvers and possible triggers. That is most effective when it happens on a moment-to-moment basis, or in realtime so to speak. Rare moments of change-inducinginsight are in my experience depending on resonance between your ability to look clearly and to see the connections clearly.

I don't know how important insecurity is to NPD, but it's not explicitly one of the diagnostic criteria, FWIW. I think it's far more important in vulnerable narcissism, which overlaps significantly with BPD, which is almost by definition a disorder of insecurity (in attachment, identity, self-esteem, emotions, etc.) Insecurity seems more specific to certain traits or situations, but I'm sure they overlap. Superiority - I've noticed narcissistic thinking styles tend to receive projections of vanity from other people quite poorly; as a display of superiority over themselves. Perhaps it's an Aspie thing, but that kind of response hasn't ever made sense to me, so I'm wondering, How much of a point does this perspective have? If empathy can be effectively switched-off by Person A and their vanity outweighs the engagement with Person B, for example, isn't that kind of unconsciously devaluing whomever's being interfaced with? If someone seems vain or full of themselves, I interpret their vanity as a direct personal affront and attack to me and my self-esteem/self-image; I feel they are trying to make me feel inferior. I do then devalue them in my head, but it's not very effective and I tend to launch into full-out anger or even rage at how they're \"treating\" me. Competitiveness - Is anyone able to tease healthy from unhealthy? Again it's an area I feel blind to w/r/t other people, but I f*cking love challenging BS artists, so go figure. Is the distinction perhaps when it goes from useful to useless flexing? I think competitiveness gets unhealthy when it results in maladaptive aggression toward the competitor. For example, if a businessman can't beat his competitor in business, he might try to blackmail him or set his factory on fire because he can't stand the idea of losing (a narcissistic injury), or simply because he's a psychopath and wants to win at any and all costs.", "hash": "933a36b95d1a827d0c0129694443792493bc7ad4d96c6d08e501c3426dac611f"}

Envy doesn't consume a significant part of my life. I do believe others are jealous sometimes, which is probably narcissistic, but it doesn't seem to affect my life to a significant degree, which means it's not pathological. Jealousy had a function in keeping tribes together, so probably weirder to experience none than a little. Men are mostly just apes with flashy peacock feathers: if another one starts doing his dance in front of your girl, the \"jealousy\" motivating wedging him away needn't be the emotional kind (or hostile). I think \"healthy jealousy\" comes from protection; unhealthy from insecurity. Envy seems more like jealousy doubled over by selfishness or greed - has expressions in virtue-coveting, object attachments, pessimism where there can be optimism; jealousy is less desire-based, more based on maintaining the most 'evolutionarily desireable' thing available to us (love, sex) once connection with a partner has been attained. Nothing wrong with that if you ask me. Assuming others are envious of you based on little information probably is narcissistic; nevertheless situations occur where the thought will have obvious validity - and that too becomes excessively narcissistic (I guess it's possible to be excessively excessive? lol) if the observation becomes something of a focus. I reckon you can be just as narcissistic about the truth as you can with BS - and both seem to invite the same kind of response. In theory, I think this would be classified as extremely healthy self-esteem or maybe cockiness, not narcissism, but I think almost anyone who's obsessed with themselves likely has narcissistic traits. I don't think there is an adaptive reason to be totally obsessed with yourself. It liikely means you constantly want to feel superior to others, which is narcissistic. Is that just a technicality though? I reckon most people see self-involved cockiness as narcissistic. But say it's sub-NPD and there's some awareness of the outer repugnancy - like it's kind of being 'weaponised' to see what the effect will be - would you say that's primarily narcissism, or something like \"depersonalised mischief\" ? I don't know how important insecurity is to NPD, but it's not explicitly one of the diagnostic criteria, FWIW. I think it's far more important in vulnerable narcissism, which overlaps significantly with BPD, which is almost by definition a disorder of insecurity (in attachment, identity, self-esteem, emotions, etc.) Insecurity seems more specific to certain traits or situations, but I'm sure they overlap. Isn't there a sentiment out there that certain NPDs can be highly secure in themselves (without being psycopathic), and have a high - or maybe excessively high - self-esteem? Hardly applies to me though: had bad GAD in my late teens and developed an OCD/BPD type insecurity about sexual performance while sober (takes a while for some addicts to get back in the groove), and doing the Freud thing, it's pretty obvious that's mostly what my \"narcissism\" is compensating for (alongside the general futility that comes with being a chronic addict). Sex is fundamental to our nature, so lacking confidence means you'll lack something overall - if there's surplus energy (like bipolar-addicts tend to have), you'll eventually seem creepy. Ironically, doubt it would've developed that way without initially having the other qualities my attention drifts towards, in order to make up for it. If someone seems vain or full of themselves, I interpret their vanity as a direct personal affront and attack to me and my self-esteem/self-image; I feel they are trying to make me feel inferior. I do then devalue them in my head, but it's not very effective and I tend to launch into full-out anger or even rage at how they're \"treating\" me. Is that because they're effectively objectifying you? Not only are they acting superior: they're disrespecting/disregarding your own virtues, by focusing on their own. You aren't getting the respect you deserve; therefore they are being disrespectful. Objectively, they are being anti-social towards you. The more I think about it, the more obvious it should be, to not behave this way. I think competitiveness gets unhealthy when it results in maladaptive aggression toward the competitor. For example, if a businessman can't beat his competitor in business, he might try to blackmail him or set his factory on fire because he can't stand the idea of losing (a narcissistic injury), or simply because he's a psychopath and wants to win at any and all costs. If people react differently according to a scale between acceptable etiquette and their own insecurity, from what you're saying, much more empathy is involved in the healthier kind. I've read some of your other posts - are you a diagnosed NPD? I relate quite a bit a few things you've written about, but without meaning to compare, I might unconsciously be doing a CBT/vipassana-mindfulness thing to avoid the kind of reactionism/personal offense thing you describe. What's been your experience with those kinds of tools?", "hash": "5c9c74dc2315de9c9246265eccba243293cbaf587457dbe2da7ac936e0318ba3"}

I'm not describing it well, but there's a less binary middle ground between those two extremes, where stimulation/exercise have priority over narcissism. Narcissism is involved, but reward-juju comes more from the de-personalised interplay (i.e. how it feels good to stretch different skillsets), such that winning isn't necessarily a factor...and distinct from the NPD rubric, in that reward is proportionate to the challenger - win/lose may not even come in to it; rather it's a win/win split between exercise and better exercise. ifogg was an example of the kind of de-personalisation I mean. He's very clearly psychopathic/narcissistic, or whatever, but he relished having a challenger; and the closer to the mark a challenger got, the more he seemed to like them. Talent and ability is more interesting to him than his emotions are. Emotions interest me more than him, and probably care more about crossing over the line than he does. Asking because dissociation increases when stoned and there isn't the person's facial feedback to remind me of their emotional state, and I tend to be insensitive as a result. Bit more context: About a year ago I had a Nepalese housemate who played guitar, and when he learnt I played as well, he was keen to have a jam session. At the precise moment he realised I could do things he was unable to, his whole attitude tensed up, and after a few minutes he started going on about how he wished he could play the same. Children experience that sort of thing all the time, like when marble collecting re-emerged in the mid90s, but it's a hard one to meaningfully empathise with. The world isn't really solid, in that way; more of a wade through subjective dream-pools, of extremely narrow perceptual biases. Reality is neural simulation through personality filter . If we comprehend how that applies to our own person, there can't be envy towards that which challenges us to stretch ourselves - rather we appreciate it (or them); without comparison, we like them more, for the pleasure of their talent. Narcissism on the positive side - can't see any reason it can't have components of the negative (or that it can't slide towards the negative under influence of other variables). Someone in between, for example, might lack any thoughts of superiority and enjoy other people as much as themselves - but say they're also part-schizoid, spend most of their time alone and don't connect very easily, and they've got some depression: that 'healthy-competition' drive, which is a kind of aggression, might become part-hijacked by the depression; and because the person's part-schizoid and more detached than normal people are, they drift into inappropriate-conduct territory, merely because they were abnormally selfish at the time, and their native margins happen to be wider than the norm.", "hash": "36f237b335342a08e6d5fe8ac040c6e16e840d64249b9340b5c5af95d3974ebd"}

But if that grandiosity is fragile (i.e. vulnerable narcissism) and the False Self is therefore not robust, one can pendulum-swing to the other side, the deflated \"True Self\", but since the True Self isn't fully developed or fleshed out, it is really just an approximation of a person with no real sense of worth, identity, or self-esteem. At least, that's how it plays out for me, but I apparently have more identity issues than most with pure NPD (I also have borderline traits). I do feel like I have two different \"personalities.\" One is \"everything-is-great-and-everyone-loves-me covertunsure\" and the other is \"I hate everyone and everything and myself covertunsure.\" Maybe Jekyll and Hyde is more accurate. The shift into the latter is precipitated by a perceived rejection, slight, or narcissistic injury. But my default state these days is the latter. Perhaps it's a safety net to avoid further disappointment. The most frustrating part of vulnerable narcissism/borderline disorders is the inability to self-soothe and having nothing to fall back on. There is simply no true self-esteem, so in effect your personality is dictated by those around you and you are at their mercy, which just makes everything all the more unbearable.

An example would be xPD vs substance abuse disorder or eating disorders vs borderline pds. Then from the clinicians side there might be certain expectations that malleable, submissive patients are easier to work with and more pleasing, so certain diagnoses might give them bad expectations and counter-reactions - this is supposed to be addressed in their team meetings though as a normal side effect of psychological treatment. On the other hand side of course laypeople using NPD or narcissism often use it as a term for describing a demonized entity, not describing a, psychological disorder - especially not one informed by the intricacies and the history of the term used. We are seeing this not only with annoyed girlfriends though but with the so-designated themselves.

We are seeing this not only with annoyed girlfriends though but with the so-designated themselves . People who show up here clearly showing obsessive or introjective-depressive symptoms, demonizing all sorts of behavior as symptoms of \"narcissism\". A striking example proclaimed lately that \"not caring about anything\" (read depressive nihilism) or having his own opinions (read agency/self-esteem) are for him clear indicators he has ASPD or NPD [traits]. Tbh, this is going to sound grandiose but unless you had experienced some odd and downright scary things where it literally feels like your consciousness is being \"occupied\" by something, am not sure this position can be declared final. Some have said here and I think you were also of the opinion that there is no point in trying to differentiate between \"the true self\" from the false self. And in a general sense I would agree. But if you look at what a personality/Self is from a spiritual aspect it´s obviously very malleable and varies with whom the person interacts with. But in any traditional sense, people´s Selves at least feel to be less transient in time but to the Narcissist, this might not hold true and it is none more true than for covert narcs who have very little sense of their own self (being capable of getting so down on themselves as to seek even to destroy their any sense of self-worth through attacking themselves. Any destructive obsession with the self is however, still an obsession with the self (which is by definition unhealthy). Now, that aside, this True Self I mentioned earlier merely because I have experienced (and written here in a post once) after real live hypnosis aimed at bolstering self-esteem that there is a \"real self\" (or maybe a split of self, if you prefer?) under or alongside the false self. After going through a particularly tumultous time (that elicited me finally turning towards the ASPD spectrum and basically abandoning all my emotional needs that I used to hide so well), the day after the hypnosis I awoke in bed after a very emotional dream where I was crying out of feeling sheer relief like a child. I initially seeked hypnosis (and therapy at the time plus holotropic/bioenergetic breathing) to recover my lost self and emotions. The dream was so vivid and felt real that when I woke I was extremely disappointed to find it untrue (my mother having returned somehow, like having faked her death or smth) and I experienced like a minute of a shift where my inner voice was taunting my emotional body (or true/real self) so to speak, basically in a derogatory way. While I (as the consciousness or the observer) was almost in awe of what was happening and actually sided with the \"weak\" self that was being bullied because I felt like it didn´t deserve it, I nonetheless could not stop the harsh inner voice. Maybe this just illustrates a truly schizoid split but unless you have experienced it you would not skip a beat in saying it to be of demonic origin. Someone here has called it the devil driver as it actually kind of feels like possession. Any normal person (in my shoes) would have gone to therapy by now but the fact that I am almost incapable of calling off the show is making me forego it indefinitely. The suicidality and bad situations that your thinking puts you through almost seems like your mind is trying to kill itself and there is only this mute force of consciousness that you are barely consenting to. What other than demonic possession is this? I would prefer not to believe in supernatural forces but I´ve experienced plenty to believe both explanations might be correct. One mustn´t necessarily forego the psychiatric materialistic explanation entirely to admit that there is a spiritual aspect to being human. Narcissism being a very severe ailment. ASPD = Psychopath was after all denoted to be from psykhe+pathos as a sick mind or suffering soul and what else are we really? In my mind there is nothing in this reality to convince me that there are not interdimensional entities running the show that we are all plugged into. It´s just that is a thought one might not want to entertain. Or maybe it´s just the narcissist´s disordered thinking that denotes the Self \"Bad\" and The Other being Good, having fed this message subconsciously while growing up. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "cccfae8c44f5a05dcddbf6b477c8aba97e42f40125fc976db25f0e96c24af654"}

I'm just going to ramble a bit, maybe I hit some contact-point somewhere. The True Self/False Self dichotomy is ultimately about how true you are to your impulses, needs and desires - I've probably said this in the past already, it was \"invented\" by Donald Winnicott to describe alienation from children from their aliveness by the rules and limitations set by their parents. Its not used a lot in the context of NPD, so I never know what to make of it when it appears here on the forum, especially since it doesn't have a lot of concretely descriptive value when people use it, since its too abstract. If such a thing exists in \"Spirituality\" depends a lot on what branch you are looking at. If you are looking at Advaita-Vedanta of course you will find the Atma-Brahma nonduality and this ideas about some sort of primordial consciousness with everything else being Maya or the play of Ishvara... Its a hard philosophical problem for the adherents of that school to show how such nonduality would be possible and how you can realize it if its nondual though. In Buddhism in comparison no such thing as a True Self exists at all (Anatman doctrine) and enlightenment to a large degree realizing this, thereby destroying the 12 links of dependent arising by uprooting Avidya (believing there is a true self). I think its important to make a clear distinction between these concepts, as they are not only different philosophical entities but \"working\" with them also is pretty different and has different goals and implications. As to demonic possession... its hard for me to see what you are getting at. If you hear voices after waking up it could be hypnopompic hallucinations. But if you experience your own minds contents as objects (read out there) more often, that per definition is in the psychotic range. But interpreting experience of course is also done on the basis of beliefs. Having grown up in a very fundamentalist {the apocalypse comes soon] christian sect, I can understand that deconnecting yourself from childish ideas about demons might be a problem, even when you are not having some schizophrenia spectrum illness. But it can also just be a way to delegate responsibility for your well-being or for the multi-facetted nature of your mind to some \"evil beings\" so you dont have to deal with that, or so you dont feel guilty. dx: SPD", "hash": "c786b44d9b96ce4c9c6684797722c07a239a699db7a35920bd420caf41af3422"}

Yeah, if anything it just illustrates the Narcissistic psyche´s inability to take responsibility for their own actions. I think you hit the nail right on the head. Ok, sorry for the self-indulging slightly off-topic post but... As for what I was aiming at, along with the reference to bioenergetic breathing - essentially, a pwNPD comorbid with ASPD is so involved in their false self and detached from their feelings (basically equal to how sociopaths are able to detach from their feelings, with the difference that for them it´s just their emotions are short-lived) that the body feels just like a vessel at most times, like you wear the false self as a second skin. When I somehow find a way to ground myself and let myself \"feel\" in the borderline sense, I only feel despair and desperation. This usually happens when I fall ill. I regress very quickly back to that young self. Obviously, being that dreams have to do with your subconscious, after awaking for the first few minutes one might still kind of be drifting between dreamlife and wakefulness. What I experienced was like a split between my body and mind, as atotal misalignment. The ´inner critic´ was what I felt as somewhat of a foreign, possessive voice, whereas the sadness that I felt after the dream was very specifically stuck like a ball in my chest. And it was like locked in, feeling impossible to recover or to give that ´weak part´ of me any more power because it felt helpless, just stuck inside. With that holotropic breathing session I did a week or so later I actually released some of the emotion but only after I had done intense breathing for 15minutes+. It was very hard to break through that defensive layer and my conscious awareness did not at the very least want to relinquish control over my body. As I kept hyperventilating, I felt my hands tense up in a very non-human like way, like there was extreme tension in the form of cramping from my wrists and I actually heard slithers coming from my throat while I was breathing (i.e. reptilian-like). Now, one can speak of the reptilian bran taking over the mammalian one (the one that hosts feelings and affection. People heavily into spirituality might speak of a real war being waged on a spiritual level, in other dimensions, not seen in ordinary reality, but obviously felt by those more sensitive). When the instructor put a blanket on I actually felt like I was being cradled in this light. There was of course suggestive music involved but after that release of emotion I just laid on the mat crying for what was probably more than 30 minutes, I actually felt intense light and some sort of angelic presence in the room and it was incredibly soothing. (Again, there is no doubt that my beliefs growing up probably had something to do with it). Sadly, of course after recovering from it, I still was somewhat dumbfounded and was back to my old self. The ways of interacting with the world did not change in the very least (being all I know, essentially). But that hour or two there was a regression to that age I emotionally froze at. That emotional age (which bioenergitcally occupies only a tiny portion in my chest) I designated as the True Self. Which, obviously as you elucidated, is not the correct designation. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "4e06357192d91856a463159b6044b6cc299b466dc10a3438dcbaa3fb12c946da"}

Mostly, I avoid people because I'm scared of rejection and of not being good enough. But I can say that I didn't think I used to split, or at least wasn't aware of the mechanisms or what it looked like from the outside, until I started seeing my current shrink, who told me I split him. And it's true. One session, or even moment, I'll see him as a savior and miracle worker, and the next I'll be almost talking down to him (he calls it \"psychoeducating\" him cuz I start using psych jargon like we use on this forum) and devaluing him. It's very bizarre. I honestly thought that's how everyone thinks, but he said it's not. So I guess what I'm saying is splitting can be hard to pick apart if you're the one doing it, and it helps to have someone more removed (and preferably an expert) tell you if you're engaging in it. Limerence is definitely something I relate to. I've gotten obsessed with people before. But if they reciprocate, I often lose interest almost immediately and like you say, probably a defense mechanism, pushing them away as a result of my own insecurities. I also feel like, \"how could he possibly be into me? Something must be wrong with him, I'm a defective POS.\" Think there are only two options: a) therapy, or b) push through it and engage anyway, little by little.

And then I determine whether I like that change or no. Most recently - I had used the sequence \" force union, incite love \". Began to really, really really really - ridiculously not like it. \"Forcing\" a \"union\" is just - creepy, quite frankly. Doesn't resonate well. So it leaves me kind of stumped. I have the 5 cues with wave relevance, there's no more - just these five. There's other cues but, they don't embody wave relevance so, don't yield any effect. Plus, I had a contention that \"jealousy\" would be a naturally occurring external phenomenon, but, I didn't really feel it coming on just of its own accord. That is, without conscious implementation, it just felt lacking. So, with the cues I have - how could I form a sequence? I can't \"jealousy\" a \"union\", or \"jealousy\" \"love\", can I? Makes no sense. The implementers were \"force\" and \"incite\". But we're x'ing off \"force\" cause, it compromises the hypothetical non-impositional state of our personality. That is - we want male to female equality. Males are big imposing brutes. Females are non-impositional, non-confrontational etc And the natural flow is that females get the choice, selective control in the realm of sexuality. To equalize this - we must preclude the impositional element from our personalities as males - but without turning into spineless, emotionless nancies, incapable of getting females excited, basically. So I went into a deep state of thought. And what I deduced was that - perhaps there is such thing as, \"jealous union\". Slightly augmented the cue, or rather - stripping it down - from jealous y to just jealous. \"Jealous\" as a cue has the most emotional potency BY FAR, thus it must be placed first in the sequence. \"Love\" is more intimate that \"union\", so it must be placed after \"union\" in the order. In addition I feel \"love\" is like, a culminating application. Can't really flow-through-it, as such. \"Union\", definitely feels more flow-through, so we can place it mid-sequence, as a means to transition to something subsequent. \"Jealous Union, Incite Love\". https://i.imgur.com/R8C1Qu9.jpg Thus - I'm not really imposing a union - I'm just ensuring if a union comes to fruition, it's not doing so via imposition. It would happen I guess, via jealousy. Not something I'm imposing - but basically I'm ensuring that union would be the product of jealousy - via this cue setup. As in, being \"jealous\" could be considered a state of wanting something you don't have, or can't have, which exacerbates how much you want it, and with that \"yearning\" - per se - we can bring the individual forth toward a \"union\" - and from there further down the intimacy chain, etc. Does that chain of logic make sense to anyone else? Cause it's relatively a recent deduction and really only beginning to make sense to myself.", "hash": "6bf89908e63e19d0520f9a6ff914df2494c7cdd86ecace70a5e3ebf19284fe0c"}

Waves waves waves. Can sense it almost in terms of a \"pulse\" - certainly when the emotion runs strong. A strong cumulative depolarization of the nervous system in some capacity. What's peculiar is, of course nerve regulation throughout the body stems from the central nervous system, which governs nerve activity through other areas. With the strong emotional depolarization, that pulse - what I get myself is, it almost seems to resonate most acutely through the mid-thoracic cavity; i.e. through the heart. Obviously the heart being composed of an array of concentrated musculoskeletal nerve fibres, so we actually physically feel the nerve activity. I guess that's why historically sayings regarding emotion and love, they use the \"heart\" as a reference. \"Broke my heart\" - etc etc. That emotional depolarization simply seems to be felt most acutely through that region. Gut-brain axis also, like when you're at the discotheque and some really cute chick you were gonna hit on starts making out with some other guy right in front of you. This is exclusively emotional, but it actually feels like someone has kicked you in the stomach. So currently some investigators are focusing on gut microbiome as next-gen mental illness treatment, understanding the brain-gut connection. Bottom line is, outwardly we've historically characterized our wave structure as our \"personality\", but I would say it's more accurately characterized as what it is. It's our wave structure.", "hash": "de6fd5a7efd3310989a7b87db1c5b591b0dab80716432f4b4ab3a0f725406f57"}

Have you considered that perhaps your obsession with looks is a diversion you've created for yourself to avoid dealing with other issues? Well, I guess it's partly a projection, because I'm very picky and judgmental, and have high standards, so I guess I expect/project they do with me as well. And it is true to some degree, because other good-looking people can inherently afford to be (and seemingly usually are) picky. In full honesty, I'm apparently so delusional and narcissistic that your \"even if they don't see you as the most attractive person they've ever encountered\" triggered the familiar panic and narcissistic rage in me at my false or at least desperately wished-for reality being questioned, even of course in your case inadvertently/unintentionally and even though I know intellectually that I'm not the most attractive person in the world. But the idea of someone not *seeing* me as that enrages and panics me, maybe in part because my black and white mind isn't able to process grays and see myself as attractive \"enough\" so I need to be at one extreme or the other, otherwise I can't cope. I've realized this is an inability, not an unwillingness or character failing, at this point, so I try to be easier on myself about it. (Of course, who *wouldn't* want to be seen as the most attractive person in the world? It's flattering, but not a reality for almost anyone.) Regarding your question, instinctively, I feel the answer is no, I never consciously constructed a diversion, just that I simply must feel good about myself before engaging in relationships.

Yes, I've seen a psychologist for the past couple months, using transference-focused therapy (made a thread about this narcissistic-personality/topic214483.html ). I'm skeptical it will help. He doesn't think I have OCD or any other Axis I disorder, which makes me think he's a dumbass, even though he went to an Ivy League university and studied under (or, at least, I think he did) Otto Kernberg. This only leads him to then say that I'm in a cycle of idealizing and devaluing him. Which may be true, but it just makes me feel crazier than I already am. He doesn't think I have OCD because he doesn't see the compulsion followed by the obsessions (intrusive thoughts). I feel like the very fact I have intrusive thoughts should clue him in. With pure \"O\" OCD, the compulsions are either completely absent or, I believe more likely, less visible to the outside world. For example, I'll think, \"I'm gorgeous,\" to which I'll cringe and think \"I can't think that,\" and I have to think \"I'm not gorgeous\" to neutralize the inevitable disappointment of walking around thinking that and having it not be confirmed by the world. My last psychiatrist, OTOH, thought I had OCD and NOT a true Axis II PD. It's all so befuddling. What's obvious to me--and he agreed with this--is that whatever your training, specialty, orientation, religion, opinion, etc. is, biases you, kinda like the \"when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail\" phenomena. So he naturally lumps me into Axis 2 PD, whereas my last psychiatrist had more Axis 1 training (mood, anxiety, etc.), so he was more likely to think in those terms. This only further complicates the picture as it becomes impossible to get a clear and accurate diagnosis and, thus, treatment.", "hash": "7c80f6b6b39229f5f2f3db69114184dcf4ff1a46dd9d974387be6dbfdf2843d0"}

However - we acknowledge the external manifestation of the aversive \"jealousy\" - it can actually drive others toward us. i.e. something aversive externally, drives others toward us; applied internally - drives others away.

Now - jealousy has this - but, it's more of an El Nino, versus a nice laminar placid wave (as Sarandipity was alluding to), thus, it can come about externally, but not be embodied, not incorporated into the cue sequence (albeit we're aware it's a part of the process - like Sara was saying - \"plant seeds of jealousy\" - alluding to their external implementation). \"Love\" - I overlooked initially as a potential cue application (it occured to me but I excluded it), as it simply doesn't really \"flair\" emotion. It's too placid. I had always thought I needed to embody something to send emotion high (thus incorporating jealousy). But now I know better....

That small image, the largest size I can embed - is probably pretty hard to read. So - I've determined most critically - all the cues with wave-relevance. i.e. the architecture of the word generates a \"wave\", which resultantly has AFFECT, on the observer. That is to say, it implicates them emotionally. (if no wave-relevance, no affect - thus the cue effectively does nothing, no purpose to implement it). As to intuitive interpersonal wave generation, how this transpires on a neural to neural level via self dialogue - something implicating action potentials and thus neural activity perhaps? Hopefully this can be better clarified in time. For now - the wave-relevant cues pertinent to emotionality/intimacy are comprehensively isolated, and arranged quite simply in order from high potency to low potency - the lower potency representing greater intimacy - but of course requiring the higher potency as \"precursors\" effectively. And thus, we attain the most intimate possible state - \"love\". Which should theoretically give rise to nervous system regulation/optimization, alleviating nervous system related complaints and conditions. ....

See - issue I struggled with in the past is, if no man has ever embodied the perfect wave state composition, thus effortless inducing orgasmic sex in a woman, then no woman could have experienced orgasm via vaginal penetration...? Relativity. Jason covers this as perfectly as it needs to be covered. https://youtu.be/CyYQIcZacvA Doppler effect of wave implementation. A man (or woman) may not embody the ideal wave state, but RELATIVE to another person, it may basically have the desired effect.... at least at that point in time. I guess that's how the \"passion\" curve goes. Sex is great initially - then wanes in time as the wave state relativity shifts/weakens etc. Third party wave interference? Well - as Sarandipity mentioned - third parties can often facilitate unions, gettings others hooked up etc. They can also hinder and obstruct it. Re facilitation though - my contention is the third party makes communication easier. I've been observing this over the last few weeks. Three's a crowd - as they say. Can just make communication easier with that third sometimes. Breaking up buildings? Well - just say wave generation is via neural/nerve depolarization - I have no idea the frequency the subsequent wave occurs at but, I'd imagine it's extremely weak.

Yeah - I'm contending that's what happens with implementation of self-dialogue, when said dialogue contains cues with architectural relevance to wave generation, i.e. wave relevance In that, we're not typically conscious of wave generation, but can harness in the most optimal fashion - via the above diagram (which has been over a decade in the making - and I am not fully certain yet if it's even \"done\"). But basically - optimization in this regard - we resonate with, everyone. Bridge cultural gaps, societal gaps, belief gaps - but most importantly - the gender gap. Whether the process implicates structural modification via neuroplastic changes, long term potentiation? Or simply cellular function/expression itself. What I can say is that, over the course of using and applying various cue and cue sequence, my body has undergone radical shifts.

Many possibilities.... -- Thu Dec 05, 2019 8:10 am -- That paper demonstrates to me that, certain scientists are vaguely aware of the concept of neural wave generation, its perception (which I contend is what we refer to as intuition) etc, and that there's something to be exploited, but just haven't got yet, how to fully do so. -- Thu Dec 05, 2019 8:19 am -- justonemoreperson wrote: There is evidence that brain waves can interact between individuals; that somehow we click with some people better than others and , although most of that is subtle body language we're not consciously aware of, there are some scientists that maintain that the waves formed in our brains can resonate with others.

No one, no disorder, can take that choice from you. And you're also still a human being with human feelings. Of course you can miss someone. Even if you have what might be considered an abusive personality, you still have the choice to do right by others and yourself. And making good choices, despite whatever your natural instinct is, is possible. If you want to be faithful, then you CAN be.

If you're someone I barely know and I already barely want to interact with you? I'll weigh the cost of saying \"I don't really care.\" As for understanding how my actions affect others, this depends on your definition of understanding. I can logically work out why what I did was inappropriate and seek to curb behaviors like that in the future if need be but I won't feel any empathetic pangs. Are narcissistic abusers abusive because they are narcissistic or are they narcissistic and abusive? Narcissistic and abusive. Two different ballgames. Again, I can logically grasp the consequences of my behavior if I'm forced to stop and think about it, or if I see I've accidentally hurt someone by being careless. My heartstrings won't be pulled in the way most people experience it but often I still feel remorse in that I have failed to be the \"perfect person\" by visibly failing others. I want to be better for others in order to prove to myself internally that I have tangible worth. My long-term partner has been baffled by my odd reactions to things, sure, but all my empathetic blindness has meant consequentially is that I need to check in more frequently to see if I've done anything wrong. Can someone with NPD ever change and be a bit more empathic, considerate, open to talk about emotions? Again: you can logically be considerate as that's a part of the unwritten social contract of pretty much just interacting with anyone at all ever. Maybe I'll brush people off or push ahead of someone in the cafeteria, but when it comes to my close relationships I've learned to ease up a bit and not be too pushy. Can someone with NPD remain faithful? My last relationship ended because they were the one who had cheated on me. Again, I don't really care to form too many meaningful connections since my own unrealistic standards cause me to view very few people without a very obtrusive amount of contempt standing in my way of wanting to associate with them. Even if I flit about in terms of networking, I only have a few people I actually let get close to me. I don't respect the people I work with. It's especially tough to find something meaningful since any prospective friendship also has to be patient enough to let me know when I've done something thoughtless, rather than assuming I do things with chessmaster-like intent.", "hash": "fbb9e0f7f63b5c13851589539cb6eddc60c2935c648779f9f80ec2245433ccfd"}

They know it is all a front, so their little inner children are all laughing and playing when they sit around while they bolster each other's false egos. Somebody with NPD can eventually \"collapse\" and the false ego will go into extreme depression and die temporarily. That is the only time a psychiatrist, psychologist, loved one, etc. can truly enter the heart of the child and form a relationship. While it is very difficult, if it happens, the NPD can CLING to that \"parent\" for the rest of their lives (marriage). That is why the relationship between co-dependents and NPD are so strong. The parent just needs to keep the NPD in check or the NPD will rebel and go on a cheating spree like a child has no rules.", "hash": "7ab0d02e664fae7b881620019184a76c8bab1022a4f334feb8fabbd9ed924718"}

If I'm listening to a good song I'll picture myself performing it on stage and doing it better than anyone's ever done it. Especially when watching movies - I put myself in the movie and how I'd do things better or be more successful than the main character. I also fantasize a lot about serial killing or just generally going around causing havoc and destruction. The latter fantasy was especially strong in jail. My fantasies involve having fame/infamy, power, and/or success. Nothing to do with being seen in a good light or as good - just different and special. These fantasies are in the moment and thinking about them in my head satisfies the desire and makes me feel like I accomplished something. Moving on, wherever I am, I have a need to come off as different from everyone else around me. This manifests as \"having\" different opinions than others and being antagonistic to other's views just for the sake of debating and have no problem effectively arguing both sides of any discussion and winning(at least in my head I always win). I'll openly disrespect authority if everyone else is a follower or the reverse, speak good on an \"enemy\" of the group. I'll also alter personality traits like in jail developing a more formal, thoughtful persona to separate me from the more brash, loud, and low intelligence criminals. Or the opposite, behaving more like a fun jerk while in a group of polite people. Whatever happens, I need to win. I place personal power above everything else; especially in interpersonal relationships. I use calculated aggression to make sure I get my way or at least change the terms so I get some level of control and yeah that's still a win. Not always possible to control a situation but if I can't then oh well move on. Having a person escape my metaphorical chains is one of the few ways to anger me. When that happens of course I work on getting that back into my hypnosis. Though while losing something important to me will cause a flash of anger I never let emotions show because losing control is weakness, much less chase after the object. As such I come off as a rock and described as methodical. In jail fellow inmates called me a serial killer because according to them I was too calm all the time and had no feelings or emotions and that I looked like one day I would snap and beat someone to death. I certaintly do, I just don't behave like I do, because of my level of control. Closest I'll be seen behaving emotionally is when I use anger to make a point or get something. I've been consistently described as every narcissistic word out there. Arrogant, grandiose, egotistical, etc. I will say in my core I've always viewed myself as superior - but it doesn't manifest overtly as haughty, cocky behavior nor blindly thinking I can do anything. From my readings NPD worry about other's perceptions and feel a lot of emotions I don't. I also don't seek validation the way a typical narcissist seems to. I don't like being complimented or people being kind or touchy with me. It's annoying. I don't like people getting too clingy, following me around, or looking up to me as a superior. People who try to kiss my ass are weak. So, I don't particularly chase admiration, attention, unless I'm bored but not to regulate ego. I get my kicks and gratification from controlling people actions, perceptions, and emotions. I regularly ask people to do increasingly bigger favors because I like to push boundaries. That was quite a bit of info. Those with good knowledge on the core of NPD, do I seem to fit in your opinions? P.s: I've been dx'ed with Aspd on several occasions and never has a clinician mentioned narcissism other than one mentioning grandiosity. I don't fake it.

Would you say people tend to have both coping mechanisms but one used more than the other? Suppressed affect or an inability to feel emotions is not an aspect of NPD, where emotional perception and range is typically unaffected. Thats really more an aspect of certain strands of dissociativity, psychosis-spectrum disorders and also - if not always - in SPD. Might also be a general aspect of ASPD though, I dunno much about that. Grandiose fantasies etc. or a fantasy-life like you describe is more typical for SPD. pwNPD also may have grandiose fantasies, but the quality is rather different I'd think. SPD is on the one hand side more about an inner retreat and the fantasies can be rather elaborate stories, while the narcissistic fantasies I would see as much moer ad-hoc and more towarsd the end of \"unrealistic expectations\". In addition SPD types seem - from what Ive read - to orient much more towards being \"different\", than NPD types; so unlike the [cliche] type NPD that needs others to tell them how amazing they are, SPD doesnt want others to tell him what they are at all, they dont want others to define them. So in general if theres a quality of \"splitting off\" I'd say thats more SPD, while NPD internally are orienting more towards integrating / merging others into their grandiose perception. My 2c. Would you say people tend to have both coping mechanisms but one used more than the other? Nah, I dont think \"normal\" people would use schizoid defenses, or maybe even anrcissistic defenses. Schizoid defenses are per definition indicative of some low-level organization, or in other words you'd be borderlinish or schizoid or something, not normal aka neurotic, to use them. Narcissistic defenses tbh I'M not sure what that would be, as there seem to be conflicting ideas about it. Just like with the former though I'd think that, if its about restoring grandiose self-perception, that might happen when the person is actively regressed, maybe due to some trauma or shock situation or something. dx: SPD", "hash": "9454f5bb478b768d564692f74e6cf3a2bdde47744ce2632bc599d102cf4f58e5"}

The whole thought process of someone with narcissism is skewed because the rationalizations that go on through someone’s head are all to sheathe the true intentions to expell them from conscious awareness. That is because a lot of the times, the real underlying intentions might be looked down upon or completely invalidated and disallowwd by the superego. I went through 25 years of life almost entirely convinced that I was the good guy, no matter my actions, often being completely obtuse to how my actions and dispositions affected others. As far as I was concerned, my ‘true’ intentions were always good. I truly grew up trying my best to see the good in everyone, probably because I had hidden away how little I actually thought of myself. Also, a very odd thing about NPD is that somehow, the disordered mind is capable of also righting any wrongs like that and sometimes overwriting history/facts (either temporarily for convenience or permanently basically gaslighting one’s own Self) to set the record of intentions always to the side of the narcissist. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "c1fbc924ccdc6c8d41e21b52e6d872d510d526df771e36f3904cb30dbcb53564"}

For instance, I sometimes tell people I'm going on a vacation for 10 days and talk about the details of the trip. I get angry if they don't appear impressed. And I know (or assume) it may make them feel jealous, insecure, or feel bad, but I do it anyway. So my intentions are mostly good, but colored by narcissism and insecurity. And sometimes if I'm retaliating against someone, my intentions are to right a perceived wrong and put myself back into the superior position. The intention isn't bad, per se; it's not sadistic just for the sake of sadism, although it can have the same effect.

Anger perhaps alittle rage and conflict. The way I’ve chosen to deal with this is to play the perfect gentleman try to kill people with kindness and hopefully they don’t trigger (I hate that word) any unwanted reactions on my part. This works to some degree, I’ve kept out of trouble at work and I pretty much avoid all human beings whenever I can. Is it a perfect system no but it’s been working, sorta the problem is I detest that I have to do this, I feel like I shouldn’t have to change for someone else’s benefit. This also just causes the anger when it does come about to get turned inwards at myself, self medicating, other covert sneaky self destructive behavior I’m starting to catch on to. Today had someone deliberately trying to piss me off and I know what he was mad at but he didn’t know what was going on and was wrong, so I pulled my vehicle up on the side of him and let lose, absolutely destroyed him, am I proud of this, no but I did have a learning experience out of this, It felt good it felt great to just dump it all on him and not carry it around the rest of the day. Perhaps this is wrong, I don’t know that is just how I felt, right or wrong. I’d like to hear other people and what they think about this, I know kingping has mentioned looking for ways to better deal with these situations. If I had a volume knob this wouldn’t be an issue but I don’t I go from calm respectful normal guy to full on psycho with nothing in the middle back to normal again.

The thing is I can never remember what my anger is like. I have this really short memory for emotion it seems. I think it's because any emotion I feel at times is fleeting. It's there and it's gone again. A psychologist asked me once to explain certain emotions to her and I couldn't. How the f** do you explain something you hardly feel. Anger is probably the deepest emotion I experience but it's also shallow. I could be having an aggressive argument with one person online and having a pleasant conversation with another at the same time and neither would be aware of the other. One thing that triggers my anger is being disrespected, but that depends on the circumstance. You could insult me to my face one day and I wouldn't give a s***. Do it another day and I'll want to rip your head off. Another thing that triggers it is noise, certain noises that other people seem to be able to tolerate more, like someone mowing the lawn more often than expected. One of my neighbors used to mow his lawn a lot. I wanted to go out and put a f****** bullet in his head. I rarely express rage, but I think I must feel it a lot when angry because my first thoughts are usually always violent ones. It's funny, I can be calm as day in the middle of a severe storm (and I should know. I've lived through three of them) and yet I'll lose it over a pebble in my shoe.

I never really understood it, as it would come out of nowhere and I'd end up going feral. It still happens now, although not with the same ferocity. I think it's calmed down for a number of reasons. I think age has an effect, as you've mentioned. I'm not sure if this is due to physiological things like testosterone, as when I get aggressive I do so in the same manner as I used to. But I think there's an acceptance and a recognition of what's happening, and the awareness takes some of the power out of it. Having a wife who understands, to an extent, what's going on inside my head without judgement helps too. I think a lot of the problem is restriction. Good behaviour and following other people's guidelines creates a powder-keg of pressure which, at some point, is going to go boom. Now, when I'm heading there, she'll often notice before I become consciously aware of it, because I start becoming more distant and my language towards her is more detached. She'll then say, \"go out and shoot something; I've cancelled our plans to go out with friends tonight.\" Weed helps too. Regarding confrontation. I'm very confrontational with pretty much everything, and if I get into a situation I'll push the other person hard to make a move and then all systems go, but usually people back down. I was driving through a local town and this guy was driving right up my arse, so I stopped the car in the middle of the street and got out, stood in front of his car and started shouting at him, what the ###$ he thought he was doing. I told him to get out of his car because I couldn't hear what he was saying but he just locked his door. I got back in the car and drove off. My wife said, \"Feel better?\" \"Yeah,\" \"Ok, stop at the shop, we need milk.\" I guess what I'm getting at is, sometimes anger isn't a problem. Allowing it to come out in smaller doses will stop the build up so much, before you end up playing football with someone's head.

It still happens now, although not with the same ferocity. I think it's calmed down for a number of reasons. It sounds similar to the destructive urges I get, where I just want to destroy everything around me. They just seem to come out of nowhere because I don't recall anything triggering them. I just think it stems from a build-up of excess energy that turns hostile when there's not enough to stimulate and release it. I've had violent thoughts since early childhood, but the destructive urges didn't start until in my teens, so I don't know if it's even connected to that. As you know, I get homicidal urges as well, and while destructive urges may seem similar to that, they're different in that they make me want to destroy everything , not just kill someone.

Confrontational Tending to deal with situations in an aggressive way; hostile or argumentative . You've been on the forum for years and not once have I ever seen you show any serious hostility towards anyone or be confrontational. You usually come across as very passive. As far as I can tell, you don't even enjoy arguing and often avoid it. Me personally, I love confrontation. I love a good argument and the more aggressive it is, the more I like it, especially when there's potential for violence.

I was wondering how admiration makes one with NPD feel? Might sound like a obvious answer, but I am curious. When I get admiration it can of course make me feel good, but it also makes me uncomfortable. I find that I try to brush it off and \"disperse\" the admiration to others around me, such as reflecting back to the person who gave the compliment with a compliment about them as well. It also triggers anxiety and intrusive thoughts. Any time I talk about myself I also get a uncomfortable feeling, and it makes me hyper aware of what I'm doing/saying, analyzing my interactions to see if I am indeed coming off as self-absorbed. I will also do this when thinking about previous conversations I have had, and frequently it makes me cringe. Do you ever think back on times when you've acted boastful/self absorbed?

For me, my OCD \"obsession\" (but it may be more a narcissistic obsession or grandiosity, or a mix of both) is about my looks. When people don't notice me or find me attractive, I go beserk internally (and sometimes do virtually anything to get their attention). That's a narcissistic thing, because I can't tolerate not being perfect and universally attractive to everyone. But when I do feel like I get lots of attention, I almost resent it and feel objectified. Basically, I can't win. More later, perhaps.

It sounds like you may have pure \"O\" OCD and sort of a mental hypochondria, which I've had precisely before as well, and thus are obsessing about having NPD.

Yes, I do have other obsessions. Many are narcissistic, but some are not. I've had homicidal OCD where I worried I ran someone over. That no longer predominates. I've had hypochondria (arguably a form of OCD) where I was convinced I had brain cancer, schizophrenia, MS, ALS, etc. (sort of in remission, but rears its head quite often in more mild ways) I have a thing where I say the number \"77\" in my head when I'm avoiding attention or trying to repress my grandiosity (very weird, I know) I feel like if I do X, Y either will or won't happen—magical thinking part and parcel of OCD. But this often ties into my narcissism. For example, I have a need to be the most attractive person in a given place. So my intrusive thought is, for example, that if I have the thought, \"wow, I'm the most attractive person here,\" and I really obsess and get excited about it, then someone more attractive will show up. Weirdly, that seems to actually happen quite often (someone more attractive showing up randomly out of nowhere), so I can't help but believe there may be truth to it. But, this may be delusional.

Kind of like a betrayal to myself I guess? I dunno. Just curious, have you ever gotten therapy/medication specifically for your OCD? How effective was it? Just to clarify, do you mean when you sort of tested the thought of having Pure \"O\" OCD you didn't feel anxiety about it? I am familiar with that feeling, too. I mean, in theory, it could be a false indicator, since who wouldn't prefer to have an ego-dystonic order than a major, ego-syntonic characterological defect. Not saying it is in your case at all, just pointing out that it may not mean a whole lot in and of itself. But it's funny, because I can relate to testing different thoughts against the OCD thought processes/framework, seeing how they feel, and coming to conclusions based on that. Assuming, of course, that is what you meant. I have read a good book about OCD (Brain Lock) and seen several therapists more generally...probably 8-10 in my relatively short life. None has diagnosed me officially with OCD I don't think, but several have said I have tendencies/traits. I don't know why I can't just get a ######6 diagnosis. Driving me crazy not to have something definitive to latch onto. I have heard that CBT and exposure therapy can be effective for OCD. CBT requires you to do the homework, and since I have some kind of personality disorder or at least serious traits of one and I generally dislike myself very strongly, I always end up self-sabotaging, just to sort of prove to myself and the therapist that I'm too specially defective to fix. And as far as exposure therapy, in my case, I don't see what I'd be \"exposing\" myself to. There are no specific fears really at the moment, just obsessions and rumination.", "hash": "8fca9620fcd154bfdd761b47ab894d0f0ddba4b2fb747d7784dc9db64e41b897"}

Your post is a bit abstract in describing what you do (and of course I understand that given this is an anonymous forum), so it's hard for me to understand, but it does sound like you enjoy what you do, which is important. As far as what I like doing, you're right, I probably do need supply, though I'm not positive. My supply now consists almost solely of strangers staring at and ogling me for my looks in my public. I've just started a podcast about current events and comedy, which may generate admirers/supply, but based on my track record, confidence and faith that I'll keep it up and really work on it and build it up is almost nil. I also love technology and have since I was a little kid. So I enjoy creating software products/solutions, but I never see them through to completion, and I find the sales and marketing daunting and usually give up when that becomes critical. -- Wed Nov 20, 2019 1:45 pm -- salles wrote: Apparently having narcissistic traits should be an advantage to being an entrepreneur according to this article. https://www.fastcompany.com/3061922/entrepreneurs-four-worst-personality-traits-and-the-one-that-can-redeem-them It looks at four of the more common negative personally traits entrepreneurs tend to share, plus one.

Most majorly successful business leaders--especially outside the Silicon Valley software/hardware companies which seem to often be the creations of seemingly well-adapted young people out of Ivy League schools--has some significant personality quirks. Bill Gates, who seems level-headed, has been known to be pretty mean and blunt when he doesn't like something; same with Steve Jobs, who however possessed far more charisma and persuasiveness.

IDK, the \"all over the place\" comment seemed to come out of nowhere, but I guess you were expanding on it later on in your post. Also, what do you mean by crumbs? Your post is a bit abstract in describing what you do (and of course I understand that given this is an anonymous forum), so it's hard for me to understand, but it does sound like you enjoy what you do, which is important. You need to take a less stereotypical view of a successful business person. You probably have ideas of a guy in a suit on a high floor of a skyscraper, overlooking a city backdrop. The reality is that most successful business people are dressed in shabby jeans and a t-shirt, picking up van-loads of stuff and driving thirty miles to make a buck. Put an advert out asking for broken washing machines, offering free collection, and pick them up, rip out the copper from the motors and sell it. Then repeat for the next five years and you'll be successful. Yeah, I'm not the latter kind of hustler-to-make-a-buck person you mention, but I also don't have the ideas or aspirations of being a businessman in a suit. I'm keyed into the startup scene and know that most entrepreneurs don't dress up anymore; they just do cool (or not cool, but still do) stuff. I've just started a podcast about current events and comedy, which may generate admirers/supply, but based on my track record, confidence and faith that I'll keep it up and really work on it and build it up is almost nil. This describes 99% of online content. Get offline and do something else; do it as a hobby but it is not going to be your thing. What you're describing here is the exact opposite of your skills. It requires dedication and consistency. Business requires 1% imagination and ideas and 99% percent hard work. If you're honest with yourself and know that you can't be consistent, then you might be better off getting a job. You don't believe consistent habits can be created? Regarding the bolded part, I've thought about getting a job many times and even took one across the country, which I was also fired from, but every time I talk with recruiters etc now I just don't feel excited about it and don't want to be bound by someone else's requirements or schedule.", "hash": "8e98cc41bef91ff117462858a8b6d7b47aafc3ba93cac4ca0149012658be111e"}

My father is narcissistic, but I don't think he is quite pathological. Or maybe he mellowed with time. The narcissism mostly manifests in him thinking he's always right and knows everything, almost a God complex. He pretends he's humble and says he doesn't know much, but actions (or in this case, advice or wisdom in specific situations that call for it) speak louder than abstract words. He also has a lot of followers in his business, which I'm sure he enjoys. But he isn't the traditional, peacocking overt narcissist.

I have OCD, I believe, never formally diagnosed because it doesn't fit the classic hand-washing or checking (although I do get the latter to some degree), but is more pure-obsessional (pure-O) OCD. For instance, if I'm an airplane, I'll have a positive, optimistic, yet intrusive thought like \"we won't have turbulence.\" I then have to neutralize that thought by thinking \"we might have turbulence,\" which leads to me obsessively focusing on and looking for any signs of turbulence. I feel like there is a true connection between thought and the real world (thought-action fusion). It also ties heavily into my narcissism. For instance, I'll have the thought, \"I'm gorgeous,\" which makes me mentally cringe and feel the need to immediately resist and counter that thought with \"no I'm not\".\" Because if I think I'm gorgeous, I'll walk around with overconfidence (grandiosity) and inevitably be shot down by the real world and my actual attractiveness level (vulnerable narcissism). Magical thinking also occurs for me in perhaps non-strictly-OCD related ways and more narcissistic/borderline. For instance, I'll split into two fragmented \"personalities\" of sorts, where in one split I'm perfect, everyone finds me attractive, no one will reject me, etc. And in the other split, I'm disgusting, repulsive, no one wants me, etc. The magical thinking is that each split actually creates its own, independent reality, if that makes any sense.

But I still think only about her and how to get in touch with her. My mate will be sending her a message. The psychedelics were usefull in facilitating change. Mostly dealing with the feelings I still have for her. My feelings have been changing depending on the understanding of the situation, and psychedelics make it easier to find and integrate the new feelings and the Jungian views on personality. Example: Ive just been integrating the perspective that we might have been mirror souls http://www.thelawofattraction.com/twin-flames/ . And that means that only she is important ever. I would have never thought Id be looking to sites like that for answers but they are the best explanation I have for what happened.

Make all of this worth something to you in a more practical sense? Yes I did try, all I did in my last 5 workplaces was looking for a girlfriend. And I got fired from each and every one becouse Im still mentaly ill self abusive. No matter that nothing will ever be as good, I just dont want to be alone anymore, like you said hopefully I learned enough to not hate the next girl. But recently after the 2nd hyperspace event me and the OCD friend that's been seeing me through this agreed that if Im still self abusive, doesnt make sence to have other people in my life. So I realy have nothing except what I learned from my \"relationship\" with her, so I dont know the only solution I have for the moment is dreaming up the relationship, holding my pillow thinking of her and imagining her forgivness. I had that idea before Arthur imagined his relationship in the Joker by the way. I am still repeating the same mistakes, unable to change anything. At least I had an in-detail illustration how the disociative processes work while chatting with her best girlfriend, over the course of 9-10 months. How I just imagined the person im talking to, as stupid as old me, so she didnt need to write back. She was too stupid, she just listened to the wisdom of the buddha. How your not able to understand, even thought you wrote it precisely . That she hates you becouse you broke her best girlfriends heart (thats not the reason). And what was realy happeneing was I had to trust her completely and go desperate for her becouse she hated me, like for all the girls before. Always a disaster.

Case in point. Yes, 100%. Individuation is exactly what I´ve been pondering about lately. It´s boiled down to the idea that I absolutely abhor my dad on some days but on most days this hate towards him and his mannerisms is the only emotion I experience so am really defined by this. Am defined by my enemy so to speak. And so is it with my Grandmother where on some days it seems like she has this trouble with individuation herself being HPD and having parentified me after her daughter (my mother) died. The thing is, all that you (Akuma) have written in response to my rambling threads was difficult for me to fathom when you first posted the because I was expecting something different - validation mostly I reckon so I swept it aside. Some of meanings of those posts have started to make more sense to me. I had some weird epiphany yesterday where I admitted some fearful thoughts and feelings of regret about my life so far. It didn´t necessary lead anywhere but a part of me kind of snapped out of the bubble of a victim mentality and understood that if I don´t change my circumstances, nothing will either. A complete snap out of it unfortunately does not seem possible for now because this weird mixture of defenses I have keep shifting the blame - ASPD traits externalize it to my lack of good parental figures during my upbringing, my current situation, the way the world is set up and the schizoidish part is more like (I´ll just wait here until someone takes notice of me, which realistically could be forever because everyone has their own lives). Am not out of the woods by any means but I guess this weird split of ruthlessness VS absolute idling (you need to be productive to make something of yourself - you´re okay doing ###$ all - none of it matters) is something I´m at least getting the hang of. But yeah the truth is it´s very difficult for me to care about much these days so making \"real goals\" for myself is kind of on the wayside.

Im doing quite the oposite of denying my needs, Im actualy aknowledging them for the first time. Whats interesting, in analytical psychology proposed by Jung individuation means something different. He understands that as the lifelong process of furthering your awareness, f.e. integrating unconsciouss aspects into consciouss awareness. About the symbolic relationship you mention: thats actualy the fundamental problem of NPD, that the internal representations are disconnected from the real world.

Wanted to comment on this thought. Yea, I think people with NPD can end up consciously or unconsciously choosing others who value them for appearances, and what you can do for them. A repeat of what many people with NPD learn. 'I am valued for what I accomplish, for my independence, for what I do for others' Good to read that you are aware of that, and even though that awareness has now lead to a position of feeling lonely, I think it's wise to avoid getting into another round of friends/partners who will bleed you dry again.

Personally I dont self-loathe really. I might have negative perceptions of myself and sometimes rather bad ones, but I see them more like unemotional facts. The only place where I could find self loathing is if I regard my mind/body split. There I loathe (is that a verb) a lot of my physiological reality. I loathe migraines, I have some weird new asthma-like crap that is very distracting and annoying, vertigo and other possibly psychosomatic (?) things that I really hate. So in a way I could say I find this body really crappy and with that, if you would remove the split I would of course say that I find a big part of myself crappy. But it doesnt occur to me like that.

I've always felt insincere, uncommitted, and arbitrary when people asked what I believe in, so I make up whatever approximates something that I feel I should have. Maybe not that extreme all the time, but sometimes it feels that way. I moved to the city I live in now for no real reason. I started doing stand-up comedy with my friend but it feels empty and I don't know why I'm doing it.

I relate very well to the BPO. On a more practical, dsm oriented level, I feel, at least intuitively, that perhaps one of the biggest differentiators between a more narcissistic orientation and a borderline one is that narcissists reinvent themselves in that survival of the fittest way you and Kingpin describe. It sounds like it’s not necessarily painful or ego-dystonic for you, or is that an incorrect assumption? For me, it is quite painful. I don’t like and feel tired of acting. I most of all long to be comfortable and happy just being me and being accepted. I want to be perfect, but I think it’s mostly out of fear of what it means to not be perfect to my mind—rejection and exclusion. I feel I must be perfect to survive and be happy and loved. I do still have elements of grandiosity, but if I could feel safe and good about myself dropping the need to be perfect, I probably would. It still hurts badly on an egotistical level to think about not being universally admired or better than everyone.

Is he gay? by lechatnoir » Wed Oct 23, 2019 11:02 pm I'm confused and heartbroken. I've been in a rocky, on-off-on-off again relationship with a covert type, somatic Narcissist. I did not diagnose him on my own, he has several times over the years told me his issues and that he suspects he is, but refuses to get treatment for it. Sometimes he has periods of clarity where he doesn't seem disordered at all, but most of the time he slips into it along with all the typical somatic behaviors that come with it. I've been working on myself to erect boundaries and extract myself from the relationship and I'm in a much better position than I was before, but I still slip up and get involved with him again. The entire two years we've been \"together\" (I say that loosely because we could barely go 3 months without him vanishing without a trace, before resurfacing again several weeks later.) he would triangulate me with three specific women. I never met these women, nor did I know them, but he would give me context clues such as where they lived, what they did for a living, etc. Whenever he and I were on the \"outs\", he'd invariably let it be known to me that he was with one of these women. He is a businessman and splits his time pretty equally between 3 cities. Long story short, and unfortunately I can't give all the details here because they are too specific, but I accidentally found out, unexpectedly, that all 3 of these \"women\" he's been talking about are actually all the same person, and that person is a gay man. There is a plethora of information about this person available online. This person also lives in, works in, and regularly travels to the exact same cities that my ex-bf spends time in for work. In fact, they used to live less than a mile away from each other. All the details match, age, career(s) (he has more than one and they all match each of these mythical women he's told me about), living and working location, 100% the conclusion is that all these women he's told me about is actually just a gay male he's been seeing. Further, I've drawn the conclusion that their relationship pre-dates ours and that I'm likely the \"side\" person in the equation here, and this man is his primary relationship. Again, I can't go into the details without seriously risking their privacy but this nearly for certain is the case. I really don't know what to think. I'm in a state of shock. He has several gay male friends, one of his work partners is gay, he seems comfortable in his sexuality and being masculine or feminine, so I'm surprised he feels the pressure to be in the closet. I am so confused! I'm oscillating between sadness for him that he feels he has to hide this big secret, but I also wonder if this is just how pwNPD are, they don't care where supply comes from as long as it's supply? This ‘other wo-man’ is clearly good supply. Semi - famous, intellectual, beautiful, essentially a younger v 2.0 of himself. I'm not mad. I'm not going to call him out. I’m not going to confront. But I have no idea what to do or say or think now. I spent all night bawling, partly out of sadness, partially relieved for having an answer to this weirdness, finally, but now I feel numb and I need to talk to someone about this. If I stuff this inside of me and move on without discussing this with someone, I'm afraid I'm going to end up falling into a depression of this whole charade of a relationship that I stupidly hoped would still somehow work out in the end. I just need to get this out. I haven't said anything and won't. We're not on speaking terms as of yesterday, which is also when I found out.

First of all gay men dont date women, so theres some issue there you should resolve.

I'm a 24-year-old gay man in Australia. I have a younger boyfriend, it's not yet apparent to me if things will work out but so far it's going okay. I read a link someone posted about Inverted Narcissism and am surprised to find parts that strongly apply to me. Would I call myself an inverted narcissist? I don't think so... but maybe. I literally only discovered the term a day or so ago. Narcissism usually seems to come from our upbringing. I've looked back on my life, early developmental years, and found interesting circumstances and things that could have shaped my current personality. Childhood: It was lovely. Before I hit puberty life was lovely. Sometimes my parents confused me with their irregularities. In kindergarten I was nice to everyone and my classmates would ask me why I was so nice, why I'd lend things without expecting them back. And I just understood the Golden rule and that was that. I was rarely ever a brat. I did, however, have a weird masochistic compulsion that made itself apparent when I was as young as ten or eleven. I don't know what caused it. I tried to make myself the butt of jokes. I actively humiliated myself and made myself out to be an idiot as a ways of entertaining other people. I feel uncomfortable to admit that. I don't understand where the pathology came from. If you believe in past lives and spirituality, there could be something there. Anyway, what I did went beyond being a 'class clown', I was never one to misbehave. I encouraged people to mock and ridicule me, and I don't know why. I made myself out to be an idiot. As a teenager I had intense self-hate and depression for no reason I could understand. My family does have a history of mental illness on both sides. I continued to be a disgusting idiot, I think I degraded myself to please other people. How strange. I had a form of dysphoria about body hair and it made me disgusted by myself. Anyway I think that in my late teenage years after some changes (including shaving, which had never occurred to me at the time), my self-esteem slingshotted the other way into narcissism, in some regards. I do believe the inverted narcissist can alternate as the situation allows, but perhaps only in some ways and not completely. A truly fascinating condition now that I've read into it and its counterpart. I did and do often feel that I'm extremely beautiful, sometimes the most beautiful person I've ever seen. I became deeply religious at a young age and so altruism became further embedded in my psyche. I'm not religious anymore though still have spiritual beliefs. I am, even now, realising how much my personality is truly shaped by this disorder. I'm undiagnosed. I never believed I had a disorder, until this literal moment. I'm well-functioning. I do get obsessive and delusional. Wow... narcissism... inverted narcissism, a personality disorder. I was very lonely all my life and wanted nothing more than a boyfriend. I even self-harmed over it I was so depressed and despairing. It was all-pervasive, this need to have a relationship. The genetic disposition of my family, the intense depression and self-hating of my early teenage life, tendency to be stuck in mental loops and later despair over and need for dating is probably what shaped me to be this way. My first relationship lasted six months, he had anxiety that he takes medication for now. The relationship was one-sided and I was extremely attentive and doting, I believed that he needed the care because of his condition. I didn't love him and didn't care much when he broke up with me. I believe my current and former boyfriend also felt that I was in love with them just because of how I was, but the truth is I am simply very attentive and doting and enthralled by my partners. I crave someone to worship, someone who I can be their narcissistic supply. If I had to choose I'd rather date a codependent because I want stability in a relationship, certainly need it if I am to love at my strongest. I sometimes like to dominate, I certainly like to provide care, which is why I'd want a codependent. The idea of being with or worshipping a narcissist is still exciting for me to contemplate. I don't think I could give an inverted narcissist the bullying they may require. Anyway... input will be highly valued by me.

Lets start with this. I could have edited your post, but on second thought there is no need for you to read your post again, you spent enough time editing, so just a sample so I can get threw to you with what I mean: \"As a teenager I had intense self-hate and depression for no reason I could understand. I always hoped for the best, tried to apply the golden rule to everyone, care about everyone, even if I didnt care about myself, didnt think I could undo the damage done to me. I never liked myself the way I was, I often drifted off into fantasy where I was better, more witty, successfull and accepted for who I am. I actively humiliated myself and made myself out to be an idiot as a ways of entertaining other people. I thoughts its ok, I liked making others laugh, maybe most of all things. I was always the class clown. I missbehaved a lot, could never fit in to societie's rulestructure. Anyway I think that in my early twenties after some changes (moving out to student dorm, taking care of myself), my self-esteem slingshotted the other way into narcissism, in some regards. I became deeply atheistic at a young age and saw humanity as a kind of a \"spaceship earth\". Altruism became deeply embedded im my psyche, I thought I love all people, becouse of the destiny we share on this planet. This made me often taken advantage of. Im undiagnosed, but I always believed myself to be pahological. I shared this thought with my sister, who also held this belief. I was very lonely all my life, but didnt believe a girlfriend would help that. I could connect to some people in some regards, but never felt anyone truly understood me.\" My hope is to illustrate how much the disorder shapes your behavior. Now about your newly aquired self-awareness (\"I posses inverted-narcissist traits\"). You must understand that this awareness does not equal the awareness of ones actions, why one does the things he does. One of the characteristics of NPD is the lack of the capacity to self-reflect. This one makes sence. One couldnt be self-abusive if he understood, that he does it. You cannot know, or you might actualy stop. You say: \"Wow... narcissism... inverted narcissism, a personality disorder\" Yes, I faced disbelief like that, just like you did, when I first found out. Now you bring up a key difference. I had many short relationships, which all failed and I just didnt believe I should make someone unhappy, by being with a pathological person like me. I thought Ill just be alone, doing my things, learning about the world, an observer, living vicariously threw my intellectual and artistic pursuits. Your craving to be with someone has led you on the right path to answer the questions you've always had. NPD is to be primarily understood threw your relations to other people. You must be aware by now that you lack emotional empathy, the ability to empathise or emotional intelligence, and whole object relations,without which you cannot understand or meaningfully relate to other people. We can talk later in detail how this works, but for now be aware that the feelings you are having are not the same feelings other people have. You dont think of yourself as emotionally shallow do you? Did you think you were the most empathic, caring person as well? You say that you crave to be supply to someone, but that is a very recent realisation right? I did exactly that, it was stronger than me, but without realising it. Actively seeking the abuse. I am very ashamed of that. Id advise you to investigate codependancy further, you dont have the right idea yet. A codependant is primarily someone who stays in the relationship regardless of the abuse inflicted. They are deeply sacrificial and need the other persons validation. I have no doubt you could make a codependant happy, though, just by accepting her as she is. You could give another invert the bullying he requires under special circumstances, one author explains a method, you'd have to be in a life crisis following narcissistic injury, to shift your patterns while he restores your supply and hope. Dont be so sure about that anyway, I did find myself abusing inverts when I felt justified by their actions (stupidity, dishonesty). Not for my pleasure, becouse I believed I have to give them a lesson.", "hash": "ce117ff68ebbc0db44808d8d48fd150f36f298d3e6c33bb39e94eca64fdd1b5d"}

You could say I'm in denial, but due to my life evidence and experiences I just really doubt I'm consumed by any disorder. I think if anything, my personality may be atypical, but I have atypical interests. Thanks anyway.", "hash": "ff3593e2b9f3e96e22657b2c469096c8b781fe7bad7200dc83810f77789ffe3d"}

Your self esteem depends on external validation, aka narcissistic supply at the moment (Asuming your intuition is correct and you do see inverted traits in yourself, but best go to a specialist for a diagnosis) so any fix is nescesairly temporary. They wont be able to diagnose you with inverted narcissism becouse they dont believe that criterion exists. But being diagnosed with NPD, or even knowing you lack empathy or self reflection is a big step forward. Exactly the oposite, you need to trust yourself. Not your feelings, thats true, becouse you dont actualy have genuine feelings yet (not getting into the details). But you should trust analitical psychology, fathered by Karl Gustav Jung.

I'm also gay, almost 30 in the U.S. I almost always feel lonely. I crave and require admiration and attention—although you didn't mention much about this, which if you didn't need this as a narcissist would be very rare, almost excluding such a diagnosis. I also felt terrible about myself (and my body hair, for that matter!) in adolescence--and still do most of the time. I also felt ugly and slingshotted into the other extreme of often feeling amazing looking and beautiful when people stare at and admire me. Your belief about being the most beautiful in the world borders on, if not being, delusional, as literally NO ONE is the most beautiful in the world or the smarter. I say this as someone who's been called \"incredibly handsome,\" beautiful, etc. (Never gorgeous though, which is still upsetting.) So I'm not coming at it from someone who's not attractive and wouldn't get it. First, A) Beauty is subjective, and B) there is ALWAYS someone better looking. BTW, this is something I really cannot tolerate either as a narcissist. And I understand it intellectually but cannot emotionally accept it and when I'm confronted in the real world by a more attractive person, I typically freak out and find a way to boost my self-esteem. When I'm with a good looking friend and they get more attention, I get extremely jealous and angry. Your class-clown type behavior, your self-hatred, all these sound like low self-esteem with compensatory narcissism. Maybe vulnerable narcissism, as I think they're often related or even one in the same. The main questions are, do you have empathy? Do you have the real ability to self-reflect and introspect or do your internal mechanisms seem inaccessible? Do you apologize and feel guilt when you do something wrong, or is it purely shame-based or externalizing?", "hash": "426bcc3372fd651c52d88550d10d7d416a6bac13066180727d3a5f4cab6dbc23"}

Also if pwNPD could accept themselves for they truly are they wouldn’t have NPD to begin with. I read a story by Ellenor Greenburg who’s probably treated more cases of NPD than just about anyone. She gave an example of a classic NPD his first visit he pointed out his expensive shoes, his tailor made shirt, his accomplishments at work. This was a defensive mechanism to cope with the stress and anxiety of first visit. The same client in his 3rd visit was a shell of himself, in a deep depression because he waved to someone at work and they didn’t wave back so he felt snubbed.

You seem to care for your grandma. It's certainly good for her food and health, and good for her in general to have your regular presence.

Arriving at my grandmothers I ask her about it and she starts defending my mom, too, explaining that she \"just wanted to show me some pictures\" and that she \"had to go to town\" etc. Here is the question : do you think milk was really important for her? Or that she needed milk and would be happy to see you if you are around? Now this isnt the first time this happened, I guess in the past three years this must have happened like five times. It also happened with an aunt who was buying stuff from town for my grandma and then left and my grandmother called me shortly afterwards if I could come around to put the trashbins out. Back then I called my mom being rather irritated why I should walk there now for some ######6 trashbins while my aunt had just been there, and there, too, it was all excuses along the lines of \"your aunt has so much [problems / stuff to do] already\" etc. Same : is that so important to put trashbins out that day? Maybe she can close the plastic bag and wait for some days. Now aside from one more nail in the coffin of my family being a sack of $#%^, and to where all my possibly silently introjected ideas about being bad comes from, I was wondering... the normal response would be to apologize, wouldnt it. Let's project own history on yours. I come from family with narcissistic traits, specially on my mother's side. That means that people are enmeshed to each other and it's difficult to sort and preserve myself. What i do is - as much as possible - try to relate 1-1 and protect boundaries. So if i look at your story, here is what i see : You offer your time each week for your grandma. So she should think of asking you for milk and the trashbin out that day. If not, sorry, you don't have infinite time. Sorry grandma, i come on thursday. We'll do it that day. But you don't do that. You decide there is emergency and it should be done immediately. Then resent other family members I mean if I do something wrong, then I apologize for that and am not trying to find reasons why it's not an issue or why someone else is at fault. You mean she is at fault about you or about grandma? What i read makes me remember the plenty of tracks that i try to protect me of. Mother sees grandma? It's her problem. Maybe grandma didn't ask mother because she prefers to see you. We don't know. All people have different reasons. Now there is a practical problem. Grandma has lost autonomy and needs regular help. If for you it's heavy, a solution should be found to help her. Depending of the country and the context, there can be help provided. Maybe grandma or mother or some family members can pay some neighbour to help grandma regularly. Of course it's precious to have grandson helping, provided it's ok for him and it stays in certain limits. So - on-topically apologizing here for the extremely lengthy introduction to such a short question - anyone else has parents who are unable to realize they're wrong or saying sorry? In my experience, consistent sorry is very rare. Particularly coming from parents. My comments come from own history and difficulties. Of course i don't know your context. I just explained how i see things with own family", "hash": "23a495ea480bcec753fd63037edb569aad788418442eefe484273b82a86f2ee7"}

Or that she needed milk and would be happy to see you if you are around? Well another family member has told me two years ago that her dependence on groceries might also be an attempt to have someone around. In addition, looking into that direction the symbolic nature of milk doesnt elude me. But then I feel used. What connects to me being pissed about what my mom said about \"just doing it next week\", because it implies that its a natural thing to do that is just expected, while I am doing it exactly because apparently it's not natural apparently for the other family members, including grandchildren who actually have cars. It gets complicated additionally by the fact that I really dont like my grandma, or at least my conscious part doesnt. I mean she was originally my surrogate caregiver but really rarely wanted to play with me or anything as a kid; and from a more adult perspective she is a rather weak person who is very egocentric and doesnt admit to her faults. For example she is complaining about grandpa not being able to walk normally anymore, while it's her who canceled the therapy activating him, because it was \"too much\" for her. So now feeling expected to be there for her is quite a strain in terms of conflicting inner states. But you don't do that. You decide there is emergency and it should be done immediately. Then resent other family members Well in this specific case with the milk I was on my way anyways, because I wanted to take a walk and I was pissed primarily because I find it hard to grasp how my mom or aunt or whoever can't just ask if she needs something when you are ######6 around already. Its true though I dont like to put things off - but this might in the case of the trashbins have more to do with my ambivalences towards my grandmother, especially about where her old age (91) starts, and where her personality pathology ends. Hm I cant remember the word now. Theres this skill where you draw boundaries and kind of explain what your position is and how far you go. I still suck at that; but also at even knowing what I want heh. Now there is a practical problem. Grandma has lost autonomy and needs regular help. If for you it's heavy, a solution should be found to help her. Depending of the country and the context, there can be help provided. Maybe grandma or mother or some family members can pay some neighbour to help grandma regularly. Of course it's precious to have grandson helping, provided it's ok for him and it stays in certain limits. Well they are having services already because grandma is \"caring\" for her husband who has dementia.

Your grandmother is at an age when it's difficult to get around physically, so there is that to consider. The other part may be that asking for milk is her way of getting to see you on a semi-regular basis to get some attention. With a husband who has dementia, she could be climbing the walls for adult conversation, however brief, and relief from the \"sick room\" atmosphere that likely focuses a lot of attention on her husband in their home. Have you considered making your walk to Grandma's a routine thing, like every Thursday, for example, and asking Grandma if she needs anything? This way you commit to that one day of the week (your boundary), whether or not other family members have come to visit or help out (or not). You can also state what chores you can do or won't do for for her. If you don't want to take out the trashbins, then make that clear with your grandma, e.g. You have your limits, and caretakers should limit the demands, otherwise they get burnout. You can't change others' behavior, but you can put down some boundaries for yourself. From my experience of looking after elderly parents-in-law, it's no picnic. However, there does come a time when an elderly person can no longer drive or do some things for him/herself and needs family assistance with daily living. Some have partners who are no longer mentally capable of having a reasonable conversation with and that can get pretty lonely. Being in touch with family members probably makes your grandma's life a little more bearable.", "hash": "fc93a09ffb2f677fcde2826a9f6a74595a67e0b6e681696470bbb21dce5569d1"}

You may not get any answers there either. On that forum the questions often tend to turn toward 'why did you choose this person?' versus a focus on 'what is going on with them?'

Thank you I have not participated in this forum for some time though I still occasionally visit. I was once much more active under a different username. That being said ... Posts such as these now amuse me. You come here, to an NPD forum at that, and tell us how abusive your ex is/was. You then go to explain about how you want him away from you and your child. Yet as he is writing you 'horrible' messages you just had to reply one more time. In that one reply back to him you made sure to tell him that he was unlovable. You did this even in knowing he always felt neglected and abandoned. Get the f@ck off here. People such as yourself want to make themselves out to be the victim as they INTENTIONALLY inflict pain upon another. Are you really incapable of seeing that your behavior is just as much abusive as his? You feel scared for you and your child? Yet instead of just leaving and blocking him you felt the need to provoke him. You are playing a game. You WANT him to contact you. You want his attention. You wanted to have the last word/power/control that is why you sent the message you did and then blocked him. Feel better now?

He absolutely hates his dad, I think the reason why he has npd is because of his dad, horrible things happened during his childhood and now he is trying to be like his dad and doing what his dad did. Anyway I sent him a message saying that he was just a lost little boy, his dad never loved him and that no one can blame him as anyone would have left him (his dad left him when he was younger and even though they kept in touch he always felt neglected and abandoned as his dad was more interested in women), I also told him no one loves him. I then blocked him, just as he was writing another message. So, I guess my question is, will he finally leave me and our child (who he never cared about and when he does it's to show off to other people) alone? Or will he try to contact me? Get revenge? How do you think the narcissist felt when I told him what I did? I feel scared and fear that something will happen to me, my child or a member of my family, so I need to prepare myself. Thank you I have not participated in this forum for some time though I still occasionally visit. I was once much more active under a different username. That being said ... Posts such as these now amuse me. You come here, to an NPD forum at that, and tell us how abusive your ex is/was. You then go to explain about how you want him away from you and your child. Yet as he is writing you 'horrible' messages you just had to reply one more time. In that one reply back to him you made sure to tell him that he was unlovable. You did this even in knowing he always felt neglected and abandoned. Get the f@ck off here. People such as yourself want to make themselves out to be the victim as they INTENTIONALLY inflict pain upon another. Are you really incapable of seeing that your behavior is just as much abusive as his? You feel scared for you and your child? Yet instead of just leaving and blocking him you felt the need to provoke him. You are playing a game. You WANT him to contact you. You want his attention. You wanted to have the last word/power/control that is why you sent the message you did and then blocked him. Feel better now? You're welcome. ###$. You. She has feelings and had to find release. If she was treated unfairly, putting up with the abuse and keeping it all inside becouse of her child, I can understand where she is coming from getting back at him. And you cant, so your response is not only insensitive but also irrelevant.", "hash": "3d6e7dc167b7f5de80ffa2623badabf2544683a92b7d1b9256a150a5b3726480"}

It is when you realize that the reflection back is false. It is significant damage to the \"false self\" that we have had so long. It usually comes with age or some significant event where you suffer from severe injury/rejection. Just realize that you are not alone.

Basically it is torture. Especially when I'm confronted in the real world, on the street, with not being constantly ogled and gawked at.

OCD seems to be seen as something very unproblematic, when you people always use the word \"just\" hehe. OCD can completely destroy ones life, creates intrusive thoughts, internal endless-loops, basically make you withdraw into your own world, where you are mostly thinking about your topic of obsession. I've just yesterday watched this 4-part series about Bedlam , which followed a few peopel with extreme OCD - especially that woman who was always afraid she had unkonowingly put strangers into recycling bins was interesting. I mean as I've already said to heracles it's of questionable worth of course diagnosing, but I dont think you are NPD, because you are primarily obsessing and obsessing is simply not an aspect of NPD. Secondly you would have to be grandiose and you would have to either expect people to mirror that or devalue them, which you arent doing; if I read you correctly you have a conviction thta you need to look a certain way, not that you do look a certain way and youw ant people to share that conviction, which also means you invest a big deal of energy into what others think of you, or at least if others share your idea of hwo you should be, again in an obsessive way. Then, in CNPD, you would need to idealize other people, not your self, which I dont see here. And lastly, most importantly, you seem to display a pretty sharp cut between yourself and others, I'm not sure if I read this correctly. In NPD such a cut doesnt exist, others especially when part of your grandiose-self are [albeit mostly unconsciously] part of yourself.

My looks obsession has just been a flaw, a weakness, I know I have to transcend.

I don't have any answers, just some related thoughts - I think unfortunately what most people with cluster B disorders lack (sans Psychopathy, which is different), is implicit self-esteem.

I don't know how to fix a lack of implicit self-esteem, but it might be worth it to you to peer into the looking glass. You may find no answers either, but I guess the one benefit is I'm somewhat less hard on myself now. I know what is broken, not how to fix it, but that I should stop beating myself up over it. I am more aware of how shame, guilt, and remorse that I didn't deserve have affected me. The only warning is it's a tough thing to look at, you may need some support while doing so, and you might end up feeling worse off for it.

If I wind myself up and go around without being grounded (majority of the time), it´s like my mind gets ahead of my body, am not really well situated in it. My dad (cNPD, just to reiterate) held off on physical contact throughout my childhood and the majority of memories I have of him doing it were always in somewhat of a ´scientific´ manner, if you will. As he has always been a fitness freak (a liftime jogger of a religious nature, to the point where he got irritated if he hadn´t for a reason or another done it and lashed out on us), one of the things he would do when my sister and I were little was take us to cross-country skiing trips and I always had this sens that he expected us to get into jogging like he has done or smth of the like as well. His touches wer always in very rational, i.e. noting to us which muscles had seen the most use during the excercising and so on. Tbh, throughout my life his presence always felt distant like it was too well-considered and came from a rational place, without warmth. There was the odd acknowledging (but very selective) pat here and there and he had the habit of giving (again, awkward) high fives when he dropped me off for a longer time period. The single hug I ever remember him giving us was when he announced to us that our mother was very sick (late stage cancer) and he gathered us around and told this to us in a solemn way. Other than that, it´s just been emotional neglect from his part because he simply lacked the capacity. As a teenager I was quite isolated and a loner so I didn´t really partake in anything I deemed ´rowdy´ with others. I had only few fights in school but they were just that, fights - they got started quick and intense and subsided as fast. Well, anyhow fast forward to 27yo me who has done little to no contact sports (always felt team sports were too cookie-cutter) but with action sports. The only boundaries to be found out are the truly physical ones like when your skin or worse bones break and it has nothing to do with other people and sensing their boundaries. I have a friend who is quite well socialized but suspect had a somewhat narcissistic father (he´s told me as much and has some codependent traits) who oftentimes tries to mess around and wrestle with me, which leaves me dumbfounded because it´s quite difficult for me to gauge how I should respond. Am somewhat of a strong believer that people with empathy intuitively know. This is something that I´ve not and there´s a part of me that thinks maybe this could be something missing in my life that when improved, could carry further benefits to other areas of life as well? So the takeaway from this to me is - lack of contact=lack of socialization.

I really do appreciate it. That bold part made me laugh out lout. In my mind it´s quite typical of you to write something like that and I´ve been realizing this more and more. Yeah, that ´summary´ wasn´t exactly anything earth-shattering. Figured that people would probably not give the YT link an actual watch-through. Briefly put, Peterson talks about the importance of rough and tumble play in there and the effect it has on the child´s psyche. I guess my childhood was not absolutely deficient in play as such though but there certainly was no real physicality between us, as if he was always afraid of it. Now I know for sure that actually was the case. Weak father figures make for weak agency and meaningless drifting as is also well known. As for with other boys, I was always quite a sheltered child in that respect also, maybe overly sensitive from the start. Then later on the rowdyiness of a group of guys always felt weird to me somehow, reckon it has to do with lack of certainty in myself and seeing others as bold and sure of themselves, whereas I always had a weak sense of self. I opted out of it completely, thinking I was the sensitive, creative type whereas internally it was actually kind of a \"I´m better than that\". It was probably just that I felt I didn´t belong and it became a strong layer of defence (\"I don´t need to do that guys stuff, that´s dumb\") As for not giving my dad grief, my whole life I´ve spent hung up on what I feel I was cheated out of in childhood, which is the love of my mother. After she passed, my grandmother blamed my father (and it was reiterated by her that my father´s father had done so also) and it painted a picture in my mind of how things had been between them pretty quick. Nowadays, what there is to learn about trauma, bonding and constantly being anxious about someone, makes it all very likely that they were both right. He was never violent with her but I know for a fact he didn´t love her as he simply wasn´t capable of it and always left her guessing. What I learned about my father as a child were large part of the reason why I tried to make decisions so as to not end up like him. Nonetheless I dug myself into the hole that I am currently in by trying to evade that destiny. My whole state of mind became absolutely twisted after realizing that all I hated about him, I have embodied. The self-hate was augmented even more-so because I understood that even though I had tried my hardest not to end up like him, in a cosmically ironic fashion, I have become that and even worse. Anyhow, the physicality of a mother with their children is obv a lot different than between a father and child, as it carries a totally different aim. Assuming it was one of the few times in your life when you actually felt cared for, does it carry a deep significance do you? At least that´s how it is for me, as I remember vividly a very pecific moment which also could have been somewhere around age 6-7. “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?” Camus", "hash": "db859443a57a5e9c8c90b52a33b74082db190d252632fbd5922d4f5e52ef7c41"}

I just saw the video and its the same as all the others. The conclusions he draws, and he no doubt thinks those are very significant, are not actualy very significant at all and in fact trivial. You should try someone who is a buddha, like me. Like buddhism, means 'awakened one'. Emerald https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvW2U2 ... BzUYOw0DwA or Teal Swan https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSpiritualCatalyst for example. Its excellent that you drew the conclusion that you are like your dad, someone you detested. That was my first step to self-realization too. That how I treated Bony was a mirror of how my mom treated me. Yes I was cared for, by many people, my dad too, although he was distant but he was an ok person and being manipulated by my mom constantly, all the girls that fell in love with me and even the mom of the first girl that fell in love with me, when I was 13. She fell in love and my mom and sister was present and her mom, right there, it was a on a winter camp in Zakopane, carpathian mountains. Her mom said she fell in love and what I should do (reciprocate). I said I wont reciprocate and I remember her hurt and my mom so pround of me. That Im hurting this girl right in front of her. I learned more from her mom in that moment, that from my own mom EVER. Althought I wasnt able to understand the significance yet. A friend in the warehouse that saw me fall in love with Bony, knew we were both in love with eachother, he wanted to tell me just becouse I knew english and made jokes to him, If I just admitted to him that Im in love, thought he will be telling me something that is obvious anyway. Not to the narcissists. Instead he got to see all the insanity firsthand. Becouse he didnt have thoughts yet, I was mentally ill. Only the narcissists has thoughts. Another friend in college in the student dorm when I was breaking the heart of another girl by being insane, wanted to tell me too, nagged me to admit to my mistake of getting naked and getting in another girls bed, as a joke (the two girls were friends). So I had poeople care but I couldnt understand it and hated them and only just understood that recently, and its still very traumatic. Id rather not have known. Many people that wanted to spend time together and not abuse me, becouse I secretly craved to be treated narcissisticaly by a narcissist aparently. So things like that, when other people had your best interest in mind, had plenty and it still wasnt enough when your self abusive. The example of my mom sleeping with me when I was 7 was actualy and example of abuse and not respecting my boundaries, not of being cared for. She did other things like asking me to touch her tits if front of my dad. Or demeaning me in front of the family, laughing at me, telling me Im the bad one and I need to be fixed, thats what realy damages a child. Or when a guy puched me in front of my house, my mom saw it and screamed \"good, punch him again\" and calling me by my nickname. Even the guy who punched me was kind of terrified at the pathology.

I had read some past posts on cNPD, and also some posts from partners of people with cNPD on another forum, and it seems like this is a common thing with people with cNPD. They say they can go through \"phases\" of spending ages at home without any real social interaction, or their partner will go \"weeks without leaving his apartment\" (which is probably another reason why I have a hard time staying interested in someone). I used to chalk this up to introversion, but if you define introversion it doesn't make full-sense in my case as I'm slightly ambiverted (although I do have problems switching from being home a lot, to going out again)... it's actually probably due to self-absorption. Like, someone with this is so involved with their own interests, and also might have a bit of social anxiety, internet addiction etc. that become completely absorbed in what they are doing whilst also neglecting the lives of the people around them, as if it would be to much effort to bother with that so they just remain locked in what they want to do. If anyone here with this relates, either with yourself or someone you know/have known I would be interested in hearing it. Another thing, what do you with cNPD do for work? Is it something that's self-focused so you don't have to deal with the public, and do you feel that the absorption thing makes it more difficult to get there everyday, and do you have that \"shallow vocational commitment\" (you don't really try very hard) when your there?

I used to go to therapy and my therapist told me I was a narcissist. It was a couple of years ago and I never got to ask more about what he meant because I abandoned therapy sessions. I do think I have narcissistic traits though, especially of the VULNERABLE/COVERT kind. My main problem is my looks. I am not an attractive guy, quite the opposite actually. I have a few scars due to acne on the left side of my face, a slight lateral deviation of the jaw and assymetry in the jaw (I mean besides the lateral deviation, it's like my chin is not really symmetric). I also have a bad posture. But really my ears are the problem (\"cup\" or \"lop\" ears). When I was younger I wasn't too concerned about my looks, or maybe I was but I managed not to dwell on the matter that much. But as I grew up, all my friends started dating and guess who didn't. At some point in my life I started doubting whether any girl could possibly be attracted to me. I also tend to feel inadequate and stupid, although I always got good grades in high school and at university. When I'm with friends I always feel like they're putting up with me and wish I wasn't there. I'm convinced there's a couple of \"friends\" that just don't like me, but the more I think about it the less able I am to tell objectively if that's the case (because it may just be my imagination or self-loathing). I think I could deal with all this, but what really bothers me is that whenever I go out, I look at every man in the street with envy. I envy their good looks, but above all their \"being normal\". It's like they have it easy--- they will get the girl, have a family and be happy. I don't have the guts to talk to a girl for fear of rejection. But it's more than that. I feel like if I ever invite a girl on a date she will politely say no but also she will be surprised at me asking her out. It would be like a man with no legs that wants to run a marathon not knowing that he's disabled and can't do it. (\"Boy! You'd think he knew he has no legs by now!\") I look myself at the mirror and can't really tell whether someone could possibly find me attractive or not. And I know looks aren't everything, but the uncertainty is killing me.

Hey none of us likes rejection and again I am nothing to look at it, but he is/was right, if you try and say 'hi', you may be surprised at what happens. Women are also motivated by looks, but it's not the only factor. If you need a degree of NPD to get you through it, then so be it. Say 'hi' to the next woman you pass. In a way it's that simple.

I've been going to therapy for 4 months. No, I have not taken any psychology classes... I think I may be a codependent and have narcissistic personality disorder. My therapist once described me as having self doubt. I believe that narcissists have a difficult time making decisions. I'm dishonest frequently. I sometimes lie to my friends and parents, but usually to reassure that I'm doing okay with my life, while I really feel so ###$ up inside. Despite feeling \"bad\" talking here about hurting my parents almost every single day, I never really regret having hurt them. My mom makes me feel bad and I tend to blame her for my issues, never helping her, saying terribly demeaning things about my dad in order for her to get on my side (it seldom works that way, but I try to make it so). My parents do enough for me, superficially, I've been through two years of college thanks to their help. Though I hold them accountable for a lot of my problems, which are usually things I never share, and keep secrets, even to my therapist. I know there is really something wrong with me, but I'm unable to confront myself about it because guilt it unessential to my ego. I've been to church recently, I have tried praying and doing other routines to keep my mind \"positive\", but I don't consider myself religious. My mom knows I'm not, and that I don't believe in anything. Still, I went to church a few times thinking I could play her into thinking I was going to church for spiritual development. I felt this might be putting her at ease, so she wouldn't worry about my anger issues, but it didn't. My game was figured out quickly. Despite spiritually abusing her in that way, I didn't feel guilty, just disappointed that I wasn't able to continue playing my game with her. I'm confused at this point, and wondering if I'm just a sick person, or maybe I have Covert narcissism? diagnoses: major depressive disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder", "hash": "9646201c1cb04171b40de67d32a805508f4f18c58dea41d72882db960de48171"}

To diagnose narcissistic personality disorder, the following criteria must be met: A. Significant impairments in personality functioning manifest by: 1. Impairments in self functioning (a or b): a. Identity: Excessive reference to others for self-definition and self-esteem regulation; exaggerated self-appraisal may be inflated or deflated, or vacillate between extremes; emotional regulation mirrors fluctuations in self-esteem. b. Self-direction: Goal-setting is based on gaining approval from others; personal standards are unreasonably high in order to see oneself as exceptional, or too low based on a sense of entitlement; often unaware of own motivations. AND 2. Impairments in interpersonal functioning (a or b): a. Empathy: Impaired ability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others; excessively attuned to reactions of others, but only if perceived as relevant to self; over- or underestimate of own effect on others. b. Intimacy: Relationships largely superficial and exist to serve self-esteem regulation; mutuality constrained by little genuine interest in others? experiences and predominance of a need for personal gain B. Pathological personality traits in the following domain: 1. Antagonism, characterized by: a. Grandiosity: Feelings of entitlement, either overt or covert; self-centeredness; firmly holding to the belief that one is better than others; condescending toward others. b. Attention seeking: Excessive attempts to attract and be the focus of the attention of others; admiration seeking. C. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's personality trait expression are relatively stable across time and consistent across situations. D. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's personality trait expression are not better understood as normative for the individual's developmental stage or socio-cultural environment. E. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's personality trait expression are not solely due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., severe head trauma).

I am codependent too, and I am 34. At 22, I acted, felt, and thought a lot like you. I was enmeshed in my parents' lives in an unhealthy way, felt like I needed to please them to get financial help, would always hand over the remote compulsively then resent it, and even went to church with my dad because, well, consciously, I needed his help with money. But underneath this, I wanted him to approve of me. If you are indeed codependent, you likely have a lot of unresolved trauma from childhood and early adulthood. Trauma doesn't have to be rape or violence. We do not become desensitized to pain over time; we actually become more sensitive. The same repetitive pain can eventually bore into us and create trauma--a damaged area that doesn't heal with time, and causes reverberations of anxiety, low self-worth, numbness, sadness, anger, and so on. If you were traumatized in your childhood home--if you are still being traumatized, as smaller slights hurt more over time--you will have a toxic environment with your parents where you are basically living, eating, and sleeping in your trauma site. A man tried to rape me once when I was 26 outside a campus apartment and every time I passed that area, I got scared and anxious. So I stopped taking that route. I didn't realize until later that this same fear and anxiety was occurring in my home because of unresolved trauma there. It is not healthy to live where you were hurt (or are being hurt), and that doesn't mean you don't love your parents. In my 20s, my codependence looked a lot like covert narcissism. I was numb. There were a lot of people in my life, but they were shadows more than anything. I pretended a lot. I was not able to forge genuine connection, and so I settled for second best--trying to perform well enough to be approved of, fit in, enjoy attention, and push loneliness away. Two disorders can look the same, but they are not born out of the same motivations, and their internal structures will be different once you start to deconstruct them. Connection is about sending something of yourself out into the world (or to God) and having an Other (a sentient \"object\") respond to you with their own something that they have sent to you. The two currents meet and connection is forged. In both codependents and covert narcissists, this connection is broken. Narcissists have fortified the wall separating self and other, a wall that is supposed to be semi-permeable, and thus their signals just get bounced back to them. They are locked in a frozen lake looking out at the people on top. Saying stay here, look at me, see how many flips I can do, I'm beautiful right? Going a little crazy by myself down here but the good news is that I'm so frozen, I stopped feeling most unpleasant things a long time ago. Been spending a lot of time with myself, and now I'm pretty into that self, who is my friend, because if he wasn't there I would basically die from the isolation. And you can see how envy, rage, coldness, the false self, and so on would come into play. Their signals coming back to them, they think are coming from the people on top of the frozen water, and that is projection. Codependence is different; the barrier that is supposed to be semi-permiable has become perforated, and too many foreign agents infiltrate the self. We don't know where we end and other people begin. We think their problems are our problems. The narcissist says, you owe me something! The codependent says, you say it is true, and so it must be. The narcissist says, you will help me believe that my false self is a real, special, beautiful person so that I can keep believing I'm ok and not down here by myself. The codependent says, well I can't just leave you alone down there can I? Never mind that we never actually touch and I am so, so lonely here with you. o;p[]\\. And because we aren't sure of ourselves, don't trust our volatile emotions (is this real or is this traumatic injury), we want other people to tell us how we are supposed to feel and act. I know these are hopelessly garbled metaphors. Maybe they can help though. The narcissist is frozen. The codependent is injured. Both can help the other feel special to compensate for low self-worth. You mentioned going to church and whether you believe in God or not, there is something transformative about putting our trust in an eternal, benevolent fortress of protection. There are resources outside of yourself and this world that can heal your pain. You don't have to feel like this forever. Carl Jung was not a religious man but he was amazed that the seemingly incurable disease of alcoholism could be cured with the spiritual-based 12 Step program. You could always go Christian Lite with the self-helping and addictively enjoyable messages by Andy Stanley, just google Andy Stanley and Your Move. He talks to nonbelievers about how Christian ideas can be applied in a way that is relevant and immediately effective. (My sociopath/narcissist brother goes to his church!)

As to trauma therapy, I'm not sure what that is I'm not sure what it's called but I guess what I mean is a form of psychoanalysis focused on childhood trauma... As to what I am looking for, it's mainly to improve my connection with people in this world. I have contacts but I have always struggled to make meaningful and long-lasting connections with people. My lack of empathy, arrogance and general asshole like behaviour/attitude does not promote me feeling connected to people. A while back I became so isolated I developed psychosis. To defeat what I considered a weakness (ie: needing people) I killed a part of myself off which triggered the psychosis. I felt that now I can be self sufficient on my own and not needy of others. To be honest this has worked in some ways. I am still isolated but I don't struggle with feeling soy sadness or depression associated with it. The problem is that now I make \"zero\" effort to connect with people, even on a superficial level it has died down to almost nothing. I do keep in touch with some people by phone but they are so far away that there is no inclusion into their lives. The issue with all this o course is that I have no meaning in my life. I am not depressed as far as I am aware (I work, hit the gym, eat healthy, seek women out...etc). But my life feels good and meaningless. I have plans but they feel like nagging in the wind and I believe the issue is a disconnection from people and the affairs of society. This is the main thing I want to work on but I also suspect I need to process my childhood trauma (mother attempted infanticide, assaulted strangers in front of me, sexual acts in front of me, trying to burn grandmothers house in front of me, emotional abuse). I believe the trauma is at the heart of my narcissistic defender and why I can't connect with others.", "hash": "6290946cbc133ce058a75da32cce4f99fd0e905406670829b4f861163bd4760d"}

Also psychoanalysis I think is suited pretty well, but the speed of it will probably be slow. I dunno if youre aware of this, so its probably good to say this up front, thats a thing of many years. It depends a lot on your psychological setup and the therapist himself. My therapist is very \"respectful\" as he always says of my kinds of defense and what is defending against so even while I'm irritated sometimes that its so slow, its less dangerous - both in terms of you leaving therapy abruptly, or becoming more ill. Also - but that also will be talked about with your therapist after a while I assume - it might be necessary or a good addition to get into a rehab center or psych-clinic for a while while in treatment for specific stuff - some stuff can be resolved more quickly in that way, or so I hear. Finally as to childhood trauma, I dont think theres a therapy form that \"focuses\" on this per se, if its psychoanalytic, because the focus is on whats on your mind currently.

It sounds like you are very cut off from your emotions--dissociated from them--which is very common in traumatized people. Someone who is an expert at treating complex PTSD and dissociative disorders would probably be the most helpful. You can find a list at ISST-D.org (International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation). Most people don't realize that prolonged abuse in childhood causes complex PTSD and dissociation and that this accounts for many of the symptoms that we have as adults. One can't really put one's bad childhood behind (as I used to think you could) and just go on from there. It comes with you in all sorts of ways, and most of them are hidden from awareness. It affects basic things like relationships, trust, self-image, etc, and people often think that's just how they are when it really has a lot to do with how they were treated as a child.

I'm surprised you ask me o_O. I think the question contacts a lot of layers. On the very basis I would say affect tolerance is the essence of all psychotherapy, learning to tolerate what you cant tolerate and understand the reasons and connections. But I think its also very naive to think that one would be able to just \"get in touch\" with stuff one can't get in touch with. Since we have lots of ways to forget what we dont want to remember and to not see what we want to see, it seems obvious that what you can get in touch with is mostly stuff that is not hidden and therefore also not a deep, causative problem - or that might be even mistaken for something it is not, because one gets blinded by some things [apparent] intensity. My therapist has tried out a lot of methods and been in a lot of workshops and he for exampel is very opposed to therapies that purely promote \"letting out\", like primal therapy and the like - he says he has seen people being \"mentally destroyed\" by it, and I think it makes sense, because it can promote disintegration, false ideas, and paradoxically moving away from central issues and oneself, too. On the other hand side the pure contacting of emotions itself is narcissistic of course. If you keep on staring at yourself, at your thoughts, or at your feelings, that can be a form of narcissistic withdrawal or obsession and since you are using only the visible to look at the visible, while having no means [and no motivation] to look at the invisible, in the best case it wont change anything, in the worst case its going to give you a lot of false impressions and make you worse than before - or in a different way. So no, while experiencing unpleasant mental states is of course an aspect of therapy, pathological narcissism can't be battled by withdrawing into your chambers somehow and meditating, or taking drugs and hallucinating, or whatever. The narcissistic idea stream can only break itself in the prism of another person - the identification with the idealized imagos or the withdrawal into the schizoid shell only be solved in the interpersonal field.

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/narcissistic-personality/topic64338.html", "text": "Thoughts on *The Wizard of Oz and Other Narcissists* by okerry » Sat May 14, 2011 6:31 pm I do know that there is a book called *The Wizard of Oz and Other Narcissists*, but IMHO the author really missed the mark on identifying the NPD in that particular story. The following is just something I thought of while watching *The Wizard of Oz* yet again, while struggling to understand what on earth happened to my NPD ex-husband who had once been such a good man and loving father. As most people know, the condition of narcissism is named for a character in a Greek myth, Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflected image in a pool and pined away for it until he died. This has led to the idea that narcissists love only themselves, but that’s not exactly what the story means. Because he was so empty on the inside, Narcissus only existed when he saw himself reflected somewhere else. And that’s how someone with the condition called “narcissism” goes through life: An empty hole on the inside, with no sense of self-worth or self-validation to make them feel whole and human and good. At some point, possibly in response to some loss or trauma or pain, they stopped looking inward to create those things (that takes work) and indeed cut that off completely so that 100% of their validation comes from the outside - from other people (because that seems so much easier and so much more rewarding, the way it's always easier to use a drug to get a quick fix of whatever you're looking for.) But of course no other person can give them what every human really needs - which is self -worth and self -validation and self -respect - and so narcissists spend their lives as bottomless pits for attention, admiration and validation. And they only end up more and more and more empty, because that sort of pit cannot be filled from the outside. It can only be filled from within. In *The Wizard of Oz*, our famous four characters search for the things which every human needs: A brain, a heart, courage, and a home. But just like the narcissist, they make the mistake of searching for others who will supply those things instead of looking within themselves and finding what they need on the inside. The Munchkins represent well-meaning friends who actually encourage the narcissist to search outwardly instead of inwardly. “Follow the yellow brick road!” they say, because the yellow brick road leads you to the someone who, the Munchkins believe, can give you what you seek – namely, it leads to the Wizard. Glinda the Good represents a true friend who wants to help but knows she cannot, because she understands that she cannot give the characters what they seek and no one else can, either. The Wicked Witch represents full-blown narcissism run rampant. She is surrounded by evil, misshapen characters like the Flying Monkeys who try to bring her what she wants – namely, attention and admiration that she has not earned – and by thralls, the Winkie Guards, who are enslaved by her cruelty but don’t know how to break free of her. In the end, the Wicked Witch is vanquished by simply washing her away with honesty and courage. And then the Flying Monkeys are gone and we see that the Guards were not really loyal to her at all. The Wizard is a fraud, of course, because no one can give you what you must create and nurture from the inside – courage, wisdom and love. Glinda finally tells Dorothy that she had the power to go home all the time. “Why didn’t you tell me?” Dorothy cries, and Glinda says, “Because you would not have believed me. You had to learn it for yourself.” And so they did. As we all do. NPDs spend their lives looking for love and validation from Flying Monkeys and enslaved thralls - who have the power to destroy you and will not care if they do - instead of the NPDs using their own power to simply go home. In this story, \"home\" is the place *within yourself* where you will have all the intelligence, love and courage you ever wanted or needed - including people who will love you simply for yourself, as Auntie Em and Uncle Henry and all the other \"real\" characters loved Dorothy. That's why there's no place like home. The Witch wanted the Ruby Slippers, but they were unobtainable for her. That's because the Ruby Slippers represent Home and you must make your own Home - you cannot just take someone else's and expect their home to be yours. And of course the Flying Monkeys represent the enablers, sycophants, lackeys, toadys, groupies and hangers-on that powerful narcissists and other addicts virtually always attract. The Monkeys are pathetic, unnatural creatures who exist on the crumbs and leftovers of the narcissist but really care nothing for him, because if he's gone they'll just attach themselves to someone else. Remember the \"Memphis Mafia\"? They were Elvis's Flying Monkeys, enablers who lived at his feet and would bring him whatever they thought he wanted - even if it was really very harmful and would ultimately kill him, which it did. Michael Jackson had Flying Monkeys, too. One of them was right there with him when he died. (I don’t know that Michael Jackson and Elvis were NPD, but both were certainly addicts for prescription drugs and, like every addict, both of them cut off their family and all non-enablers in favor of Flying Monkeys. Every addict of every kind has Flying Monkeys.) Elvis and Jacko are just two examples of people who chose - yes, chose - Flying Monkeys instead of the genuine love and respect they could have had from real family and real friends. There are many more, both famous and not. I looked at some excerpts from *The Wizard of Oz and Other Narcissists.* The author seems to feel that the Wizard himself represents an NPD. But the story didn't strike me that way at all. As I mentioned above, it's our four main characters who represent the NPDs because they're the ones looking for others to supply them with what they need instead of looking inward to find it. And the Wicked Witch represents NPD run rampant at its most destructive. But the Wizard - now, think about it: The Wizard is first shown as nothing but an ugly and very angry face, shouting and growling and erupting in fire and fury, living as a recluse and trying to get rid of all these NPDs who keep trying to Get Things From Him. He's not trying to get anything from anybody. He hides from everyone and tries to get them to leave him alone. He clearly looks to be angry, lonely and suffering. \"GO AWAY!\" \"I was hoping the Wicked Witch would kill you and I would never see you again.\" \"PAY NO ATTENTION to the man behind the curtain!\" No NPD would EVER say such things. They live for constant attention and emotional feeding from others. They are the polar opposite of the Wizard. To me, the Wizard represents the spouses and adult children of all the charming, sweet-talking, innocent-looking NPDs who have been tormenting them to death for years. There is a lot of talk about “narcissistic rage” from the NPD, but I can tell you that the NPD’s victims often find themselves literally raging and screaming from the extreme frustration and agony of being used as a drug instead of treated like a real human being. Finally, when the Wizard's true form is revealed as a gentle and quite ordinary man - who is a fraud only in the sense that he cannot give the NPDs what they want any more than anyone else can - he is able to get the NPDs to look inside for what they want, and then he is able to get free of them and go home himself. It's left to Glinda to help Dorothy with the biggest hurdle of all - understanding where Home really is. I don't think the Wizard represents a full-blown Narcissist at all. That's The Wicked Witch. The angry, hideous, reclusive and lonely Wizard represents the NPD's tormented and isolated victims. I was thinking about where Toto figures in the story. I think that because Toto is an animal - a normal, natural animal, not a fantasy creature like the Lion - he therefore represents the kind of innocence and purity of spirit that can never be contaminated by narcissism. He can neither be one nor respond to one. It is in protecting Toto that Dorothy finds the courage to destroy the Wicked Witch, and it is Toto who reveals that the angry, blustering, supernatural-looking wizard is also a \"real\" creature who should be treated as such - not merely used as a source of supply for NPDs, which is what left him raging, suffering and reclusive. When the innocent Toto pulls back the curtain, the Wizard can finally respond to the NPDs as his real self and *then* he is able to get free of them - presumably to go back to a normal, natural world. The only place where the metaphor doesn't quite hold, IMHO, is that the Wizard actually *is* able to turn around the behaviour of the NPDs simply by pointing out their own positive traits to them and showing them that they didn’t have to go looking for what they needed from someone else – that they would find they had brains, love and courage all along if they would only look within instead of demanding these things from others. We know that such a change happens only rarely, if ever, in the real world – maybe because NPD is never treated as the addiction it really is. Maybe we should all insist that an NPD start looking within to find positive traits and a loving Home - and maybe they would. Surely that is a better life than being like the Wicked Witch, who was indeed powerful and the focus of attention but was also despised and feared and alone with only thralls and Flying Monkeys for company - and they cared nothing for her in the end. Surely we wish better for the people we love, whether they are NPDs or not. Perhaps especially if they are NPDs.", "hash": "3cf9703402a72ae684fc72bf2cbf4d92c0d18ff39f33cbf6a07c0d90aa456cc8"}

Because he was so empty on the inside, Narcissus only existed when he saw himself reflected somewhere else. And that’s how someone with the condition called “narcissism” goes through life: An empty hole on the inside, with no sense of self-worth or self-validation to make them feel whole and human and good. This is an excellent description. The jealousy we feel towards others is invariably because be don't understand how they can be happy without outside validation. I struggle with the concept that a person can self-validate. It's not even just that I don't know how, but that I can't even grasp that it exists. This was a great cerebral piece. Thank you. The Wizard himself seems more BPD to me. Surely we wish better for the people we love, whether they are NPDs or not. Perhaps especially if they are NPDs. Thank you for that - very counter the general attitude. Just because I'm crazy doesn't mean I'm wrong. Please feel free to request citations/sources. Here's my Dx . I really like making lists.", "hash": "d2fe86e8e0aa5575e869dc70d5ef63e7a1f7beee4ed8d9d49b6053577c60eaaa"}

I haven't seen the Wizard of Oz for years, think I'll watch it again. Only one thing I disagree with, you say; Elvis and Jacko are just two examples of people who chose - yes, chose - Flying Monkeys instead of the genuine love and respect they could have had from real family and real friends. There are many more, both famous and not. Could Jacko have had genuine love from his real family? Surely that was his big problem his family was so dysfunctional. His violent bullying father put him on stage whilst he was very young and beat him if he didn't get it right. He never learnt to play and socialize with other kids, it was just work, work, work. He was not close to his siblings, when his career took off big time they got left behind maybe causing resentment creating more rifts between them. I don't think he chose Flying Monkeys I think they were just better than no one at all . The Jacksons particularly the Father are just SO Narcissic. UGH. Jacko probably went low contact to get away from them and their toxic legacy. I sure he yearned for a loving family. He was abused by his 'real family' that's why he was so messed up.

The unrelenting stuff about how wicked/evil/bad we are can be a bit disheartening, but the posts from narcissists remind me that I am human, we aren't monsters. I know that you (the nons) have been (very) badly treated, and I can't begin to understand how that has made you feel, but at the same time part of the function of this forum is to support narcissists. I also acknowledge that you (the nons) are supportive when talking to us directly on here, & probably hold back on a lot that you'd like to say. Anyway, I do understand that this thread wasn't particularly created for narcissists, but it lifted my spirits to see that Euler had posted on it, even before I read what she had written. She's 'just' another human being, struggling with the sort of self awareness and attempts to improve that the rest of us on here are struggling with - although my problems are much milder than some other narcissists'.

Personality Disorders weren 't identified much less singled out until the past couple of decades (that's not including treatment options). Get real. sorry, this is zombieworthy. Had to agree with Euler: Frank Baum was an economist and the book is about the \"Bimetallic standard\" ie silver and gold that money supply based on (not that I didnt love the PD version) but this story is all about that debate which i think was closer to 1898. And since it's such an issue-the wizard I think represented William Jennings Bryant. But the story is an economic allegory and very indepth in symbolism - for one thing, there's no ruby slippers, theyre Silver. And at the end -the wizard I believe gives them all bimetallic gifts (ie those with both gold and silver, and thus showed Baum supported the bimetalliic standard as a macroeconomic solution to \"How to increase the money supply?\" (it was the olden days-money was backed by actual commodities of value, like precious metals (til '73 i think trickydick) Anyway couple key things-dorothy is america, tinman the industrial worker, scarecrow the farmer... i forget lion, Toto i think represents \"Totallitarians\" and emerald city is DC and everyone there has to wear Green glasses (self explanatory) and it got really indepth with how many stairs and what they represented and notice the road-paved in gold all the way to DC. THe opium fields, in the book there's a China City where they kinda jack things up based on our US Imperialism at the time.. EVen the Phillipines is in the book and there's whole lot more... SO it was an economic allegory that Baum wrote to promote the bimetallic standard argument, who knew! But just wanted to make sure you all knew..

This will meander, I apologise! For a while now I have been experiencing a flatness of emotion, motivation and all that, brought about by \"pretending to be normal\" all the time to the extent that I don't know who I am anymore. Hence the title of this thread. I feel I have lost myself and am seriously going through the motions. It's a weird detached feeling and \"brain fog\" sums it up pretty well. The reason I post this here in the NPD section is that despite a diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome nine years ago, I identify very strongly with the definition of a covert narcissist, albeit sub-clinically, insofar as I have not been diagnosed as such. I expend a vast amount of mental energy projecting a self that I want to see projected, repressing interests that I don't think others will approve of, and this has taken its toll over twenty-five years now. The artificiality of my performed self and the energy it takes to maintain it have led to me avoiding almost all social encounters outside the workplace. I live far away from my family and see them for a couple of days every few months (on separate occasions as my parents split up when I was twelve.) I have no friends except for my girlfriend who I have lived with for over ten years now but am concerned that she is drifting away from me. I assumed that as time went by and I got older I would care less what other people think but if anything it's got worse. Basically I am wondering if anyone here can point me in the direction of any tips or advice as to how to find out who I am underneath the performance, if there are any reconnection techniques or methodologies I can look into, before it's too late to have any kind of authentic life to speak of. (Not to sound too dramatic!) I have searched online but it is very hard to exclude the many results that are for people on the \"other side\" of narcissism.

(Not to sound too dramatic!) I'm gonna throw a quote at you that I got reminded of when reading your post, maybe it can give you a direction. Bromberg, Philip - Awakening The Dreamer wrote: A child's core self becomes internally bonded to the early parental objects through interactions that reinforce who the parent perceives the child to be and who the parent denies the child to be. The main source of power that parents have over children comes not so much out of what they tell the child to do as from \"showing\" him who he is. That is, by relating to the child as though he is \"such and such\" and ignoring other aspects of him as if they do not exist, the parents \"disconfirm\" (Laing,1962) the relational existence of those aspects ofthe child's self that they ignore. This disconfirmation, because it is relationally nonnegotiable, is traumatic by definition and is intrinsic to the existence of developmental (relational) trauma. Such trauma is typically cumulative. 1f the child's sense of self is to remain intact as he matures, he has to preserve the early attachment patterns on which his core self rests by continuing to exist in the mind of each new significant other that comes along as the same \"self' that was \"his parents' child.\" As he does so he continues to dissociate those aspects of self that originally were too disjunctive with the core attachment to be contained as \"me.\" This is a major reason why it is so difficult for many people to change in treatment. An unreflective attachment to the early disconfirming object means having to be whoever the other person seems to see you as (in order for you to prevent self-destabilization), not simply having to do what the other person seems to want you to do. Thus, a central goal of any treatment is that the therapist enable the patient to move from experiencing his enacted patterns of behavior as the person he is , to experiencing these patterns as something that he does , and thereby facilitate the development of self-reflection. Again, for many patients characterologically, and for all patients in some areas of their personality, the development of self-reflection must precede any attempt at investigating conflict. In the areas where development has been thwarted, the analyst attempts to help a patient change what is classically called ego syntonic to what is classically called ego alien. Thus the enacted ways of being are no longer \"who I am\" but are gradually replaced by the cognitive perspective of \"what I do.\" As this change takes place, a person is more able to hold, reflect on, and potentially resolve disjunctive self-experiences as states of conflict without the effort's being automatically short-circuited by dissociative processes designed to protect self-continuity. dx: SPD", "hash": "e96e7a84bc3c7de7a44a2e2f8a1df6e218a068709145db916ade274b97288fa0"}

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/delusional-disorder/topic1281.html", "text": "by Alex47 » Fri Oct 24, 2003 5:22 pm BOOK COMMENT REVIEW SYNOPSIS GRB comments on Alistair Munro's Book \"Delusional Disorder...\" I highly recommend the website http://shop.ebrary.com/ , where you can read the above book online for free. The information below is taken from p. 232-234, which deserve to be read in their entirety. For me, this section of the book has given me some modest hope, as it paints a picture of the treatment process and some possible favorable outcomes. There is also some practical advice for the psychiatrist. By necessity, I will paraphrase Munro: Because of the patients reluctance to trust psychiatrists, ideally, assessment and treatment should be by a family physician... but they may not always have the necessary familiarity with this condition and recent advances in its treatment. The psychiatrist must be patient and will often have to spend more than one session gaining the patients confidence before even trying to persuade them to take meds. The patient will usually vehemently argue against taking medications, \"but calm persistence does finally pay off in a reasonable proporatioon of cases\". Medication should be started with a \"very low\" dose which is then raised \"gradually and cautiously\", to prevent sudden onset of side effects, \"an event guaranteed to induce immediate noncompliance.\" Munro recommends that the patient see the psychiatrist at least once a week during this early stage. Munro is a champion of the drug pimozide, used in low doses (\"starting with 1 or 2 mg daily...and in most cases [will need to be gardually raised to] no higher than 4 to 6 mg per day\"). He has used this drug primarily to treat delusional disorder of the somatic subtype, with good results. Minor improvements may be seen within a few days (e.g., reduced agitation, somewhat reduced preoccupation with the delusion), but it takes about two weeks (on the average; sometimes as much as 6 weeks) of treatment (assuming the patient is compliant and responding to the medication), before significant amelioration of the delusion is observed. I will quote the following passage in whole, as it addresses a scenario which has caused me worries (the person stops taking their meds), and actually manages to turn it around into something hopeful: Quote: Quite often the patient feels sufficiently improved early on in treatment that he or she decides to stop the medication. Inevitably the delusion and the accompanying agitation and preoccupation start to reappear and it is then that the treating physician has the best opportunity to obtain ongoing co-operation. Even when the patient is still adamant that his beliefs are real, the experience of improvement followed by incipient relapse seems to make a deep impression and if the patient now trusts the physician he or she will often become extremely compliant. In successful cases the complete turnaround from rejection to trust is both remarkable and heartily gratifying. Munro also observes that in the cases where the patient makes a \"good recovery\", it is often \"relatively rapid and notably complete... even when the delusion has been present for a very long time\". Sounds great, doesn't it? [icon_smile.gif] He also talks about long-term maintenance of treatment (which not surprisingly typically involves continuing meds indefinitely), and mentions that of the (admittedly small) group of patients he has been able to follow up with over the long term, about 1/3 have actually been weaned from meds. These occasionally have relapses, but apparently have sufficient insight at that point that they actually voluntarily resume medication. I also found the following passage very interesting: Quote: There is a dissociation between acquired insight as to the desirability of continuing treatment and in-depth insight into the illness itself. Many patients never accept fully the psychotic nature of their experience, but so long as they agree to take treatment, it seems unimportant, and probably unkind, to face them with the fact that they were delusional before the medication took effect. Munro concludes with a few thoughts on non-drug treatment of delusional disorder, stating essentially that psychological (\"talk\") treatment is essentially not helpful until possibly, in some cases, after the delusions have been resolved using medication. A final warning is given: \"There is a general consensus that psychotherapy of an exploratory, uncovering type is not appropriate in delusional disorder. \" I'll say it again, this section of the book deserves to be read by anybody dealing with a loved one suffering from delusional disorder. It helped me, and I hope it will help you, too. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Roger C comments on \"I am Not Sick, I Do Not Need Help\" by Dr. Xavier Amador Dr. Amador writes from his own personal experience, both as brother of a schizophrenia patient, and as a clinical psychologist. A large problem with treating people with schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders is that many times they won't stay in treatment. The usual explanation for this is that they lack insight into their illness. That is, they are not aware they have a mental illness, or in many cases even that they are exhibiting symptoms. Attempts to reason with such patients about their illness are futile. Dr. Amador postulates that this inability to perceive their illness is caused by the same kind of brain disfunction that is responsible for the illness itself. Experiments have proven this to be true. So, since most of these patients are incapable of understanding that they are ill, how can doctors and family members convince them to stay in treatment programs? Dr. Amador gives a four-step method for providing patients with insight into the benefit of treatment, thus giving them motivation to stay in treatment. For example, one schizophrenic patient wanted very much to be able to hold down a job, but had only a few jobs over the years, most of which lasted only a short time. Rather than simply telling this patient that a job was out of the question, the doctor empathized with the patient's desire, and then helped the patient look back to the times when he was able to get a job, and the events that led up to losing the job, and related these events to the patient's treatment program (or lack thereof). This helped the patient to gain insight into the benefit of treatment. The book finishes with a couple of chapters about knowing when to commit a loved one, and how to go about it. All the advice sounds reasonable, and Dr. Amador's track record of success with it speaks for itself. It should be universally applicable, since the method is based on identifying issues that are important to the patient himself; anything he is dissatisfied with and wants to change will provide a means to motivate the patient to stay in treatment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sean et al comments: I saw Dr. Amador speak at the 2003 NAMI National Convention, if you ever have a chance I suggest seeing him. He spent a great deal of time at the end of the session answering questions from people with a mentalli ill loved one. His sympathy and understanding towards the person with the illness was incredible. As he spoke he explained Schizophrenia and the inability to recognize the illness in simple terms: He asked someone from the audience to give a brief bio about themself. The woman who volunteered (I'll call her Susan) was a Psychologist with a loving husband and two children. She gave a brief description of her job, her family, and her life in general. Then Dr. Amador then went on to talk directly to Susan, saying basically the following: Quote: Susan, I have some bad news for you. You aren't really a Psychologist, in fact, the practice where you think you work called me and asked that I tell you to stop going there every day. There's more though, you aren't really married. Tom also has asked me to help you get help and to stop going to his house. Those children aren't yours, and the house isn't yours. You're sick Susan, and I'm going to take you to the hospital and get you some help. This demonstration, more than anything else, made me aware of how frightening it must be to have Schizophrenia and have your reality stolen from you. No wonder someone with such an illness has conspiratorial thoughts. If someone came and told me my entire life was imagined I'd think they were lying. When they went on to say I needed help and then started trying to make me take medication I wouldn't trust them. I know I haven't done the demonstration justice, but try and imagine yourself hearing those words. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GRB comments on Amador: One approach is to \"empower\" the patient to make their own decision about whether to stay on meds, by promising that no one will object if they go off the meds, under the condition that they keep a journal during the periods that they are not taking medications... Also, a thought on the idea mentioned above, about finding a motivator for the patient to stay in treatment (and which could presumably be used to motivate the person to seek treatment...). Roger had mentioned difficulties in applying this concept in his case. I would agree that this approach would work much better with schizophrenia, for example, than delusional disorder, because in the latter case the person is only affected by the disorder in a limited way, due to the \"encapsulated\" nature of the delusions. The person suffering from DD is likely to be highly functional within society in general and professionally, whereas the disorder primarily affects interpersonal relationships with those close to him or her. So, I think it is a general truth that many people with DD actually do not perceive a worsened quality of life as a result of their (untreated) condition. They might notice a positive change after starting medication, which might be helpful in assuring future compliance, but the problem of how to get the person into treatment in the first place remains vexing.... Dr. Amador introduces his four steps. Listen Effective listening is really a skill that needs to be cultivated. You will need to learn to really listen to what your loved one feels, wants, and believes in. Listening without learning is pointless. First, you need to walk in the other person's shoes to gain a clear idea of their experience of the illness and treatment. For the uninitiated, this is not as easy as it may sound on the face of it. Too many times we make assumptions without checking them out with the person about whom we are making assumptions. Knowledge is power. When you know how someone experiences the idea of having a mental illness and taking psychiatric drugs, you will have obtained the leverage you need to begin to build a treatment agreement. But you will also need to know what their hopes and expectations are for the future, whether or not you believe they're realistic. And finally, you want to identify the cognitive deficits (e.g. problems with memory, attention, focusing thoughts) that are creating barriers between you and the person you're concerned about and between that person and effective treatment. Empathize The second step involves learning when and how to express empathy. If there were a moral to each step and chapter, this one would go something like this: If you want someone to seriously consider your point of view, be certain he feels you have seriously considered his. Quid pro quo. That means that you must empathize with all of the reasons he has for not wanting to accept treatment, even the \"crazy\" ones. But don't worry; empathizing with how a particular delusion makes one feel is not the same as agreeing that the belief is true. This may seem like a minor point, but, as you will learn, the right kind of empathy will make a tremendous difference on how receptive your loved one is to your concerns and opinions. In the chapter devoted to this step, I give you step-by-step instructions on how to do this using techniques such as reflective listening. Agree Find common ground and stake it out. Knowing that what you want for the other person is something she does not want for herself can make it seem as if there is no common ground. She doesn't think she needs medication or therapy, and you think she does. Like any conflict of beliefs between two people, to resolve the disagreement to your satisfaction requires that you discover what motivation the other person has to change. Common ground always exists even between the most extreme opposing positions. The emphasis is on acknowledging that your loved one has personal choice and responsibility for the decisions he makes about his life. During this step, you become a neutral observer, pointing out the various positive and negative consequences of decisions your loved on has made. That means refraining from saying things like, \"See if you had taken your medication, you wouldn't have ended up in the hospital.\" Your focus is on making observations together - identifying facts upon which you can ultimately agree. Rather than making an observation or statement about what happened you ask a lot of questions such as \"So what happened after you decided to stop taking your medication?\" \"Did the voices quiet down after you stopped?\" \"How long after stopping the medication was it before you went to the hospital?\" If you are truly collaborating, asking questions rather than giving advice or direction comes a lot easier than it may sound. Partnership Forming a partnership for recovery is the last and, in my experience, the most satisfying step in this process. The aim of this step is to help you to collaborate on accomplishing the goals you agreed upon. Unlike the previous steps, this one involves both you and your loved one making an explicit decision to work together and to become teammates against a common opponent. You may call the enemy different names, but the names are irrelevant to arriving at a plan of action. The final step culminates in arriving at a treatment agreement. _________________", "hash": "0a21c3f0efb3ebdbc45d2367a18767ee2bf2bab60055b4c68e1c1b28e5b27467"}

I have been recently asked to moderate this forum on Delusional Disorder. I am not a doctor, but I believe I have some first hand experience. What is Delusional Disorder? This illness is a psychosis characterized by non-bizzare delusions which last at least one month. The intensity of such perceptions may wax or wane over time. The person suffering from delusions is often functional in all other aspects of their life. Statistically this illness strikes woman more than men. There are at least six sub-types: Erotomanic: Belief that another person, usually of higher status, is in love with him or her. This other person may be a boss, coworker, celebrity, or stranger. Grandiose: Belief that he or she is much more important, powerful, wealthy, or talented than he or she really is. Jealous: The belief that his or her partner has been grossly unfaithful without regard to substantiating evidence. Persecutory: Believes that he or she is being plotted against, spied on, followed, or harassed by unknown enemies. These delusions sometimes involve conspiracies of people out to \"get\" the sufferer. Somatic: He or she is ill or has other types of health problems. Mixed type: Suffers from more than one of the delusions listed above. Delusional Disorder is sometimes a associated with other personality disorders or a subset of other psychoses; and there is a certain overlap with Paranoid Personality Disorder. It may be helpful to you to check the posts in that forum as well. The above information was culled from various internet sources.

I opened the wrought iron door, and all four dogs ran outside. First, the Australian cattle dog, then the two little beagles (a blue and tricolor), while growling and nipping at each other, and finally my lovable Bernedoodle. I shut and locked the door; it felt darker in the house with the door shut, so I turned on the light, and the blue beagle was somehow still inside. My friends say they call that \"getting old.\" They say it happens all the time with their keys, glasses, tools, etc. I've read about the concepts of samsara, duality, nirvana, and the Matrix theory. Not to mention my news feed on MSNBC has stories about alien technology, AI utilization, and even physicists discussing the concept of the multiverse. While modern psychiatry has a place in recovery, it isn't the solution for every part of perception and experience that can't be solved. I feel well. I'm not insane, just pay attention mindfully. I've been meditating more lately.

The imagery. The emotional wreckage. That line— \"I love you, it's ruining my life... I touched you for only a fortnight...\" It reflects something I wrote in January 2023: “I feel like I'm driving a Ferrari without brakes... When years of CBT hit, the engine glitches. A painfully hard feeling.” Coincidence? Maybe. But when you post historic romance scenes set in 1886 (August 2020), and the Fortnight video shows up with gothic aesthetics and heartbreak experiments... it’s tempting to believe in synchronicity. If Taylor was inspired by reading online diaries like mine (yes, it’s catalogued under therapeutic writing in the delusional disorder forum at PsychForums), I’d be honored to gift her the owner’s manual I’ve been trying to write my whole life.

I didn't stay long and even though we've all had our vaccine's we still socially distanced. On the drive home along the *mod edit* route, I was awestruck by the moon rise on the Eastern horizon in the middle of my windshield. It was amazing. It took up most of the sky in the distance. According to my moon app, it was only at 95%, but awesome in all its glory on the horizon. It made me feel better about my pickup line that had autocorrected. I was working to set plans for tonight. He'd said, \"You are a persistent little gal..\" I replied \"I am:) The question is, are you into that?\" He said, \"Of course. It's been a while\" I attempted to persuade my audience with a promise to only \"commit to thirty minutes.\" When I pressed to send the message, the text sent to him said, \"I promise to only vomit to thirty minutes.\" Autocorrect foiled my potential plans. I still haven't heard back from the man since the terrible autocorrected typo. Apparently, he didn't find it funny. Technology is great; when it works. At least he has yet to delete or end the conversation. I tried to explain it was autocorrect at its worst, but I'm afraid I spooked him. Instead, I plan to work on my material for the comedy *mod edit* group and my planned revision time and creative workshop sessions later this week.

She is so loyal, that she won't even walk away from my car with the vet tech without me getting out to walk with her. She refused to leave my car, eventually, the vet tech asked me to help (even though the sign explicitly says \"Do not leave your car.\") Honey made me so proud of how she waits for me and only me to walk with her. None of the other dog owners had the distinction of being their pets only trusted other. Then when I turned to leave her at the front doors with the tech, all the other pet owners watched as she slipped from her collar to escape the vet tech. The other pet owners saw her run into my arms as I caught her before she found her way to the massive intersection with 3 lanes headed in every direction. From the warmth of their cars with their headlights shining towards us, I was thankful I caught her, but I wished I hadn't worked from home today. My outfit and shoe choice was questionable at best, and my cotton hem fluttered in the breeze, I'd skipped the tights, and my wool coat had half the dogs shedding hair clinging to the fabric. Another nice spring day was cooling off from the sunset. I hope Honey's treatment goes well tomorrow. It's too quiet without her here to guard her spot outside my door. I miss her grumbling growl at every headlight that pulls by the house and her intense show of defense against pedestrians who dare walk by. Tonight, there is only Buddy's faint snoring and the distant rumble of the train rolling along the edge of the prairie sounding its horn, as usual. Earlier, I read Joan my article, a submission for an online publication. She thought it was amazing but then again she's my friend.

Tonight is trash night so I went around and found all the trash cans and took out the garbage to the curb for when Mr. Jinx comes by. My trash collector said he likes home-baked food and treats that time I had over 20 bags of leaves from my dozen trees, and he knocked on the door to let me know the max is 6 bags, but I'm lucky because he is my trash man, and he planned to take all of them. He and the other trucks usually roll into the neighborhood early, like 7 am. This evening I'm on top of things. The bins are at the curb. I won't have to run with the giant rolling recycling bin and household refuse in my sleepwear barefoot to the curb. I wonder how many other moms have a relationship with the trash service where they'll pause in the neighborhood if the bins aren't out and purposefully compact the load in front of the house, giving me the precious seconds to get down and get the bins to the curb. I'm grateful for the disposal service, Mr. Jinx, and his colleagues because I really don't like managing the routine with the garbage. I really need to learn to become more organized and keep my household in better order. Until that happens, I'm thankful for the city waste management department, and the kindness of hard-working strangers. \"I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -Sunnyg", "hash": "4879a3e07e69c4970c70cb7846968d37cdaf76eef64fdd269cba3b9ff6412dc4"}

I did wonder if development believing in false memories or lying to yourself too much can create unhealthy self-delusion, like in severe form of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Some people believe that people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder lie to to themselves too much that bags to question if they became delusional overtime, not that it's the same as as traditional psychosis. But only some people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder lie to themselves that are harmful to others, most of them cause relationship issues that severe harm. Some people generalize people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder as being all the same, but because not every person with Narcissistic Personality Disorder are the same, generalizing people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder as being all bad is stigmatizing. Some websites say that people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder lie to themselves too much and are delusional overtime, but I get confused, because they don't use the word 'some', because not everyone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder are going to have all the traits. Please, educate me if I am wrong", "hash": "1885f8679933c40987df74ccd46055fea76fb93c811641f358fdf10962f4cc4c"}

At first, when my partner started acting strangely, I thought maybe it was me giving off the wrong impression somehow, or perhaps he was just abusive or narcissistic, but his behavior has morphed into something else and him into someone I don’t recognize. We’ve been together for 2 years and are living together. His main behaviors are: - wanting access to my phone and phone password. Going into a frenzy if I receive an app notification thinking it’s from another man. - contacting me constantly wanting to know what I’m doing and mad if I don’t reply -slowly trying to chip away at my friendships saying all men are in love with me and I can’t have friendships with men. -constantly accusing me of having online and offline relationships - when I go to visit my family he thinks I’m out doing it with random men when I’m with my family. - if my friends are male, male coworkers, or even a male female couple they want me and I’m doing it with them. I cannot even mention talking to a male coworker in my break room without setting him into an episode of yelling screaming and accusations for hours on end. -looking at and misinterpreting my social media and thinking I’m doing nefarious things that are actually incredibly innocent. I could go on, but these are the main ones. I have never cheated on this man (or ever tbh, it’s just not who I am) and I did eliminate my male friendships to make him happy and so I didn’t have to put up with his behavior. Even when he is presented with proof (like my Google location, calls to show I’m with my parents, showing him the apps that have gone off, giving him my phone passwords) he still insists on the delusions. The most recent was that I was in a hot tub at my friends house doing it with other men. My friend does not even own a hot tub (he has been to her home), and furthermore, I was at my parents home and in bed and calling him to show him this, but he wouldn’t believe me. I sent my Google maps location and he didn’t believe that. I finally got a hold of him on the phone and showed him my child sleeping next to me and he somehow didn’t believe that and turned it around to say he was calling because I’d blocked him on text (I didn’t). He does not even think he is jealous nor controlling, and sees no problem with this behavior and thinks I am 100% cheating on him. If I deny and provide evidence I’m cheating. If I say that I’m not going to argue because he won’t believe me either way, that’s also proof of the cheating. He is not sorry he hurts me or makes me cry. He offers no apologies for his behavior, and when the constant accusations upset me and I try to leave the room or start crying, it just angers him even more and he says I’m just upset because he’s right. I am not in a position to leave for another few months due to life circumstances. He has already grabbed and thrown my phone and I am worried for the behavior to escalate. How do I keep him calm until I can get out of this situation. Any suggestions would be so much appreciated.", "hash": "2448025ebe652f0bc7230abbca74b53250c981841fe28bac7d71cf06ace92f8f"}

I think it can be hard, for family members of those suffering from DDJ, to get on this forum without making them angry. I understand you saying that you cannot leave for a few months, but PLEASE leave as soon as you can. It never gets better. It only gets worse. I have been with my DDJ husband for 23 years, we just recently separated for the last time. (There have been many separations) He did not always act that way but I think it was always there and I just didn't realize it. The episodes used to be few and far between but increased with time. The past couple of years have been never ending accusations. Just like with you, any males or male/female couples are fair game for him to accuse me of sleeping with them. I have been accused of knowing and having affairs with complete strangers at the drive thru window, as well as at stores, recreation areas, etc... And I have no male friends and I had to quit jobs over men working there. Most of the time, I was not even allowed to work at all. I was even accused of sneaking off to see someone during covid lockdowns. (I didn't) DO NOT RELY ON GOOGLE MAPS!! I went to a grocery store that did not have good cell service in the back of the store. I guess google maps tried to triangulate my position and was off by several blocks. Even though I had a receipt from the store showing that I checked out with a huge amount of groceries at almost the same time it showed me at the other location, he refused to believe me and to this day swears that I was having a threesome during that lost 5 minutes. I started recording myself on Facebook live after that and just set it to private. He of course had access to my facebook account. You would think that would solve everything, instead it made it worse. It seemed to make him angry that I had proof that I had not done anything wrong. A couple of times, especially going into stores, the livestream would get interrupted and I would be accused of doing it on purpose to \"hide what I was really doing.\" I fully believe that abuse and narcissism go hand in hand with this condition. My husband has been abusive as well, and he definitely displays narcissistic traits. Sometimes I wonder if he really does believe these things or if he is just projecting his behaviours onto me. He accused me of secret social media accounts, when he actually had them. He accused me of sneaking around to see someone, when he was doing that. Most recently, he started talking to an old female friend and became obsessed with her and confessed his love to her. It was not mutual and now he blames me for that. I must have done something to drive her away. They say that most with delusional disorder will exhibit signs of more than one delusion. He has had the jealousy delusions, the thinking someone is in love with him when they are not at all delusions, and the paranoid delusions that everyone is out to get him, that random people are laughing at him and talking about him, that he is being spied on or posioned, etc... It literally doesn't matter what you do. Argue, don't argue, have proof, don't have proof. He will take whatever your response is and make it proof of your infidelity. I have taken 2 lie detector tests. I passed both but they did me no good at all. He has even been to a therapist on more than one occasion. He lies. When I have gone with him and they realize that he is lying and try to actually help, he will not ever see that therapist again. Even the other members who have been able to get their family member to get the correct therapy and take the correct meds, will tell you that the previous delusions are there to stay. He will never be able to be aware that he was wrong. You will always be a cheater in his eyes and he will never trust you. If you have no choice but to stick it out for a few months, then just understand that he may lose control and become abusive. He may also tell everyone how horrible you are and they may believe him. GET OUT AS SOON AS YOU CAN. I wish I had. I stayed with my husband because I really love him and wanted to help him and fixx this. There is no fixning it and he does not really love me.", "hash": "e18e63b20aaa60c6ed1bfb3d7edc214e03347b5610a6332d5dd67a06bf5af490"}

It sounds like you're dealing with a complex situation involving extreme jealousy and controlling behavior, which can indeed be quite distressing. It's important to prioritize your safety and well-being. Seeking support from friends, family, or professionals who specialize in relationship issues could be beneficial. This situation does highlight aspects of male delusion where irrational beliefs and unfounded accusations can create a harmful environment. Remember, your safety and mental health should always come first.", "hash": "716b519870df542d09be84d2b750c8e079e181e17d6160605dc3f773f71f2c3b"}

My ex now (TF) suffered from delusional jealousy, and exactly like your partner mine would be on high alert for the slightest phone notification, even if a cyclist wrang his bell going by, she'd think it was my phone. She'd imagine hearing it, and when there was nothing to show her she'd accuse me of deleting messages. She'd say that male contacts in my phone were made up names for secret girls i was in touch with! Accuse me of having affairs with family members, friends wives, people from work. If i went to the toilet with the phone in my pocket, then i was away making secret calls. When she phoned me, if I answered the phone too quickly then (in her head) it was because I was on my phone messaging another girl, if i took too long to answer then i must have been physically up to no good with another girl. If she called i had to let the phone ring 3-4 times then answer it, I had to call her while driving to work, at lunch time, and on the way home. If in didn't either then i was up to no good. If I went shopping on my way home I had to show her receipts to keep the peace. If I was in an area and there was no phone service, she'd be calling and calling and by the time you'd get a signal my phone would be beeping with missed calls, she'd then call I'd answer the phone it would still be beeping with her dozens of notifications, she'd say those noises were notifications from other females, she'd be screaming down the phone. Any night out would always end with an argument, you couldn't talk to anyone, you feared anyone coming over and talking to you, if a girl spoke to you even if she had her own partner with her then you were having an affair with her. I dreaded a family occasion where id have to take her. I had a family funeral where she was adamant I was having an affair with my own cousin, and she even said my cousins husband was in on it! I cant believe i put up with it, probably because there were good days, but they always followed by a bad days, but the bad days were far more than the good. I always hoped it would get better. And i did love her, but that slowly start to ebb away. Anyway it slowly got worse and worse. I told her she'd needed serious help with her jealousy, if she didn't get it then i was going. She said she spoke with her Dr and she was recommended somewhere. She wouldn't tell me where or who, I wasn't allowed to go as \"I would tell them things\" which I thought was the whole point. Anyway after a few visits I sort of sussed that this was some sort of well being place, she came back one time with the notion I was gas lighting her. That's when I said \"i'll show you how much im gas lighting and controlling you\" I just left the relationship there and then, never looked back. She harassed me for about a year after that, but I never ever took her on that was 5 years ago, she send me a message a few months ago, half apologising. I never responded. Jealousy will turn any relationship toxic, it will always get worse, you need to bail out for the sake of your own sanity. Its too late in the night for me to read this through for mistakes! I'm just rattling my way through typing this trying to recall all her accusations, so apologies if it doesn't make much sense! Another thing she did was accuse me of having an affair with a girl at her own place of work, that I had never even met !! She would watch this girl at her work on the phone to her own boyfriend, my girlfriend would then phone me and if my phone was engaged then it meant I was on the phone to this other girl !!

When I am manic, I have delusions that I become a famous person and genuinely believe I am this person, sometimes for months at a time, but they are dead in real life. Before I experience this, I often experience him talking to me with a voice in my head (not from the outside but within my head). When I'm unmedicated I also experience sensory hallucinations, thought insertion, \"radio waves in my head\" etc. I have gotten quite good at managing these sensory hallucinations but my executive functioning is still greatly impacted while having episodes. This side of myself has gotten better about not getting into trouble but I was wondering if there was research and case studies I could research on this phenomenon to better understand my experiences.

I tend to lurk, but this is my first post. Recently, I have not been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder (DID) and schizophrenia, though they're being heavily considered, among other things, if that helps contextually with what I'm going to write here. I am not looking for a diagnosis of any sorts, just concerned about arising symptoms and wanting to express those feelings. Not a big fan of reality checking / reassurance of my existence/being alive, even if that contradicts me posting here in the first place, but it just tends to bring me more denial and frustration / distress. == I want to make it very clear here that, throughout this entire post, there will be themes of death/dying, Abuse/Trauma, and similar themes. I will not go into explicit detail but I want to put this warning here to be safe. It is never my intention to harm anybody. == So basically, I think I'm dead. Realistically I know that this makes me sound strange to those who do not suffer delusions, but it feels very real to me. It's hard for me to say 'it may sound strange to those who do not suffer delusions' in the first place because alongside my feelings of being dead/in hell/rotting after a traumatic event basically exactly three years ago, nobody really feels real to me anymore, including myself. It's been increasingly difficult to consider the thoughts and feelings of anyone around me when my brain constantly presses the fact on me that nobody really is real, this is all a fabricated personal hell that I'm living in, and that I am dead. All my constant suffering and traumatic experiences are justified by this, it feels like. I feel like I live in some kind of sick, twisted version of Groundhog Day; While the days may not be exactly the same, I experience a great deal of amnesia surrounding the previous day when I wake up the next, My routine is always extremely indifferent, and I always have to experience some kind of intense distress / abuse / manipulation at the hands of my guardians or \"friends\"/family / traumatic experience / misfortune in general. Every little glimmer of hope I get is instantly snatched away from me. I experience a lot of physical and mental symptoms that also make me feel like I'm slowly decaying. It feels like my cognitive function and thought process is horrible and has drastically eroded over the years (I'm 20), and I am constantly physically ill or sick or in pain in one way or another. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and I could most certainly go further in detail why I feel this way, but I guess the bright side is that I have a psychiatrist I recently got in touch with that I can see in a week or two to talk about this with if the feelings continue. Even if I feel like they'll only be there to tell me what I'm feeling isn't real, and that I am alive, and everyone around me is real. It does not feel that way. My brain completely rejects the thought immediately upon considering it. This is more of a \"vent\" than anything else, but if anyone can relate or ... I guess, offer anything else in terms of moral/emotional support, I would appreciate it. I'm not very interested in trying to bring me back into reality or trying to ground me but if that is even allowed here it may help me more than I think it would, which is not at all. xP Thank you for reading this wall of text, lol. Obviously some \"part\" of me knows that this isn't the case if I'm posting here to begin with, but it feels like a very small \"logical over emotional\" part of my brain.", "hash": "c4c7dd45a132664f1f502878afdb96fe4ccba83df04b99ef92217a9758977720"}

SAEED wrote: Obviously some \"part\" of me knows that this isn't the case if I'm posting here to begin with, but it feels like a very small \"logical over emotional\" part of my brain. Well I can't say how it is with schizophrenia (since you are being considered for a Dx in that direction) but on a very lower plane of um, 'unusual thinking' I know being OCD I can get kinda sorta close to being delusional about some things, even though of course I understand logically it ought to be all a bunch of bull. But that doesn't stop me from believing them, anyway. Um, an example: I can't listen to the wrong music on the way to work, I can only listen to a certain playlist and if I deviate from that I'll be punished by having a very bad day at work. So yeah I can admit it is illogical but you're not making me listen to the wrong stuff either oh hell no. It's real. (even if logically it isn't). But see in my case, that's supposed to be the usual defining line between OCD and crossing over into a delusion: someone with OCD always knows deep down 'okay this is silly'. Except sometimes OCD has been documented to jump that fence after all, so sometimes I feel as if I get really close to that. So I do sort-of understand how you can be Schrodinger's Cat- you say you're dead but yeah you're kinda not but that doesn't stop it from 'yeah I'm dead'. Yeah, I can understand.

As a great believer in synchronicity, and because your post may be the first genuine and heartfelt thing I've read in some time, I decided to register and make my first-ever post. I, too, have experienced what you describe: So many things about reality right now are different from how I remember them being before a series of traumatic personal experiences befell, and I have wondered if I am in some kind of afterlife limbo (the Bardo, as it is described in the Tibetan Book of the Dead ), and my daily experiences are in some way either self-inflicted or imposed by some unimaginable and seemingly omnipotent external force. There is no advice I can offer, since I'm as much in the dark as anybody regarding the nature of my plight. In myself, I understand this as a kind of psychosis, and I have been advocating for my own treatment and doing my best to comply with the medical advice I have received. It isn't always easy when, as you described, each day is very like the previous, but since I trust that these medical professionals, for the most part, have my best interests at heart, I figure that if this really is the Bardo, then the best thing I can do is remain receptive and alert so that I can more easily absorb whatever lessons I'm being taught, or undergo whatever purification process it offers. I have no illusion that absolutely every body around is trying to help, and indeed, there may be some who, for whatever reason, try to thwart my progress. I can't say for certain whether they're all NPCs or if there are simply individuals who have a polar alignment opposite to my own and are reliably deceptive, but over time it has become easier to sense who can be trusted, and how far. But I do not believe that such a state of affairs can be permanent, or that its purpose is solely to punish transgressors. It seems more and more obvious that my experiences are informed by my expectations, and my environment is most likely to be filled with the things I pay most attention to. This is where things veer off into frankly mystical territory, so take it with a grain of salt, but there's a strange kind of tautology at work here: I'm certain that the experience of my senses cannot under normal circumstances be an accurate and complete reflection of how the Universe truly is, but it seems impossible that there would be anything here that doesn't contribute by its presence to the Wholeness of Everything, so at some point I must have proved some worth, and I find myself incredibly fortunate to be having this experience. I guess I'm just hoping that you will not succumb to despair and hopelessness. It sounds hokey and kind of unrealistic for me to say so, but each day really is a gift, or it can be if seen with a certain openness and relaxed willingness to connect with and participate in the experiences it presents. At the same time, no truth I have found externally has stood the test of experience, and I've concluded that, ultimately, the Truth that can be found is only that which I will discover within. The inner work is often the most difficult, and I think it yields the most profound and lasting results. I hope you're feeling well and optimistic today, and I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to read and respond to your post. -- * I guess that's a pun, although I wasn't intending it at the moment.", "hash": "8802c7584e48e6a399b5ac4f816eb49cc2105514395d4ea2eee1fa7a03de4ab1"}

I registered here because i need to ask someone for advice about my friend. She is driving me to the point of seeking a restraining order against her. I'm sorry I'm advance since English is not my first language. I never heard this ever happened to anyone before and i think that my friend needs some serious help. First of all i am a female and my friend is also a female. I'm not married but she is. To a wonderful guy. We meet at a party about 2 years ago. She and i became good friends after only few months. Don't get me wrong she is a great friend. Her hubby is a great guy. Now this is the weird part. My friend is obsessed with past lives and reincarnations and such. Nothing wrong with that. At least that's what i thought so. Few months ago she changed quite a lot towards me. I don't know if this goes under delusions but... Few months ago she asked to see me for coffee. She was very serious and acting nervous. She stared taking that she found out about her past life. Didn't wanna tell me how. The weirdest part she said to me is that she knows who i was in my past life. She is convinced i was her husband?? Like what? That she and i lived during the 2nd world war. According to her she was a nurse and i was a pilot for Russian air force lol First i laughed and told her she probably just had a dream. She was so insulted she literally slapped me and said all kinds of weird things. That this is serious and we needed to explore this further and so on. Still i though she was joking. Since then she calls me every day she comes almost every second day to my place with her rambling about us being married and so on. I told her to please go talk to someone. Again she acted so insulted. Her delusions are worse and worse every day. Two days ago she literally locked me up in my place demanded me to believe her. She became violent and i feared for my safety so i told her i believed her. She hugged me and finally went about her day. Later i called her and politely asked her why she thinks i was her husband and what she wants me to do about it now. She went silent then said to me: i don't know. I asked her did you talk to your hubby about this and she says to me; you are my hubby omfg I started to yell and basically lost my temper. Told her I'm not gay she is not gay and that she should go to her real bio male husband and to leave me the f... alone. She got mad and serious. She said that i insulted her and that i will pay for this. Now I'm scared. I'm shocked and bewildered and i don't know what to do. Should i tell her husband? Should i report her to the police for harassment? The thruth is that i don't know if she is really mentally ill or what is going on? She did have some severe stress at work. Is this some kind of a delusion? Or psychotic break or what? Did anyone ever heard about something like this? Please help. Any advice would be appreciated.

Please tell the people in your life that you are being harassed by this person and they are not to give out any information about you without your knowledge or approval . Tell your boss and co-workers about what's happening so they can help you if she shows up at your workplace . Tell your parents in case you need to go there and keep a friend or neighbor on speed dial . If you don't know your neighbors well , then get to know them . Like I said - Document , document document . If she crosses a line and the police do get involved , any written or video evidence you can provide will be helpful . Lastly , if you do end up speaking to her husband , try to make the tone of the conversation more like \" This is what is happening to your wife \" instead of \"This is what your wife is doing to me .\" I think he will be more willing to listen but understand that there's no guarantee he can do anything about it .

It's possible that this might not be a delusion if she's interested in this stuff and has consciously concocted a past life based on familiar people / things around her (which just happens to include you). One obvious thing in your post is that challenging her belief causes her to react badly, so I wouldn't do that. Aside from that, avoid being alone with her, if you think she's a danger to you. If you no longer want to be her friend, gradually lose contact. This is kinder than ghosting. If you ghost her, she may remain invested in you and wonder why you suddenly broke off contact. An easy way to do this is just be \"busy\" and \"busier\" than you were, which is leaving you with no time for friendships (that's your excuse). In time, just drift apart, without any hurt feelings. If you still want to be her friend then, ask questions, rather than denying her experience, so you can figure out where all this is coming from (without judgment), i.e. whether she's actually suffering from mental illness or she just believes in \"psychic / mystic\" things.", "hash": "dcc9810755c97c7f0f5e5269af83ba44946b93b7e5e3a6dcfbb8c5807e397105"}

I'm in a pretty f...d up state atm. I'm scared and on edge. Staying with my ex atm. And i took some time off work. Basically the day she sent me a text: are you at work b...ch, I didn't reply to her. Later she called me while i was still at work but i didn't answer the call. That's was on Thursday. Few mins after the call she texted me: please call me i need to hear your voice. Im sorry i called you a b..ch. I didn't text her back. She knows where i work so i told my boss that i needed to go early because of some issues with one of my friends and also asked to take some time off. So there i went to the police station. And yes the cops basically looked at me helpless, rolled their eyes at me and said that there is nothing they can do about it for now. Go figure. But when i told them she locked me up in my own apartment and threatened me they did let me know that one of them will have a word with her. Right. Because i don't have any witnesses they categorize it as hear say!! Ughhhh I even showed them her texts but there is nothing even remotely threatening in the texts. They also advised me that i should record her calls,voicemails and save all her texts if she goes overboard. I then went home. I locked my door and closed my blinds. I was literally having a meltdown on Thursday. I finally went to bed so exhausted and fell into a deep sleep. 5 am Friday phone rings. And rings and rings. Of course its her. I don't answer it i turn off my phone. I finally wake up and turn on my phone. 3 texts. First text from her: im sorry. I love you. Second text; You don't get it. No one gets it. Third text: why are you not answering me why are you avoiding your obligations? Avoiding me. Like my what!!! What obligations!! Now i know something is seriously wrong with her. Then all the h..ll broke loose. I started crying panicking. I called my ex bf in tears, begged him to pick me up. He and i are on good terms but he is always busy so i didnt wanna bother him. Didn't think he'd pick up. He came instantly. I told him everything i cried like a baby. I showed him the texts and he told me to get dressed and take my stuff. I did. So he took me to his place where he lives with his roommate. Calmed me down. I'm now with him and his roommate. He begged me to go to the cops again as they didn't get back to me. I didn't go so far. Today is Saturday. No text from her still. Or calls. My ex told me to call her husband or that he would. I might do it but now I'm so sick to my stomach because if she is there by his side there is no way she would let me speak to him. That's what's happened so far. And I'm so sorry for my English and grammar but I'm Serbian and living and working in Switzerland . Thank you for listening to me both. I don't have so many friends here in Switzerland. When i googled for psych help forum i found this forum and now I'm happy someone took the time to listen to me. I'm grateful. Police here is useless pretty much. More or less. And one more thing is that they will likely be on her side because i am not Swizz obviously and she is.

Last night i finally called her husband. I was contemplating if i should do it but after her continuous texts of me being her long lost husband and love and whatnot... I called him. She texted me many times since my last post. Mainly she is writing about our past life. According to her we had 4 kids. I was a pilot who got called to serve his country and i got killed. So i did call her husband... He answered the call and the first thing I've asked is to where is his wife? If she was close by. Then he started crying (to my shock) and told me his wife went to spend her time with her mom who lives half an hour away. Her reason: she feels overwhelmed in their marriage and needs some time off from him. He also said he wanted to call me about her to ask if she has contacted me. I've told him what's going on. I've told him what she said to me and what she believes in. I've also told him i have her messages to prove. Then he broke crying. Apparently she was telling him that she believes marrying him was wrong, that they don't belong together, that it was all a lie. Now he is devastated and wondering what he should do about it now. He believes she had some sort of mental breakdown at work. I've let him know that i am scared of her. That i do want her to get some help but I'm scared and i don't wanna get near her. Like, no way. He begged me to go talk to her both. I said NO. No way. He thinks we should call a psychiatrist or someone to let them know what's going on and ask for advice. She is still driving me insane with her texts. Calls me but i don't pick up. Last thing she wrote to me was: i need my husband. I do believe she feels strong about her beliefs in past lives. But i cannot even make myself to go and listen to her to what she has to say. So I'm still... In a terrible state. Sad for my friend. I'm still staying with my ex but I'm thinking of moving back to my place. But i don't wanna be alone there as im scared she'll show up.

Never had it that high and long, till now. Trigger - mistake, that in real life can be fatal. 1.Can't eat any food. Now is 3rd day. No hunger and no fatigue at all. Like i'm on very very high drugs. Drink water and coffee. /gives me some thought that i might be in very very high manic episode, never have been without food for so long/ 2. I can't even write what i'm doing or feel during the day, cause of my psychosis, thinking that someone might find it here, so i skip alot. /again clear sign/ 3. I do smell stuff, others can't. Something like bisquites on evenings. I've this in some month or longer. Just asked my wife, and she is better with smells, so what i smelled wasn't real. /never had this before, i think it occured after some stress event, that has something to do with this now, some months ago/ 4. I do have some missing points like where i put my ciggars 10 seconds ago. All the time liek that. Start to forget alot of things. 5. I don't hear any voices /never did/ 6. 3rd day i started to think my wife is doing something behind my back, cause while entering her email on iphone, she had to apply for cockies, which for me in psychosis means that she deleted her history on her phone. /had this before, it's the least that is worrying me, but only today i started to no trust her, thingking i might be having problems with her i didn't knew i had/ I know it is possible for my mind to make thins up. So i don't start conversations or limit them as much as possible, in order to at least look like i'm functioning, i know me and how to supress it infront of others. But i can't even start thinking to want to end this, cause will feel unprepared for bad stuff. But as you read that what are the chances i'm starting to see stuff, like the same person popping around 3 days in a row, in a time i was waiting for someone like him to come around? Every time i start to think that nothing is happing and i'm crazy, he and one more came out, like in perfect timing, followed them, all 3 times. Last time that guy just dissapeared, or had start running and entering a very suspicious car, after the corner i missed him. So i'm either not crazy and very very ###$ up for real, or i make false memories and analogies with people's faces, or i'm starting to see people that are not real at all. Never had visual hallucinations and so on, but still what do you thing. Given everything, what are the chances for hallucinations of seeing people, that don't exists?", "hash": "4ebff49d448da61680733cc7933dd9137345546bc59f2788bf162bc9b0e9bed9"}

B4A058A2FA Something that seems, from the little reading I did, distinct from either a mania-induced psychosis, or a flat-out delusion. I don't know this really applies here, though, but I thought you might find it interesting. It seems people who have an 'overvalued idea' are quite coherent in most of the rest of their thinking they just have this one quasi-delusional belief they hang onto. Now, just to be clear, you're speaking of thoughts that are not intrusive, yes? I mean I'm OCD and I have harm thoughts that used to give me trouble, but it didn't stem from obvious anger (subconscious might be another thing entirely however) and I consistently found the thoughts to kill to be distressing, which is entirely in line with obsesssive-compulsive disorder being that people with OCD get these ego-dystonic thoughts that cause them angst. And I can tell the difference- if I really want someone to drop dead of a heart attack, yeah I know I do. As opposed to an unreasonable notion I'm going to kill someone, a thought that causes me distress and fear. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

I do not envy you. Of course she doesn't have delusions because... delusion. This isn't delusional disorder, but let me ramble about my flavor of mental illness for a moment- I'm going somewhere with it... I'm OCD. Which is an anxiety disorder... mostly... but can sometimes stray into delusion (and can be (fortunately infrequently) a precursor marker of oncoming Schizophrenia if I correctly recall). I think that I've never been delusional in my obsessive fears/thoughts and resulting compulsions, but... to be honest I can't be sure. At times of great stress, I have held some really irrational beliefs that I just barely hang onto this side of understanding they're irrational- but even now part of me is like 'but are they irrational? Really? Are they?' like a devilish little imp. The thing that normally delineates OCD from other disorders that include delusion as a symptom is that a person with OCD almost always understands it's all in their head and that it's their thinking that's the problem, despite being powerless to stop the thinking pattern. Which makes it Not Delusion. Usually. But it turns out, not quite always. There have been some documented cases of diagnosed OCD including a little flat out delusion. It's not usual, though. So it's like my OCD brain flirts with delusion. It's as if I've stood right on the edge of that void but not quite (I think!) stepped off into it. Yeah. I could see how someone could be completely convinced they are the normal one and you are nuts for suggesting they're mistaken in that firmly held belief because I've had times I've gotten really close to that. Because of the nature of that, that's why I can't be certain I've never been delusional in my own mental illness. I pride myself on being rational even during the times anyone else would look at me and tell me I'm being completely not at all rational. My partner sometimes has to put up with a lot with me when I get like that. At those times they can tell me all they want I'm being crazy and it's not as bad as I've made whatever it is out to be but nope they're wrong . I know they are. Even when I understand well maybe I am irrational about this, it's so darn hard not to be. The TL/DR is that when I get really convinced that something bad is going to happen, or if I get into my head I have to do THIS to prevent THAT (like drive a certain route and listen to the same list of songs to prevent something bad happening at my destination- and I have done that many times!), even though I'm not technically got a delusional disorder, damn if it ain't hard to convince me to quit thinking/behaving a certain way. How much harder must it be for your wife? When by the nature of it you can't at all see it. Short of catching her in a moment of clarity where she has a little self-doubt of the certainty of her beliefs, I'm not sure what a person can do? Keep on her and try to get her to see someone about this is the only thing I can think of. Also, compared to some of the Nons who have posted here to PF, I'd say be darn glad her beliefs don't seem include something negative about you! That's just a whole 'nother level of Hell. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

I wasn't alone in watching the glitch. I'm celebrating the 1st Friday the 13th anniversary that has fallen on the 13th in 11 years. I'm going to enjoy it with plans to attend a painting party with a group I spend a lot of time with - Sober. We are painting a sunrise, or a lake or something. I'm probably going to paint what I've been trying to work out for years, the Mandala I saw at the center of the lotus flower, with the white light shooting feelings of love from the source, my higher power loving me in my third eye during the birth of my daughter. They can paint the water and sunrise, I have other things I need to work on getting on the canvas. \"I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -Sunnyg", "hash": "16297353ce68527beb5c61d50850c5b281ea0cf01a53e948663beb45d611bc71"}

I went to the painting studio with a friend and met the rest of our group. At the end of the class, we lined up and took pictures with our paintings. Someone asked my friend and I, \"What class were you in?\" We both laughed. She'd painted her tribal seal, and I painted my memory from the birth trying to show people the beauty that has captivated my mind for so long, and especially the sacred geometry in the light. I still haven't mastered it, but someday, I'll be able to show others and hopefully move on. Everyone else painted the sunsetting on a lake in orange and blue... It was strange being in that group of sheep painting with the instructor. I felt happy to be doing my own thing next to my friend expressing her identity, too. It has beauty and value to me. Unfortunately, the board attachment quota has been reached or I'd share a thumbnail of my painted memory. I've been wondering if my friend the computer scientist will seriously visit, and if he thinks I'm the anti- post thesis blues solution... I have mixed emotions. My gut says \"Yes! I'm in.\" My mind says, that I respect the level of sacrifice and dedication he's put into his education, and his love for his family. But, to be totally honest he doesn't see my strengths fully or I think things may have progressed differently. Wouldn't he have realized it years ago... Then again, he didn't believe me when I told him I was into him back in the mid 20teens. That's on him. He knows I love him, I can't help but love the men I've been with, and I believe that he has feelings of love for me too when he tells me so. We are friends and more. This just feels like his heart isn't in it. Like I'm the un-intentional backup plan, because the intended original plan failed. Maybe it's just the pandemic and not having seen him in a very long time. I was supposed to visit in January, but the surge happened... I want more with him. And I want for him to have what it is his heart desires. I love him too much to see him make any choice for the wrong reasons. And I love myself too much to have anyone less than passionately into me... tied to my life. \"I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -Sunnyg", "hash": "093e3107f21ffab7523ad8434751f8a715a19204cb248da2e2a16ff37d4c21bd"}

That was my takeaway from talking with the municipality. On last Saturday, a comedian leaned in. When the picture was taken, I thought it was his stomach pressing into me as it was happening. It wasn’t till the next day when I looked at the photo that I got the joke. In the photo my eyes show a laughable expression of alarm, when you zoom in. At first, I too thought the expression was funny, until I realized, this violation touches complex trauma wounds. Not a modern joke at all. This is an old school romance move and it’s unhealthy humor, it’s not cool (Old school romance is defined best by “Beyond Heaving Bosom’s: the Smart Bitc#es Guide to Romance”). In the late 90’s the Romance Writers of America Association banned rape and rape culture from mass media content, this started the evolution of new school romance. I want new school romance with actions in the context of healthy relationships. #consentmatters #notajoke. This is past the point of funny. The Comedian did not ask for consent and I do not have a consensual relationship with him that would allow such public familiarity. I am not okay with this. It didn’t happen because I was dressed sexy, case in point, my basic long green dress. I was not drinking. I quit alcohol a while ago. Although I drank for years to cope with the last time a man violated. The original trauma that I couldn’t make sense of happened during an exam while experiencing orgasmic labor at the birth of my daughter. It took me 15 years to process that trauma to be able to respond with a healthy ability to hold my boundaries. By the time I reported it to the Medical Board it was 15 years after the incident, it was past the 5-year statute of limitations. But what’s 10 years when you are healing trauma? Healing is slow with these types of wounds. That is my experience anyway. On Monday evening, I decided to make my own moves: • I called the sexual assault hotline and looked up my rights at http://www.rainn.org . • I went and made a report to the PD. I chose to enforce my boundaries. This is a health issue regardless of age, race, ethnicity, gender, and disability status. Last time I waited to act I suffered for years without healing, stuck in my issue and getting stuck in the energy of entanglement. I’m not gonna play around with the idea that “someday he will love me.” I’m past that place. I got sick of telling my story sadly, years ago. That was the whole purpose for choosing stand-up comedy. Then this fool touches my trauma and I have the picture of it as a bad reminder that comedy needs to evolve. That is right Mr. Comedian, that’s you. I do not accept it. My ability to put up with sexual misconduct has been depleted when the physician abused his power at the birth of my daughter then I lost my mental health. I don’t have the privilege to laugh this off. Last time a man with power abused his power I wrote a book. This time you get this post. This is about me having agency and holding healthy boundaries. Why does the city get to decide I don’t I have rights against sexual misconduct? Today 11/11/2021, Veteran’s Day, I got a call from the PD. The municipality refused to act on my report. My take away: Guard you’re a$$ and tits ladies and gentlemen. Apparently, anybody can touch your body’s privates and get away with it. The hotline #, I’ve needed it 5 times already. I only want sexual contact and intimacy within the context of a healthy relationship. Comedian, this wasn’t a healthy move. Please don’t assume every woman wants sexual touches. I assure you, I want a healthy relationship, and this isn’t it. Violating a woman and not having a relationship where she is satisfied is just wrong. Please don’t touch without consent. #consentmatters #TheComedian #humanrights #boundaries Public Apology - Dialogue Matters Dear Friends, Family, and the Comedian, I want to apologize to friends, family, and especially to the Comedian. I'll start out with full disclosure, I have serious mental illness and have been struggling with inflammation and to be honest, my mental health has not been 100%. It varies day by day with my personal issue (I have a problem - causing inflammation and impacting my wellness). I do not say that as an excuse for my actions, but if I was 100% I would like to think I would have done better. Not that I want you all up in my business, but I was feeling really lousy about this situation. And I believe honesty is the best policy. I want to explain what happened, and what I learned, and what I hope for in the future. 1. I posted a long post on social media that consent matters. I perceived that the Comedian had touched my breast during a public photo opportunity. Some agreed with my perception of the picture, some could care less, for some it induced trauma, and many others were confused, I'm sorry for adding to everyone's trauma. It isn't that I didn't perceive it, but after talking with my therapist, I realized I needed to have a healthy conversation with the Comedian if I want to try to heal. 2. In reflecting, I've experienced Samsara, duality, and delusion before, so honestly, at this point, it doesn't matter if he touched me or not. My therapist believed I needed to talk with the Comedian to process this event better for my own ability to heal. My narrative was just that, one-sided, without the perception of others involved. 3. When the Comedian and I had a brief dialogue, I understood that he had no intention of a cruel joke, harming, violating, or even touching me. I realized the intent wasn't there. It was not my finest moment mentally having gone out on a limb with the picture on social media saying to guard your privates. My social media narrative didn't help the situation. While I agree that consent matters, after communicating with the Comedian's loyal fans - who convinced me to take the post down and listen. People said, \"this Comedian lives by his values.\" That made me think I needed a better way to understand my perception. I have character and have lived differently enough to know my narrative isn't always reliable, and my therapist is right, dialogue matters. Plus, I have no interest in harming anyone's career. 4. The Comedian is really the funniest comedian who's come through town. I would like to humbly apologize to all of you. I have another issue of a deeper trauma that I've been stuck trying to heal for over 15 years. This time, I developed a fear that I'd feel trapped the same way struggling with this perceived violation. Thankfully, I hope to heal from this matter with the Comedian better than the last issue where I perceived that exam with the Physician as a violation. 5. If I could go back, I would have had a dialogue directly with the Comedian about the issue prior to going to report it through posting all over social media. The comedian and I deserve to treat each other as fellow human beings and have a dialogue about what happened. Today, I think the United States is falling to $#%^ because people aren't having these conversations. The legal system sucks for dealing with things, it takes too long, there is little healing, and a lot of wrongs are being done by the system. I needed to hear the Comedian's point of view to find a common ground to listen and understand what the heck happened. This world is wild with video everywhere, and we need to connect and understand all the information - especially together. I want a world where everyone wants to be and that means I want to listen and understand more. I want people to talk with me to find common ground when I'm hurt. I'm human, not perfect, but trying to do better. 6. I thought railing against the issue of my perceived violation would make it better. Turns out I felt worse than if I'd sucked it up and tried to cope with my perception in isolation. With any social issue, we need a social solution. There was a need for dialogue and inclusion. Isolation is about the worst thing for mental health. We need more conversation and dialogue. 7. Thank you to M. a super fan for helping to raise my awareness of how this issue was traumatizing and irresponsible. I'm sorry. 8. Thank you for reading this long commentary. Please accept my sincere apology. Next time I think about posting, I'm gonna try having a real conversation instead. I wish I'd called someone sooner. I am truly sorry for any emotional response my earlier post may have brought. In reflecting on this I've decided to take a vacation from social media (after this post to make amends to the Comedian). Sunny I quit social media because the narratives attached to this were trying to make it about something else. Social media is not good for mental health. I wish for hope and healing. It wasn't really fair to have this up here without the picture of the issue. \"I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -Sunnyg", "hash": "bdc872febb6366d823f5c856fe4d622f6e38b56f1869afb11667b33767b503fa"}

In a moment of weakness, I searched for changes to a playlist. Shortly after I pressed the search button, there was a crackling noise, and a bit of ink appeared on one of my comedy flashcards. I studied the watermark and it looked like a heart shape. Not perfect, but close. I looked at the ceiling to see if something fell, then tried to scratch it, to see if it was a piece of pastry from my almond croissant earlier. It wouldn't come off. It was as if someone drew on my flashcard with a tiny fountain pen. When I turned over the card it was my lucky number 3. A bit that jokes about experiencing the ghost of my daughter's grandfather... (3) That was the same bathroom I experienced the ghost of my daughter's grandfather telling me to \"be good to his son.\" While I was on the toilette. If that doesn't make $#%^ awkward then nothing will. Talk about spooky $#%^! I cried and laid down wondering if it's my mental health again. I most certainly didn't ink that heart on the back of the card with the ghost story.

By the time I dragged my pumps around the corner I saw some commotion on 2nd Avenue. A woman dropped a quarter and I thought it vanished from sight. It disappeared from the surface of the pavement. It wasn’t that it had rolled away, it evaporated into thin air with all our eyes on it, as if we were hypnotized to watch it. Two businessmen were walking down the street, towards three women heading uptown. I overheard their exchange about the coin. They all were looking down. “Where’d it go?” The man asked with the Midwestern accent. “It vanished into thin air,” an older lady dressed as if she could have just come from church said in disbelief. “That’s crazy,” her friend said shaking her well plastered hair. “Impossible,” the other man said peering through thick glasses. A third woman in sandals walked down the steps to look on the ground there, as if the quarter rolled out of sight. The Midwesterner reached into the pocket of his khakis. “Here you go, I don’t need this one,” he said handing the first lady a shiny new quarter. I walked around the group as they continued to search for the lost coin, baffled at its disappearance. I relaxed when this happened. Reassured by the Midwesterner’s generosity and the experience of the coin. I felt connected to the East Village and Gramercy through my routine walks along their sidewalks. But when the coin was taken from the sidewalk where the woman dropped it near 24th street, I felt that something more powerful in the universe linked to my reality. As soon as I got home, I video called my friend, Sophie. She remembered another story I’d told her. “Yeah, I’m a little worried. I know the idea of time travel is delusional, right? But, could the coin have rolled back in time? Could October have been the other end of a wormhole? Back then, a coin appeared out of nowhere in that same spot.” I said hesitating a bit, knowing I must sound out of my mind. “Oh my God, I remember you telling me,” Sophie said letting her jaw drop open. In the fall, I had been worried about money and wasn’t sure about my future. I’d started to feel like if I didn’t have a solid financial situation, then I didn’t have value, but that was when the quarter rolled toward me. There was nobody else around. The quarter appeared out of nowhere in the center of the sidewalk, in front of me on my walk to work. At that moment I was thinking about my monetary value when the coin came to me. Once I saw the coin, I gave up obsessing about money, but felt paranoid for a few days. I kept walking, freed from the ideas that I needed more money. That coin spoke to me in a deep way. It was a sign that someone somewhere had the ability to give or take away things. I believed my relationships with the people around me, and with whoever controlled that quarter and knew my thoughts were really what should matter. The coin was not under my control. In October 2014, I didn’t need the money as much as a symbol of worth, and seeing the coin appear out of thin air had shocked me awake. I didn’t chase the quarter, because I didn’t know where it came from. It made me a little paranoid that someone was watching, and playing with me. So, I let the coin roll down the steps to the paved patio and kept walking. “Oh my God. A wormhole on 2nd Avenue?” Sophie questioned lifting her brows. “I don’t know, I searched for the “disappearing coin trick” and saw all sorts of magic tricks that can be played out. There is even one stunt in a café where they made a scene happen like out of a poltergeist movie. I don’t know how it happened, but it was reassuring to think that there is some other force watching out for us.” I said. “But how would they have known to roll it while you were thinking your self-worth was tied to finances?” Sophie asked. I shrugged my shoulders. The strangeness that inspired much of my life over the past decade was made up of reality, but I worried. Was I misunderstanding my surroundings? Either I was getting sick again, with the experience with the coin, or something strange was happening around me. It isn’t that I asked for strange things to happen, they just did. And when they did, I tried to document them. Everyone said it couldn’t be real, my family and providers said it was delusional. But I accepted treatment, I took effective medication. Why did things keep happening? When the coin went missing or appeared out of nowhere, it made me wonder; what if it was real? I shrugged my shoulders. I didn’t want to believe my experience, because if it was true, then someone may be in control. Had a magician, God, or some other intelligent life form played with me? I preferred to think I was just sick again. Sophie had lived with me while she was in college. Sophie knew strange things happened around me. Things would be moved about, spices would go missing, just before I’d reach for it. The radio would turn on and off independent of being touched. And at times it spooked us. The doors would be unlocked when it should have been locked. The lights would at times flicker on or off without being commanded. Sophie worried that somehow, I was at the center of something strange. I had confided a secret. It involved New Hampshire. It was just weird enough that Sophie thought Spooks could be targeting me to drive me mad, to take away my credibility regarding the secret of the sexual abuse at Jamie’s birth. Sophie added the coin to the list with the radio, lights, lock, and spices. “Look at it this way, at least you got to experience the coin. Some people go their whole life without interesting things happening to them.” “Ah, they probably have weird stuff happen to them, too. They probably just weren’t paying attention,” I said jokingly. “Seriously, when things happen that are strange most people just ‘let it go’. Like that time my keys were lost, and I found them in the freezer. You are not alone in this, you’ll be ok, just take it easy, and relax, it will sort out eventually. Just keep documenting, someday they’ll understand,” Sophie said concerned that maybe I wasn’t mad. For me only time could give me insight into the coin. 2017 Eclipse The sun was high in the sky as I drove away from the beach. Jamie sat next to me on our trip home to New York City. I’d rented a car to pick her up from a YMCA camp near the Delaware Water Gap in New Jersey and we’d driven up to visit Dr. Mitchel’s family at their annual beach house vacation. Their family invited us to share their time with them to help fill the void of loss. We backed away from the white house towards a small green mermaid statue at the edge of the sand dune. Dr. Mitchel had walked over to the fence in sandals and shorts. He’d lost a loved one to mental illness, and our relationship acted as a healing connection. At a Yankee Dental Conference dinner with his wife in 2009 we’d shared stories that were deep and personal. I shared my story of the sexual abuse by a physician at the birth followed by the onset of mental illness, and I learned something fascinating about Dr. Mitchel’s wife’s beliefs. “We come into this world to help one another through this lifetime, and work toward our soul goals.” She said. Over beef burgundy with pasta, we forged a healing relationship. Dr. Mitchel provided insight from his years of experience, and I gave him a way to try to heal his soul from feeling the pain of helplessness against losing someone special to mental illness. As we left the parking lot that summer day, he lowered the thin linked chain that cordoned off the entrance to the lot between the sand dune and the fence. He waited for us to slowly drive over the chain. Then he refastened the metal to the hook to chain off the entrance, and we all waved goodbye. That morning the radio buzzed in preparation for a solar eclipse. Jamie alternated between iTunes DJ, Google maps navigator, and conversationalist. The sun was high in the sky when we pulled out of the parking space. We talked about her time at camp, her response to the letters I’d sent to her at camp. She scheduled a visit with her new best friend from camp. We started to plan for her going back to school and I explained my work schedule for the coming months. While we travelled along the eastern seaboard, I was hit hard by the thought that I’d missed so much of motherhood wrapped up in my thoughts about the birth. My heart tugged at the realization that I’d lost so much time in motherhood trying to heal from the memory of being sexually assaulted during the exam in childbirth. I’d never had a fiercer attraction than I felt for the man who touched me. When the physician violated my sacred space, regardless of his intentions, I broke in response. I’d never had anyone touch me like that who didn’t say they wanted me, too. I’d never been touched by someone who I didn’t have a consensual agreement with who I could love. After Dr. Richard’s touch, it was too much to try to reconcile the reality of my perception of his abuse with my fantasy of desire. I became trapped in the memory of his touch wanting forbidden love. He did not, and would never be able to love me. He was just doing his job. I was treated clinically rather than like the human I am. When I was put in the role of the patient, I was told it was time to examine my progress in labor. The system took my ability to protect my sacred space at the most vulnerable point in my life. Would I have been allowed to say something? Would the system have let me say he was too hot? In 2005, I don’t believe they would have accepted my desire to change providers without making it a big deal. Both the fantasy and abusive reality were bad for Jamie and me considering our situation. I was a 28 year old new mom, with Jamie to care for, and reconciling the sexual experience required every free cell in my brain for years and years. Due to my illness compounded by my preoccupation with the memory of the trauma and PTSD from the experience, I struggled over the years to stay in the moment. The radio tuned into a pop station as we approached 2:52 the time the 80% eclipse would begin. Cars pulled over on the side of the road. Drivers held their phones to the sky, tracking the sun above. I kept driving, noting that it was just a little less bright out. It wasn’t significant enough to stop. It didn’t impede my vision. The traffic in Connecticut along 95 was heavy and slow. As I drove something happened to me. It was subtle, but profound. The feelings that had held me tight for over a dozen years released inside me. As we listened to music, it happened. Jamie played Total Eclipse of the Heart on repeat throughout the eclipse. After the eclipse we talked about the Taylor Swift trial verdict that I’d mentioned in one of the camp letters. I explained the significance for women everywhere, when a disc-jockey was found guilty of groping her. She was not held to blame for his losing his job over his actions, and counter sued for a dollar for the grope. I had a personal reaction to the events of the Swift trial. I went back in my memory and considered my experience from a new perspective. Silently, I reflected as the music played and Jamie texted with all her new friends in a group chat. Her phone was blowing up with hundreds of comments, it chimed like extra beats in the music. We laughed as it took on a beat of its own, and she silenced her device to a vibration. The chuckles pained me. I felt upset at the memory of Dr. Richard’s touch in my sacred space and how it had taken such a deep root inside me. I grieved about the time I’d lost as a mother, and how Jamie had been hurt by my inability to move past the memory of not being loved by Jack or Dr. Richard. But I was determined not to wallow any more. I recognized that I have the rest of my life to be the mother the way I’d set out to do when I started trying to conceive Jamie. I hoped that she would heal from the pain of not feeling unconditional love. For the longest time I didn’t know how to love. After everything I went through, I didn’t like myself for a while. I tried to love Jamie the best I could, but not loving myself, I didn’t have the resources to meet her needs emotionally. It wasn’t until I broke free from Jack that I began to heal my heart, and learned to love myself and began to fulfill Jamie’s emotional needs. She’d been raised with a form of unsatisfying and conditional love from Jack. It was a love based on a behaviorists world view. When she behaved as her father wanted she was rewarded with feeling his conditional love. My love was unreliable for her due to my medication sedation, and illness. These ailments physically limited me. She was still rightfully angry that I wasn’t a better mom for her. She compared her experience with her friends. “You failed me so many times, I’ve lost my trust in you through years of disappointments and broken promises.” She said. “I’m trying. I want to be the mom I set out to be when I planned to have you. I’m sorry I got sick, and I know I need to do a better job as a mom.” I said. “You shouldn’t have had me if you couldn’t handle it.” She said. “I was well when I conceived you, I had no idea I would get so sick. Even if I had known I’d get sick, I still would have had you, because you are the best part of my life. I love you more than anything, and you are my connection to the future.” I said getting teary eyed. “I don’t believe you. If that was true, you wouldn’t smoke.” She said. “I’m quitting. We have to go on a tight budget this fall, and I’m giving up all the expensive things that are not essential.” I said. “Good. You know how upset it makes me to see you killing yourself with cigarettes and alcohol.” She said. We continued to plan for the fall. She made a list of all the clothes she needed for the fall, and we talked about how we would make our budget work. Jamie was the best seventh grader I’d ever known. She understood our situation, in some ways she understood things better than me. I loved how she was bright and intelligent. My heart squeezed with love, and painful regret and guilt for all the time I’d been captivated by the memory of the trauma of the touch from Dr. Richard and not being loved through the experience. In that moment I realized, I’d never really be able to love the physician who’d put me on this path without the world changing and understanding from a higher level a higher love. For the first time in my life, I began to feel upset for Jamie and the injustice she’d endured due to my experience. Jamie was such a great kid. She was a member of the Principal’s Council, the student government group at her school. Her leadership qualities were strong, her logic was sound, and her intelligence keen. I couldn’t remember a time when Jamie hadn’t been correct in her assessment from her perspective. The issue I had with her perspective is that it was not always grounded in love and trust, and I felt responsible for that weakness. Over the next few weeks we shopped for school clothes, supplies, and I signed her up for riding lessons at the barn. Even if her and my relationship was still healing, she had a healing relationship with the horses at the last barn in Brooklyn. I trusted that even if she didn’t feel good about her relationship with her dad and me, she looked forward to riding. I knew that gave her something in life to love. Even though we didn’t have much money to spend on things, I made sure to pay the bill for her horse riding lessons. By the middle of the month I took the bus up to Albany, NY to run a meeting for my professional association. I’d been elected as President shortly after I’d published my book, a mental health advocacy story I’d published as “fiction, based on a true story”. I mean, how else do you publish delusional memoir? I’d shared the book, and even having read “All in Her Head” the house of delegates for the New York Dental Hygienists’ Association elected me as President. On the bus ride home in September 2017, I googled something I’d just learned about, the Mandela effect. The Mandela effect was first noted by Fiona Broome a paranormal expert who attended a Dragon Con Event in 2011 and a group of individuals had alternate memories regarding President Nelson Mandela. Fiona Broome remembered a story where Mandela had died in a prison in the 1980s. He’d lived through that time to become president of South Africa and didn’t pass until after 2013. I wanted desperately to understand my reality and these strange phenomena where many people were affected with the same shared memories unnerved me. The Mandela effect opened many questions for me. I’d remembered books from my childhood were Berenstein, not Berenstain; I remembered the Portrait of Dorian Gray not the Picture of Dorian Gray, and hadn’t it always been Sex in the City, not Sex and the City. These small but memorable changes had crept into my memory bank, and this time I was experiencing something that I wasn’t alone with. Up to 20% of Millenials and Generation X’ers were Mandela effected. Most disturbing to me were the changes in my recollection of geography. According to news stories there was a terrible hurricane, named Maria, in the Atlantic ocean. I read and overheard people talking about Puerto Rico described as the 52nd state. I’d remembered it as a territory rather than a full state. I remembered the flag had 50 stars because there were 50 States. However, I returned to understanding that the group consciousness agrees with me that there are 50 states. When I exhausted the news on the Mandela effect, I meditated on my emotional response to the time I’d lost on my journey through motherhood to the memory of the physician’s touch. Tears fell from my eyes at the injustice Jamie had suffered due to my inability to release the trauma of the memory of his assault. Jamie was with her dad that night. I got home from my trip after midnight. On Monday morning September 18, 2017 after I walked Jamie to the train for school, I finally came to a new conclusion. I didn’t feel right blaming or holding the physician accountable for my grief for Jamie. I decided that forgiveness was the best way forward. I found peace in my decision to love myself. I forgave myself and the physician. My phone buzzed with a reminder from my step mom Jill to take my medicine. When I reached for my pill bottle, which should have been half full, it was empty. It scared me. I’d noticed spices and things around the house coming and going again. Like the fingernail clippers the year before. September 2016 Last night I went to Bar Chord. I sat at a picnic table in the backyard where the murals are painted. It was the first free night I’ve had in a while, Jamie was at her dad’s. One thing led to another and I ended up going home with an artist. I hadn’t meant for it to happen. I learned the artist was married, and I knew that it was wrong for me, but it felt so nice to connect. So intense. I liked it intense. Part of me worries I’m playing with fire. I don’t know how I’ll feel once I bond with him. In a weird way, he feels like my equal. I like that, but I know I could never trust him. I worry it will turn into a dark and unhappy space for me. I think about Dr. Richard and it makes me cry. I know, that will NEVER happen, but I still want Dr. Richard. People like the artist help me forget how sad I feel about not knowing Dr. Richard. October 2016 Last week I looked everywhere for the fingernail clippers. They disappeared from the place I expected them to be. The small china cup that held the clippers was missing. I searched and searched, the kitchen, bathroom, closets, my daughters room, her closet, my boxes of things. It was 1:30 AM by the time I gave up. Everywhere I looked there were no clippers. I finally found a fingernail file, a gift from the Empire Conference I attended a few years ago. I grated down my nails irritated at the missing clippers. Then tonight, when my friend, the artist, asked to smoke a cigarette, I went to get something to take to the terrace to ash in, and there it was: the small porcelain tea cup with the fingernail clippers. It was sitting right there, right where it was supposed to be last Saturday when it was missing. “It’s back,” I said. “What?” My friend asked. “The ashtray went missing, and now it is right here. Do I have selective vision? How did I not see it before? How is that possible?” I asked. My friend had no idea the significance of my find. He was oblivious to the irritation I experienced last Sunday night at 1:30am. I had searched and searched for the clippers and that tea cup. I would swear on my life that it was NOT there just last Sunday, but it returned to me today. It was a full moon, and I told my friend the artist that I couldn’t be intimate with him anymore. I felt too guilty having a relationship with him. He had commitments outside of the connection we shared. So, I told him I needed distance. He played some songs for me on youtube, then I said it was time to walk the dog. We said a hurried goodbye, and I returned home to consider the significance of the reappearance of the nail clippers. I wondered if it had something to do with my email. I’d told everything, the truth of my story. I felt reassured when things I needed were returned. If ever something goes missing and isn’t returned I’ll worry that my protectors failed. For now, I feel safe. When my medication went missing the morning of September 18th, 2017, I worried that I wasn’t supposed to take the medication. In my state of fear, I lied to my family about taking my medication. On Tuesday, I went to work. I’ve been told that the medication doesn’t leave your system for some time. I didn’t feel like a threat to myself or others, so I didn’t consider going to work a problem having missed my dose of medication. I slept okay that night, not as soundly as I usually do, but I made it to work on time. It was a good day, filled with positive interactions with student learners in the clinic and their patients. However, the computer system AXIUM was acting up. With one of the patients the odontogram where the teeth are charted on the computer screen said a front tooth was missing, but looking in the mouth and looking at the x-rays, the tooth existed in real life. We couldn’t figure out how to make the tooth appear on the chart. I brought over Dr. Burns and she confirmed the tooth was there, then we emailed everyone in IT to address the computer glitch. It unnerved me because I’d read a story about the mysterious planet Nerbu X in our solar system. I was starting to see signs in my environment, and this error message made me wonder if AXIUM, our flawed electronic dental records system, might be a metaphor about our world. Like Nerbu X, the glitch in the system was showing the tooth as missing when it was actually present in real life. After that, every time something happened, the error messages in AXIUM would give me warnings. It had me on edge. “I don’t know why it is giving us all these error messages,” I told one student I was working with. “I know, I’ve never seen it be this bad before.” She said. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say it was a sentinel being.” I said half joking, half serious. “What does that mean, sentinel,” She asked. “A sentinel being is something with consciousness,” I said. Everyone in the cubical chuckled as we dismissed the error message and the signatures were accepted. At home that night I was getting more messages in the form of things appearing around the apartment. A stray orange Gatorade bottle appeared in the fridge half empty. We didn’t know where it came from. Then, the radio was also acted up. It turned on randomly to sing pop music with lyrics that were a little different than I’d remembered them. In response to my decompensation, I created a key to interpret the signs and signals. The key used the alphabet to interpret signs using my assigned protective concepts. I used the semantics reading the words in the reverse direction. For instance, “Trump” meant: “Plan. God, You Are Thankful.” Trump T Thankful R Are U You M God P Plan When strange things happened, I’d use my key composed of protective concepts to guard me from fear of the experience. I believed I was being saved by semantics, a form of a game. It felt as if mythology was real dealing with my experience of being played with. Wednesday morning came, and the morning was going well until 10:30am. I walked over to the reception desk on the fourth floor by the CD side of the clinic floor. Each clinic floor was divided into sections: AB/CD. I saw a grey metal hole punch with “CD4” etched by a dental drill. When I saw the shaky hand scratched letters I became afraid. Explosive, I thought when I repeated CD4 in my mind. The chakra at the back of my neck opened in fear. Then, the fire alarm sounded as I stood in front of the reception desk and printer. It howled throughout the building the second after I had my fearful thought. Unsure what was going on, I walked back to my students who had just finished the final step I’d assigned. I’d already checked everything else. We dismissed the patient beneath the ringing sirens, and flashing lights. There were lines at the stairs as the building evacuated. My students asked me if I was afraid. “No, I have faith in a higher power,” I said and made eye contact with the people nearby on the stairs as we waited to descend. I prayed to God for protection from the siren and the fear of an explosive. When we got outside the sun was so bright and warm. It was a beautiful September day. I took a deep breath, and after a few minutes they let us back into the building. That night I got home and hugged Jamie tight. We made dinner after she finished homework. I set out my bag for work the next day in Queens. When I went down to walk Buddy, I read the dramatic news stories between Trump and Kim Jong-un. The stories were so funny when I used my key to interpret the news, that it made me laugh hard. The belief system was rooted in a deep level of feminism, whereby women could take back power in the world through withholding climax from their men for the sake of world peace. A car parked along the service road began to blink with the right turn signal on. The car was empty. It almost felt like the lights were laughing with me. For as long as I could remember, when I walked Buddy the automated lights we passed would shut off in response to our presence. I worried that somehow the lights were responding to Buddy and me. It bothered me that my presence caused darkness. I’ve always preferred bright lights. Brightness diminished my perception of bokeh or light refractions on the lenses of my glasses and helped reduce my perception of auras that sometimes surround people and objects. I took the f train Thursday morning to Queens. I sat at my desk in the morning light and looked over Kew Gardens. The lush greenery of early fall had yet to turn into autumn splendor. Class began on time and I worked with students in anatomy lab to support their learning. Things were going well with the exception of my issue with flickering lights following me. As we entered the clinic the lights started to blink. The small LED lights flashed like we were at a disco. Even the large overhead lights would randomly turn on and off. “These lights are weird, it’s like supernatural.” One student said spooked by the strange phenomena. “It’ll be ok. Just think of it as ambient lighting,” I said trying to reassure her. “I guess, but I’ve never seen anything like this. Do you think it will be ok when we have patients?” She asked. “I’m sure it will stabilize before we see patients.” I said. A man came in from the side door to the clinic and flipped off and on the light switch observing the unusual lighting effects. He tried every switch near the door trying to figure out which switches were impacted. “Are you here to fix the lights?” I asked. “I’m the electrician. It’s something happening with the transformer,” He said. We all chucked at the twinkling lights above. After he moved to the other end of the clinic floor, the student and I began to work. “Welcome to supportive learning,” I said. “My goal is to help you to review any content you may not have gotten right the first time and help you to review your study habits so that you can build both your core knowledge and your process knowledge. By that I mean the things you memorize – core knowledge. And how you learn or check your knowledge base – process knowledge,” I said. I noticed that it was emotionally challenging for students to feel like they’d failed when they missed questions. I reassured them that by reviewing things and approaching the errors with a growth mindset, where learning is a process and not a fixed objective, they’d make it through their educational journey as life-long learners, and I worked to reassure them that the knowledge base in the profession was expanding rapidly. “When I was a student, the difference between non-succedaneous and succedaneous, was not core knowledge that I retained. The injustice in the dental educational system is that it abuses student hygienists by making you pay for and learn more than an associate’s degree, then it fails to give you full recognition, but don’t worry, this program’s master plan allows you to put your earned hours towards a baccalaureate degree. Sorry, I’m getting off topic.” I said, and we returned to the corrections. I asked the students to open their text books and find the text with the correct answers, underline the text, then write the terminology in a notebook to make flashcards later. “This will help you to learn your source material and be able to easily access where your knowledge came from at a later date,” I said beneath the twinkling clinic lights. I believed my higher power was showing me through these student’s lessons a simple truth. I thought the instructions had two meanings. One was teaching students how to find their sources and become researchers. Second, these instructions could be used later for determining that we live in a multiverse. I knew I’d never be able to prove or disprove my belief in a higher power and how I’d been shown the multiverse. I read something about “disco lights” and the prophesy of Jesus. I wondered if someone was playing with me again, or if my reality was being influenced by a higher power. That night Jamie was at a friend’s home. New York City public schools were closed for the Jewish and Islamic holidays. I reached her about 6pm, and we both felt tired and hungry. By the time we got home, it was past time to eat. I fed Jamie a quick snack, and started heating water, and chopping garlic and peeling potatoes for a meal of fried catfish and garlic mashed potatoes. Buddy stayed by my feet hoping for me to miss the trash can or drop a scrap. I changed his water when he scraped at his bowl. I searched for the recipe for the catfish meal but couldn’t find it. Rather than abandon the attempt at cooking, I decided to use the quality ingredients delivered earlier that week and rely on my skills as a cook. I dipped the catfish in an egg batter then dredged it in flour and added some ground sage before frying it in the buttered pan. In the other pot the potatoes boiled with the garlic. The raspberries and whip cream topped snack had improved Jamie’s mood. She joined me for our meal that night. We talked about how our budget was working. She continued to understand the limitations of the budget. I didn’t share my concerns with her about the fire alarm, the “disco lights” at work, or the missing menu card. Instead we focused on her. She wasn’t feeling well. Her sinuses and “allergies” were acting up. I suggested we rest the next day. “I’m not feeling very well,” I said. I was beginning to feel transient physical, visual, tactile, and other sensory symptoms of medication withdrawal and amplification of psychotic symptoms and an altered perception of reality. I was too sick to think of the consequences of going off medication cold turkey. The burning skin was back, in addition to pins and needles, heartache, chills, burning souls of my feet, chakra bursts, pulsing energy, etc. The list of my symptoms was starting to grow. “I’m not either and I have so much homework. I have to write pages and pages for English.” She said. I was struggling with fear and fatigue, and our home showed it. There was stuff on the chairs in the living room, I needed to do laundry, scrub the kitchen, and pick up the laundry on the bathroom floor. Plus, I needed to take out the trash. The building’s trash shoot was closed off for renovation, meaning I had to walk outside to the curb with the trash, and I hadn’t done any house work since the previous weekend. It just felt like too much. Jamie was old enough to help but she told me it was my responsibility not hers. I tried to explain that we were a team, but she would get upset because her teachers had overwhelmed her with assignments. I chose not to argue. Instead, I took down the smelly trash when I walked Buddy. As I walked Buddy, I noticed my surroundings. There were police in the neighborhood that night. A long NYPD van with 6-8 officers sitting inside looking at their cell phones was parked at the corner of Ditmas Ave. and Ocean Parkway. I read NYPD “Delusional Plan. Why, Nation.” It made total sense that we needed police, to protect against some people’s delusional plans. Fortunately, my plan was the love orgasm plan. I felt safe within my semantic game. Buddy and I walked past the NYPD van to cross Ditmas. I saw a captivating woman in the crosswalk. She stopped dead in her tracks when she saw Buddy. She lifted her gaze to mine. She wore a wool skirt and shall wrapped around her shoulders. She connected with me through thick glasses. She looked young for such a look, and when our eyes met, the pain in my chest lifted. I walked Buddy past her path to clear the way for her to get out of the middle of the lane and thought about her calming gaze for much of the rest of the walk. Her stare helped me feel comforted. That night was to be the fall equinox, and that witchy woman’s gaze soothed my pain. We passed down the block past the rose bushes to the corner of Webster, where Buddy always marks the corner of the fence. As I looked down at the bushes inside the fence, my vision went to black for a split second. When I could see again, I saw a black and brown spotted Tabby cat sitting between the bushes with a downcast gaze. The second before I’d only seen dirt between the bushes. I felt safe with this animal there. Buddy was indifferent stopping to smell the patch of grass in front of the fence. Knowing that woman’s gaze helped me and being watched by the local wildlife (stray cats) reassured me. This night the lights stayed on as we passed by the buildings. I wondered if the cat was a shapeshifter, or if I’d slid between the veil. Jamie was in bed by the time we arrived home that night. I felt exhausted. I threw off my shoes and climbed in bed. But my mind was a buzz. High on a mixture of curiosity, fear, and hope, I couldn’t stop my thoughts. They just wouldn’t turn off. They slowly progressed. My mind wasn’t racing, it awakened to a new type of processing. My thinking lifted. I could no longer perceive time normally. The months of the year were hard to recall. I struggled to schedule tasks. However, my ability to play a game with semantics wildly expanded. When I wrote notes about my experience on the computer screen, a text box appeared. It simply said, “compare and contrast”. The message assigned me a task to look for contradictions and contrasting events. What I learned as I played this game was that it was inappropriate when reading about death, dying, or most news of sadness or terror. As I read the news, I listened to music on iTunes, iHeartRadio, and from my radio. Everything felt predetermined and intentional. Did someone know my thoughts? When they didn’t like what I was thinking, the phone froze, song paused, or a new story launched for me to read. The devices controlled my perception. When I asked if the fire alarm was their doing, they were perplexed. “You mean you don’t know?” The text in the browser asked me. When I searched my memories trying to know what I didn’t know, that was when the browser launched independent of my key strokes to a news story. It was an article about Durga, the Hindu goddess of justice appeared from the American Institute of Vedic Studies. I’ve been feeling for a long time that someone was helping me through my struggles with mental illness. The great mother goddess, who appears as Durga has been given many powers by Gods and Goddesses. She is a super power in the realm of the supernatural. I tried to understand the significance of this information. The songs on the radio sang sweet love ballads. It made me wonder if maybe God loved me. I kept sinking low when I had the thought that only God would love me. My dating life was fun, but when I reflected on the inability of the men in my life to love me through my mental illness, my heart ached. I wanted unconditional love. The type people at church talked about in my youth. When I thought that God loved me romantically, it was a powerful aphrodisiac. I liked it, but I sank low when I thought of how I felt about the men in my life. Pulling back from the memory of the men who’d failed me, I lifted my mind, and thought about my history of my romance with God. I couldn’t forget the way I’d taken my virginity. The first time I’d had sex was with Jamie’s father, Jack, which was true. But, I’d climaxed before that on my own. I’d used the most powerful thing I could think of in high school. I fantasized about God. I knew it was wrong, but it was fun. Part II Durga’s Plot While I was coming to grips with my new understanding, and the intensity of the grandiose idea of God’s love. The messages continued. From a combination of the text on the screen, music on the radio, and my thinking I came to believe that Durga and the angels of heaven or Gods, depending on what religion you used to try to describe the higher order of our subjective reality and the higher realm of power. I believed that Durga plotted with others to design a “bad romance” whereby all religion paints the backstory for this love affair with the third eye, a higher power, and sexuality. In romance writing the force is the thing that brings two characters together so that a romance can blossom. In my story that force was the concept of healing. Someone in the higher dimension thought of using “healing” as the force to bring God into proximity long enough for humanity to fall in love romantically. In 2005, I broke when I couldn’t separate my fantasies of the physician from the reality of the abuse of his exam during my labor at the time of my daughter’s birth. Then my husband didn’t love me through the experience, and I struggled. I believed that God was slowly healing me through time, and modern interference. Until the 2017 eclipse, I was unable to conceive of my experience as sexual abuse. I wanted to believe in the physician’s humanity and believe that he didn’t intend to assert his power over me. But thinking back, I remembered the look on his face when my husband took a picture with the physician’s camera for a picture album cataloging all the deliveries he’d attended. His trophy collection. I couldn’t forget his cruel expression when the flash exposed him, I lost my mind as I tried to erase that memory. I wanted to love his humanity and failed to connect with reality in my attempt. The experience changed me. Eventually I couldn’t sit with the anger, I didn’t like feeling that toxic, so I chose to forgive, but still, it left me forever touched, and the ramifications for my daughter and my relationship were significant and long term. When I deeply reflect on my perception, I am uncertain of any reality that is not verified. Memory is subjective. It can be influenced and twisted by many forces. It was also the most vulnerable moment of my life. Plus, with having experienced so many versions of reality in the multiverse during my illness*more later, I have stopped believing that there is a simple reality. The physician may be the well-intentioned version of himself, and not the power player I remember being touched by. Anyway, at this point, the intention doesn’t matter. I perceived it in my reality, and I’ve forgiven him. He is free. I am free, too. I chose to love him unconditionally, regardless of his actions or my delusions. Even though I don’t get to be with him in the physical world, I feel alive in my higher level connection to the universal source. I live in the Light and live my life with love, and it feels divine. I am better not having him in the physical sphere. Any connection to him is of a higher level. It only happens when I lift up and feel the energy rise within and through me. But I find sometimes we go to the sitting place in my mind and spend time being sad when I cannot lift beyond my visceral needs. I’d been through so much. A song played on my iPhone by Rockell who sang “Show Me the Way.” The song wanted me to show the way. I couldn’t escape the reality that I need to care for my child, and I knew I was suffering with my illness. I knew I would need to return to medication to treat my illness and return to sanity, but I knew the side effects were severe with the medicines I took. After over a decade of medication compliance my body was suffering from the medication side effects. The smooth muscles throughout my body had become stiff. Even breathing was at times labored and uncomfortable especially when wearing a constricting bra. Instead of worrying about me, I started to worry about the physician and his world. I was told not to worry about the physician. I was told that when his time comes, he dies a peaceful death. The messages told me that on the journey through to heaven, God (or whoever was playing with the messages) looked back in the rear-view mirror and saw an image of his likeness in the physician. Who knows, maybe Durga forced Him to do it. There was a country love song about those two meeting in the back of an old bar and falling in love. I think maybe it was all an elaborate setup. When I focused, I worried about reality. I read news stories about the threat of nuclear war. Then the messages started coming. I was instructed that I had to decide the future with my action. I was given the choice either to climax, or the world would be destroyed. The messages told me our futures were at stake. Thinking of my role as a mother, of course I chose to climax. What was the worst that could happen if I pleasured myself? It was so strange feeling as if someone could read my mind and control me so intensely. However, I never felt my free will was taken. Despite being played with so completely, the choice to act was always mine. Although, the perversion of psychosis is real. I felt coerced into action. It was my understanding that some higher power needed to ejaculate on the solstice, or the next thousand generation would be baron. Somehow, I was the focus of the attention of the higher power and by climaxing I believed this started a religious chain of events – beginning the Rapture. My delusion of grandeur about the end times is a common theme in mental illness, although my experience of it may be different. Granted, looking back on the scripture, my belief is impossible. The bible clearly states the pregnant woman gave birth with “labor pains” to a male child. And I didn’t have the wings of an eagle, I had mental illness and a half-written romance novel titled the “great blue heron”. At climax I felt a sensation of honey like energy spread over my body. I was vibrating so intensely, I felt like I was buzzing. The music on the radio sounded so alive and fresh to me. I felt high. That night I didn’t sleep. As I understood it, He needed to climax to reproduce to create a new heir for his family. Somehow my climax helped him out. Minutes later a story about a dynastic heir emerged in my news feed. When I stopped sleeping, my mind kept slowly thinking new thoughts. It wasn’t going fast, just slow and steady. I needed to consider to understand what was happening to me. I was captivated by the game, and my experience. Throughout the night I read forwards with the authors intent, then applied my semantic language reading backwards in loose associations that I found to be ironic and funny to read. It felt like I was experiencing the feminine and masculine forces of the ethos. It created a funny and ironic balance. The basic protective concepts when placed together explained something about our God, who I came to understand as coming from a higher realm like magicians in a parallel universe. I believed he was King Arthur, the King of Heaven, and really the leader of Islamic, Jewish, and Christian faiths, who is a masculine force. Past experiences with things appearing and disappearing around me had altered my understanding and perception of time. When I shared this story with my writing group, they cautioned not to share it, because my story may be radically insensitive to religions around the world. But, I have lived experiences of mental illness that defy reality. I still remembered the story of the coin. Unsure of what to do, I’ve kept my story silent for the most part. Taking it out and working on it when I am able. When I read the signs, they explained that He (God, the Male God) orgasms. I mean, we were made in his image, right? So, why wouldn’t He orgasm? “Orgasms Are,” I read when the messages told me to “Grow.” The humor tickled me at the notion that Durga, the supreme mother goddess had set up the author, my God, in a sort of a bad romance, where all world religions form the perfect backstory for the setup for this new mythological reality. She assisted using the character in my imaginary world “Sunny” trying to help me through my mental illness. She’d plotted for Arthur to work to heal me from the original sin of the physician’s abuse at the birth of my daughter, and to rebalance the male and female forces in the universe. Even Jesus worked into the backstory to create a reality where America exists as it can today to allow our higher power to fall in love. Even the Pope was part of the conspiracy to create a world where God can heal us all. The music sang to me with unusual lyrics to a song I had heard before. The lyrics were nothing like I remembered them. I’ve looked for the song and can’t find it in my library or locate the artist, but I remember the story vividly. The lyrics told me a story where God and others saw the holy Light but failed to descend in time. “We’d just taken you to walk the plank. We were so surprised. It was so surreal. We didn’t look at what happened until it was too late.” The music said. Putting it together with the messages I was reading in the news stories, I figured Durga was who they saw in the Light. They could see Durga, because she is a goddess. Their family in heaven share a third eye. They’d explained that they saw their family’s sins and sins committed against them. I saw into the third eye as I gave birth to Jamie and looked into the holy Light beyond the lotus. The flower opened with the purest Light I’ve ever seen at the center. The lotus flowered during the transition in my labor hours before I gave birth. I sat and breathed deeply and used techniques I learned in yoga practice in my early 20’s to deal with the pain. As I meditated, the sensation of the contractions of labor was intense. They felt similar to the orgasms of pregnancy. The lotus flower pulsed and bloomed with one thousand petals of every hue of color. Reds, greens, yellows, oranges, purples, blues, and at the center was brightest Light filled with love and sensual energy that shot sparks through the entranced imagery. There was darkness all around the periphery of my vision of color and Light. The radiating flower pulled me towards the Light and held my attention through the labor. There was also a Mandela in an electric yellow/green and orange pattern that emerged from the lotus. It was hypnotizing. I understood that because Arthur explained He saw Durga, they determined a sin had occurred, but seeing the holy Light transmitted simultaneously, they were confused. So was I. They later explained that being sexually abused during the birth violated me. But they hadn’t immediately gone to look beneath the veil to understand my story. When the sexual abuse was registered as sin, it changed everything. He said the world could never be the same. I believed they were changing timelines to prepare for a new reality – one where equality and justice ruled. In response to my curiosity about the romance plot, I looked back at the story I’d written in 2011. Originally inspired after my first professional encounter with Dan, my boss’ boss whose gaze made me feel things I’d forgotten I knew how to feel. I remembered something. I remembered being taken by the browser and shown the sir name for a line of English Nobility. I’d laughed at the idea that my writing used the sir name for the King of England. This was too much. It was impossible, wasn’t it? I’d debonded from Jack with the hope in the delusion that someone loved me. The idea that Dan (my boss’ boss) could love me burned hot, until Father Figure by George Michael played, and I realized he was too old for me. I was young enough to be his daughter. Plus, I didn’t believe he’d abuse his power that way. I knew I was sick and delusional, and that in fact, my computer was hacked and leading me around the internet. I’d chosen to believe that someone could love me, and the content on my broken computer, over trusting my broken relationship with Jack, the head of information security. Looking back, I wondered if I’d trusted Jack, if things would have turned out differently* footnote story about the hack in 2016/2017. I found a copy of one of my stories saved randomly on the hard drive of my computer rather than saved in a file. It was randomly dropped at a high level of my organization system. I usually kept my written works together in a file under my projects folder. Romance with God When a revised version of my failed submission for the Flame Contest showed up on my hard drive I opened it up curiously. I couldn’t remember revising it with such a strong masculine voice. I wondered how it got on my computer. Was I blacking out, or forgetting the memories of my work? I started to read it, and that reading played over in my mind creating new threads of thinking from which delusions formed. Had Durga helped me again? Or, my heart skipped a beat, Arthur?

I experienced things that can't have been true. I mean, it's just too much. The basic premise is that Durga Plotted to seduce the God of the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic faith. She did this using the theme of healing to bring God into proximity with women to heal them from the sin of sexual abuse such as the Me Too movement. God fell in love and realized why America exists, because this is where he has the potential to love and be loved. SO, the premise is sorta freemason... where God forgave Lucifer, because He fell in love. To accept Lucifer back into heaven, He (God) participated in a ritual to become the devil. I know, it's complicated. My Reaction to the Bad Romance News stories about the royal family, the third eye conspiracy, thoughts of my story linked with God, God the devil. And more. Holy Fire and Druga’s Protection When I looked up the holy Light in the bible, there was a reference about Jesus emitting the holy Light. The Mormon’s go into great detail about the belief in Jesus bringing the Light to every person. More simply, I think the Light I saw was coming from within my brain. I also found references to Jesus and the idea of the holy fire. Then in the thirteenth century, the miracle of the Holy fire was deemed a fraud. But it made me think of all the fires and fire alarms. Thankfully I reminded myself Durga is the goddess of protection against fires and things. I had a history of being afraid of fire. With the name like mine, who wouldn’t. Part IV – Chapter 1 Karma: Motherhood and Mental Illness I wondered if somehow Jamie was Durga’s child – Karma. Durga’s daughter is Karma. But Durga had never stayed after a major defeat in one of her battles, she always disappeared. I worried about Jamie if anything happened to me, and I couldn’t repair our bond, because you know what they say about Karma. I also worried that Jamie belonged as the daughter of the King of Heaven. Since the conception, I’d struggled to believe that Jack was her father. I had an alternate memory about the night she was conceived. I’d written about it in the book I’d published. I’d told myself it had to be a fantasy, an implausible fantasy. But, I remembered it clearly. In June 2014, after I’d had sex with Jack and he’d fallen asleep next to me, I’d masturbated to climax. The sex toy I’d reached for felt sticky and warm, but I used it anyway. I was too turned on by the idea that someone wanted me badly enough to trick me into getting pregnant with their child. Although, it did occur to me that it was wrong on so many levels to masturbate with my husband asleep by my side, he’d left me wanting more. Our home in New Hampshire was being painted that summer and an extension ladder leaned against the back of the house by our open bedroom window. I heard it creak as I climaxed. I postulated that if I was right, and Durga together with others from the spiritual realms set up Christianity, Islam, and Judaism as a backstory for the romance between a sort of a masculine King of heaven to transition from a male dominated society to a balance the power on earth between men and women. If I was right, the future would be filled with large sustainable cities, that were environmentally friendly, and where justice reigned. The images they took me to allowed me to have hope for the future. It reminded me of the ancient Mythology, where women united against men to end war and create peace on earth. Another possibility included that it could have been my soul emitting the Holy Light. I mean, I’d seen it during the birth. Must have been my Light, right? If true, then I doubted my understanding of “God.” I wondered if I misunderstood the role of the King of Heaven and the Mother Goddess Durga. A collective third eye that emitted love was more likely the true God. The one that I know and love, who is eternal love. I loved that male God of Christianity too much so I preferred my higher power to be the God that existed in the third eye as a universal truth that belongs to all of us. I figured maybe I was right and it is as if we live in an ant hill or a bee hive. Confused by the number of messages coming at me, I tried to understand, even if nobody else would agree with me. My story explained a new perspective for the reason behind the intelligent design of our universe in ways I could understand. The United States of America was intelligently designed with the eye at the top of the pyramid waiting for women to climax in a form of spiritual ecstasy. When I explained the story to close friends, I found many women in my life shared about their own close connections with God. “Every Sunday morning, I have a romance with God,” one friend said enthusiastically after I explained how I loved Him. Another friend said her mom relied on God’s love to raise her kids as a single mom. My heart started to sink low when I let myself get down into the details of the failed relationships with the men in my life. When I rose up and saw the bigger picture of the systematic failure of culture and religion, denying women power, I felt better. The thought of any one man failing me pained my soul. But looking back from 2021, I can at times lift to a higher vibration and love unconditionally. The protective concepts in my list of keys were a plan that defined the ultimate feminist ploy. The notion that women uniting to deny men climaxes and refuse to participate in sexual unions without love was divinely funny. Even the word porn made me laugh. When I read it I understood it to mean: “Nation ouR Orgasm Plan.” Reading forwards that orgasm plan for America was “porn”, which usually isolates people, which contrasted nicely with the notion that a love plan for orgasms could work. The associations were bright and vibrant in my mind. The connections taking place were crystal clear to me, although looking back, my friends, family, and medical providers struggle to follow my ability to associate so flexibly. The looseness of my thinking allowed me to make associations, find irony, and discover humor where nobody in their right mind would find anything. It kept my experience lighter than I’d ever known when confronted with a mental health crisis. I believed it was a game with our higher power playing with my reality. One of my favorite words was Durga, which when I read backwards, it meant “American God, Are You Delusional?” Durga clearly was a Hindu Goddess. Later that night I walked Buddy, strolling slowly on the sidewalk along Ocean Parkway. Buddy liked to stop at every tree, hydrant, and corner to sniff and mark the objects. When he lingered his face at the base of a puddle of possible markings from another dog, I’d gently nudge him on. “Don’t lick that, Buddy.” I said. Buddy loved to lick everything. I’d seen where his tongue had been. It made me uncomfortable at the thought of him licking my feet. I experienced time distortion where I thought I was only gone for our typical half hour walk. When I walked in the door Jamie said it was two hours, and she was just about to call me. When she explained the length of my absence, I tried to retrace my steps and think about how long it should have taken. Buddy and I must have been moving slowly, I thought. Exhausted, I kicked off my shoes and laid down. Still unable to sleep my mind continued with its progressive thinking. The music played on my phone, and I read stories. I wondered if I’d been taken through the veil and kissed by God. When I looked at the star charts, everything looked to be the reverse of reality as I knew it. I began to imagine that I’d slipped to the other side of the galaxy across the Milky Way. Thinking I was in a mirror reality helped to explain my experiences. I was still in the grips of a Mandela effect, where everything was similar, but different from how I remembered it should be. I’d began to see the veil, a lapse of darkness that caused time to be distorted, and I felt surrounded by spirit animals like pigeons, starlings, finches, flies, parrots, cats, and dogs in my neighborhood. When I came home that night, I worried about the threat of an atomic war, I prayed for peace. I was told that my next task was walking all the world leaders into the Light to protect the world from harm. I focused on Kim Jong Un first. I lured him towards the Light with the promise of the honey of my love. When things became dark, I turned on my dental lamp and he laughed and came into the Light. I repeated my task with Putin. Using the dental lamp when it became darker than I liked. I was worried that I hadn’t done a good enough job, then I checked my email. Apple iTunes sent me a password reset from two days in the future. That reassured me that the future still existed. When I laid in bed again, my thoughts took me low. I surrendered to my experience. I felt hopeless against the power of the perversion of my psychosis and inability to sleep. I understood that the realm of higher power is in command orchestrating every moment in the dynamic dramatic program called life. In the morning, Jamie opened my bedroom door. She poked her head between the door and the frame with the hall light shining behind her. It was early Saturday morning. “Mom, I’m going to the barn soon, but I don’t feel good.” She said. She talked to me, but I had a hard time hearing her. I had just explained with my thoughts that I wasn’t afraid if they chose to take me. They’d told me that I belonged home in heaven. That is when I began to see the Light in the upper left corner of my vision. I refused to look at it though. I chose to focus on Jamie. I need to stay for Jamie. She needs me. The thought was firm in my mind. “Ok?” Jamie asked. “Sure,” I said, not sure what I was agreeing to. Jamie turned and then came back carrying my small black hand bag. She explained again that she needed money to go to the convenience store for lunch with the volunteers at the barn. I pulled out a twenty and gave it to her. “Text me when you get there, and when you leave. Please be home by sunset,” I said. “Love you, see you later,” She said and closed and locked the front door. By Sunday, I wanted to get out of bed. I felt disoriented, even though I was eating well, the sleep deprivation was taking a toll. I’d ordered plenty of food and water online for delivery. I was able to cook healthy food for me and Jamie. But Jamie’s mood was grouchy. “I think I’m sick, look at my throat.” She said and opened wide handing me her L.E.D. flashlight. “Honey, it looks a little red, but I don’t know if that means you are sick. Maybe we should go to a doctor. You seem irritable.” I said. Reading the signs, when Buddy lifted his right paw, I interpreted that we needed to take her to get an exam. We’d been to a walk-in clinic in park slope before. I put on a nice yellow dress, flats, and a light weight jacket. Jamie’s terrible mood showed as she whined and yelled about everything. She was hungry but refused any food I offered her. Thankfully, Durga was there to help. Jamie got stuck in her pants. It was as if Durga had cast a spell to make the pants impossible to pull up. “Help me get my pants on,” Jamie demanded. I went to the couch to help her. Both Jamie and I struggled and laughed as we attempted to pull up the jeggings. It really was an impossible feat. By the time we were laughing hard, the struggle ended. When we got outside, it was a beautiful and sunny fall day. Jamie put the park slope address into the phone. A driver with a Russian accent picked us up, but the app on the phone took us to a Bay Ridge location. With everything I was experiencing I just went with the experience. I didn’t try to get to park slope. I figured we were taken to Bay Ridge because the signs said the eye was delusional and God’s energy needed to protect me and Jamie. I was worried that Jamie was God’s child. I was concerned that Jamie would be harmed by those who were in power, or worse that Jack would intervene if I failed to address her needs adequately. We arrived at the clinic shortly after 9:00 am. The email receipt said the charges were made by EZ-Car, but I thought I’d used my UBER app. Ignoring the strangeness, Jamie and I signed in. I shared her insurance information and we were quickly called into the exam room. Jamie sat up on the exam chair. The attendant had a nice yellow aura and wore a hijab. I started to realize that we shared a love for God. My God was her God. When the physician’s assistant came in he was glowing in Light. It was quite amazing. I’d never seen such a glow. Even when I chose Jamie over the Light the day before, she and the Light had glowed half as much. I was unsure what to think of the Light surrounding him. They recommended a variety of allergy medications, antihistamines, and even antibiotics if her condition didn’t improve. They suggested seeing an allergist to help with understanding her condition and getting the right care long term. When we left the CityMD we walked to a pharmacy around the corner to purchase over-the-counter remedies. Then Jamie was hungry and wanted Starbucks. She typed into her phone and found one a short walk away. We sat inside and ate hot sandwiches and sipped on iced tea. On the way home, Jamie talked for a bit as she read the labels of her medications to me. I looked out the window and read the graffiti. The Brooklyn Queens Expressway seemed to be further inland than I remembered it being. It was a strange ride home. The landmarks I knew were missing from the Brooklyn Skyline. The only landmark I could identify in the distance was the Freedom Tower. Everything else seemed to point a Pisa Dynasty. I figured the lack of sleep had taken its toll, and I must have misunderstood my surroundings. Once we were home, Jamie decided she was too sick for a party at a friend’s so she stayed home that day. I cooked pasta and chicken with ground sage for dinner. I couldn’t find any other spices. By the time Monday came, I knew I had to tell my family what I was experiencing. That morning while I walked Buddy, the signs written in the cement on the sidewalk were reinforcing what I read from MDs office. The message said that Jamie was God’s child. They’d taken a throat culture to send out to the lab. When I thought paternity tests had to be blood based, a message appeared on my phone. The message when I read it both ways said He was family. The sidewalk in front of the Jewish Center had a single letter “C” etched when I looked down. When I read the sign to see, it hit me hard that God told me so. I called my sister, Chloe, a little before 6 am her time. I choked on my tears as I explained about falling in love with the King of Heaven, and telling how the Hindu Goddess Durga was helping Jamie and me. My Mom, Dad, Sister, and Brother, each called each other to plan how best to help. I needed medical attention. Chloe called my psychiatrist to notify her that I wasn’t well. A new prescription was called into the pharmacy along with a refill that my brother would bring to me that night to add another medication that I’d been well with for years before that I’d stopped because of the side effect, and I’d refill the prescription that I had been switched to. My sister-in-law came over that afternoon to be with me. When she saw the kitchen she immediately stepped into action. My nephews played in Jamie’s room, we put Buddy away in my bedroom, and in something of a daze, I spent some time at my computer reading the news as physical sensations began to take over my body. Sensations were rolling over me in waves moving from one area to the next transiently. After I had made calls to all the family members, I must have saved a sewing machine that Jamie wanted in my list of purchases to make. I also must have moved the radio from the kitchen to the dining room table that night. The next morning when I got out of bed to get breakfast for Jamie, I asked her how the radio ended up on the dining room table. “You put it there last night, don’t you remember? You were talking about how much you like to listen to music out here.” She said. I couldn’t remember having gotten up from bed the night before, but I trusted Jamie’s memory over my own. Either I’d blacked out on my memory, or Durga was helping me again. I looked for a message in the sign from the radio, but I couldn’t understand. When I realized I’d become too sick, I knew I could not go into work in the condition I was in. I sent an email to my department leader asking for coverage for my shifts in clinic. Chloe scheduled the next flight from LA the next day, Wednesday, September 20th. She arrived at noon. I took both my medications that night. And got the first few hours of sleep I’d had in days. Thursday morning Chloe took over getting Jamie ready for school, making breakfast and walking Jamie to the train. After I walked Buddy that morning we sat and she helped plan the schedule of doctor’s appointments. That afternoon I had a physician’s appointment in Manhattan. They called to say that my insurance company said my usual physician was not listed as the primary care provider on my insurance. I called to straighten out the provider information with the insurer. For some reason they had changed the provider. I called the office of the physician who was listed and the office was closed that week, so I figured the error was not mine. I couldn’t remember making the change or scheduling any appointments with this other person. We kept the appointment with my doctor I’d seen for the past seven years. After we made the calls I got a text from the CVS pharmacy near my home that a prescription for Jamie had been filled for antibiotics for her sinus infection. We picked up the medicine on the way to the train, and because Jamie was still feeling ill, decided to pick her up from school so that she could take her medicine. We decided we’d be gone for too long to let Jamie stay home alone, so we had to take her with us on our trip. We’d need to go into Manhattan to my appointment. I’d also received a notice that the new laptop I’d ordered had arrived at the Bookstore. I let Jamie use this device sometimes. A few weeks before one of my devices stopped working. I’d sent it into Apple and they’d determined liquid had been spilled on the keyboard making it short out. When I got to the store, I struggled to find the email to pick up the computer. I’d given up on finding the proof in my email that the order had shipped. Chloe had helped find the threaded email lost in a list of old emails due to google yahoo issues. Once they found my invoice and brought out the computer, we left the store. We walked down Broadway, I was reading signs everywhere in my surroundings. When I looked at the back of a Benz, the tag said “RIZE”. I thought God was saying I needed to lift my spirits. “Energy Sleep. I. R.” I read that he commanded the extra energy to sleep and reassured me of His presence. When we rounded the corner to the nearest coffee shop, with a sticker over the In Living Stereo sign, it was aptly named “Dark Star” Coffee. I thought it was funny considering the darkness of my mood at believing God was the only thing that loved me. I also found humor to the name In Living Stereo, considering how the signs were found not only in visual cues from words, but also found in music this time. I tried to order tea, but chose a bubbly water instead. The glass walls surrounded a man at a broad desk inside the music store. It created a fish bowl effect for the man working at in living stereo. We climbed the stairs to the loft and started to recollect ourselves after the challenge of finding the email in the computer store. Jamie had made a point to remind Chloe “You’re not as cool as you think you are, you know that, right?” Jamie said when Chloe tried to get selfies with her. I stared at the pictures hanging on the walls, a picture of the cow made me smile. I thought it meant God was telling me See Orgasm Woman. I thought the picture of the cow was proof of my experience being real. Jamie and Cloe looked through our purchases. The wooden stools were comfortable enough and I liked the music on the stereo. After we’d felt done sitting we went to walk further down Broadway, but our group wasn’t feeling well, so we decided to take a car downtown. We sat near a statue of balloons by CUNY in lower Manhattan. Jamie was irritable and wanted some hot tea, so we found a starbucks, and headed to my physician’s office. At the office Chloe explained to my physician that she was there because I was sick again. And that my psychiatrist wanted to rule out a physical reason. They took my vitals and gave an EKG to check my heart. I’d shared my list of physical symptoms I’d been experiencing. Everything looked normal. Then the nurse came in to draw blood. During the blood draw, I lost consciousness. I felt like I was in an altered state. When I looked down at the needle, I worried I was transforming into something where my blood was inaccessible. She was not able to withdraw a sufficient quantity for analysis. They laid me back to recover. In the visit notes the physician said it was over an hour, but it felt like much less time. My perception of time varied from reality. We took a car home from the appointment, and when we got to our door, a package was waiting. Jamie’s singer sewing machine that I accidently purchased had arrived. It was a great distraction from everything I was experiencing. Jamie and Chloe spent all evening trying to set it up. They finally asked me to help when they couldn’t get the needle and bobbin threaded. I found the automated threading button, but put the bobbin on backwards. They figured the rest out as I went back to resting. That night I went to flush the toilet and the handle to flush the toilet fell apart. Annoyed, I lifted the lid on the back of the toilet, and looked at the apparatus. I realized the handle linked to a chain that lifted a rubber stopper to flush the toilet. I pulled up the chain and the toilet flushed. I explained how to flush the toilet to Jamie and Chloe and we laughed. “Sorry, but you’ll all have to pull your own chain,” I said. “Ewe, that sounds gross.” Jamie said. “At least it’s safe in the clean part of the toilet. It just feels cold when you reach in the tank.” I said. Chloe started to make a list of all the issues going on in the apartment for Erik to address. She called him up and suggested he bring any tools he would need to repair the refrigerator’s insulating trim that had detached from the door, and fell off everytime you opened the refrigerator. He’d need to purchase a new toilet handle at the hardware store, and we needed him to bring a ladder to replace Light bulbs. Once Erik finished with his chores I asked him to push one of the carts filled with our bagged laundry to Laundry Mania. I set out with the first cart about 5 minutes before him, but I’d run out of cigarettes. I decided to cross to the Ocean Mini Mart to buy a new pack. When I arrived half of the employees had red marks on their foreheads, the other half didn’t. When I got to the counter, everyone had red dots on their foreheads. I’d been their customer for years, and I’d only seen it on their foreheads a few times. “Is it a holiday today?” I asked gesturing at my forehead. “No, I wear this every day,” The cashier said. “What does it mean?” I asked. “It is for my God,” He said shyly and when I asked what the God’s name was, he said the name which I typed into my google app as soon as I left the store. Something like SamSara. The website that I landed on explained it was the god of duality and illusions. When Erik looked up my browser history later in the month, everything in the browser history had been wiped clean. I couldn’t find the right God when I went back to look for the source of this knowledge. One man was blowing up a black number 3 balloon. At first, I wondered who would buy a three year old child a black balloon, then I realized there must be a zero missing for a thirty year old’s birthday. At that moment my vision went to black. When I recovered my sight there were no balloons being inflated. I stood in front of the counter with my twenty dollar bill in hand to give the cashier without a red dot on his forehead. Perplexed by what had just happened, I pushed my cart back towards Ocean Parkway stopping briefly to light a cigarette and search for the name of the “god of duality” samsarah, when Erik called my phone. “Where are you?” He asked. “I just stopped at the Ocean Mini Mart for cigarettes. I’m on my way.” I said. He was already at Laundry Mania waiting for me. It was a ten-minute walk to the laundry mat. I’d set out five minutes before Erik. How had I lost at least 10 minutes? When I added the lost time to the fragments of memory of seeing the black balloon inflated, having my vision flash to black, then having there be no balloons in sight, and no red dots on foreheads, I was confused. I couldn’t find the right God when I went back to look for the source of this knowledge. Chloe’s favorite pants disappeared in the laundry. She looked everywhere for them, but they weren’t there. I explained that when they were found I’d ask mom, who was coming to visit next, to ship them back to her. I had experience with things going missing. They were always returned, but on their own timeline. Chloe flew home at the end of the weekend to be available to work in LA. On Monday I visited my psychiatrist, and we talked about everything. I showed her the key I’d been using to keep my experience light and funny. She said it was a classic symptom of Mania to create a key. She wanted to add another medication that should be soothing and help with sleep. I still wasn’t sleeping well. She offered for me to be hospitalized. I wanted to continue to recover in my home, with my existing support system in place. My team of family and friends had circled the wagons to provide support and help. I’d spent years cultivating relationships that were prepared to take on the task of being there in the short term and long term to 1. Listen, 2. Dad would facetime to observe medication compliance, 3. Help in little ways by picking up the phone and being present for Jamie and me. The thought of going to the hospital when I already had a support system, would have done more harm than good at this stage in my progression into illness. I was not a threat to myself or others, and leaving my home, my daughter, the dog, and not having access to technology to pay bills and take care of my life would create more issues than it would solve. I explained that my current support system could function through this event in my home. We talked and discussed other options. Alternatively, I suggested if I didn’t improve, I would consider a residential care setting. It would probably be a better fit than a hospital for me, if I got worse. Dr. Bouley prescribed the maximum dose of Depakote, and I headed back to Brooklyn.

Healthy Communities Green Sustainable Equality Peace Light years to go. 12/2/17 I thought the feelings were getting better. Then last night was hard again. 1. I just can’t rid myself of this affliction. I’ve tried everything to forget the memory of the physician’s touch and his presence in my sacred space. 2. Running from it. Makes me cry. Makes me feel like a monster. Like I’ll never deserve to be loved in this life. 3. Running into it. Brings it back front and center. Reminds me that my love for the physician is delusional. He never loved #metoo. 4. Praying to God. Believing in love from my higher power just makes me want to escape this reality, and be with God. Then I start to feel like, no man will ever compare to God’s love. Why bother dating? Why am I even here? Then I think of Jamie. She needs me. 5. Blaming the physician for stupidity – makes me feel bad. It makes things feel very dark for me. I don’t like to blame the physician for touching me during the exam. He was too young, my clit was too swollen, and it was my mind that was broken. 6. Distracting myself real men. I have yet to meet a man capable of loving enough to help me heal my soul from the physician’s touch. 7. Playing with power exchanges, trying to heal from the physician violating my sacred space has made me feel very dark and hopeless. Although, fun in the moment at times. 8. Writing about my feelings helps me to better understand my emotions, it creates a salve for me to ease my psychological pain from the trauma of my experience of not being loved after the physician entered my sacred space. 9. The greatest psychological harm was caused by treatment where we were forced to act as if we weren’t both humans and like there was some construct that separates us clinically after I was touched in my sacred space. 10. After he touched me in my sacred space, I needed to be treated like a human being after the physician’s exam tapped my desire. It left me isolated with zero way to resolve my conflict between reality and delusional love with the physician and therefore the Hospital. 11. I understand the need for rigid boundaries in hierarchal healing relationships, but I’ve never been given the ability to resolve my emotional conflict with the physician and being trapped by desire the way I was. 12. I want to heal, and I felt so much trauma from my experience, I’m not sure how to move on and remain intact, with my heart full. In 2005 I experienced medical trauma at the birth of my daughter. I’m past the initial stages of my trauma, I’m out of the marriage where I felt vulnerable and unsupported. I live in recovery with a diagnosis of mental illness, and live in acceptance of my condition of mental illness, but medication has not healed my soul. The problem was that I felt trapped by the traumatic experience, and emotionally unable to resolve my conflict with the physician over my experience alone and in isolation. My therapists didn’t have the understanding to help me critically reflect on the issue from multiple perspectives. A supportive dialogue would have helped me so much. I feel like I was stuck in the plot of a terrible romance where bad communication drives the plot development. It was a misunderstanding. He never talked to me like a human, because our #healthcare model forbids it. The story should have ended years ago with good communication and conflict resolution. Instead it has festered. I’m tired of crying about it. I want a process to help me move on with my life and escape this the trap. I like to think of myself as emotionally able to adapt. Instead, I was treated with silence about my emotional health and wellbeing, because that is what the system deems appropriate. There are two roles: Doctor and patient, and moving beyond that into critical reflection is forbidden. There is no process to deal with a situation like mine. I need a process. The medical system failed me when I was assigned the role of patient, where some construct separates us as “Doctor” and “patient”. I’m a human. I want conflict resolution, critical reflection with experts, and the ability to have dialogue to move on. I want to understand, and move on. At this point, I want a process where a team of concerned experts gather to discuss this long lasting trauma with the hopeful outcome of helping me get out of this trap. It’s 2017, almost thirteen years after my experience, and I still struggle with feeling trapped by my memory. I needed to talk about my perceptions, and have the people who were involved share their perspectives without the fear of litigation. I want a process where I can understand what happened by hearing the medical perspective, and juxtapose that with my emotional response to the memory. Instead, my perspective was silenced by the Hospital’s legal team. Being treated clinically as I entered motherhood emotionally devastated me in my postpartum. To not have my identity including my sexual response to the physician’s examination, the lack of acknowledgement of how it impacted my mental health and wellbeing, the lack of support of the medical system in my healing journey from my perception. Real or perceived, I’m beyond the medical model. I want to heal my soul, and there is no process available to heal from a system error. My emotional health and wellbeing were compromised by the physician entering my sacred space. The system needs a process to learn from these types of events. I also do not wish to harm the physician and his family. And wish for peace physically, spiritually, and psychologically. I needed to understand what happened, including my desire that left me trapped in the memory. We are at such a strange time in history. The #metoo movement must look to reform the process and ethics that guide us as a society. The only way to do this is to develop a process of critical reflection, where two individuals either directly or indirectly work with a panel of experts to deconstruct the situation where a medical error, or medical trauma occurred. I understand the need for rigid boundaries in a hierarchal healing relationship. I’ve given up on the idea that a simple apology will help my cause, and I already know that it didn’t help having him telling me my behavior was inappropriate and should stop. I wanted to be touched by someone who loved me, and I’m not sure that I’ll ever be able to move forward to find that until I resolve my emotional conflict with the physician, and not feeling loved after his touch. My ability to protect my sacred space was taken from me by the system when I was made a patient. Every other man who’d touched my sacred space always had a consensual relationship with me. I understand, logically that he didn’t love me, but emotionally, I needed a dialogue, some process to inform my emotions and escape from the memory. I’ve forgiven myself for getting sick, and forgiven the memory of the physician’s abuse, but I’m still haunted by my desire for him in my sacred space. Maybe it is erotomania, but I’m mostly normal in that if we had been able to have a honest discussion (directly or through a process) where he expressed his perspective and reflected on what happened from his point of view, either directly or through mediation with experts in communication with him, I’d be able to resolve this affliction. Relationships are my greatest strength in my recovery from mental illness. Why is communication forbidden regarding my perceptions from the birth. I broke in response to his touch, and I don’t want to hurt any more. I want to heal. When I was a kid, my parents learned that if they didn’t want me to do something, punishment never worked. If they wanted me to change my behavior they needed to explain why they didn’t want me to do something. I need to understand why it happened, and why he doesn’t, won’t and can’t love me. I understand that it is against medical ethics and all, but the harm this situation caused me is undeniable. I want to stop hurting. I want out of this trap. Communication through a process with healthcare reform and improving the medical malpractice laws are my only hope to freeing my soul from this trap. My friends and family have explained that he can’t love me repeatedly, so I understand cognitively, but emotionally, until there is communication through a process of critical reflection, I don’t understand what happened, and/or why it happened. I’m stuck. I’m still broken over a decade later. I know there can’t be anything beyond this process for resolution, and I’ve accepted that. I mean, when I’m honest with myself, I feel too much pain and trauma from this unresolved conflict to form any loving relationship with a man after what I felt in response to the memory of the physician’s touch, and being silenced by the Hospital’s legal team. --- Another 4 years later, 2021, I feel that I'm starting to rise to a new place of being with my story. I know I get sick, but I don't always sink into sadness. About half the time I can lift my energy and connect to the source and ground. I feel such love from the universe when I am able to do this. I just want to love and be loved. \"I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -Sunnyg", "hash": "162d8f7dd8f3b3e3d0e5c007575cb0af23e51e612be6e31daa2a39f394ccfe35"}

I remember standing in my kitchen one Saturday afternoon and realized, I’ll never get sober alone. I had the insight that I needed social support. If I stayed alone, I wouldn’t have the strength to abstain on my own. In recovery, I've learned it requires myself to be stronger than I like. Through finding other people who are doing the work and willing to lend support to my program, and through working these steps I’m beginning to reliably stay a little bit better emotionally, physically, and spiritually. Plus, by not drinking I don’t nearly drown in the self-pity of my experience. The principles of the 12-steps require that I’m well to do the work – in my humble opinion I don’t think I can do it when I’m unwell. It is too messy to try the steps while I’m sick. Mental health recovery needs a strengths-based program. Recovery from alcohol and addiction focuses the light on the shadows. Must be well to do this. I’ve been feeling healthier again so started to read more. The program is basically a set of spiritual steps that work as a type of metaphysical instrument to extract oneself from the depths of despair. In my experience, I’m predictably experiencing relief when I actively work through the program. What I’m finding to be true is that – There is no magic in recovery. We get what we work for. In the first 111 days, I’ve attended over 133 meetings. I’d heard that to aim for 90 in 90 days may help, I found that through learning from the program, I felt something I’d been searching for a way to see my own role in the trauma. A way to appreciate how my character defect escalated what might have been a problematic incident with the physician at the birth, but for most people would not have resulted in the personal devastation and total annihilation of self. The devastating tsunami wave of pain and misery knocked me out for a very long time. I’m not claiming that this method is perfect, I have a long way to go, but it is the beginning point for a new start of my spiritual healing journey. \"I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -Sunnyg", "hash": "109e41a728f10cbd4ff2872da08255ac2895569ace1c085d73b5e9078961267c"}

I go outside and look up at the sky and see things that used to be clouds but are now streaks across the sky. What are they teaching kids in school what clouds are now? I saw the sun screwed in like a lightbulb. It hasn't snowed and it is December. A lot of TV channels look fake now. Extra words and crap sometimes from my thoughts are in TV shows. God or whatever literally through my tv told me that life is about progression otherwise I might as well not be here. I was fine working and watching TV. There is a telepathic something on my forehead which I don't really want to use or care much about because it seems to be connected to highly manipulative dicks. This similar issue happened to me last year but I kind of ignored it. Now there are just way to many syncronicieteies in my life for it to be just a coincidence anymore. My TV and radio has a lot of harassment on it. Whatever it is likes to talk through stories and analologies and raidio. Some days I wish the whatever it is would just take me out of Time already like it did before and either put me back to 2020 or just that's it. If the world ended why the F am I still here? I now seem to live in a simulated reality or a highly manipulated one. It only took a short while for me to learn the government isn't really what I once thought it was nor are creation stories. I might get it to keep a good job I have because there is still money and I have a body and my whole life was taught to eat sleep take care of responsibilities etc but now don't know what its for really.

I hope you find the support you seek here, and I hope you feel better. I've found help through talking with a psychiatrist, treatment, and growing healthy coping skills. Granted it doesn't cure my illness, and my core trauma haunts me. When I'm not feeling well, I avoid tv, and other recorded programs because they are programming, and not helpful when dealing with illness. What helps is human connection, having conversations, talking. There are warm ear lines and NAMI has support groups, many communities have clubhouses, too. These are healthy options to pursue. I too work. Best wishes with getting the care you need! National Alliance on Mental Illness has a great booklet called Navigating a Mental Health Crisis. You can search for it on your browser, and it will help you find care in your community. Peace and hope you feel better soon - and find the care you deserve!

You have my heartfelt sympathies for what you are going through. It’s so perplexing. You have done nothing to warrant his suspicions and accusations. Whatever you do, don’t ever take a lie detector test, or go to a mental health evaluation yourself. None of that will prove to your husband that you aren’t cheating on him. I’m husband has had the same behavior. At times it has been bad and at times it has gone away. He also had other odd beliefs: that his ex-wife was alive and following him (she died in 2006). After he went through chemo, his thought processes really took a hit. I don’t know if it was the stress of the cancer and chemo or the depression due to his changed condition or the chemo itself, but it got pretty bad. He started taking testosterone shots due to ED and this caused his jealousy and accusations to really escalate. Every time I left the house for an errand, to get my hair done or have lunch with my girlfriends, he thought I was meeting this guy and having sex with him. Life got pretty bad. Eventually we realized the T shots were a huge problem. After he stopped them his delusional behavior lessened dramatically. I don’t think it’s gone away completely. Is your husband on any medication that could be causing this? Keep trying to trouble shoot this!", "hash": "59409186b796fb88e8fad217f500da92788ee40fbbd1cba9984c5eabcad532f0"}

I told him I was tired of denying bs statements that were not real, and I’m done doing that. If he wants to text that guy, we’ll he should just do it. I just kept brushing off the horses and he kept coming out of the houses to yell at me. He was really unhinged. This is so sad.

I told him that since I’d been on a diet, I haven’t even been cooking for him, and it looked like he remembered that was correct. Day before yesterday I again told him that his brain was playing tricks on him, and that he really needed help. He just yelled “you always want me to think that, but I know what’s going on.” So, I wrote a letter to his oncologist, a doctor he likes and trusts. I told him what has been going on, and frankly it’s been much worse since the chemo he had in 2018. Last year he was supposed to get an MRI of the brain because I asked him to please tell this doctor about his increased anger episodes. He did, and the doc ordered the MRI. But, because my husband’s allergies were so bad, he was unable to lie down and get it done. He tried twice. I asked the doctor to please make a neurological referral if he felt it was appropriate, and to please try to get that brain MRI done. I’m starting to suspect the onset of dementia or something like it, or frontotemporal deterioration, or something similar. But a neurological evaluation could only help at this point.

We actually had a few good days, and my husband talked about how the chemo he had possibly could have changed his behavior. He said it would be a good idea to get an evaluation, and asked that I call and schedule. And that call was on my agenda today, before everything blew up. We had finished working outside, and I had told him I was going to get some weed killer to spray the weeds along the edges of the pasture we just baled. He said he didn’t want me to do that (he has reasons but they don’t make sense, so I won’t add to the story). Later in the house, he accused me of always being against him because I wanted to spray the weeds. He started yelling and accusing. It’s like some little seed starts in him and blossoms way out of proportion. I said “well, here we go” and grabbed my purse and took off to town. He immediately texted that he knew I was going to meet that poor guy, and his other usual hateful stuff. I went into town, did some errands, and had a lovely time shopping at Home Depot for a few things. I got home and headed back to my home office. About an hour later he barged in, yelling, accusing, demanding that we get a divorce. He hates me, despises me and how could I be such a slut as to have sex with XXXXX. I told him to get out. He kept screaming that he wants 50% of everything and he means 50%!! He kept screaming and yelling through the door. It was a little scary. So I spent the next 2 hours downloading the divorce forms and filling them out. They are ready to file in the District Court tomorrow. I’m not sure where I will go but I have to find a place, have to get this house sold, sell the horses and cattle, and all the equipment.", "hash": "4cdb83f8da56ad9956c2d0aa613f2aed703ae3592077dbe412b7cb2617c06db8"}

But I didn’t. I came back home, worked on the painting in my home office, cleaned out some closets for Goodwill and straightened up my bedroom and my office. Lots of work! I also looked at the financial implications of a divorce. We are fairly well off right now, with a farm and a house that’s close to paid off. If we were to divorce, sell the equipment for probably half what it’s worth, sell the cattle and horses, we would definitely have cash, but not enough for either of us to buy a place nearly as nice as this farm. I have money of my own that I inherited, and he has no separate assets. Just thinking of selling all this and starting over is painful. So, what if I just stay? If he wants to get a divorce, then let him go do all the paperwork, or find a lawyer to do it, and get it all underway. This morning, I got up and went out to do some errands: Goodwill, Home Depot and Walmart. When I got home he was out and I had time to keep cleaning, and then work in the orchard. He came home and asked if I was going to get fertilizer for the fields. I said why are you talking to this disgusting slut? If you want fertilizer go get fertilizer. He said he had to work on the borders (we irrigate tomorrow). I said I don’t care, do whatever you want to do. He kept asking me to do it. I told him I wasn’t going to do anything for someone who calls me a disgusting slut. He kept saying he couldn’t do both, and the fields need fertilizer (true). So I said from now on, we are just business partners; you have your life and I have mine, and I got in the truck to go get the fertilizer. When I was done with all that, I was filling water troughs and he came to talk to me. I didn’t talk to him at all. He started ridiculing me and again said how he knew what I was doing, etc., etc., escalation again. He was now screaming that he wanted a divorce. I said fine, go get one. He went into the house and I went back to the orchard. I spent an hour there and went in the house and showered, and now I’m on the front porch cooking chicken fajitas on the grill. I think he’s cooking in the kitchen. The point is that I’ve discovered a new resilience and a thicker skin. His screaming insults now have no effect. I wonder how he will take that. I’m no longer trying to save a marriage. I’m trying to save a human being from himself. Still no contact from his doctor though. Oh well, I truly am doing what I can.

My wife had been experiencing some major paranoia since the 2020 election began, and she got caught up in the whole Q-Anon phenomenon. Since then she's had many delusions running through the whole Delusional Disorder spectrum (Grandiose, Jealous, Persecutory & Somatic). She's been in residential treatment twice (voluntarily) in the last two months, but each time she refuses treatment and medication. She thinks I am an enemy of the state and wants me to leave the house and leave my kids with her. Each day we are all walking on eggshells. It is obvious she's trying very hard to hide her symptoms and I am hurting because I can only imagine what's going on in her head, as are my kids.

It's not that she is violent or having any obvious delusions that we know of, she's just living as if I weren't there. For example, she just throws my clean laundry in a pile, makes everyone else's dinner plates but not mine; not that I care but we used to do these things for each other and I still do. She contradicts everything I say to the kids even if it's not in their best interest, just to make me look like I am in the wrong; the kids can see through it and even question her about it. She just has nothing for me and it's hard not to take it personal, I know its the illness and she's probably dealing with what Dr. Xavier Amador calls anosognosia (the inability to realize you're sick). Every time I talk to the kids she stops and makes sure she can hear what I say, she believes I am turning them against her. She still wants me to leave the marriage, believing she will get full custody of the kids because I am at fault and I'm causing this mental anguish she is experiencing. This too is really affecting the kids. I have them in counseling but I don't know where to draw the line before I remove them from the situation because she is refusing treatment and wants to take the holistic, naturopathic route without the us of medicine. Everything I read says that this route doesn't work for Delusional Disorders.

Ordinarily threads like this might be posted in Significant Others, but a lot do go ahead and get approved for here, since it seems so few people (we do have a few) with the disorder actually are aware enough (or possible just honest enough with themselves) to post here. Well it sounds as if she's found a new twist on the Silent Treatment, hasn't she? Despite my avatar, I'm bio male, and I been on the wrong end of that before- I sympathise. But ofc the big difference here is that it goes far beyond thinking your spouse is in the wrong. And she's caught up in political mess. We're not allowed to talk about politics directly, in PF- but as an accessory to what's going on, it's going to be next to impossible to not talk some about it. No matter which side of the political divide she's on, if she got caught up in that Q-anon stuff, well, my sympathies. I can well imagine- either on the one hand, you're hanging onto false hope from Q about how the damn cavalry is just around the corner to save us and the arrests are going to start at any time- or you're on the other side convinced a bunch of racists are about to stage a violent coup. Both are, in my eyes, equally delusional. I had to quit looking at social media because I couldn't sit on my hands any longer and wanted to start hollering at folks to just shut the hell up already. So, you're an enemy of... whatever her version of Freedom is. I really don't know how you can win that battle- it's hard enough among people who don't have DD. I'm just a mod here- well sometimes I think I borderline on having some mild delusion because of my OCD (which can occasionally stray into territory that's a bit 'out there'). But most of the stories I've read in the forums from spouses of DD, it doesn't seem to go well. Sort of like dealing with some of the personality disorders- I'm thinking OCPD in particular- they're the ones who are right, everyone else is doing it wrong and that's all there is to it- I used to have some Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (which is definitely different than OCD, the two are sometimes confused by people) traits at work- it was we must do it my way, or the world was going to ######6 end . And when you're down in that, you can't see it. There's just little to no self-awareness of it. And it's like my OCD rituals that I've had sometimes, that border on outright delusion. It's like part of me knows this is bullcrap, but.... but but but.... but at the same time, it's real and I must act on what I think will prevent what I am convinced will happen if I don't. I have to drive to work a certain route. I even have to listen to the 'right' music. I have to think the 'right' thoughts. And calamity will ensue if I don't. And I can write with intellectual honesty about it all day long in forum, but I'll go right back to acting that way, only stopping it with effort. Because when you're caught up in it, it's awfully hard to get out of it- and this is from someone that merely flirts with delusion- as far as I know . I mean, I know I already tend to it- would I know if I was seriously delusional? By the very nature of it... no of course I wouldn't. So it's probably one of the most uphill battles I have observed significant others with, here in PF. It seems to be hell on steroids to get someone to where they will admit that just maybe it's not everyone else, but it's them, and seeing a professional and taking some meds really is in their best interest. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

You are very wise to have the kids receiving counseling. Talking with their counselor about whether to move them out of the environment is probably a good idea. It does look like your wife is trying to force you to leave by treating you so badly. For the last 2 years, my husband’s delusions have gotten worse. When it gets bad, I tell him that his brain is playing tricks with him, and that what he believes is not real. I printed out his ex-wife’s obit, to counter his belief that she was alive and following him. I printed out articles on Delusional Disorder and the contact info for our insurance’s behavioral health clinic. I have done this a few times. The last time, I found that he actually saved the printouts! I was very encouraged that he might be starting to believe I have a better grasp on reality than he does. But all this has come with angry words, yelling, extreme discomfort in the relationship and much emotional distress. I can’t imagine doing all this with children involved. A discussion with the kids’ counselor about how to have honest conversations with your wife, when the kids are likely to overhear, might help. Unless your wife gets help, your marriage may not survive. Consider speaking with an attorney so you know your legal options in this situation.", "hash": "a5aa1eec56a1289b18c89f2239f1160f3b0b98f205534e810cb1b2377520ba7d"}

A beautifully intoxicating home for every stray thought and hope and desire. A world that evolves and solidifies with every visit until I’m falling in love with my crush and the future I dream of. When the story threads dry up I create another world and another with different career paths, different friends, different locations but the same easy companionship and the same love. It isn’t long, however, before the dream world clashes with reality. I see her with a guy who couldn’t possibly be her boyfriend because he isn’t me, but of course I’m lying to myself and the dream world crashes down around me. With an extraordinary amount of resilience, the dream world picks itself up, dusts itself down and rebuilds itself. The foundations are now cracked but somehow I start to dream again, at least until the next reality check. I crash and burn over and over and the heartache is real. I’m losing my dream partner, after all. I leave college and try to put myself back together. Eventually, the heartache fades. I’d never had a mental illness before so I’m shaken that my reality was so distorted. I try to rationalize my experience and find a name for my episode, deClerambault’s Syndrome (DC). I discover all I can about my enemy, identify all the indicators and try to arm myself in case of further attacks (counterDC). Episode 2: I avoid any big DC encounters for years but my luck runs out with N. Some similarities with Ep 1. Crush that goes nowhere but hungrily devours my thoughts. DC is on one shoulder encouraging me whilst counterDC, on the other shoulder, is urging caution. DC distorts and counterDC over-corrects so it’s almost impossible to find my way to the true reality. Inevitably, I’m left broken and I promise myself that next time I start dreamweaving I’ll stay clear of possible dream partners so that I don’t feed my DC. Episode 3: Two years ago I see L for the fist time. I feel a strong attraction to her but no reciprocation. Second meeting is brief and uneventful. Third meeting is also brief but there’s some eye contact and it feels like something is brewing. Covid strikes and I don’t see much of her during the first lockdowns but then I start hearing her voice in my street. At the sound of L speaking my name DC wakes up from his long sleep and begins to weave his magic. The new dream-world begin to grow and deepen and demands more and more of my time. I should resist. I know where it’s taking me but its endless paths and possibilities are lighting my way through a dark lockdown. I lose myself to my dream L in my DC worlds. My dream-world has moved so far ahead of reality that the two worlds have started to jar, pushing me further and further down the rabbit hole. I hear L say she wants to spend the rest of her life with me and DC breaks free from his tether. He’s off. He’s flying like never before and he fills DC land with love and hope. Meanwhile counterDC is becoming increasingly uncomfortable. Something is off and it’s dawning on me that L’s affection for me is total and unconditional. She looks at me with pure uncontrolled adoration and I know now that she’s going through her own DC episode. She calls me the man of her dreams and this says it all. She’s lost in her own DC worlds and I’m sensing no grounding, no counterDC. I guess this is her first episode and her family and friends don’t know the warning indicators. They seem oblivious to her behaviour, to the signs that are obvious to me. I should reach out to them but I’m more ill than I’ve ever been before and in the back of my mind I’m aware that during an episode you can invert everything and believe that the person you’re infatuated with is in fact infatuated with you. Knowing this further destabilises my grasp of reality. My DC and counterDC have never been more polarized. They’re fully at war with each other and it’s ripping me apart. My avoidance strategy is no use here. She’s living almost next door to me. I hear her through every window and she always seems to be there when I go out. She tries to connect with me but her spoken messages never fully reach me. I’m left with fragments that are too easily distorted by either side in their war. I start sensing anger and some bitterness towards me. Maybe she expects me to meet her half way but her beautiful face is the face of my next breakdown. I’m in love with by DC L and she’s in love with her DC me and it’s clear to me how impossible this is. I can never compete with a dream. I can see that each failed message she tries to give me is tearing her apart and her pain, in turn, is tearing me apart. I know how hard it is to connect at this stage. You believe that your future and all your incredible dreams depend on this one moment and the pressure is unbearable. It’s taking its toll on L. Soon I hear that she’s moving out and a door in my dreams slams shut. She delays leaving, giving me hope, but eventually she packs up all my hopes and dreams and takes them with her when she leaves. So here I am, broken, full of pain and regret and deClerambault has beaten me again. I don’t know where L is and how her battle with DC is going and letting go of that is going to be the hardest part for me. I hope you’ll excuse such a long post but I felt that I needed to share it somewhere. I’d be grateful for any advice.

Up at 3 a.m. my husband did not catch the voice mail from the irrigation manager yesterday, saying we might not get to irrigate today. So he stressed about that and was angry “why didn’t he keep calling until he got a hold of me.” I just say “I don’t know” to most of what he asks. Why didn’t my husband actually check his phone during the day to see if the irrigation manger had any updates. Taking care of details just isn’t his thing. So we do actually have enough water to irrigate, and he gets started. Water going everywhere, and as usual he leaves it on WAY too long so we have a flood. As we were walking through the back cow pens, I point out that the water in the drain ditch looks like it;s going to overflow into the cow pen. I might as well have hit him. He blew up and said I was always criticizing him, etc. etc. the usual yelling and screaming. He left and went into the house and later to check the water. I finished my work outside and then left for town to do some errands. He texts me, saying “I bet I know where you’re going”. Implying I’m running off to have sex with Albert. It’s where his mind always goes. I feel sorry for poor Albert who has no idea my husband has this bizarre idea about him. Can someone please explain why he has a one-way thought process on this???? Frankly I am so turned off about sex because he’s focused on it, and he uses it as a weapon. We haven’t even tried to have sex in months. He does have ED and says he needs to fantasize to “encourage” him. I’ve told him I don’t want to hear all that crazy stuff, but what he does in his own head is his business. So I get home hours later and he acts like nothing’s wrong. I’m so done with this charade. Is this any way to live? I’m not really expecting an answer, just hoping that writing it down makes me feel better.", "hash": "2885cc684ef68d972a9ff6c20a28a6918b4aa5a383267466de3b934d7ad1e286"}

Occasionally someone will want to journal without people replying back to them. However, both the open-forum journals, and the blogs, are always moderated before being published- including replies.

We have a venting forum for people with the serious need to screed, but those are locked by the mod team and don't allow replies whatsoever- they're more of a one-off thing, rather than keeping a running stream of thought like a blog or journal post. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

He didn’t recognize a shirt in his closet and told me that I put it there either because of my infidelity and/or because I might be in a cult (neither is the case). He had a whole elaborate set of stories and connections to explain his paranoia. To note-he had episodes of psychosis and hospitalization in his early 20s, but never a formal SZ diagnosis. We’ve had two other episodes together- always stemming from him thinking I’m trying to give him signals that I am in a cult (a satanic one?). Otherwise the relationship was loving, communicative and strong. He is in his late 40s. He left the day of “the shirt,” saying that he needed to know whether he was going “crazy” again (he has limited insight into his early psychosis), or if being with me is the problem. He did talk about signs from god as well, and is retreating to religion very quickly. He communicates occasionally if I lead, and has so far been willing to deal with the legal/mortgage issues of our shared home, but he says he wants nothing to do with me. He hasn’t really expressed any concern for my well-being. He does not want to pursue therapy individually or together. He is almost unrecognizable when we talk-both in tone and just something different in his face and body language. He is still working, and his friends say he seems sad but ok. He has been vague about his reasons for leaving when they ask. My questions are: if he doesn’t want me around, at what point do I just give up and leave him alone? How do I process what happened without a formal diagnosis? Could I be wrong and he is just fine? Does DD really just come out of the blue like that? He seemed fine the day before, we were making plans for a vacation. Is there anything else I can do for him? Will he get worse? Is it ok to be angry?

I think unless someone wants to get help, it might be some time to see if it settles down? And as for being angry, I think that's only human. You understand it's an illness, but still, it's got to make a person angry. If you need to let some of that out, I'd suggest Significant Others, Family & Friends as a place to vent- and if you really, really need to vent, we have a Venting forum in the Off Topic section, I think it is. You have to also think about your mental well-being through this. As for it coming 'out of the blue', it isn't really. I mean if he's had a history of it. Perhaps you've been lucky that he went as long as he did. But then, things have been kind of rough on everyone for a little over a year, now. I'm OCD- I'm not DD (that I know of)- I know I get mighty close to delusional beliefs on occasion, and stress flares my OCD up sometimes. Has work been extra stressful for him, or anything else- as if 2020 hadn't been enough to drive half the planet mad. I think if I were in your shoes I'd contact him on a limited basis but unless you can involuntarily get him into some help, he's going to have to want it... maybe if you just be like fine we won't talk, he'll remember he had a relationship and start to miss it. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

If it was present all the time it would be easier to leave him. I guess it’s a little bit present all the time (believing he has an intuitive ability that lets him know what people are thinking, even with zero clues/facts). He quickly interprets the smallest of actions to mean something much greater. His jumps in reasoning don’t make sense. But there it is. Then, there are the really big delusions that pop up every year or so. The last one was a few years ago when he was sure his ex-wife was following him. She’s been dead since 2006 but I had not shared that with him when I learned it. He said she had been following him, and her State Police boyfriend was also following him and he had called the State Police complaining. At that time, I printed out the ex’s obituary, and some articles on Delusional Disorder. I told him his brain was playing tricks on him and recommended he call the Behavior Health clinic for our insurance. He kept insisting the ex was alive and didn’t believe the obit. I told him that his refusal to believe the obit is a classic sign of DD. After that, things calmed down but were very uncomfortable. Over the last year he has become convinced I’m having an affair with the guy that runs the local John Deere dealership! Albert. I don’t even care for the guy. But he’s convinced that every time I leave the house I must be sneaking away to have sex with him. Two days ago this really blew up. I had gone into town to meet my step-sister regarding my step-mom’s probate. He knew I had this meeting set up. When I got back home he started accusing me of seeing Albert again. I had had enough!!! I told him “all you think about is sex and Albert, sex and Albert! Well why don’t you just go have sex with him? You are mentally ill with your Delusions and I’m not going to pussy foot around them anymore. I’m going to call them out and shove them in your face every time you mention them!!! Ugly screaming after that. I went back in the house and again printed out articles on Delusional Disorder and the phone number for behavioral health. We slept in different rooms for a few days. I left those articles on his place at the table. Of course they disappeared, but this is how I’m going to handle this from now on. I’m going to mention his delusions every time he engages in them. I think he likes having delusions. Life is so much more exciting the way his brain interprets it. And if he doesn’t like me confronting him with the truth, oh well. It’s the only way I can stay married to him.", "hash": "e21d5714ee49df09f388ddbaed8b8c4df6a040ac1221be89151f33274ee394bb"}

I just need a way to effectively cope/handle these occasional bizarre delusions. If he know he’s going to get the “you need help” talk, along with printouts, every time he talks about these delusions, 3 things are likely to happen: 1. He actually goes and gets help (unlikely). 2. He stops telling me about his delusions (likely). 3. Maybe he will come to trust my assessment that his delusions are not real(possible). At least I feel better with this method. I’m being honest, I’m not encouraging his delusions. I think there is a volitional component to these delusions: he gets some kind of rush or thrill thinking about it. He has always wanted to do strange sex stuff with another man in the mix, and I think he gets excited imagining that I am having sex with another man. I don’t get it, it will never happen, and I’ve told him that repeatedly. But he’s stuck on the idea and this delusion feeds this fantasy.

By 'another man in the mix', are you willing to be slightly more specific? It's not out of salacious curiosity, it's that older men, I have noticed, sometimes want to play with the other team a bit, so to speak. I won't waste time expanding on that if that's not what you mean, but it's something to consider. And it's not... completely uncommon. Sixties is... getting on up there- I'm sliding towards 60 but not there yet. But I can understand now why a divorce would be rough. You don't think this could be something with an early onset, do you? My dad is around 80 and... not sure what he has, but he gets some pretty crazy ideas in his head. At times I've thought maybe Alzheimer's, or even late-onset schizophrenia- which is very uncommon I think, but does occasionally happen. How long has he had these delusions on and off? Just in the sixth decade? Before? The whole time you've been together? I'm OCD- Obsessive Compulsive Disorder- not as bad as some I can think of (on these forums) but has he a history of being prone to fears which lead to compulsive behaviors? OCD isn't all about like, germs or things being neat and orderly, in everyone- or even most- but people with OCD will have unreasonable fears. Which lead to compulsions to 'ward off' the feared thing, so to speak. I ask about a history of OCD style anxiety, because for some people with OCD, it can get uncomfortably close to delusion. I've... kinda flirted with delusion a time or two- it's very hard to unseat some beliefs I will get. Even though intellectually I understand it's irrational. Also sometimes OCD is a precursor to schizophrenia- but as that disorder usually hits in ones' twenties, that seems unlikely, here.

The delusions have been getting worse in the last few years. He also now has some OCD (hand wringing, fretting with no clear purpose or trigger). I have considered early onset dementia or Alzheimer’s due to this worsening in the last few years. In mid 2018 he was DX with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and had to go through chemo and a stem cell transplant. All that chemo did a number on him. He now has benign essential tremor of his hands, which he has never commented on but it’s obvious to me. Last year when he was having bursts of anger I asked him to tell that to his oncologist, and see if there was something going on his brain. The oncologist ordered an MRI. He tried twice to have it, but was unable to because his sinuses made it impossible to lay flat that long. After 2 tries he abandoned it. I do think he has something going on in his brain, which may or may not show up on MRI. I’ve asked him many times to “get this checked out” when he has outrageous anger or a delusion that’s really nuts. He won’t do it. Oh, and the sex thing? He’s always wanted a threesome, for whatever reason. He knows I’m not interested. He says he wants me to have sex with other men and he would watch. Sorry, not interested. Early in our marriage it was just irrational anger that was the problem, but I think it was based on delusions that he wouldn’t mention to me. In the last few years it’s worse. The anger comes and goes, as do the delusions. The delusions are worse, the OCD behaviors are present, he has trouble processing information at times unless he is really concentrating. I do think a mental decline is part of this. So until or unless he decides to get evaluated by a neurologist, get an MRI and have this professional evaluated, I am stuck with coping the best way I can. Thanks for listening.", "hash": "0592e163142afb49461c9f5c1f49b24146e5240499f804ce995e031582b6152b"}

Very busy day on the farm, irrigating for the first time this year. We irrigate out of canals from the river, and it’s always tough to know when you’ve put enough water on the fields, and to cut it off. Mid-morning, he asks me to get in the truck with him and run down to the ditch. I get in and heat is blasting from the vents. It’s already warm outside, and we should have had AC. I said, is the AC on? (because I had driven the truck last and probably had the heat on). He instantly blew up, saying I was always nagging him and didn’t I think he knew enough to turn on the AC. Screaming and yelling at me, calling me names as always. I opened the door, he stopped the truck and I got out. This must happen once a week. I went in the house and did some work on the computer. He comes stomping in to the office, asking me if I’m done helping him. I said I just had to get out of the truck. He told me he was going to check the water, then come back in the house and take me up to the ditch if we needed to adjust the valves. He left. I finished what I was doing, then walked all the way up to the ditch to be ready when he wanted to switch. After a half hour or so, he drove up on top of the ditch, and said he was turning one valve on all the way “here it comes!” He yelled. Then he drove over to shut the valve on the north 12 acre piece. I took all that to mean that I was to adjust the valve where I was, to route more of the water to the 7 acre piece, and less to the 3. So I did that. It looked like the 3 acre piece was about done, and the water already in the field would get to the end. Then he drove to where I was, screaming “what are you doing, that field isn’t done!!” Turn that water back in the 3 acres. He kept screaming ‘you never listen!” All you think about is having sex with Albert. So we are back to Albert again. I told him why don’t you have sex with Albert, you think about him so much. Then I turned around and walked all the way back to the house. Gathered up a few things, got in the car and went to town to do errands. Before I left, I put a note at his place on the table ‘GET HELP. YOU HAVE DELUSIONAL DISORDER. YOU ARE MENTALLY ILL’ i come back a few hours later and he has completely flooded the cow pens. I mean, the cows are searching for a dry place to stand. What a wreck. So that 3 acre piece wasn’t finished watering, huh? Oh, and the AC is not working in the truck. I don[t even care. He can get it fixed if he wants to. It will be a cold day in hell before I get back in that truck with him. *mod edit* Last edited by Snaga on Fri Apr 02, 2021 4:03 pm, edited 1 time in total.

She suggested that he have a full neurological work up, and go from there. Great advice, but difficult to accomplish. I tried to get it done within the context of his chemo treatment and aftermath, but he could not complete that MRI. During his delusional episodes, I admit that I get as loud and angry as he is behaving, and that’s not a good context for the “you need help” discussion. The one benefit of my reaction is that it has seriously reduced the frequency of his delusions. Leading me to believe there is at least a small volitional component. Either that, or the new consequence of his delusional behavior (me behaving angry, mean) is so distasteful to him that it modifies his behavior and he doesn’t mention his delusions. Regardless, if I am actually going to get him evaluated, I need to react more lovingly the next time this comes up. As far as my coping mechanisms, I used to just clam up or leave the house, which was effective for me escaping it, but did nothing to stop or reduce the delusions. It was no help to him either. My current method (yelling right back at him, angrily screaming you need help) has reduced the incidents, but still not really effective for an overall solution. Tomorrow we are irrigating the farm again. High stress leads to his delusional outbursts every time, so I need to be prepared. When it happens tomorrow, I will respond in a calm, direct manner, and try to lovingly tell him that he needs help.

He got really angry because we had to go out and sort off the two cows they wanted, and that meant he had to get up from the tv. Sorry buddy, but cow sales is part of what we do. So we are going back to the cow pens to get them, and he starts yelling”why did you tell them 9;30 was ok? It’s not!!” Well, they were already in the truck driving from 2 hours away, and I told him that. What was I supposed to do, tell them to go back to the house and wait a few hours?? Sure way to blow up a sale, and we do need sales for income. That answer didn’t sit well with him. We started sorting the cows, and cows will be cows. They don’t go where you want them to, and can be unpredictable. In the middle of this, when I am having trouble getting 2 out of a pen, he starts laughing at me and ridiculing me, not in a nice way. He was very very mean “you are so dumb, you are terrible at this” he says. I told him why can’t you be a partner in this, instead of being an adversary? He continues to laugh and ridicule. Then I told him I wish I had never married him because he had one goal in life: to make me miserable. Well that stopped the ridiculing and all conversation, but it was definitely an escalation of the conflict. So much for responding to him with love today. That was impossible. The buyers arrived, we did what had to be done (branding, etc.) while he continued to mutter at me under his breath when no one else could hear. Finally they were gone and we were back to the Cold War. He went to get the fertilizer to put on the fields while I had to take down some electric fence. He got the truck stuck, and rather than ask me for help, he walked ALL the way back to the yard, and got the tractor to pull his truck out. I asked “do you need any help?” And he did not reply. Fine.

But I always end up suffering a lot because of it, I cannot help but think they are watching me, judging me, I feel so vulnerable and ashamed, there's no escape for me, it got to the point of me making a plan on how I was gonna kill myself and when, in order to make this all stop. I need help, I kept this a secret, nobody knows about this. I've thinking about reaching out to my mother, but what if she doesn't react well, I still have to live with her (I'm a teenager). How can I tell her??? I'm not ready to tell my father yet, he's scary (to talk to about this stuff or any where you have a different opinion to his). (My parents are caring, I'm just terrified things will go wrong, example: they don't understand and freak out.) (I forgot to add something about my intrusive thoughts, religious intrusive thoughts, they are horrible, debilitating and make everything ×10 times worse) Thanks in advance to anybody who cares to answer.

Please check your PM inbox. Now then, I have approved this for delusional disorder, as you placed it- but I was interested by this: Hiddenrubbishi wrote: (I forgot to add something about my intrusive thoughts, religious intrusive thoughts, they are horrible, debilitating and make everything ×10 times worse) That sounds rather Obsessive-Compulsive. Not diagnosing you- I can't do that, but as the OCD moderator (and a person with OCD) that... smells like OCD. First off I don't think you really want to, but if you seriously feel as if you'll hurt yourself, tell your parents immediately- get help! That out of the way, when you say you get erotomania- you seem pretty aware of it. How long does it remain aimed at one person? There's a fine line between OCD and delusional thoughts, sometimes- a blurry, fine line. That's sometimes crossed, just a little- I've nearly done it more than once. I'm just wanting a feel for if this is really erotomania, or OCD gone wild. As far as the religious thoughts, that is a... common OCD theme. Fears of things like The Unforgivable Sin and going to Hell, etc. I've.. been there, done that when I was a preteen. Add to that harm-related OCD intrusive thoughts (of doing bad things to others, which I still get, some decades later), and I often thought, as a child, that I was on the cusp of demonic possession, or something. I remember... many evenings of being calm on the outside, my mother none-the-wiser, while inside I felt as if I were going insane, worrying myself to death that I was going to do something horrible to myself, or others, or do something that automatically and irrevocably doomed me to Hell (when in truth, if anything sends me there, it's likely to be my potty-mouth, meh).

If i tell a teacher, they will absolutely tell my mother (she works with them, not as a teacher though), it's better if I tell her myself. These days I been thinking really hard how will the conversation go, if I should just say I need to see a professional because I could really harm myself or should I say the whole true, including the possible erotomania. Tbh, I really don't want to die, I have the things and time to do it, but it's hard giving up now, I'm too deep into life to quit now. Also the idea of an afterlife terrifies me to no end. When i'm out of it i can tell pretty easily reality from my thoughts, but once it started again, it gets really blurry, I try to remain logical to not embarrass myself. I know it got bad when I can't lay on my stomach because I'm scared somebody will appear and touch me. About the lengths of the obsession, they usually last around a year, I go from enjoying, to obsessed, to avoiding, before finally coming out the other end. I did know intrusive thoughts are common with OCD, and I do fear that my thoughts turn out to be unforgivable, that's the main reason why I wanna disappear.

That is... a very commonly voiced thing in the OCD forum. When anxiety spikes. I think we just want to run from our anxiety, because I don't know of anyone from the OCD forum that's made a serious attempt. I include myself in that- I'm not being flippant about pwOCD, I'm no different. It's a rare week I don't think about suicide at least once, in connection with anxiety. I..... don't worry about it too much, if I was really going to I'd have done it a long time ago, and I'm not young and have had OCD a really long time. Yes there are a lot of OCD feels to this thread, and I think if you could manage to see a professional that would be really good. I know like, the laying on your stomach thing, sometimes pwOCD can have some pretty strange beliefs that border on magical thinking. 'If I think these thoughts something bad will happen to my family', or 'if I don't get rid of these things that give me pleasure (often personal items) then this will happen. For me, often I would have to go to work using the 'right' route, and listen to the 'right' music, in the hopes that it would make the shift go well. Or I'd have to pray, and pray certain things in a certain order, and be very specific- almost like an ersatz rosary. If you lay on your stomach, someone will appear and touch you? Sure why not, I can dig it. We can... create some very interesting scenarios in our head, when we let it run away with us. I'm not saying it's OCD- it might be something delusional- all I know, is that I feel as if I've gotten really, really close to delusion. It used to be said, that pwOCD always know their beliefs/obsessions, are irrational, and they do not actually get delusional. That thinking has.. been modified, to sometimes a person with OCD can get yeah a wee bit delusional- while still only having OCD. From what I've read, anyway. For an anxiety disorder, OCD sure does love to flirt with psychotic disorder symptoms, that's for sure. I have extended family history of some nice little psychotic disorders, so... yeah sometimes I distractedly wonder if I'm going to go off the rails- but I haven't yet. And neither have you- you understand these obsessions for people are just that, and acc'd to you, you don't act on them. I used to be easily infatuated (still am, a little, but tempered by age), and I have OCD. When I would fall 'in love', I mean, really in love- I would be... more than a little crazy in the head. Not like bad stalky or anything but I mean I remember having some really strong obsessions and I would be happy one moment and cry the other. Yes by all means I really think you should see a professional- it seems to me that besides/instead of erotomania, this could be explained by one or more other things. I mean there's OCD elements to your story, there's even maybe some Borderline elements. I... have traits from a little of this and a little of that, and you don't seem so much a stranger to some of the places my own brain has gone. **Not here as I would choose to be, please contact another mod for urgent forum issues** We do not delete posts.

I still suffer with it and it has been for several years for the same person. I'm a teenager, by the way.. I only found out last year (2020) when I got into some trouble with them, that I have erotomania. But, of course I just see this as a label. It's not an easy thing to grasp that your whole life is a lie. I've lost everything to it. It has ruined my life and ability to live a full and fulfilling life. My advice to you is to not tell your parents, but rather someone else who is close to you. I can't think of any set of parents who would react kindly to that. Mine certainly didn't. But, if you really want to tell your parents, bring it up in a conversation, like \"Have you heard of Erotomania?\" Or \"What do you think of Erotomaniac?\" Their responses will give you a good indication of what to expect. Much love to you. <3", "hash": "6549d8e80d447ba182cf8b1d7282ea371dee8d2d0a52eebb4636f341ecbe9e23"}

The mic for the event came through my speakers with a repetition, an echo. Instead of bearing with the echo on my monitor, I wrote a letter to the physician instead. I wish we could talk. The nights I don’t have a distraction these past weeks, months, and even years, I lay there and cry. Especially the past two weeks, it lasts for 30 minutes to an hour until I fall asleep. I try working so hard I'm tired, but in some ways it's worse. I wish I had been able to heal my situation with my daughter’s father (my ex) or find another lover who could love me. Cognitively, I understand. I’ve only brought you pain. You’ll never be able to love me. I get it, but my heart doesn’t understand. I’m feeling sad about this. Fifteen years hasn’t made it stop bleeding with tears and heartache. I’ve realized a few things. I’m not exactly a prize, I mean I am amazing, but not traditional. And second, nobody else touches that brokenness the way you did. I don’t know what to do. Abandon it? Give it more time? Keep letting it bleed out tears? I am tired of feeling this way. It’s been too long. Then I imagine your playlist is for me. That helps until reality reminds me there is only silence between us. Reality stings. Playing with the broken bit increases the intense longing. So I try to quit. Writing this, I hear the blood pounds in my ears, and the tears drip on the page. Then the calm self-regulation comes back. I’m okay, but wow. Why does it feel so intense? It’s been almost 16 years. Sometimes when it hits me at work, I wonder if you ever have to close the door and ground. If only they hadn’t made a mistake in the office and scheduled my daughter’s father with you. If only… Wishful thinking isn’t helpful. What helps? 1. My delusional hope – I imagine sitting on a dock with you talking like it’s the 90’s, and nobody is trying to reach us with cell service to redirect this line of thinking. I tear up, and my chin quivers thinking about it. I want to love and feel loved. Yeah, gush, tears, longing. That is my dream that someday, something will let us reconcile that exam, and I can reintegrate that part, and heal whatever I may have hurt in you. 2. My hope based in reality – I believe that with a good moral man in my life, I hope that someday I may heal. The problem is that: a. Good Moral types are usually paired. b. They rarely know what to make of my extremely flawed dramatic story. c. I’m not sure I’m consistent enough for one of them. d. But that is my reality based hope. 3. Other’s hope for me – I believe other’s are correct, that you aren’t the only way forward. 4. But, seriously, I wonder if we both would benefit from a conversation. It’s just that you might be the only way to align that part. Who the heck knows what I broke in you. Maybe I hurt you too. I function; it is just that the hurt part doesn’t stay well. I feel anxious about the spiritual connection I feel. That bit that thinks it bonded to you at that moment and pulls energy from it. I don’t know how else to explain the feeling. I lay there and feel what I wonder you’re feeling. I cry so hard when you feel empty or disconnected. Then I feel foolish for thinking I have any real connection, and it just hurts. Without distractions, I struggle. \"I trust that if I start to fall off the ladder of life again, others will pick me back up and put me back on.\" -Sunnyg", "hash": "31bc090ca47357cafcd281047af4dd5feaac39a2c95fe6f1f20512ea7c0005f8"}

When I imagine talking, it is comforting. Things I want to share: • My gratitude for my day. • My latest & greatest update from the week by phone. • About those moments that were hard to endure. The times when I can’t breathe or struggle to lift back to hope, and I sink into despair. If it weren’t for my daughter, I might not keep on keeping on. I’m struggling to imagine my future, especially when she leaves for college. When I feel like giving up, quitting work, and giving in to disability, I envision a part that argues for being persistent. The function tells me, “But, you don’t know how this will end.” It helps pull me back towards hope. I was praying the other night when that broken bit encouraged me to keep waiting. I laughed through tears because I’ve been waiting to experience love for what feels like an eternity. So I asked, what did I do to have to endure this? If I could break free from this mess, I would have eons ago. I can’t help but think there is going to be an exciting and fantastic ending. I’m open to options #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Especially memories formed at my most vulnerable states that went untreated in the postpartum for some time. I never was able to have a conversation with the physician whose touch I couldn't make sense of. Anyway, 15 years later I struggle with unrequited love... Call it erotomania, but it's lost it's mania and it isn't erotic, it sucks. It was the most profound attraction of my life. Anyway, this is about you, not me. I hope you are able to talk through the questions you have in safe ways. If you have insight, then you may find ways to reality test. Find and talk with people you can trust.

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/delusional-disorder/topic1281.html", "text": "by Alex47 » Fri Oct 24, 2003 5:22 pm BOOK COMMENT REVIEW SYNOPSIS GRB comments on Alistair Munro's Book \"Delusional Disorder...\" I highly recommend the website http://shop.ebrary.com/ , where you can read the above book online for free. The information below is taken from p. 232-234, which deserve to be read in their entirety. For me, this section of the book has given me some modest hope, as it paints a picture of the treatment process and some possible favorable outcomes. There is also some practical advice for the psychiatrist. By necessity, I will paraphrase Munro: Because of the patients reluctance to trust psychiatrists, ideally, assessment and treatment should be by a family physician... but they may not always have the necessary familiarity with this condition and recent advances in its treatment. The psychiatrist must be patient and will often have to spend more than one session gaining the patients confidence before even trying to persuade them to take meds. The patient will usually vehemently argue against taking medications, \"but calm persistence does finally pay off in a reasonable proporatioon of cases\". Medication should be started with a \"very low\" dose which is then raised \"gradually and cautiously\", to prevent sudden onset of side effects, \"an event guaranteed to induce immediate noncompliance.\" Munro recommends that the patient see the psychiatrist at least once a week during this early stage. Munro is a champion of the drug pimozide, used in low doses (\"starting with 1 or 2 mg daily...and in most cases [will need to be gardually raised to] no higher than 4 to 6 mg per day\"). He has used this drug primarily to treat delusional disorder of the somatic subtype, with good results. Minor improvements may be seen within a few days (e.g., reduced agitation, somewhat reduced preoccupation with the delusion), but it takes about two weeks (on the average; sometimes as much as 6 weeks) of treatment (assuming the patient is compliant and responding to the medication), before significant amelioration of the delusion is observed. I will quote the following passage in whole, as it addresses a scenario which has caused me worries (the person stops taking their meds), and actually manages to turn it around into something hopeful: Quote: Quite often the patient feels sufficiently improved early on in treatment that he or she decides to stop the medication. Inevitably the delusion and the accompanying agitation and preoccupation start to reappear and it is then that the treating physician has the best opportunity to obtain ongoing co-operation. Even when the patient is still adamant that his beliefs are real, the experience of improvement followed by incipient relapse seems to make a deep impression and if the patient now trusts the physician he or she will often become extremely compliant. In successful cases the complete turnaround from rejection to trust is both remarkable and heartily gratifying. Munro also observes that in the cases where the patient makes a \"good recovery\", it is often \"relatively rapid and notably complete... even when the delusion has been present for a very long time\". Sounds great, doesn't it? [icon_smile.gif] He also talks about long-term maintenance of treatment (which not surprisingly typically involves continuing meds indefinitely), and mentions that of the (admittedly small) group of patients he has been able to follow up with over the long term, about 1/3 have actually been weaned from meds. These occasionally have relapses, but apparently have sufficient insight at that point that they actually voluntarily resume medication. I also found the following passage very interesting: Quote: There is a dissociation between acquired insight as to the desirability of continuing treatment and in-depth insight into the illness itself. Many patients never accept fully the psychotic nature of their experience, but so long as they agree to take treatment, it seems unimportant, and probably unkind, to face them with the fact that they were delusional before the medication took effect. Munro concludes with a few thoughts on non-drug treatment of delusional disorder, stating essentially that psychological (\"talk\") treatment is essentially not helpful until possibly, in some cases, after the delusions have been resolved using medication. A final warning is given: \"There is a general consensus that psychotherapy of an exploratory, uncovering type is not appropriate in delusional disorder. \" I'll say it again, this section of the book deserves to be read by anybody dealing with a loved one suffering from delusional disorder. It helped me, and I hope it will help you, too. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Roger C comments on \"I am Not Sick, I Do Not Need Help\" by Dr. Xavier Amador Dr. Amador writes from his own personal experience, both as brother of a schizophrenia patient, and as a clinical psychologist. A large problem with treating people with schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders is that many times they won't stay in treatment. The usual explanation for this is that they lack insight into their illness. That is, they are not aware they have a mental illness, or in many cases even that they are exhibiting symptoms. Attempts to reason with such patients about their illness are futile. Dr. Amador postulates that this inability to perceive their illness is caused by the same kind of brain disfunction that is responsible for the illness itself. Experiments have proven this to be true. So, since most of these patients are incapable of understanding that they are ill, how can doctors and family members convince them to stay in treatment programs? Dr. Amador gives a four-step method for providing patients with insight into the benefit of treatment, thus giving them motivation to stay in treatment. For example, one schizophrenic patient wanted very much to be able to hold down a job, but had only a few jobs over the years, most of which lasted only a short time. Rather than simply telling this patient that a job was out of the question, the doctor empathized with the patient's desire, and then helped the patient look back to the times when he was able to get a job, and the events that led up to losing the job, and related these events to the patient's treatment program (or lack thereof). This helped the patient to gain insight into the benefit of treatment. The book finishes with a couple of chapters about knowing when to commit a loved one, and how to go about it. All the advice sounds reasonable, and Dr. Amador's track record of success with it speaks for itself. It should be universally applicable, since the method is based on identifying issues that are important to the patient himself; anything he is dissatisfied with and wants to change will provide a means to motivate the patient to stay in treatment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sean et al comments: I saw Dr. Amador speak at the 2003 NAMI National Convention, if you ever have a chance I suggest seeing him. He spent a great deal of time at the end of the session answering questions from people with a mentalli ill loved one. His sympathy and understanding towards the person with the illness was incredible. As he spoke he explained Schizophrenia and the inability to recognize the illness in simple terms: He asked someone from the audience to give a brief bio about themself. The woman who volunteered (I'll call her Susan) was a Psychologist with a loving husband and two children. She gave a brief description of her job, her family, and her life in general. Then Dr. Amador then went on to talk directly to Susan, saying basically the following: Quote: Susan, I have some bad news for you. You aren't really a Psychologist, in fact, the practice where you think you work called me and asked that I tell you to stop going there every day. There's more though, you aren't really married. Tom also has asked me to help you get help and to stop going to his house. Those children aren't yours, and the house isn't yours. You're sick Susan, and I'm going to take you to the hospital and get you some help. This demonstration, more than anything else, made me aware of how frightening it must be to have Schizophrenia and have your reality stolen from you. No wonder someone with such an illness has conspiratorial thoughts. If someone came and told me my entire life was imagined I'd think they were lying. When they went on to say I needed help and then started trying to make me take medication I wouldn't trust them. I know I haven't done the demonstration justice, but try and imagine yourself hearing those words. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GRB comments on Amador: One approach is to \"empower\" the patient to make their own decision about whether to stay on meds, by promising that no one will object if they go off the meds, under the condition that they keep a journal during the periods that they are not taking medications... Also, a thought on the idea mentioned above, about finding a motivator for the patient to stay in treatment (and which could presumably be used to motivate the person to seek treatment...). Roger had mentioned difficulties in applying this concept in his case. I would agree that this approach would work much better with schizophrenia, for example, than delusional disorder, because in the latter case the person is only affected by the disorder in a limited way, due to the \"encapsulated\" nature of the delusions. The person suffering from DD is likely to be highly functional within society in general and professionally, whereas the disorder primarily affects interpersonal relationships with those close to him or her. So, I think it is a general truth that many people with DD actually do not perceive a worsened quality of life as a result of their (untreated) condition. They might notice a positive change after starting medication, which might be helpful in assuring future compliance, but the problem of how to get the person into treatment in the first place remains vexing.... Dr. Amador introduces his four steps. Listen Effective listening is really a skill that needs to be cultivated. You will need to learn to really listen to what your loved one feels, wants, and believes in. Listening without learning is pointless. First, you need to walk in the other person's shoes to gain a clear idea of their experience of the illness and treatment. For the uninitiated, this is not as easy as it may sound on the face of it. Too many times we make assumptions without checking them out with the person about whom we are making assumptions. Knowledge is power. When you know how someone experiences the idea of having a mental illness and taking psychiatric drugs, you will have obtained the leverage you need to begin to build a treatment agreement. But you will also need to know what their hopes and expectations are for the future, whether or not you believe they're realistic. And finally, you want to identify the cognitive deficits (e.g. problems with memory, attention, focusing thoughts) that are creating barriers between you and the person you're concerned about and between that person and effective treatment. Empathize The second step involves learning when and how to express empathy. If there were a moral to each step and chapter, this one would go something like this: If you want someone to seriously consider your point of view, be certain he feels you have seriously considered his. Quid pro quo. That means that you must empathize with all of the reasons he has for not wanting to accept treatment, even the \"crazy\" ones. But don't worry; empathizing with how a particular delusion makes one feel is not the same as agreeing that the belief is true. This may seem like a minor point, but, as you will learn, the right kind of empathy will make a tremendous difference on how receptive your loved one is to your concerns and opinions. In the chapter devoted to this step, I give you step-by-step instructions on how to do this using techniques such as reflective listening. Agree Find common ground and stake it out. Knowing that what you want for the other person is something she does not want for herself can make it seem as if there is no common ground. She doesn't think she needs medication or therapy, and you think she does. Like any conflict of beliefs between two people, to resolve the disagreement to your satisfaction requires that you discover what motivation the other person has to change. Common ground always exists even between the most extreme opposing positions. The emphasis is on acknowledging that your loved one has personal choice and responsibility for the decisions he makes about his life. During this step, you become a neutral observer, pointing out the various positive and negative consequences of decisions your loved on has made. That means refraining from saying things like, \"See if you had taken your medication, you wouldn't have ended up in the hospital.\" Your focus is on making observations together - identifying facts upon which you can ultimately agree. Rather than making an observation or statement about what happened you ask a lot of questions such as \"So what happened after you decided to stop taking your medication?\" \"Did the voices quiet down after you stopped?\" \"How long after stopping the medication was it before you went to the hospital?\" If you are truly collaborating, asking questions rather than giving advice or direction comes a lot easier than it may sound. Partnership Forming a partnership for recovery is the last and, in my experience, the most satisfying step in this process. The aim of this step is to help you to collaborate on accomplishing the goals you agreed upon. Unlike the previous steps, this one involves both you and your loved one making an explicit decision to work together and to become teammates against a common opponent. You may call the enemy different names, but the names are irrelevant to arriving at a plan of action. The final step culminates in arriving at a treatment agreement. _________________", "hash": "0a21c3f0efb3ebdbc45d2367a18767ee2bf2bab60055b4c68e1c1b28e5b27467"}

I have been recently asked to moderate this forum on Delusional Disorder. I am not a doctor, but I believe I have some first hand experience. What is Delusional Disorder? This illness is a psychosis characterized by non-bizzare delusions which last at least one month. The intensity of such perceptions may wax or wane over time. The person suffering from delusions is often functional in all other aspects of their life. Statistically this illness strikes woman more than men. There are at least six sub-types: Erotomanic: Belief that another person, usually of higher status, is in love with him or her. This other person may be a boss, coworker, celebrity, or stranger. Grandiose: Belief that he or she is much more important, powerful, wealthy, or talented than he or she really is. Jealous: The belief that his or her partner has been grossly unfaithful without regard to substantiating evidence. Persecutory: Believes that he or she is being plotted against, spied on, followed, or harassed by unknown enemies. These delusions sometimes involve conspiracies of people out to \"get\" the sufferer. Somatic: He or she is ill or has other types of health problems. Mixed type: Suffers from more than one of the delusions listed above. Delusional Disorder is sometimes a associated with other personality disorders or a subset of other psychoses; and there is a certain overlap with Paranoid Personality Disorder. It may be helpful to you to check the posts in that forum as well. The above information was culled from various internet sources.

Most delusions are resting on each other like a house of cards and confirming her point of view will do one of two things. It will either make her face up to the bollocks she's throwing at you, or it won't and the logical thing for her to do will be to call the police.

Hope you find this place as supportive as I have over the past decade. So medication helps most people with delusions. But anosignosia or not knowing one is sick is a symptom of the illness. The longer delusions go untreated the harder they are to treat, in my case I’m still struggling with making sense and healing from a trauma that’s over 15 years in the past at the birth of my daughter that involved an exam. I’d document your issue, and if the individual becomes a threat to self or others get help immediately. When talking with the person - Explain nicely that they need to seek professional care because they aren’t well. There is a great book by dr Amador titled “I’m not sick and I don’t need help”. They key strategy is to listen, empathize, agree with some aspect of their complaint like (I agree you must feel frustrated), and partner to get the person help. Also contact your local NAMI organization. They can help, too. The helpline is always there to listen and support you. Hope that helps.

I think I have said most every response possible. Is there a general method of handling these false accusations. I thought it wasn't a good idea to buy into their world. For example, the main core of their beliefs about me involve the idea that I took her lottery money. She says she gave me a ticket worth 10=50 million and I have the money. It is a long drawn out rambling story that repeats every day many times a day, all out loud with yelling and screaming. I have thought about saying \"Yes I have your money\" But is that a good idea? I have called the police many times and she calls them sometimes once a day or more.

I don't really have lots advice as I'm still trying different things but I've been pleading my innocence for three years. That definitely doesn't work. One piece of advice I will give you though is choose your Dr carefully. My husband has been seeing a psych. He's on antipsychotic medication but it hasn't really helped. I've done a lot of research and I don't believe the meds help without cognitive therapy. My husbands Dr only did the meds and that just isn't enough. Talk to the Dr before you take her. Make sure they are experienced in dealing with these disorders and incorporate cognitive therapy into the treatment. My husband won't go to another Dr now and I can't help but believe, the right Dr would have helped. Good luck and take care of yourself. Over time this will take its toll emotionally. You feel guilt even though you've done nothing wrong. You lose your dignity. You lose your identity and your life becomes all about helping them see.

In the end, he went but my Dr refused to refer me and his psychiatrist also encouraged me not to see anyone as this would just enable his delusion. I sort of wish I did go though because then he would have to consider that if my MH was OK and his Dr says his isn't, there might be some truth in it. The other thing to not do, is get guilted into doing a polygraph. I thought that was going to be the deciding factor until the anxiety, upset and worry caused the test to come back as deceptive. The annoying thing about that was that I was so anxious and nervous that the test really couldn't get a true result. I 100% told the truth and it still said I may have been deceptive.

Any Solutions Besides Medication? by insaneinthemembranes » Thu Oct 22, 2020 4:55 am Hello, My name is \"Insaneinthemembranes\" (lol have to use a little humor ). Lets just say thats my name for now. I have lived quite a difficult life getting in quite a bit of legal troubles. I always have been a cautious man because of my unorthodox lifestyle. I have recently been using K2 (synthetic cannabinoid) for about 12 months. It has been about 7 months since I have touched the stuff except a recent relapse about 4 months ago where I smoked it once. That was a little history of what I believe is causing my problems. I typically am a very logical man and I do pride myself on this. I study quite a bit and look into many subjects. Now I thought at first I was being setup by some people to harm me and it really took me quite some time to realize that I am insane. I have been really focusing on what is going on and the delusional thoughts that go through my head. I have not seen a doctor and to be quite frank I will not go see a doctor. I worry about getting on medications that will slow my brain down. I get a strong feeling people are plotting on me. They want to set me up to get me killed, poison me, kidnap me, or beat me down. I look at certain people and thing they are a part of an organization that wishes me harm. I get a sense that my roommates are hiring a hacker to hack my computer. I get a sense that undercover cops are following me when I walk around and that I am being watched for something someone made up on me. I think people around me are undercover federal agents and they are spying on me to get information for something someone is setting me up for. Now at first this did cause me a headache. I am pretty good in remaining calm in violent situations so I don't let things get to me so pretty much no one knows whats going on with me. It's something I can hide quite well and put a smile on my face. I truly thought this was happening because its really hard to know whats happening when you first initially deal with this. Especially with no support from anyone because I really don't have any family or friends in my life. I have come to the understanding that these sinister plots on my life are nothing more then delusional and have self diagnosed myself with persecutory delusions. I know it sounds dumb me self diagnosing but when I researched the different variations of psychosis it seems this is the correct one. My question now is what is a good way to cope with this? Now that I understand this things are different. I have a deep understanding when I hear my roommates plotting on me in the next room or when I think a group of people is part of a gang trying to get me then I just smile and act casual. Understanding this isnt true. That it must be some delusion coming from my ego thinking im better then people or special in some way so I am a target. In the end that is what it happening and thats me giving myself the most unbiasted opinion I can. It's interesting recognizing my insanity and I am trying to out think it. Seems crazy right? lol trust me i get it. Trying to fix a broken tool with a broken tool it seems but I refuse to be heavily sedated. Any ideas on something that can calm me down? Im taking zoloft that isnt prescribed to me at a dose of 100mg. I have about 500 pills left I got from a friend. I take \"Stress Comfort Peace Of Mind by Natures Bounty\" in the morning with my zoloft. At night I take \"Honey Lavender Stress Relief Soothing Serentiy Blend Tea\" with my 30mg of Melatonin for sleep. I try to work out a few times a week and pray on my knees every morning and night. Im not a christian but I am open to any options that might work at this point. Hence the weird herbal concoction I have going on lol. I do not drink any caffeine because I noticed it will put me in a manic state that really intensifies these delusions which I cannot allow. I chew tobacco and I dont drink or use any mind altering substances. If anyone knows of anything else to add to this please let me know. I am winging this right now and I just came up with the medical diagnosis about 2 hours ago lol. It truly does match what is going on with me to the \"T\".

Remember that following through with any diagnosis is strictly voluntary on your part. Take what is said as only suggestions, but think about what is said. You don't want a med that would 'slow' the brain, but possibly help clear the mind of clutter, noise and paranoia. Once that is begun, then counseling will work much more effectively. It is very difficult, if not impossible to treat someone with active delusions. For a time, I was unreachable until a crisis intervention and personal surrender made me decide to give recovery another chance. \"Surrender to win\" sounds like a paradox, but it saved my life. I would not self-medicate with Zoloft or Melatonin until it is cleared by a physician/pharmacist. These 'natural' drugs aren't always completely safe and can have side-effects. Just my 2¢.

This seemed to stop the problem but over time he has changed his meds and I feel the delusion never really went away. About a week ago it started again, and he was in hospital again this week, against his wishes - the only reason he went is because he had an episode at work and they called an ambulance. Nevertheless, he believes he has achieved something amazing, and claims he is now 'fixed' although he continues to make weird movements. He is now on lithium and a new anti-psychotic drug. He has agreed to stop smoking weed, which I think was a huge part of the problem. We are on Day 2 of the new drugs.

He doesn't want to go to talk therapy, which is super frustrating as I know there is ALOT of childhood trauma there. I'm confident that meds with therapy will fix this, I just need to help him get there. At the moment, he is on Day 3 of no pot and and Day 2 of the new meds. He is now physically calm but very angry at me for not believing him. He is now saying that all along he had twisted intestines which he fixed himself with his breath. He wants to speak with an \"internalist\" (??) who he believes will confirm that he is not crazy (his words). I think that he knows somewhere in there that this makes no sense because as angry as he is, he is taking his meds (angrily taking them!) and not smoking pot - though he has no choice on that because i have cleared out the house of everything. I'm just so scared that this will tear us apart as he is saying that he doesn't think our relationship can continue if I don't believe him. I'm devastated. We haven't been married all that long...before this happened I was literally living the dream, living in bliss with the love of my life in Hawaii. I feel that is shattered now .. heart broken.", "hash": "84ed3108eec7d01045c7670a0c251f2f89cdfa95516a019b44ac1905d2ae43f1"}

This is by phone- I don't have to live with it, however. If it's affordable (insurance etc) maybe he can see an internist. I'd try to talk to the doctor, ahead of time, though. Don't really want to encourage him in this, though. Just... I don't know- it's a tightrope for you.

A lot of times, when someone is experiencing this kind of thought pattern and behavior, they absolutely refuse to take the medicine. It's important to remember that this medicine can sometimes take some time before it starts to work properly, usually a week or two. I agree that keeping the pot out of his hands will do him good. People with severe mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia should not be smoking it under any circumstance. It can only make the disorders that much worse. I agree with see a doctor that he wants to see (so long you can afford it) and talking to the doctor ahead of time. It might actually show him that, yes, nothing was ever wrong with him, however it could also make him angrier, so be prepared for that. And yes, don't encourage him in this.

I have been in love with the same guy since I was 14. He is a professional dj, used to be a dj for a now very famous rapper and is currently touring with another well known rapper. I first saw him in the background of the first rapper's music video when I was 14. I didn't know who he was but for some reason I was extremely drawn to him and to this day I still don't get why. He is a very handsome man but back then when he was only 21 he was cute I guess but not someone that would normally make my shallow, 14 year old self swoon. I started fantasizing about him. I gave him a name. I wrote stories about us falling in love. A couple years after that I bought a documentary dvd the rapper had put out and the dj happened to be on it. So I was able to get his name. I friended him on myspace. He had a girlfriend at the time but I was 14 and he was 21 so there was nothing I could have done anyway. Fast forward to my late teen/early adulthood years, I continued to follow him on social media. I would look at his friend's pages just to see photos and videos of him. Never tried to contact him outside of sending a couple little (very corny)messages to him saying I thought he was very talented. He responded saying thank you and that was that. In 2011 he dated a woman (I was 20 at this time) and I remember feeling devastated and crying about it. I never had any ill feelings toward her, didn't even really feel jealous. I was just very sad he wasn't with me. They've broken up and he appears to be single. There have been brief moments where I haven't really thought about him much. Like if I was involved with someone \"in real life.\"I've dated and been involved sexually with plenty of other people but nothing ever got serious. As soon as those situations fizzled out I went right back to dating him in my head. Right now I'm not interested in being with anyone (other than him) seriously so I keep things casual. Sometimes while being intimate with other guys I pretend it's him I'm making love to.The only things about my situation that are different from the typical erotomania symptoms are I do not believe that he is sending me signals, I don't stalk him and have no desire to (well...more on that later).I have never told him how I feel. I have looked him up in a people search just because I was curious and wanted to know more about him. I don't communicate with him. I don't feel violent toward him or anyone in his life. Lastly I don't believe/think he reciprocates my feelings.At least not really. Three years ago, I fell on hard times and found myself in a homeless shelter. My first night there, terrified, hungry and full of anxiety...I remember all I could think about was him. So I prayed. (I grew up Christian. No longer religious but very spiritual with belief in God, the power of prayer, the universe etc.) I prayed that God would tell me why this man has dominated my mind all these years especially now since I should be focusing on getting my life together. My belief is that God told me that man is my soulmate and we're to be married and build a life/family together. I've prayed for signs of this and believe they were confirmed. I've prayed for certain things to happen for him and they have. I waffle back and forth between believing that this is so, which feels amazing, and not believing it, the latter causing me so much anxiety and emotional turmoil. I feel like I'm crazy. Like I'm delusional and hell I just might be. I've prayed that God would remove these feelings from me, make me not find him attractive anymore but to no avail. I live in Michigan. This guy lives in Miami. Many times I think of going to Miami \"on vacation\" with the hopes of running into him or going to one of his shows and him seeing me and falling for me on the spot. I suffer from PTSD and BPD (borderline not bipolar)due to abuse from both parents growing up and going into my early 20s. Feeling unloved most of my life, the idea of having someone God chose that is guaranteed to love me is very comforting. I was also brought up in church and it was drilled in me that God is supposed to choose your spouse for you. Anyway. I know this is very long...but I'd like some insight from anyone struggling with this as well or who has knowledge on the subject. I plan on speaking with my therapist about it this week. I spoke with my last therapist about it as well but she didn't seem to think it was a big deal.", "hash": "81436b18926cf33e8b73b87c00afd401c7852b59077868e8586e979bffcebd1e"}

My psychosis originated from traumatic childhood memories and research into ritual abuse. During this break, I believed that I was being manipulated by a universal cult and that my partner was literally God and that they would kill me if I didn't design a better universe for them. That episode ending with me trashing my entire apartment, breaking a window and hurling household objects outside, screaming incessantly, and finally physically hurting my partner when they tried to stop me. My court date for that incident is tomorrow; I am transgender so I am expecting to be confined to solitary without hormones for close to my maximum sentence (3 years). My only hope is my partner's testimony since they witnessed my delusions and they don't blame me for the incident at all as I am normally very peaceful and kind. However, after I was released from the mental health facility, my partner began to echo elements of my delusions. They told me that they had broken their own mental programming and that they understood everything. They believe that they are being constantly stalked by a mysterious \"they\" that includes their actually-loving mother but doesn't involve a cult (I've insisted that the cult isn't real). They believe that colors and words and numbers are all used as a kind of code which can be used to manipulate people psychologically or to communicate with them convertly, and since then they've mostly communicated with me in code that they refuse to explain, which makes it difficult to even understand the nature of their delusions. They think that we're in grave danger and that they have to change and control me to protect me. Since then, my partner has admitted to repeatedly attempting to brainwash me \"for my own good\", which they are ashamed of but can't stop doing. In conversations, they often ignore me completely and ask me questions repeatedly even after I've answered them. In the last week they've started randomly moving objects around the house, including my personal items: so far I've lost my toothbrush (3 times), my makeup (twice), my guitar picks, my only pair of shoes I can use for walking, my inhaler, and my food stamp card. The inhaler, food stamp card, and shoes are still missing; I can't go outside without my shoes and my partner keeps asking me to anyway because I \"need to get out\" (luckily I do have a pair of heels I can wear to court). He's also scribbled messages on my checks (e.g. \"Give me all your $#%^\" or my name over and over). He has also damaged other household objects, including a handbag, his own clothes, and a now-destroyed houseplant that my partner was really fond of (he named it \"Franky\"). He fills bags with small objects and hands them to me telling me that they're his \"rights\" and that he's the one going to jail, not me. We're packing (because jail) but all my partner has done is to stuff hundreds of objects into cupboards and claim that they're packed. On that note, my partner has also been committing minor criminal acts. They claim to have stolen from work (I think they took cash?) and last night they came home with three torn-down COVID-19 signs. They keep stuffing their pockets, bags, and once their boot with random small objects that he says he stole from me, even though half the \"stolen\" objects are usually his. The night before that he broke his dad's window for no discernable reason. That night was particularly strenuous: my partner hurt me physically and attempted to terrify me psychologically (it worked). He also spilled hot wax all over me, the floor, the counter, and my laptop while I begged him to stop, then refused to clean the mess afterwards. Then he tried to eat the ruined candles. I can't even get into all the mind games he played with me that night because it was so convoluted and the conversation was so confusing that I can't even remember exactly what happened; I just know that the constant verbal and physical pressures ended with me crying and hyperventilating and begging for him to stop torturing me. He didn't really seem to care except when I started screaming and fainted. The only part of our verbal exchange that I remember was when he was talking to a non-existent bus driver off to my left while still interacting with me physically as if I WAS the bus driver, even though he wouldn't look at me and shushed me every time I tried to speak claiming that he was explaining everything. That part of the conversation lasted for more than half an hour with him repeatedly giving me his bus fare and then taking it away again. I feel hopeless and there's no one to comfort me. My partner will sometimes get angry with me when I try to touch them, and they usually seem to do so when I'm feeling upset; thankfully when they're less delusional they still hug and cuddle me like they used to do. They also refuse to even lie down in the same bed as me because it \"doesn't feel right\", but there's really nowhere else to sleep so now they no longer do. So, every time I sleep and wake up, my partner has had 8-ish hours to run amok without me and I wake to find more of my things missing. My partner may go to jail if they keep this up, and I have literally no friends or family so if they can't take care of my things while I'm gone or give me a place to stay when I get out myself then I'll be leaving jail clothesless (aside from whatever I'm wearing when they take me), homeless, and without a job or my cats or access to medical care. Even if they do take care of my things, when I get out I may only be returning to them for more psychological torture. Thank you to anyone who read everything; I just needed to vent. I am devastated. My partner was nothing but perfect for me until this happened and I've loved them more than I've ever loved anyone else in my life, but now I feel that I've lost them in addition to everything else in my life, and that makes me want to die. I can't take this anymore; I'm just too emotionally fragile and broken to handle this. Thank you for listening.", "hash": "494a6efd7b0732069a7c9e70d4de7f9c6270349df0e3b6a20d22b0582a4d4832"}

I have a 57 year old father with Delusional Disorder, who has been consumed by this illness since 2007/2008. I think this illness came about when he essentially lost a personal injury trial a few months prior. He dedicated about 5 years of his life into this case. I guess he tried to make sense of it by (wrongfully) blaming my mother for conspiring with the insurance company against him. At the same time, my little brother was diagnosed with Autism. It was a very stressful transition time in my family. I'm going to spare the details of how his illness manifests, because it is so similar to what everyone has been posting here. This has been a huge strain on my family (my mother, myself, and two siblings). He does better when he is on antipsychotic medications, and for a period of about 3 years, he seemed to be his old self again. He worked, socialized well, and just seemed to be a good guy in general. As far as I could tell, he just had occasional moodiness (who doesnt?). I thought this was a miracle and that this disorder was controlled and a problem of the past. That was the case until he started to become non complaint with his medications (yet again). He is currently ordered by a mental health tribunal to take his antipsychotic medications every month, and he still defies the order. He tries to trick doctors in various ways to say that he is compliant. Essentially, the police have to show up at the home in order for him to go get his shot. When he is well, he is able to work, socialize, and be a productive member of the family. When he is unwell, he mismanages money, does not care to work, and essentially makes accusations against everyone and makes life difficult. My dad needs to be medicated. And once he's medicated, he needs to go to therapy. However, that's not what I am writing about. I am so scared that I will inherit delusional disorder just like my father. It seems that there is mental illness in the family. My father has DD. His brother was an alcoholic (who knows what kind of disorder he was hiding?). My grandfather (dad's side) certainly had some sort of mental health issues later in his life (but he was a WW2 survivor - a lot of this was attributed to his war experiences). My grandmother (dad's side) has a family history of mental illness as well. My mother's side, as far as I know, is clear. I am a 30 year old man. I am currently single, but I have a good job and would like to start a family sometime in the coming years. I've had no real mental health issues other than family and typical life-related stress. I experimented with drugs in my early 20s, but they were never an addiction. Overall, I would say that I've done better in school and work life than my peers. I spoke with a psychologist about my concerns, but I think she just did not understand DD. She seemed to conflate the disorder with schizophrenia. She basically told me that since i've not had any psychotic symptoms up to this point in my life, and that my siblings do not have any psychotic disorders, that it is extremely unlikely that I will ever go on to develop a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia or DD. However, DD can be onset at any time in your life. I am so scared that I will be a burden to my (present and future) family. I am so scared that I will become a shell of myself and create trouble for those I love the most. The problem is that there is no certainty about what my future will hold. Any help and insight would be appreciated.", "hash": "67dea3ef20ea5079f8c3d93fa2b8b57942fa50f060de28e88b4adcdffd3434f7"}

The fact that you're worried about it is a good first step, as it means you're aware that you may entertain unrealistic thoughts. The issue many face is that they refuse to accept that their delusion is what it is and argue beyond reason that it's true. However, there is a danger that your obsession with getting delusions gets to a point where it itself becomes a delusion; that you're so convinced that you'll get it that you'll see it where it doesn't exist. I don't know if you've ever seen a film called A Beautiful Mind, but if not then it tells the story of John Nash who was deluded to the point of vivid, visual hallucinations. Medication etc didn't work as a long-term strategy, but he eventually managed to cope with the delusions by employing a real-world test as to their existence. It's not the same as you, but it might be worth considering some tests that you can deploy to test any beliefs against reality, even posting them here to get an more objective opinion might help to confirm you're living in reality without the need to become obsessed with the idea.

As is usual with kids, they had a basic notion of how the world was made, but without the experience and understanding to realise at the outset what the logistics entailed. I told them to carry on, but warned them that if they started to see water in the hole, it meant that they'd missed and hit the sea. It was enough for them to stop but with a level of accomplishment. So we made the hole bigger, lined it and turned it into a fish pond. There is a grown up and useful version of these types of delusion, called visualisation.

I posted a few months ago on Reddit about my current situation and since deleted it; frankly, most of the advice given was unhelpful, if not unkind. I am convinced my spouse of four years (together for nearly a decade) has a delusional disorder, likely stemming from PTSD. Most of his delusions center on infidelity, but are accompanied by full-blown auditory and visual hallucinations. He claims to have seen me, on multiple occasions, have sex with other men in our apartment. Twice now, he claims to have recorded evidence. Of course, I've asked to see it, and of course, there are plenty of excuses as to why I can't: he deleted it, it's with a lawyer, etc. I'm fairly certain yesterday marked the end of our marriage. The outbursts and name-calling have only gotten worse. His favorite today is \"junkie whore.\" Secret drug addiction seems to be his rationale for why I'd sneak men into the apartment for sex. For money. For drugs. I don't know that I'm ready to discuss all the gory details, but today he mentioned my handle. It's a handle I've been using elsewhere, mostly in Discord-based support groups. He thinks I use it to hook up with other men. I have no idea how he knows about it. He's not that technical. Maybe I just left my laptop open at some point. I guess I'm hoping that maybe, one day, perhaps once he's found someone new, he'll find this post. Perhaps when he starts accusing her of the same things, he'll care to look. I suppose I just needed to write something down somewhere. All the things I wish I could say to him. How I wish he had gotten help. How much I want him to find happiness and peace. How fearful I am that he will end up alone. How sorry I am I couldn't help him. How much I hate the cold, distant person I became last couple years of our relationship.

I'm exhausted too. I'm not sure of the answer to your question as my husband and I have only been on this roller coaster of despair for a couple of years but I hope you do get a chance to make some nice memories this year. I read some of your earlier posts and your story is eerily similar to mine - feel free to read my previous posts for context. I spent a long time trying to find others in my situation because I think it helps to not feel so alone. I was going to write a new post but this board doesn't get a lot of traffic so I thought I would just reply to you. I left my DDJ husband in July this year but our separation isn't going very well. We see each other most days for a few hours and usually have dinner at whichever house has the children on the day. When I left, I did so on the basis that my own mental health had taken a beating and I was sick of being told I was a liar, a cheat, narcissistic, schizophrenic and evil. I was an emotional wreck and having always been somewhat of a people pleaser, I spent my every waking minute trying to make my husband believe that I loved him and wasn't cheating. I left without a reconciliation plan and bought a new house to live in. When I was still home with him, he would sometimes sit me down for a serious talk to explain to me that he understood I was in a difficult position. He thought the man I was supposedly having an affair with must have had some sort of hold over me and he wanted to help me. Other times, he would tell me I was schizophrenic and possibly didn't know what I was doing because it was the 'other me' doing it. He was so convincing that at times, I would sit quietly in the bathroom and search deep into my own memories and thoughts to make sure I really wasn't getting up in the middle of the night to have the 'affair' while everyone was asleep. More than once, I had suicidal thoughts because I just couldn't deal with the accusations, the way he looked at me, how when I didn't make eye contact because I felt degraded and humiliated, he thought it was guilt etc etc Biggest problem I have today is this. I've let myself become very emotionally dependant on him and that's really bad. As a person who wears my heart on my sleeve, I struggle to convince myself that it's his illness that made him say such horrible things to me over the last two years. When he was saying disgusting things, I warned him that he wouldn't be able to take them back and warned him that I may never get over them. He wants me to move back in but I've convinced myself that we can never reconcile until I get the following: 1. He has to take responsibility for his mental health being the cause of the problems 2. He needs to apologise (sincerely) and show genuine remorse for what he put me through and the damage his mental health has done to me 3. Ideally he should stop smoking 'funny stuff' to remove the paranoia side of this illness He has been taking Risperidon for about 6 months at 3mg a day and he meets with his psychiatrist once every few weeks. I went to the last meeting and explained to both of them that I can't be in a relationship with someone who believes I have ever cheated on them. My husband stated that he knows I'm not cheating now. The psychiatrist added that while my husband doesn't think I'm cheating now, he will likely never realise that I didn't cheat because it was real to him at the time and he may always believe I cheated and put him through all of that. To me, that basically means that he will never treat me with the respect I deserve because he will always think I'm capable of lying and cheating. I like his psychiatrist but aside from managing his medication, I don't think he's doing any cognitive therapy with him and I have read that for this difficult disorder, both medication and CT has better success. My husband refuses to talk to me about the issues that lead to our separation. He doesn't want to talk about them ever again. If I do ask him anything about the events of past, he says he just wants to live in the now, he's not stupid and he knows the truth. If I ask him what truth he knows, he replies with a cryptic answer. If I try to get a non-cryptic answer, he tells me that I'm the reason for his beliefs because I have always been the person to keep bringing it up. He seems to forget that while I was living there, he treated me with so much disrespect and contempt, it was hard not to bring it up. He always says that he wasn't bringing the topic up but was merely just pointing out oddities he noticed around the house (which were usually indirect attacks at my supposed infidelity). I'm thinking that after Christmas, I'm going to have to go no contact so we can both move ahead but there's something stopping me. I don't know what is blocking me because while I was happy to spend the rest of my life with him, we never really had a great relationship to start with. We had some really happy times but more unhappy times and these days, I don't get a lot of comfort from being around him because the medication makes him lifeless, unmotivated and unresponsive a lot of the time. Hope you don't mind the long post but feel free to share your thoughts - I'd love to lend an ear to someone in the same situation as me. Other people just don't understand what this is like. Family and friends say, \"Just leave the a#$%%e\" as if we're just being idiots and they have zero sympathy for what it must be like for the sufferer. I hope you have a very merry Christmas and hope the new year brings new special memories to hold onto. You are not alone.", "hash": "f3f296cec6657481b03ae236d32ac9b5d0c37c94083088c5ecc3fd61ae6eb1e4"}

I'm not 100% sure why my husband takes his Risperidon. The only way I was able to get him to go to the psychiatrist was by promising I would go to one as well to help me with my imagined infidelity/lying problems. I never wound up going because two GPs wouldn't give me a referral as they believed this would make my husband's beliefs stronger. The psychiatrist that my husband sees agreed on that point so I never went. Even though he believes he was never the problem, I think his psych explained that the medication would rid him of the physical symptoms of his anxiety and generally make him feel better. In answer to the \"did the meds help\" question - yes and no. Yes, it has calmed him down and there have been no fresh accusations for 4-5 months. No, in that I had hoped his meds would provide him with insight to know that I never cheated on him. I just can't get past it without being released from my imaginary crimes. He is going to ask his dr next week if he can come off the meds or lower the dosage because he doesn't feel the side effects are worth it. Side effects for him are: - absolutely no libido - he's never experienced that in his life before - flat emotions/doesn't get joy from anything much - no motivation to get anything done If he does go off them, it will be interesting to see if his delusional beliefs come back in full force.

Hubby (ex) has been on the Risperidone for 10+ months now. No change in his beliefs. I often wonder if his extremely fixed ideas would be different without key 'facts' or would a DDJ sufferer just make other things key 'facts'? For example, my husband's 'absolute proof' moment was initially a lie detector test that gave an incorrect result. Then, it was a video that I apparently put on his phone of me having sex with someone else. The video couldn't be found even with restore deleted images apps. There was however a still frame image of the video and the woman doesn't even look like me. Another piece of undeniable proof, was an audio recording one morning that he set up in secret outside out bedroom. There was a faint noise that could have been a neighbour but more likely, it was our small dog snoring. That was interpreted as me sneaking someone in and having sex with them. Funny thing is that around the time of that recording, you can hear me talking to a man. The man I was talking to was my husband. You can hear his distinctive voice clearly but he still believes that I had someone there. More recently (aka yesterday), he said his definitive proof was a short recording from our security camera several months ago. The early morning recording in question showed a light coloured shadow moving slowly across our front pathway. I watched it. My guess is that it was a headlight from someone's car. At an absolute stretch, I guess it could have been a large white dog but it was so blurry, you really couldn't make anything out. Apparently, that video shows me having sex with someone outside on our front garden path. He does not think any of these 'proof' moments are irrational thinking at all.

She hasn’t been officially diagnosed or seen a doctor about this, but here’s some history: Firstly I have to avoid going into specifics just in case she ever reads this, and shall refer to her as “Mo”, which isn’t her real name. Around a decade ago “Mo” was assaulted by a guy she’d started seeing. While she only confided this part recently I believe it to be 100% genuine because it’s entirely plausible, fits the timeline, everything appears to stem from this event, and it doesn’t have any of the characteristics common to her delusions. Also she’s always been a very forthright, straight up and honest person aside from the delusional behaviour. Seven years later Mo naively confided this in a friend, who knew the guy in question. This person didn’t believe Mo’s story, accused her of making false allegations, and then proceeded to embark on a passive aggressive campaign of slut shaming and gaslighting on social media. It was a few weeks after this (around 2016) that Mo first began exhibiting symptoms of paranoia. Initially she appeared to be manifesting the non-bizarre persecutive variant, but recently it’s expanded to include grandiose delusions and erotomania. Subsequent to the onset of all this she began smoking weed to “calm her nerves”, and this most certainly seems to be exacerbating the problem. Aside from the delusions Mo functions normally, but certain aspects are starting to intrude on her life and career. She’s also started to broadcast these delusions to more and more people. The delusions clearly aren’t true as they stretch plausibility too much. While the story remains mostly consistent it keeps growing arms and legs, and more and more people are now identified as persecuting her. It seems only a matter of time before I am perceived as joining her ranks. The delusion has gradually expanded from just the friend who originally shamed her, to a millionaire sportsman from overseas who is paying a team of hackers to persecute her because she reject him, an Instagram model, hundreds of followers that these people have across social media, to an international web of conspiracy that includes any cameras and microphones she comes into contact with. More recently a second faction of world famous rock stars has begun defending her honour against the evil masses, one of whom is a band member in REDACTED who is now her secret ‘boyfriend’. All this has been communicated subliminally over social media, where the whole drama apparently plays out, and also via the radio etc. It’s literally everywhere, and she is right at the centre of all this action. It is impossible to reason with her, she admits it all ‘sounds crazy’ but is adamant that it can’t be because it’s all true. She’s been regularly expressing suicidal thoughts, although this depends on here mood, which depends of who is ‘winning’ this Instagram war. At the moment I have the impression that she’s too important to humanity to harm herself. I managed to get her mind off it all for a while last year, and she admits now that she was considering that it could all be down to her mental health... but then she spilled part of the tale to some other people who tried their best to politely humour her, and now she ‘realises’ that the notion of her being delusional was ‘nonsense’ because these people immediately brought her plight to the attention of REDACTED, mobilising it against her detractors. As if. She has even gone so far as to report all this to the police, who recommended that she see a doctor, but she won’t. Does anyone have any suggestions as how I can encourage her to see a doctor? She never goes to a doctor with anything, not even when she’s ill. Her parents are completely unaware of all this. She rightly keeps it from then in order to avoid upsetting them as they are old and infirm, so that avenue is out. She has confided heavily in one other friend whom I know of, but don’t actually know personally. I could contact this person but if word ever got back to Mo then that wouldn’t play well. The problem has become apparent to some other people she interacts with, and together we’re trying to manage it all as best we can. It might be possible to arrange for the people who humoured her last year to come back and verbally inform her that they are not actually involved in mounting a campaign in her defence, but I suspect that might go badly, or she’d have some way of explaining/denying it.

Years later, she was now accusing her brother-in-law (her sister's husband) of selling the video on the dark web. This was a family of attorneys, and they were struggling with the accusations. According to the guest, who is about 50, a few years ago, she suddenly remembered the assault, a memory which she had suppressed. Her niece said that a few years back, the woman appeared normal, and she had good relationships with her family. From listening to the woman, it sounds like her delusion grew to include her brother-in-law as a result of her \"piecing things together\" and \"trying to figure it out\". I gritted my teeth. My DD relative frequently uses those phrases. At the end of the episode, Dr. Phil announced that he believed the woman has a delusional disorder, specifically the persecutory type. (I was surprised, because I had seen two other episodes where a guest appeared to have DD, and he blamed their beliefs on mold in their home.) He offered her help from a company that offers treatment. I didn't catch the name of the company, but one or two reps appeared briefly on the show to say that they thought they could improve her condition with treatment. I understood the family's frustration as they described the woman's behavior. But I felt that Dr. Phil was being exploitative when he yelled at the woman for not bringing evidence of her claims. The audience applauded in response to his yelling, while the camera showed the woman looking sad. He could have edited out those few seconds before the show aired. He should know that shaming someone isn't going to provide the safe environment that the victim needs for trusting people. I hope that the show gives an update on this family in the future. It's so rare that DD is referenced in the media.", "hash": "0ba6f9418b613f9ec178a7eabe7234650aa0fb555e010526352b3ed1a3c38db8"}

Her delusional disorder began 10 years ago, at age 68, and at first she though her then-husband was having multiple affairs, and that he was sanding her furniture. A couple years later, with her poor husband enduring weekly accusations, she thought he was going to kill her and she left, and thankfully her doctor convinced her to admit herself to a geriatric psychiatric unit, where she stayed for 2 weeks. The doctors there referred to her delusions as 'fixed' and tried anti-psychotics, but the medication didn't change her delusions at all. My mom and her husband divorced, which was strongly encouraged by the psychiatric hospital experts, and which my sister and I were relieved about because we could see the stress on her husband, a dear man who was then in his 70s. She moved to an apartment on her own, and became convinced he was still entering all the time, to damage her furniture or move things around, or take things, to then return them later. There are so many other things she was suspicious of, too many to list here. She spent money on cameras and door alarm monitoring. Anyway, a few years ago, she said her apartment has fleas, but get this, her dog did not! She still spent hundreds of dollars on flea treatments. She even took what she thought were flea carcasses to a dermatologist, and was told she has delusions. (She's received that diagnosis from various doctors, to no avail) She started to say her ex-husband is blowing dust and fleas on her through holes in the ceiling, and that he lives in the apartment above her. A few months later, she said she had the fleas under control, but then earlier this year, she started saying she now has mites all over her body. She puts various tree oils and who knows what else all over herself, and does a lot of laundry. She caused a rash on her face, probably from putting various 'treatments' on. And now she also picks at her imaginary mites. A month ago, she suddenly signed a new lease with a new apartment, saying she has to get away from her ex-husband (who, in actuality, is in his 80s now, can't walk well, and lives hours away from her). We worked very hard to help her move, though she didn't consult with me about whether it was convenient, and yet we knew with 100% certainty that moving would not stop her delusions. Sure enough, it's been just 2 weeks since the move and a few days ago she told me her ex-husband lives in the apartment above her. She still thinks she has mites, and she's also developed olfactory and auditory hallucinations. She thinks she hears her ex-husband whistling, and gets angry with us when we say we can't hear anything. And she thinks she smells vapors or fumes that he's blowing on her somehow. We're hopeful that the new place she moved to, which has independent apartments, but also has assisted living services, will place barriers on her behavior, or somehow enforce mental health treatment. We'll see. I'm also 100% certain that even if her ex-husband passes away before she does, she will still think he's tormenting her, or that he's hired people to do it after his death.", "hash": "04ae26292de34ea3cf5a52488bc8e695bde491c998772922c2ba574335b248d3"}

To cut a very long story short I have been accused of having an affair and committing fraud for the past two years. It started suddenly one day and has been relentless ever since. Initially he was manic and psychotic for over two months and he frightened me so much that I got the police involved. He thought he was being chased and filmed on the motorway and followed into work with people breaking into his house and moving things just to unnerve him. He comes and goes as he pleases and at times is quite scary as he is verbally aggressive. He had an affair four years ago which I forgave, he didn’t apologise and I feel he is projecting his guilt into me. I am also accused of staring at men younger than my sons all the time and am told that I’m embarrassing for doing this. The person I’m accused of having the affair with is a random estate agent I met a few times when selling my house and this person is also accused of recruiting me to commit the fraud. I’ve left him so many times but then feel sorry for him as ‘he isn’t well’. I’m told by his family that he had a very similar psychotic episode when he split with his first wife but this only lasted about six months - this was four years before he met me. He told me himself when we met that his wife had an affair but she wouldn’t admit it but if she had then they would have been ok - he’s used the exact same words to me too! I’m told by his sister that he had an affair when he was married - two years before he accused his wife of doing the same. My question is that if I just let him go and he met someone else (which he keeps threatening to do as he constantly tells me that I don’t love him) would he just get better? I’m thinking that this may be the kindest thing to do for him, as much as I love him I am the total focus of his delusion and probably being with me isn’t helping him. I add that he has lost a very good job and a 20 year career six months ago because of this and they paid him off to leave - this is also my fault apparently. He hasn’t accessed any help as he doesn’t see that he has a problem. It is all me and I’m just trying to make him think he’s going mad.

He would at times completely misinterpret very innocent actions and statements on my part. He would believe I was somehow insulting him or attacking him. How he could make that connection was beyond me. I stopped taking him with me to company events, because when we drove home, he said all the people there were looking down their noses at him. Early last year he started saying his exwife was here, following him around with her cop boyfriend. I was stunned, because she’s been dead for 12 years, and he didn’t believe me when I told him that. When I learned of her death many years ago, I did not mention it to him (no point). Last year he was diagnosed with a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. I did everything in my power to help with all his chemo and then a stem cell transplant. The lymphoma is in remission. The whole thing was pretty hard. Then, this morning, he told me his exwife was back to stalking him and that a cop had been following him. He said he called the state police to complain. ENOUGH. I told him his ex had been dead since 2006. He said he didn’t believe that, and I was wrong. I told him his brain was playing tricks on him, and that I was going to find the obituary and bring it home. So I printed it out, along with some other information on delusional disorder. He does not believe the obituary. He thinks its faked. He continues to believe she is alive and stalking him. I told him this is a sign of a mental health issue and he needs to get it checked out. I also printed out the phone number of the behavioral health clinic with our health insurance. I don’t think he believes anything I say. This year we will be married 22 years.

For a long time my hope was based on delusional love, now it's based mostly in reality, although at times I struggle with how I think. I have learned that if I think of trauma with acceptance it is easier to live with it and the memory of my delusions. Helpful stuff: Coping skills help. Therapy helps. Medication helps.

Take classes like family to family) Learn about LEAP = Listen Empathise Agree and Partner Don't confront the delusion to argue, but don't agree either. Try to be kind, but firmly hold onto reality and keep your trueth, just no need to pursue the disagreement. For instance: \"You [insert delusional acusation].\" - person with lived experience \"I hear you saying that you feel [insert acusation], I'm sure you must feel [appropriate description of a response to the accusation]. I feel terrible, but I did not [insert delusional acusation] as you remember. Will you talk to someone who may have insight who can help us solve this issue?\" - the sane person.

I would like to know what type of clinical diagnosis such an experience may correspond and how a psychological disorder may lead to such an experience ? An afternoon a person wants to make a trip of two subway stations, it enters the metro train at station S , during the trip the person notices that the time to travel the two stations is quite long and that it did not notice that the other times it took this trip. It also notices that this day the lightning is weak and unstable and that are quite few peoples in the carriage. However after the two stations trip the station name is again S . The person doesn't immediately realize the inconsistency, instead it instantly thinks it took the wrong direction, so it goes out, quits the platform and follows the panels to the \"good\" direction, and after a short trip inside the station it is back to the same platform. It finally realizes that it is still at the same station S waiting for the train. Obviously, this life episode should not be possible, but this is what the person experienced from its point of view. So the person concludes that it lives in a simulation and there was a glitch, or that it experienced a delusion. The person never noticed any other inconsistencies in its life, and has no way to know what really happened. The only thing that is sure is that this episode lasted at most a few minutes, it didn't monitor the time precisely as there was no foreseeable reason to do that.", "hash": "dbc6df200b3ad1413d993eb9ad844da8fdadebc7be768497aceaf6e29046457e"}

I have had quite a few experiences like this, always after a trauma, not random, but pretty much as you describe in various situations. This is our theory. We are not professors and do not know what this disorder would be labelled as so we call it delusions: The subconscious brain overlaps the conscious brain. Like a miswire, crossed connection either by chance, an outside occurance or drugs. The subconscious brain then influences and tricks the conscious brain. The lights look dimmer, is the journey time longer than usual? Uncertainty and confusion leaking into the conscious mind... next the person sees train station S twice although in reality they only saw it once. The conscious mind becomes confused and believes what the subconscious made it see. It then gets off the train feeding the delusion. And an overall weird twilight zone effect is experienced. If it's only happened once then that is probably due to tiredness. More than once and perhaps there is an underlying issue. That is my opinion but obviously a professional is needed to decide that properly.

We live in Seattle and was taking cbd pills for Lyme disease related issues. The treat for Lyme was negative but she firmly believed that was her malady. She suffered physical abuse and multiple rapes during her teenage years. She worked sporadically over the past 10 years and would sleep sometimes 20 hrs per day. She developed a liking for the host tucker and I began to notice an attraction when he came on the screen. While odd we have been married 17 years so I really didn’t note any special significance other than a crush. As the days and weeks passed she eventually started to make gestures to him on the tv and would lookout the window. She had passed from crush to full on in love in a matter of days. I noticed she wanted to talk to Me about her desires towards him and would go into full detail about how he could see Her and she posed nude for him. I was angry and jealous. I thought by listening it was her talking it out and it would Pass. But it got deeper. She would go outside and wait for him. Because of a way he looked at the Screen/her. The more upset I got the more she retreated into her own world with him. She would use ky and go outside for A quickie with him. He never showed up. I tried to Explain how stupid this all was. She then Began to think he was coming in the apt at night and having intercourse with her. I asked how he got in and why I didn’t see him and she replied that he had to drug her so she wouldn’t remember him because of his fame. It was then that I realized that this was more than a fantasy. Suffice to say That she said that I allowed tucker to come in to The room and acted as the pimp for hundreds of other men. I was shocked and either I wanted her to go or she did for a rape analysis. We drove to the hospital where the er team had the svu officer come By to help.her story was odd to them and I told them about the tucker issue. They didn’t do a rape kit and said she was suffering with delusional behavior. We left with a referral to a shrink. She refused to go and the cycle continued with her saying .I was pimping her out to tucker and his friends. I read some on erotomania and shared it with her family. She ran out of the car in early may to find tucker and I called the police and informed them that I was very concerned blah blah. She was put into a mental hospital for two weeks. I had to testify against her to get her help. On the advice of a friend in the hospital they decided a crush is no big deal. She started to refuse my calls. I still went to see her and it was there she Told me that I had her locked up, pimped her out and she wanted a divorce. Upon release she left her wedding ring in the hospital as a sign of her hate and disgust For me. She still lives with me, refuses psychiatric help and is making my life worse than hell. She ridicules and belittles me. Demands money from petty cash. Calls me her driver. She actually kisses her iPad when tucker is on there. Talks to him like he is actually there. She has become arrogant and snobby. To prepare for her life with him. He won’t allow her to dress certain ways in public. She tells the story of her pimp husband to strangers everywhere. The weird thing is she can put together an act that fools people. She’s very pretty and is convinced that I am now Satan’s son. God does not like me. My dead parents are ashamed of me. God has appointed her to rewrite the New Testament. Etc.... every couple of days I try to speak to her. She asks if she’s on a game show or reality tv. She covered the bathroom mirror with my winter jacket for some reason. She talks about divorcing which I am fine with. Her family won’t help. Other than a cursory email. I see no end to this. We are now getting evicted because she smoked in the apt 3 times after warning. Sorry this is so long. But other than me moving and ditching her , I’m at a loss. Today I was supposed to think about what I did to her and be prepared to confess. I stay 3 to 4 he’s over at work every night. Her days are spent watching tucker and preparing for her new life. She is also A Consultant for trump Obama John McCain before and after death. She is friends with the Fox people and actually gets in cat fights over tucker.

She showed depressed facies and moderate psychomotor retardation, and expressed suicidal thoughts. For eight months she had been increasingly abusive toward her family, suspicious of their motives, fre- quently berated her husband for not working and accused the neighbours of spying on her. As a result of her behaviour, two daughters stil living at home had moved away. Hf.r symptoms had improved for two months when her husband obtained part-time work, but became even more intolerable when he returned to retirement. Concurrent with her paranoid symptoms were increasing symptoms of depression: feelings of sadness, los of energy and ambition, feelings of help- lessness and hopelessness, weight los, dificulty in sleeping, somatic preoccupation and suicidal rumina- tions.

She hates me for putting her in there. (Don’t blame her) it’s horrid. She wanted to know why and I told the truth which she didn’t want to hear.

He is Bipolar 1 and has had difficulties with psychosis, mania and depression many times during our life together. He has a tendency to think women are attracted to him, and are coming on to him. The last woman this happened with started in 2010. She attended our church and works at the same place he does, though not in the same department. He started to talk to her before church started. She is in the choir. Then, it moved on to emailing her a lot. He has done this other times. Emailing a few women he thought he was having a relationship with. Some of it was sexual in content. I don't know specifics about the content with this last one. He hasn't given them to me. But, in 2011, she had their employer warn him to stay away from her. The end of 2012, he became manic and phoned her. She had him arrested and ended up getting a restraining order against him. She then got a permanent restraining order against him in 2014. This woman was just one of many women who he was convinced was attracted and coming on to him. Recently, I had a conversation with him about this. He is totally convinced that these women were attracted to him. I know for a fact none of these women ever were interested in him. Obviously, the last woman made it extremely clear. Unfortunately, he thinks her husband made her arrest him and get a restraining order against him. Is this erotomania? Is it possible to talk sense into him? Make him see that none of these so-called attractions were real? He is a professor in a university. Recently, he told me that an attractive, young woman in his class flirted with him. But \"he did not take the bait, and pursue it.\" He was quite proud of himself. I am very upset. I am sure that was not at all what happened. 20 year olds do not come on to 58 yr old men who look 75. I am worried that he could lose his job if he did \"act\" on an imagined come on. He almost lost his job twice because of the last woman with the restraining order. Sorry this is so long. Does this sound like Erotomania?", "hash": "d61d4c7f5ffad551f99f1d45ce90912c027a5215c39ecbc2003007228a68c84e"}

She's always been a little odd - a little paranoid, but about 8 or so years ago my stepfather died and she went totally off the rails. She moved into a townhouse, and then became convinced that the neighbors were out to get her. She thought they poisoned her dog, she thought they had bugged the townhouse, she thought they were pumping poison in through the air conditioner, that they were talking to the property manager to get her evicted, etc. etc.. I lived in a different state at that time and believed that maybe she had some bad neighbors (I mean, I knew they weren't poisoning her, but I could believe that maybe they were unpleasant). So she moved to a house in a different neighborhood, and again the same kind of delusions popped up, except now she was convinced she was hearing them talk about her, and somehow she became convinced that the old neighbors knew the new neighbors. She was overwrought with anxiety a lot of the time. Finally convinced her to see a geriatric psychiatrist, but she bitched about it, because she didn't think that there was anything wrong with her, and she wasn't compliant with med. So...I moved to another part of the country to start a new job, and because I was so stressed out from not being able to help from a distance I moved her up here too. First it took months to get her moved out of my house into her apartment (finally happened with something of a scene - she paid rent for four months without once sleeping in her apartment). Within a month, the paranoia set in again. Took her to a psychiatrist multiple times, but she incorporated the psychiatrist into her delusions. Moved her to a totally secure beautiful condo - doorman building, private garage, etc. - and she is convinced these neighbors are mafia and drug dealers and that they know the old evil neighbors. She thinks they are destroying her hearing, that they're trying to drill through her ceiling to abduct her, and that they are shooting lasers at her to make her blind (through the floor, ceiling, walls) but that aluminum foil can protect her. She also had a delusion involving my aunts, so now isn't speaking to them. This winter I caught her sleeping in her car to avoid the neighbors, took her to the ER, and she was committed for a short stay, but after 3 or 4 days when she wouldn't sign herself in, they let her out. Then a new psychiatrist, drugs that seem to do nothing, and she won't take anything that would make her sleepy because she feels like she needs to be vigilant all night. She spends almost all day everyday at my house, which drives my husband and kids crazy because it is just one thing about the neighbors after another. It stresses me out and depresses me. I have no family to help shoulder the load on this. I hate it because she could be having a nice life, but she's making herself miserable for no reason. I know she's hiding things from me because she knows I don't believe people are out to get her - like she asked a friend to take her to a hotel last night to get away from the neighbors, or that she sleeps in her closet sometimes. If you look at her, she seems put together - nicely dressed, pays her bills, drives, highly articulate and intelligent. She does have some short term memory issues the last year or two leading to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, but it is pretty mild. I feel so hopeless. I can't help her. She doesn't get better. She is petrified of being by herself, but it is impossible to have her move in with us because it is so hard to hear the paranoid ranting all day. She called the police on the neighbors the other day, and I had to go behind her and call them the next day when I found out, to explain her diagnosis and that the people upstairs aren't actually doing anything wrong... Sorry for unloading, it is just so hard right now. Anyone have advice? Or can let me know I'm not alone? Thanks.", "hash": "9a189851c9f1e134404c4cac80ceacefaa51cb64f7ddad4bb40528645439d090"}

I know how it feels to have nearly that exact scenario and it's so unusual and heavy that you can't really talk about it to people because it's too much. My husband and kids are supportive, but I try to shield them from the responsibility and burden. Thankfully, I can call my sister to vent once in a while, but she lives very far away. My mom is also in her 70s, and we've been dealing with her delusions for the past 9 years. She was married to a nice man, they'd been together for about 30 years. But suddenly she began to think he was damaging her furniture or knotting up the fringe on her blanket or scratching her paintings. Really weird stuff. Though, she also thought he was having multiple affairs with neighbors or even acquaintances of mine. Three years into her delusions, during which I'd been conferring with doctors, elder specialists, and talked her into seeing a counselor, there was no change. Then she snapped and thought her husband was going to kill her. She called police and then was willing to go to a geriatric psych unit for two weeks. They, like previous doctors, diagnosed psychosis with delusions. But she refuses that diagnosis and won't take medications. She is now divorced and living in an apartment. She has become more vocal about her suspicions, telling her friends that her ex-husband is stalking her, that he enters her apartment to damage her things all the time. She spends money on surveillance, cameras, and alarm system. She complains to her apartment manager and calls police occasionally about the 'break-ins', and the police have contacted us so we can share information. The police agree that she's got all her abilities - paying bills, keeping her apartment nice, etc. She's super smart, funny, very pretty, and stylish. This brain illness is so tragic. She says she wants to move to get away from her ex-husband (who we still keep in contact with and help take care of, but in secret from her - so complicated). I know I can't stop her from moving to another city if she ends up really planning that, but I also know that wherever she goes, some delusion will be there always. Even if her ex-husband died, I know she'd still believe he's somehow hired someone to break in, or blow dust on her, even beyond his death. The staff at the psychiatric unit where she was in 2012 let us know that we can set limits on what we allow in our house. So if she starts talking about her delusions, I don't engage and I tell her I'll have to take her home if she continues. I've talked recently with county elder specialists, and they, too, told me to guard my own peace of mind. The professionals said I cannot let my mom's upset affect my life, and that I can't ease her discomfort. It's hard for me, because I really wish I could help her. I've tried so many ways, to no avail. So now I see her about once every 10 days, help her get groceries, or sort papers, or take her to lunch. We connect by text or phone every few days and I listen to her current suspicions because I want to keep tabs on her actions. She does keep secrets from me because she knows I don't believe her, but sometimes she lets something slip, like a new suspicion, or that she's filed a new complaint somewhere. I used to think my mom could live with us when she got older, but not now. Her being so upset is unpredictable and troubling, and being with her is full of tension, with us guarding against what topic she's about to bring up. She's not violent, but I don't know what her delusions could bring her to do. When she stayed here for 3 nights recently because of a minor medical procedure, I locked my bedroom door at night (our kids are at college). I feel for you, and it's helpful for me to hear that there are others experiencing this with a parent, too.", "hash": "6177ca8b241fb67b82f66d792ce9e394c171cdd4687f8ad5af2a56946e998457"}

My delusions became so bad because I believed people were trying to hurt me like your mother feels and I wound up committing a crime so I could get to a \"safe place\" where they couldn't easily get to me. I was very resistant to taking medication because my delusions were so real to me and know one understood that they were real so I became very secretive about it. I am on a regimen of Loxapine and Klonopin which help with the symptoms. I have been delusional free for two years now and I am trying to reestablish my life. The best advice I could offer is to get her a therapist to work with her. Someone that she can trust and talk to about what is going on. The worst thing is for her to keep it inside because the behaviors will escalate if she is convinced these things are going on. I was fortunate to have a good therapist who went through my delusions one by one and brought me back from over the edge. I was lost for 10 years and destroyed my life but am in the process of rebuilding. Don't give up on her she can be helped. Delusional disorder is hard to treat because generally people deny they are delusional. Everything you described I experienced and it was a living hell to have those feelings. Be persistent about getting her treatment. There are no support groups out there for this disorder so psychotherapy is your best bet. Shop around to find the right fit for her, someone she trusts. That is the key because you are suspicious about everyone. Good Luck Colleen", "hash": "060f994b46b7a3f12a6476c318782fb76fd208409b57c22842c9108020be824a"}

Sorry to hear you're having such a hard time with your Mum. Unfortunately my situation is quite similar, but without the hubby and kids. My Mum is 72 and the delusional disorder started around 15 years ago. She has also always been a bit paranoid. My Mums delusions are very similar. She thinks one of the neighbours has bugged the house and is harming her through the electrics/wifi (sending shocks etc). My Mum also believes aluminium foil or a baking tray can protect her. My brother lives abroad so it's just me. It's very, very hard. These aren't my words, but they are from another carer for someone with a mental illness and sum things up pretty well. They described the situation as 'heartbreaking, isolating and testing to the soul'. The situation weighs very heavily on you and takes a huge toll. The paranoid ranting is very hard. My Mums issues were always 'episodes', but this current episode has lasted since May and is not going away. To be honest, the fact that her illness was episodic kept me going as I knew that the DD would eventually go away and there would be a period of respite, however brief. Also my Mum has started to get more 'manic' and irrational about normal thing and has a lot of mood swings. She got massively stressed out and irrational about cleaning the living room earlier. You'd think it was a cesspit, it isnt... She's also been quite mean recently....it seems like I do nothing right which is devastating when you're going through hell to support someone you care about. My Mum has tried almost every antipsychotic out there and as soon as she reaches an efficacious dose the side effects (fatigue, sleepiness) become intolerable. I'm sorry I can't be more positive about the situation, but at least we're not entirely alone in this. I'm in the UK and would really like to get in touch with others dealing with this.

But it also saddens me that you are unable to find a solution for your mother's condition. Cuz I am in the same boat as you. My story is I am 28 years old I just had surgery which requires to me to be in a wheelchair for extended time so I moved in with my mom while I recover. My mom is married but her husband and her do not live together they still talk and hang out occasionally and they never had the best relationship so fighting was a common thing between them. but after being here a few months I started to notice things were off with my mom, my mom is 55 years old. She is the same as yours well put together very smart outside looking in you won't even notice a problem.then she started talking about how her husband his name is Jason was spying on her bugging the house, writing random letters all over to mess with her, listening to her via the TV or a speaker, saying he learned all this stuff through international website that he translates with apps. At first I thought maybe he was messing with her in a certain degree and she wishes taking it out of context but then I started really digging into what she was saying and I would prove everything wrong and yet it still wouldn't resonate with her. I could tell her and show her what she was experiencing was just a app and that's what it does but she always correlated it to something he was doing against her. And now it is only getting worse she is convinced that he is planning something big in her new delusion is that he is trying to convince me that she is crazy so I can't even discuss that a possibility of her not being okay and needs help because she thinks that he is winning.the other night she knocked on my door at 1 a.m. and was super energized and said look I can show you I found them I got it and she was show me a piece of wood she was saying in that used to be part are they shelf and she was look look. She was showing me a blank piece of wood and she owes look right there look at those letters. But there was no letters there and this really shocked me this is when it really dawned on me this is more serious and I thought that my mom truly needs help. I'm a firefighter paramedic and I see psychiatric patients all the time but my job is to take him to the hospital I don't know what to do after this. I can't talk to my mom about this because she just thinks her husband is winning and that's what he's trying to do she is convinced and there's nothing I can say to help her. it breaks my heart so much that people struggle with this for so long without any answers or solutions. It seems to be like my next step would be tried to convince her to go get help which I do not know if that will be possible. Or even if it is possible for me reading post it seems like sometimes that doesn't even help possible now I am very torn on what do I do once I am able to get out of this wheelchair and go back to work and go back to my place. Do I leave her to deal with this on her own I can't imagine doing that to her but I don't know what else I can do to help her I am so lost right now.", "hash": "cd098059aa746a3c4a8c178134f7f50cf3f2e66a44e6f128540f0f23cb9d0a12"}

I have been reading everyone else's posts on this topic and while I've accepted what is happening and why, I wanted to do a mind dump for others to read before they become the same fragile mess I have become. This will be a long post but hoping that it helps others and also hoping that getting it all down will be therapeutic for me as well. Here goes: My husband and I have been together for 17 years, married for 2. We always had a difficult relationship because we are very different people who really just came together accidentally. That is important in our back story but it's the last two years that have nearly killed me emotionally. About 3 years ago, while I was working away from home, the distance did amazing things for our relationship and we fell madly in love with each other for the first time since the early days. When my work wrapped up, things just got better and better - I never thought I could love this man as much as I did. When I was driving across the country on my way home, the kids and he were using my computer to check where I was as it was a two day drive and I always keep my Google location services on. On my second day of travel, my husband rang and said he'd been up all night worrying as apparently Google maps showed that I didn't go home to my apartment on my second last night. I laughed it off because when you look at the 'pings' on google, you could see quite clearly that I did go home even if the main map made it look like I hadn't. My husband mostly accepted what I said but he was actually dwelling on it. No matter how I explained it, he started analyzing other things. Things like: - Why sometimes I was cold on the phone when working away (this was mainly because refused to get a job and I was getting cranky about making the sacrifice of working away from him and the kids and despite the excellent pay, it didn't really get us ahead because he wasn't working and was using marijuana on a daily basis). Also, he has always had a habit of being a bit stalky with repeated phone calls for no particular reason and I had other things to do. I should also mention that my best friend of 30 years was on her death bed with a brain tumor and iI was a bit of mess over this. - Why did it take me so long to clean my 1 bedroom apartment before packing up - I wanted my bond back and knew how particular agents could be with bond cleaning so I cleaned everything meticulously. These discussions were initially very low key events but over time, my husband developed a couple of theories. First theory was that I met someone out and didn't go home one night because I spent the night with the guy. Once that was debunked, the theory was that I met someone in the basement of the apartment complex and then regularly left my unit to go and spend the night with him. That theory fizzled so then he started focusing on cars at the local shopping centers that had number plates from the state my work was based in. The theory was that the guy I was having an affair with moved his entire family up here to be close to me so we could sneak quickies in whenever we wanted. After a while, he found a guy in our area to fixate on. This guy apparently looked weirdly at him and I in the supermarket and someone similar to his description was seen on our street one night. The guy he fixated on was a parent at the kids school and he went around to their house to talk to the wife. He found out that the guy worked as a miner FIFO so whenever he saw the guy was home from work, he started watching me and analyzing every thing I did and every move I made. Some of his evidence an accusations were: - The guy is tall and probably well endowed and sex wasn't as good any more because the man had stretched me. - I must have pubic lice because he'd seen me scratching even though this clearly wasn't the case. - Any song I listened to had hidden meaning because the guy had sent it to me. - A guy from my work sent me a message after we got engaged saying 'so, you've been swept off your feet?'. According to my husband, this had nothing to do with him - it must have been the imaginary affair guy. - One morning he found a small puddle of water on our front deck. This could only have been due to me getting up in the middle of the night, having sex with my lover and washing away the evidence. - Another morning, a small piece of timber had fallen off the top of our deck and this can only have been due to my tall lover pulling it off. - Some plants out the front half died. My lover must have peed on them. - I got sick last year with a kidney stone which resulted in a UTI. These two things must have happened because I'm sleeping around. - I am nearing menopause and was using extra large tampons. I discretely bought some personal lube to assist which he found and decided it was for my lover and I. - Hubby has had heart problems and at one stage, he asked the Dr if it could be that he's being poisoned. - When he takes the kids to school (round trip of 6 - 8 minutes), my lover is hiding nearby and we have sex while he's out. That is just some of it. I arranged and payed for a lie detector test and this is something I wish I had never done. I was so upset and stressed that the result came back inconclusive so in his eyes, this is also evidence that I am a lying, cheating #$%^. At one stage I had to take out a DVO because he was making me wear a fitbit to bed and night and he was getting pretty scary for a while. Happy to say that he is not violent and has never gotten physical with me. I'm embarrassed to say that I married him while this was all going on though it wasn't until after we got married that he became 100% convinced that I was cheating on him. Before that it was - 'now that we are engaged, I trust you' & 'once we are married....' etc. In 17 years, I have never even looked at another man and I have extremely high morals and standards. I have never cheated on anyone and never would. My husband used to look at me with love in his eyes and heart but now he just looks at me like I'm his worst enemy. Denials don't work. Arguing doesn't work. At the end of the day, he has a fixed belief that he knows what is going on and no matter what I say, I'm guilty. I have been a prisoner in my own home for over a year. I can go out if I really want but the repercussions aren't really worth it. If I take too long at the grocery shop, it means I've hooked up. If I stop to get fuel on the way back from my parents house, I've hooked up in a car park or somewhere public. If I shave my legs or wax my bikini line, it's obviously for my lover. I barely get any time alone and he has set up hidden recording devices around the house. One day, he listened to an audio recording that I think was the dog snoring, and I was accused of having someone here as the noises can only have been made by someone having sex. Another day, he asked (yelled) me why I had put a video of myself having sex with my lover on his phone. He had deleted the video and couldn't show me but he says it was videoed on his phone from a site like YouPorn. Apparently, I have uploaded these videos of myself to youporn. As I'm writing this, my other half is meeting with a psychiatrist. I don't know how this will play out but he agreed to go on the condition that I also go and get checked our for a personality order like bi-polar or something because he believes I'm a compulsive liar and narcissist because of what he thinks I'm doing to him. He has only really gone to prove that I have a problem so I don't think it's going to help. I will post updates as events unfold. At this stage, I don't believe we have a future and we are planning to separate. Main reason is that I just can't deal with it anymore. I have not done a single thing wrong, yet I feel guilty every time I do something that he may read something into. I feel unloved, disrespected, emotionally drained and my health hasn't been great since this all started. I think we are at the point of having a very toxic relationship and it's not doing either of us any good. I guess the most frustrating thing for me is the no-end arguments where he keeps telling me that 'he knows what's going on' and there is nothing wrong with him at all.", "hash": "026258e4cff2fcf13b2365bf406038db0e3db4654a2b233a341f22bd30f64b9c"}

We both had individual appts with our relationship counsellor yesterday and she advised me (and said she also advised him) that due to the toxic nature of our relationship, if something doesn't give, she is going to have to get Child Protection involved. She is encouraging me to move out or make him move out though this isn't something he would ever do. I sat him down when I got home and we discussed the planned separation. I told him that I'm moving out asap and the kids will have their home base with me but he can see them whenever he wants. Naturally this wasn't taken very well and a huge argument followed. I am extremely confused now. He is now trying to convince me that the affair he has accused me of having has never really been the problem. The problem is that he believes someone is stalking around our house and has been in our house and if I know nothing about it, then it must be someone who means harm. I tried to rationalize with him on this. Nothing has been stolen and no property damage except for a couple of half dead plants outside have happened. Why would someone be stalking us? Why haven't our cameras caught this person? Why haven't our neighbors seen anything? He doesn't have any answers but most of his evidence of this is all a bit fuzzy. Two things of about 20 could mean someone has been hanging around but someone is home here 95% of the time, so it all sounds a bit unlikely. The two things are quite substantial. 1. He has an outdoor camera he had placed around the side of the house. One day he brought it in (only out for a day) and he discovered the memory card was missing. Obviously this is sus but it disappeared when we were home and it's weird that the camera didn't get taken as well as it was just sitting there. There are only 3 possibilities: - Around that day the electric meter checking guy was around. The camera was on the meter box. We have some junk in that part of the yard. Perhaps he was poking around the junk and realised the camera was there and took the card so we didn't see what he was doing. - Hubby forgot to put the card in - they are very tiny and would be easy to misplace - Someone is stalking us 2. Some of our outdoor downlights (solar) have switches on them that have apparently been turned off. No idea about either of these two things but as mentioned, these are the only two substantial things he has seen. The rest are as stated in the first post but include plants that have half died, footsteps around the side (pretty much proved to be our large dog), solar light falling off the gutter, small bit of wood falling off the top of the front deck, puddle on the front deck, side fence has started leaning a bit. He says there's lots of other things but hasn't actually told me them. Anyway, I don't know whether he is just scrambling with this new revelation (about the problem not being me potentially having an affair) to keep me here or whether I'm going mad and I've been dwelling for a long time on the accusations and I'm the one who has kept it going. Logic tells me that I'm not going mad because he often splurts random accusations though often quite cryptic. Eg \"You like your men BIG\" (Hubby is not particularly tall but he is lean and fit) or \"The door handle is warm as if you've been hanging on to it watching for me to come home (sometimes he'll say that I'm being mounted by my other man while hanging onto it). I think I've become a bit acclimatized to the comments now because when I read back that last comment, I realize how disgustingly sick it sounds.", "hash": "acdc60ac53694bd4011581c5616e88fb1302570ba2ecb2ad8bd1cca127c60d69"}

I'm sorry that you're going through this. I think that at this point a divorce--and moving away from your husband--will give you both some peace. From the stories I've read here, it seems that a very tiny few have made recoveries. Usually with a combination of medication and therapy. However, the obstacle to this treatment is \"lack of insight\" which accompanies DD. It's the inability for a DD sufferer to recognize that something's wrong with his or her thinking. Like your husband they think \"there's nothing wrong with me\", and they refuse to accept medication. If he won't accept medication, then there is NOTHING further you can do to help him. You can't fix him. At this point, you can only help yourself. You can do this by minimizing your contact with him; this will reduce your own anxiety that is caused by his behavior.", "hash": "3e7eb7d6d4d106a2e84148c62b7657de1b5f12e53466b27f7dd0723d267d530c"}

I bought another house and moved out of our family home 2 days ago. I cried a lot the last few weeks because I really didn't want to leave him. I had to for my own sake - I was getting more and more depressed and he interpreted my mental state as me having doubts as to whether I was doing the right thing. I know I did the right thing but it doesn't make it any easier. I don't know whether my current emotional state is due to this unresolved thing hanging over my head or because I grieving over my lost love. I am doing most things right though yesterday we sent each other a lot of silly flirty texts. I miss my husband but if I was still in the house, I would still miss him because he doesn't trust me or look at me with love anymore. Good news is that the psychiatrist prescribed Respiridon and while he ignored the prescription for the first couple of weeks, he did fill it and has been taking his tablets and has been to the psychiatrist 3 times with a 4th appt scheduled in 11 days time. I hope he goes. At the second visit, the psych told him that it's a pretty good bet that he has a mental health condition and privately told me that delusional jealousy was the likely culprit. Hubby doesn't believe still. The Risperidon isn't helping unfortunately. He took a low dose for the first couple of weeks (1mg) but now I think he's up to 3 or 4 mg. Hasn't had any impact - his beliefs may have actually become more concrete and he doesn't want me to talk about it to him at all. I understand that not talking about it would be better for him but god help me, I need closure. My moral compass is soooo strong and it makes me crazy knowing that someone in this world, worst still the person who knows me best believes I would do something like this. It's eating me up. I'm going to start daily yoga and meditation as soon as I have my boxes unpacked because I really need to find inner peace with this thing. At several times during my ordeal, I locked myself in our bathroom and curled up on the floor in complete despair. Luckily I never felt suicidal but I did have fleeting thoughts in times when I felt everything was hopeless. So glad I made it out while I still had a shred of sanity. I'll update in another week or so. On a lighter note, after a particularly sad day last week, I was curious just how my body could keep producing tears and nose goop. I collected three of my tissues and weighed them. 400g! Wow! No wonder my skin looks dry at the moment. I must have cried kilos over the last year PS If anyone is going through the same thing, drop me a line for a chat if you need someone to talk to. I am still on my journey despite moving out and I would love to help anyone who wants a mutually beneficial sounding board.", "hash": "8a904e77647498a6935af4f0c2d96698a20c60053657b370c8ca05bc14e0fa98"}

Actually, most days are bad. I am so miserable without him but know we can't be together anymore. I think the thing that is making me so sad is that I honestly thought he would come to his senses at some stage after i moved out, search his soul for the truth, then smother me with apologies for the way he has treated me before begging me to come back. Wow! I was living in a dream world, wasn't I? The reality is that his medication is for 'making him feel better and getting rid of the constant butterflies in his stomach' according to him whereas I was hopeful that it would make him think clearer and see the truth. I suppose he's right but in the meantime, he still thinks there's nothing wrong with him, I'm still a cheating, lying s%$t I have no company at all for 4 days every week and I'm obsessing over the whole thing. Worst of all, after I stood by this behaviour for 2 solid years, he's not here for me when I am literally falling apart. I can't talk to any friends about it because that would be speaking against him to common friends/family, I can't talk to my sister because she's been my sounding board and is sick of hearing about it and if I try to talk to him, he thinks I'm pathetic and tells me he's losing more respect for me each time I bring it up. I know that no one is going to ride up on a while horse and make everything better, but at this stage, I would be happy with a small pony coming to the rescue. I don't know if I'll be ok. I'm seeing a counsellor but she's away until early August. I probably need to go to the drs and discuss depression but that is not my style at all. I had post natal depression with my second child and I managed to pull myself out of it without medication and I'm hoping I can do the same this time. I really don't want any medication to fix me. I just want my husband back. And that puts me between a rock and a hard place because in the .01% chance he comes back from his delusional state and I let him, my family and few friends won't accept my decision due to what they think of him now. I've always made a point of telling them it's not his fault - it's the illness - but he hasn't always been a good partner and they are happy that I've finally left him. I'm just rambling today, sorry. It has just been such a hard thing to deal with.", "hash": "5876eaf14dc2513eccb458cb18c5d5c6aaab729aeb973be702ed75cb6f469f69"}

But I think you absolutely did the right thing in leaving. From reading about this illness over the last decade since my mom's brain went haywire, very few are able to see that they have the illness. And my mom has gotten much worse. My mom's suspicions are continual, no matter where she is, whether at home or visiting someone, and have gotten even stronger. Her delusions change and morph and she still rewrites conversations and occurrences, even ones she had a previous story for, they are now even more different. She has also now developed auditory and olfactory hallucinations, where she thinks her ex-husband (she hasn't even seen him in 7 years) is blowing a toxic vapor into her apartment, and he's also whistling or singing nearby, just to drive her crazy. In reality, he is now elderly and lives over 2 hours away. I tried telling her that, but now she says he's in her apartment building while using a walker. I dread the days that I visit with her when she says she \"has to tell me what's been going on\". She calls the police occasionally to report the \"break-ins\". The police have spoken with me and they have her on their crisis care list. She totally thinks they believe her. I know they are just trained to not refute a person with delusions. At the beginning, her delusions were jealousy-type. She accused her then-husband of having multiple affairs all over the place, once following him to the gym, and she wanted to confront a lady down the hall. Later, she began thinking he was going through her papers, and then later she began thinking he wanted to harm her. Anyway, I'm telling you this not to alarm anyone, but just to describe the progression this illness can take. We were so hopeful in the beginning when she had a hospital episode and was diagnosed, and was seeing a mental health person for quite a while, but her delusions never went away. It took us a few years to sort of fully realize our mom is permanently ill, and for the angst and stress over it all to dissipate. I saw a counselor for a while, just to come to grips with it, and to help establish my boundaries. I've spoken with a couple attorneys and mental health experts, and all have said there's nothing I can do. I consider my job now just to make sure she's okay, and we see her and try to be nice, but we limit the conversation topics, and limit the time we spend with her. It's all super sad. I hope you find peace, and someone or a mental health group to talk to. It's hard when this illness is so rare, with the seriously mentally ill person able to function otherwise, that others really can't understand what you're going through.", "hash": "c685b16a7c9771748de2544323bdf8d47cc768221548f44087efb64c1783c937"}

Your story is my story (almost word for word). I too have just made the decision to put myself and my children first and move out. It was too toxic. It never stopped. I am exhausted trying to defend myself and i am now at the point where i just loose my $#%^ at him whenever he brings up an accusation. So it was time to go. I told him I havent given up on him and I'll be here waiting for him when he can see things for what they really are. I know that my never happen. And I know my marriage is most likely over but I realise now after struggling and being tormented for 3 years that nothing i say or do will change my husbands mind about what I havent done. And I am slowly coming to the conclusion that my husband will never forgive me for something I didnt do. Its heartbreaking. I finally made the decision to get professional help for him and as of today it is completely out of my hands. He works away week on week off and last night shift he dudnt sleep for 3 days and completely went off the rails. Told me to ###$ off and get out of the house, that he loved me but I didnt deserve him and he was gone. Hes never said that and a big red flag went off in my head. \"I need to save my husband from himself - this really has nothing to do with me\" so I made the decision to call our local mental health community clinic. I told them my story of secret cameras, tracking my car, cloning my phone, the hours upon hours of studying the recordings, the 2 years of unemployment, the not coping with life, the daily wild accusations and imagined scenarios etc and the newest finding. METH. My husband was a pot smoker too and in searching for answers I tricked him into a urine test. He failed miserably and I was heartbroken. .. but it explained alot of his behaviours. Alot but not all. Here I was being accused of being a liar and a sneak, all the while my husband was sneaking ice into our house .. and I was unknowingly buying it for him. So right now, as we speak a revision board is being assembled to assess my case and within the next 7 days my husband will have his rights taken away from him and he will be taken by ambulance to the hospital to be assessed and treated. I feel sick about it. I want to throw up. I know he will see this as the ultimate betrayal but I know I've exhausted all other options. This man is destroying himself, his family, his marriage and his career and I've been sitting there hopelessly fighting a battle I CAN NOT WIN. I know that things have not gotten better, I have tried being patient, understanding, silent. I have tried reasoning, common sense, begging, threatening and now all I'm left with is the realization that this is beyond his and my control. I love this man with all my heart. I would never dream of cheating on him. Ever. Period. But this is not the man I married and I cant stay with him the way he is as I'm his trigger and he is destroying me. The ironic thing is that although he will see this as the ultimate betrayal it is in actual fact the ultimate act of love. I know I'm sacrificing my marriage to try and save this beautiful man. Hopefully one day he will understand. If there is one piece of advice I can give. Remember that this actually isnt about you. And you will only destroy yourself trying to fix it on your own. If you believe his delusions are plummeting him into a depression, get him help and let them take it out of your hands then be kind to yourself and talk to a professional about the HELL you have been through (because it is a living hell) and no one goes through this unscathed.

It's so heartbreaking isn't it? I have tried to enlist members of my husband's family to help and they are really supportive when I call them but then I don't hear back from them so I don't know if he convinces them of 'what he knows' and then they don't bother getting back in touch or if it's because they just can't be bothered with it all. I have thought about trying to get myself into a 'rebound' relationship just to distract myself from obsessing over what I haven't tried yet. I have even pulled out an old deck of tarot cards (with no experience or knowledge aside from a quick google) to get answers and they appear to be freakishly right every time though of course, they can be interpretted to whatever fits a person's circumstances. Don't judge me for going spiritual - I will try just about anything at this stage. Faithfullyfedup, did you have any luck with showing him similar stories on forums such as this? I find when reading other people's stories, some delusions seem to be the norm. Eg - The middle of the night meetings with these lovers - The hyper vigilance etc - Limiting their other half's movements - Blaming the other person of having mental health problems etc - Thinking the other person is lying about everything I have also thought about calling the hospital to take him for an assessment but he smokes daily and because of it, he is calm most of the time. If anything it's me who loses the plot when we argue. I never really felt there was a right time. I might make some enquiries about triggers to watch for in terms of getting him help. He's still taking Respiridon (or says he is) but he did tell me that after his last psychiatrist appointment he probably won't go back. Faithfullyfedup, how did you go with him being taken away? Did it happen? Also what about your kids? The best I could convince him of was 50/50 shared care so this is in place now but I do worry a little about the kids. They are 12 and 14 so not silly and they know the basics around what is going on, but really don't want to know anything else which is good. They love their dad and he loves them with all his heart so I believe they are safe. I guess my only concern is knowing how this condition can escalate. Originally I put my foot down and insisted I have them 4 nights but because 'there's nothing wrong with him' he stomped on that after the first week and pressured me into the 50/50. While I do love him, he has always had a knack for being quite intimidating and I'm a people pleaser so that makes it hard to stand my ground with things like this. I had one conversation a month ago when I asked him when the last time he thinks I was with this lover and he said it was two nights ago. I said \"Really? Because I've been on my period for the last 3 days\" and he knows that my first 3-5 days are insanely heavy. His reply was, \"Yeah but that doesn't bother this bloke!\" Never mind that it would bother me. I find that now, when we talk on the phone, he will tell me that I am the only person who can fix the problem (unsaid: by ending the affair and not lying anymore) and if I try to reason with him, he tells me that he is losing more and more respect for me every time we discuss it. He says he just wants me to come clean and stop living my life as a big lie. He sent me a text a couple of days ago telling me that he thinks I'm like a gay person who hasn't come out yet and is struggling with the decisions I've made. Oh my god! It is so, so, so frustrating!!!!", "hash": "527778145ef05f1821bcd866f1f7c194bf059e1d8e78f52a219983e3632ec0c2"}

So from my last post, I managed to hold mental health off from taking him.... he sucks me in every time I see him (I check he is ok constantly- big mistake) he found his own psychologist and did attend his appointment but I went away to visit family with the kids and he couldnt handle it. He called me in hysterics saying he had found a video on my laptop of 5 guys in our room and 2 girls with dildos and d***ks and one guy was holding a shot gun while I was with someone on the bed. Insane. I called mental health that morning and he was picked up the next day. Today was the first day I saw him. Absolutely broke my heart. All he did was plead for me to get him out which I cant do. He has absolutely no idea why he is there.... but in the next breath he was questioning me about why I had 5 guys in our room and how cruel I am. He needs to be there. Its literally like a jail, but it has to be, he was already asking me to lie for him and bring a disguise in for him to sneak out. But it does work. He hates it so much that he is willingly taking all the meds to get out. They believe he will be non compliant when he leaves in a few weeks as he has zero insight so his meds will be administered by needle at the hospital. If he doesn't show up the police bring him in. He will most likely be under the mental health act for years but if this is what it takes to get him better so he isnt living a hell every day it's worth it. Might cost me my marriage but it was doomed anyway. There is absolutely no shot in hell of fixing this yourself. The doctors said that answering or feeding into his delusions is really detrimental as it concrete in their mind that they have reason to be concerned. It's so hard to stop defending but it's getting easier to steer him away from it. It's a massive relief knowing that he is eating, sleeping and safe. Hes on anti psychotic meds and is heavily sedated which makes seeing him alot easier as he is alot calmer to talk too now. Its heart breaking and so so sad seeing him literally drinking out of a paper cup and walking around barefoot in a maximum security section but truly, the only other option is to give up on him because I cant help (and my patience is now zero) and watch him self destruct. I love him way too much to do that. For the first time I have a little bit of hope. I sent him a heap of reading material about delusional jealousy disorder and he literally said these people are crazy, I'm nothing like them stop putting a label on me and refused to talk about it. Our kids are 9 & 13, they both adore him but both understand that he isnt dad at the moment. They wont be seeing him while he is in there but they know he needs meds to get better. I've got everything crossed that this will work. I had my first real glimpse of insight today when I said that he needs to accept the possiblity that he could be hearing and seeing things that arnt there. He said if I'm wrong, and my mind is playing tricks on me I'm truly sorry for everything I've done to you and I'll spend a lifetime making it up to you. I will hold onto that sentence forever.", "hash": "72b0de2c15812c39bcaebbdbd50f61e2be8de5d522ad30cb10987ba0599aa8a3"}

(2 his, 3 mine and 1 ours). my youngest 3 children live with us (ages 12,12 and 9). my husband has always had a bit of a jealous streak and has always cheated on his sognificant others. my husband has cheated on me multiple times and has had various drug addictions, and has been clean for over a year now. may of 2010 my husbands oxy addiction came to a head and i had caught him talking to other women on singles web sites again. i was 5 months pregnant at the time with a high risk pregnancy with twins and had placenta previa.i found his account and his passwords and saw all the conversations. that morning he had been 2 days without opiates and was in withdrawal. when confronted on breaking his promises yet again, he attempted to kill himself with a bottle of 100 doxepin pills. he was rushed to the hospital and kept for observation after his stomach was pumped, he blamed it all on me, i drove him to it. the doctor reccomended inpatient rehab. i agreed. we found a wonderful place that would not only treat the addiction but help with anger management and had daily psych visits to treat the underlying cause of the addiction. being a nurse myself, tyhis was fantastic news. the day of discharge he refused to go. i played the tough love role and told him if he didnt go he couldnt come home. he left the hospital and came home and got his car which i had put his belongings in. he left and went and stayed with one friend, then another friend and his wife. although suspicious of frequent lengthy phone calls between he and his friends wife, i didnt know he actually had something going with his friend (excuse me, his dealers) wife. after being gone for 2 weeks, he agreed to come home and go to rehab. he told the kids, we scheduled the day and time...and....he never showed up. apparently he and his friends wife took off together. needless to say, my children and i were devestated. it was a rough couple of weeks. fast forward 4 weeks, i lost my job due to missed time to file a protective order when he threatened me and latenesses due to child care issues. exactly a week later while packing up my house to move myself and my children in with my parents, i went in to premature labor. my local hospital rushed me to a higher level hospital where my husband rushed to my side. our twin boys were born 2 days later 15 weeks premature. we stayed at the nicu and the ronald mcdonald house with them until at 2 weeks old one passed away and at 3 weeks old the other passed away. this was so devastating to us, our parents, our children, everyone. we then went to stay with my parents with our children. homeless, neither of us working. we got my husband into a suboxone program which he has stuck with ever since. during all this my husband made so many promises and assurances how different things were going to be. 4 months after our boys passed away, we couldnt stay with my parents any longer so i got a good paying job as a nurse manager and went back to work. 4 weeks later we were back in our own hosue with our children. through all my husbands addiction problems and the loss of our boys i realized that i was co dependent and vowed that i would not rely on him or how he treated me for my own emotional well being. after being back in our own house for months, my husband, although faithful, just didnt treat me like he loved me. he wouldnt get a job to relieve any of the financial stress off me, when it came to the kids sports, i did all the scheduling and transporting and he rarely touched me. the final straw was on valentines day when i wanted him and he pushed me away. i made the decision to stop trying so that i wouldnt allow him to hurt me anymore. thats when things got tragically worse..... after that my husband became even more jealous and controlling. swearing i was having affairs, accusing me of any male he saw at my place of unemployment, constantly calling me names. in july of this year it got even worse to where he was staying up all night for days ata time, going through my phone, checking all my emails, my facebook, my call logs, on my cellp[hone account. he calls numbers off my phone in the middle of the night and wakes people up. he finally left and went to his dads. we had tickets to a baseball game that friday so i ended up taking the kids by myself. he swore i was there with my kids and my boyfriend. those 3 days he was at his dads he started to become psychotic to the point of where he told his stepmother that i called him at 3 in the morning and told him i didnt love him and to not call me anymore cause i have company in my bedroom. he showed up at my house the nexct day and started taking some of his tools out of the basement. accusing me, calling me names, broke my phone, told our kids what a whore i was etc. he was so off, he couldnt even walk straight. he then showed me a whole bottle of xanax he had stolen from his dad and told me he was going to kill himself. he left the house drove around the block and came back but i had locked the door. he banged on the door and demanded and begged for me to let him in which i refused. he told me he was going to go kill himself now then walked down the sidewalk and threw his phone at my house breaking both his phone and my window. he then got in his truck, drove around the block and slammed his truck into the passenger side of my car. i called the police and he ended up being taken to the hospital under an emergency petition. once they pumped his stomach and cleared him medically he was placed in a psych holding area and deemed incompetent. while in the emergency room he was so bizarre. saying things to his mother and the doctors that i was in the parking lot in a truck having sex with my boyfriend in the hospital parking lot and that i had moved my boyfriend in to our house. when he was seen the following day by the psychiatrist (which was a sunday) he was diagnosed with paranoid delusional psychosis, bipolar disorder and delusional jealousy. the doctor told me he was being admitted for inpatient psych treatment and would be there about a week. he was going to get antipsychotics and mood stabilizers and wouldnt be discharged until his delusions had resolved. the following morning ,which was monday, i was told he was refusing his meds and they would pursue a court order to have him take his meds. that same afternoon he was discharged. why? we had no insurance. he had a friend pick him up, drove to his dads house stole another bottle of 90 xanax and punched his 70 year old father in the face. he doesnt remeber the next 2 days during which time i picked hinm up from a hotel and brought him back home with the promise that he would get the free outpatient help the hospital reccomended. he never did. so, for the last 3 months, i have been dealing with daily accusations and name calling, extreme fights, checking me on gps, if he comes to pick me up at work and sees a male employee or doctor in my office im sleeping with them. when we are at the childrens sports games, i will be talking to some of the other moms and he swears im talking to the male coaches. he tells me daily that i dont love him and im torturing him. he has had a second hospital visit for threatening to kill himself in august but was released in a few hours. he swears he sees picture messages on the cell phone account that i have sent to other men but when i tell him to show me they arent there and he swears i erased them. he accuses me of leaving work for lunch daily and having an affair at a park. i was counseled this week by my director of nursing that i have 2 weeks to fix this or i will be terminated. he texts and calls multiple times a day when hes in one of his moods and if i am with patients or in a meeting or meeting with families and dont answer or eespond, its proof that i am having this alleged affair. i rush out of work every day after 8 hours on the dot just so he doesnt accuse me. he drives me to work daily and picks me up, but swears i leave. dont get me wrong, there are still days at a time where everything is great and he is like his old self again, but more frequently its pure torture for me and my kids. he swears he doesnt have a problem and doesnt need any psychiatric help that its all me. he swears this is the same reaction any man would have when his wife is cheating, constantly begs me to just tell him \"the truth\". now he has convinced himself that the reason i am in trouble at work is not because of him but because i have missed so much time having my affair. my cell phone was stole from my office last week and he is convinced that i either gave it to my boyfriend or sold it and gave the money to my boyfriend. i am at my wits end. i dont know what else to do. he desperately needs help and me and our children cant go through this anymore. i have offered to take a polygraph, but will this even help? part of me thinks that when i take it and pass he will see that i have been telling the truth but part of me knows that it wont make a difference.", "hash": "d6a5980b5e4a74b95b0f7a3e3de875dc68bf548bc2bd1f4642646ac919537d19"}

We have attempted marriage counseling, but he didn't like the marriage counselor. Honestly the council wasn't doing much to help us just kind of sitting there and listening to us argue. I have continued to be faithful I have continued to be a good wife. He just seems to get worse and worse. He twists his memories of things that happened years ago to feed into this delusion. I have been accused of everyone and anyone that is a male that we have been around accept both of our fathers and my brother. I have been accused of my teenage son's friends and my stepson's friends that I have known since they were little children. If a wrong number calls my cell phone, it is very obviously my boyfriend calling meAnd a signal for me to get in touch with him. If I do anything to make myself feel better about myself like dye my hair get my nails done, try to lose weight, or buy new clothes, I'm doing it to make myself more sexually attractive to other men. He can't seem to fathom that after 18 years of being cheated on I have no self esteem left. We are currently separated and he has been living in his father's basement for over a year now. We still talking everyday and see Each Other frequently, He comes home for a couple days and stays here quite often. It's still like a goddam roller coaster. There will be a couple of really really good days where he super attentive, super affectionate, and can't stop telling me how much he loves me and how he knows that I would never cheat on him. Then those couple days are over and there will go days to weeks of daily accusations of ridiculous things. I have been accused of manipulating Facebook, getting on his Facebook to talk to his friends behind his back.I can no longer get on his Facebook to check up on him and make sure hes not talking to other women because if I do he swears I'm doing it to talk to his friends. He is recently told me that I have attempted and Succeeded in seducing all of his friends and that he is now a laughing stock and a joke amongst his friends from the day we met 18 years ago His brother and stepbrother who I never talk to both posted Happy Birthday on my Facebook page, therefore I am having affairs with them. I am the assistant director of nursing in a nursing home and the unit managers all report to me and the director of nursing. We generally use our cell phones to text each other throughout the day because we are generally out on the units and not in our offices. Unfortunately, one of the unit managers is a mail.Despite the fact that I never delete any of my texts so that they are always there for him to Look at, he has decided that the innocent text about the patients in the nursing home between me in the mail unit managerHave other meanings. As of today, the reason I am being ostracized and call a skunk in a hoar is because apparently one of his best friends for about 30 years and I are having an affair. The so called proof that he hasIs that I don't text or call him after 1030.So if he is sleeping at his father's house and I am home alone in bed sleeping, I must actually not be sleeping. In his mind he has become convincedThat I am sneaking his friend in after his friend's wife goes to work. His proof is that he doesn't hear from me after 10:30 at night. This friend of his also happens to be the birth father Of his brother's stepson, our nephew. He hasn't seen this friend often through the years but a couple of years ago they did get back in contact and this friend shot on our pool league team for about 6 months. This friend of his is a recovering heroin addict and has had many remissions. This friend of his also at One time was rumored to have been trading homosexual favors for drugs and/or drug money. It is beyond me why he would think that I would ever want a man like that period. On the rare occasion that this friend does get in touch with him he swears this friend always knows when he and I are having problems And is convinced that it's because I'm telling this friend. So he has decided that he is put 2 and 2 together and come up with 5 and because this friend's wife works night shift apparently, I don't know because I never talk to these people, I must be screwing this guy at night I have been utterly and completely faithful to this man for over 18 years. I love this man with everything in me, I would never even think about cheating on him.I am someone who is always even as a small child try to do the right thing. My mother says I was born with a desire to follow the rules. I was raised in a Christian church with strong morals. And I live by there is Morals. Just the idea of being intimate with another man in any other way is appalling to me. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells. I never know when or where the next accusation is going to come from. Whenever I'm on my phone or the Internet I'm accused of secretly messaging someone. He accuses me of cheating with a neighbor. Although he doesn't live here but is staying with his father, he has decided that I need to move into a newer and better house. I am not ready to move right now. Yes I got a large Raise last year when I got a promotion at work but I have been renting this house for 8 years. It is 2 blocks from my parents and my landlord is very lenient with late rent payments. He has never once filed a late rent notice when my rent is Late. My credit score is currently very low and I need to do some credit repair so I can buy a house. He sees none of this as a reason for me not to move. In his mind I won't move right now because I don't wanna either be away from the next door neighbor that I'm screwing or his friend who apparently lives somewhere within a mile of me. I honestly don't know where his friend lives because I don't talk to this guy After so many years and so many accusations I don't know what to do. The more I deny that I have done any of these things the angrier he seems to get. He swears that I just refuse to admit to all the horrible things I've doneAnd that must mean that it's because I won't stop doing them. In his mind it can't possibly be that I want admit to things because I haven't done them. Previously I was self assured, outgoing, friendly and usually a genuinely happy person. All of this has Caused me to be anxious, depressed, and even sometimes contemplating suicide. My nerves are constantly on edge because I never know what's going to come next. My life is spent walking on eggshells I have panic attacks. I am barrage and verbal I attacked with accusations on a regular basis. I know that this is verbal and emotional abuse. I know that his thought process is it logical And that this is delusions, but I still keep thinking that at some point he will realize how wrong he is. I know it's stupid to think that 1 day he'll magically wake up and realize hes wrong, but I can't help it. If I get angry and argue when I'm being accused, if I raise my voice to him that proof positive that I'm guilty. If I refuse to argue to him that's proof positive that I'm guilty. It's a no win situation About a year ago I finally decided that I would take a lie detector test to prove to him once and for all that I've never cheated on him. I looked online and found a local one that was relatively cheap at $400. I contacted this woman, scheduled and paid for the test myself and went and took the test with him. Unfortunately, I fail to do any research on what a lie detector test really does. Had I done any research I would have never done it. I went into the lie detector test thinking that this magic Box would off automatically prove to my husband once and for all that I was telling him the truth. Little did I know that all the machine does is register your fight or flight response during questioning. This is the reason they don't do lie detector tests when rape or abuse victims. I went into the test confident that this was gonna be the solution to all our problems. The polygraph examiner called me 3 days later to give me the test results.To my shock and surprise she inform me that not only had I failed but that I had failed miserably and that I was a horrible liar.I couldn't understand how this could possibly have happened. I was telling the truth the whole time. After much research and consulting an expert experienced polygraph examiner I discovered that an experience polygraph examiner would have never done the test on me Because of the verbal and emotional abuse that is occurred over this issue. Obviously my husband refuses to believe this. I'm really and truly at a loss. I don't know what to do. I really do love this man. I really have never cheated on him. I want my husband back. I want me back. I want everything to be normal. I just don't understand how he can't see how good we could be together if you would just stop these accusations.When hes not angry at me and accusing me of things other people are actually jealous of the affection and love they can see between us. I just want this all fixed. I feel hopeless and I feel helpless.", "hash": "cae0e2b8b27a697a1d179deba944d749196c0a44ad459ee00e9cbf9d00871585"}

He gas twisted so many things. Strangely enough, there is a coworker of his i have never even met or talked to that he has accused me of cheating with for a couple of years now. The strange part is this man sent me a friend request on fb today. As i clearly gave nothing to hide, i notified my husband right away. Why? Because i told him i would always be truthful and not hide things from him. And i anticipated that my husband, ny protector would stand up for me and also see that im not hiding things from him. Well instead, he blamed me. He saw the friend request as proof positive that im having an affair with this man. So instead of getting amgry and feeling betrayed towards his coworker, he decided it was an elaborate ruse set up by me and his coworker to cover up the fact that our fb accounts were connected (not even sure what he means by that). So i instead sent the asshole a message calling him out for randomly sending a friend request to his coworkers wife. He respinded thst he hadnt so then i sent him a picture of the request and again basically told him off. Of course in my husband's eyes, that was wrong as well. I honestly dont know how or why this person sent me a friend request as my husband actually has me blicked from his fb. Again, my husband sees that as even more proof. Theres so many examples i see on other threads of these bizarre paranoid behaviors that my husband exhinits... Call or text from the wrong number? Its obviously my lover. Neighbor mzkes noice next door, the husband is signaling me. I get my nails done, cut my hair, buy new clothes....im obviously trying to either look goid for my boyfriend or its just that i have the insatiable desire to have attention from all men.

I am a sex addict and i need some help. I am so cold and uncaring, why do i torture him so? My 19 year old twins know all about my whoring ways and give him funny looks because they really want to tell him. My sons teenage friends....sleeping with me. Apparently i have successfully seduced 100% of his friends and relatives, and none of them will tell him because they are all afraid of him. That success rate is better than a playboy model so i guess i should be flattered. I use my paycheck to pay bills for men i sleep with. I post ads on craigslist looking for carsex. I bought a locking bracelet and gave him the key, he swears o either bought two or my boyfriend has the real key. If i check his Facebook or phone, im not checking up on him, im talking to his friends If i check his location on gps, its to make sure he isnt sneaking up on me and my boyfriend.

Just some of the issues: I can't go out unaccompanied without causing a major fight Apparently, I scratch my private areas a lot which means I'm having an affair If I go to the shops, I take too long and apparently my make up is rubbed off around my lips Apparently, I'm not as tight as I used to be which is because my imaginary boyfriend is huge When he leaves the house for 7 - 10 mins to drop the kids at school, I sneak my boyfriend in for a quickie I am under constant surveillance - he rarely leaves the house but when he does, he hides his phone and records me or puts a wireless video camera in various places around the house In his mind, everything I say is a lie - I've apparently developed bipolar and I'm narcassistic Apparently I've uploaded videos of myself having sex with my boyfriend on Pornhub The list just goes on and on. I haven't posted here before and I'll probably start a thread so I can get some support (hopefully) but I just wanted to say to you: Do not get a lie detector test! Seriously, don't do it. I did it.

I'm sorry you didn't receive a timely reply. This forum is not as active as it used to be. Currently, the conventional advice for this type of situation is: Do NOT \"confess\" to something you didn't do. Don't reinforce the delusion. An obsession with the enemy's \"confession\" is a common theme in some of the stories in this forum. A lot of times, the victim tells the enemy: \"I'll forgive the affair/lies/stealing/cheating/whatever IF YOU'LL JUST TELL THE TRUTH\". It's tempting to say what they want to hear, in hopes that they will stop talking about it obsessively and compulsively. But it's not likely to work; I think it would just lead to new, bigger, worse accusations. Do NOT deny the accusation. Even if you're telling the truth, denying the accusation will only make the accuser hold onto the accusation even tighter. Even if you have a perfect alibi or undeniable logic that clearly reveals the truth, it's as if the victim's brain will create new pathways to hide the truth from him or her. The accusation/delusion might morph a little bit at this point, but the disease will still likely identify you to the victim as the \"enemy\". Change the topic. This tactic works for family and friends who aren't the \"enemy\"; I'm not sure if it will work for the person whom the victim's brain has marked as \"the enemy\". I know it sounds ridiculous, but it works. A relative of mine can talk for hours about all the things her husband has allegedly done to try to ruin her life. A simple question such as \"Oh, look at your garden! What kind of flower is that yellow one?\" can change the topic--and her mood--completely. Do you know any of this person's family? I would talk to a parent or sibling and explain to them what's going on. Maybe this has happened in the past, and they'll recognize a pattern. Or...they might believe the victim. If so, this is likely to happen again in the future. Even it you break off all contact with him, the victim's brain will eventually identify a new \"enemy\". Next time, it might be one of his family members. So if you talk to them, even if they don't believe you now, you've given them the info to recognize a pattern later. I think you have to end the friendship. But let him know that you'll be there for him if you need him in the future. I'm thinking something like: You keep accusing me of things I didn't do. It hurts me that you think I would do those things. I think that we both need time away from each other. I won't call/text/email/visit anymore. I truly wish you the best.", "hash": "309f0442e871f893935faa039297dc0037dc203f56cd694f62b653b2bb80664d"}

I adore him and will never leave him despite his problems. His jealousy stems from an ex who cheated on him while he was away with work. I also lost an ex to cheating so although I am not the type of person who would cheat, I know how it feels and could never put another person through that especially one I love. Because of his job, FIFO, it is difficult to schedule psychologist/counselling appointments. He’s aware of his problem which is wonderful but he still accuses when he’s away. I’m trying to pack up my house and living at my mum's, more to rest his mind but as I don’t drive the commute gets me here late, so not much is getting done. My son offered to stay with me but something happened today that he didn’t. Now I’m getting ‘the treatment’. I’m tired of being accused of doing stuff I’m not and not getting much packing done because I’m stressed and upset.

Living together will just give the disease more fodder to pick apart. I'm wondering if his ex even cheated on him at all. He's giving you \"the treatment\" because of something you didn't do. He's trying to control your behavior. No, he can't help being suspicious. But, yes, he can control his reaction. He's punishing you for something you didn't do. To give someone \"the treatment\" is still emotional abuse. Would you marry a guy who slaps you around? Probably not? So why would you marry a guy who's emotionally abusive? Do NOT set a date until you completed a year of counseling together as an engaged couple. You mentioned that it is \"difficult to schedule\" appointments. Well, if the relationship means enough to him, then he will find a way to make the damned appointments. This is not a good foundation for a solid marriage. Think with your head now and not with your heart (or limerence hormones). All the signs are right there.

She is a nurse that works on the psych-med-surg ward at a top hospital. She plans on becoming a psychiatric nurse practioner. I told her that I was speaking with a lawyer about what happened to me during a recent ER visit. This is unlike me, but it bothered me so I had to speak with a lawyer. I had a night where I got drunk. My husband thought my heart had stopped and he called an ambulance. I sobered up in an ER ward. Still being under the influence, I was very nasty to the nurse. I said some awful things to her. I knew I hurt her terribly. (This is also unlike me) I wasn’t physically aggressive. I didn’t try to hurt anyone or myself. I wasn’t wandering around, stumbling. I did ask to go to the bathroom quite a bit. They had to get someone to escort me. I would wait until someone was there that could help me. Otherwise, I waited in my bed. And eventually I sobered up enough to keep control of my nasty mouth. I did find out the ‘nurse’ wasn’t a nurse at all. I could tell she was angry with me, probably tired and hurt by the things I had said. After awhile, they came in my room and made me get into an enclosure bed. Basically it looked like a baby playpen with mesh sides and top. I couldn’t even stretch out in it. It was awful and I wanted to get out of the thing. It was all I could think about. I finally found a zipper beneath the floor of this playpen. I forced my finger through it and unzipped it and slithered out of the playpen. I got back into my normal bed and waited. When the ‘nurse’ came back into the room, she was surprised and nastily called me an escape artist. She didn’t try to restrain me after that. Eventually I was released and went home. I told my daughter all about this. She said she didn’t understand why this would be so traumatic to me. With my history, I would think she would understand, but she didn’t. She just couldn’t understand. And I don’t understand that...except that she is young and can’t fully comprehend what has happened in my life. It’s been a year since all this happened. A lot has happened. I’ve been on a crusade to get off all unnecessary meds, especially the opiates (for cancer) and benzos (for GAD & PTSD). Then the memory of this came to me and I decided to speak to a lawyer about it. I mentioned it to my daughter tonight. She told me that she is scared for me because of this. She said she thinks I’m delusional. Now I’m beginning to question myself. Maybe I am delusional. But I think to myself,’I seem to be getting better. I’m not depressed. I’m getting out more. I’m more and more active. Sure, it’s taking some time but I’m doing it.’ So how am I delusional? Part of me thinks that for most of my life (I’m 55 right now) I’ve had several traumatic events, and I’ve never done anything about it. Now I feel that I have to speak up. To say hey, something wrong happened here. It’s not the money. It’s the principle of it. But now my daughter has me doubting myself. Am I being delusional? If I am, then I need to watch myself. If I’m not, why does my daughter think this? No matter what, what do I do under either circumstance? I am at a loss. I don’t know what to think. So I’d appreciate any feedback from others. Ideally I should be able to figure this out by myself, but obviously I’m ill equipped for that. At least for the moment. So what do you think about this situation. Am I delusional? Is there something wrong with the way I’m thinking? Wither", "hash": "dd869410fd9a59f948292d29bd5a7aca22781ce0719c2606d66aeedf4eb7f077"}

Maybe you are traumatized or maybe you are delusional, but medical help could best solve either of those problems.

We dated for a year before walking up the altar. There were some issues that I just chose to look over and initially even believed 1) she said a group from New Zealand ( where she had been a student from 2003..did not manage to complete despite changing 3 colleges as everywhere people were ‘ out to get her ‘) was hacking her phone and listening to everything we spoke on phone and were watching her change and stuff 2) Everywhere she went she drew in new people like her workplace acquaintances into the whirlpool saying that they too were plotting against her 3) Once she came home and fought with me saying she saw me talking to a girl at her workplace whom she believed was a part of the plot. I never spoke to her nor was I a part of any ‘plot’ 4) just out of the blue she would fight with me saying I called her a bitch. Of course I did not do that. I rubbed it off saying that she’d probably misheard me. She calmed down but the resentment was there Nonetheless we got married, the accusations got wilder.... 1) Jesus came in my dreams and told me you are hiding something and trying to break the marriage 2) she accused me of wanting to indulge in wife swapping with a couple who are good friends 3) she would accuse me of saying weird and random things 4) Once she drove the car so rash after accusing me of saying some weird thing that I thought she’d kill me 5) final straw was after 18 months of marriage she accused me of calling her a C**T and a S**T out of the blue. 6) generally she is a very sweet and a calm personality and goes to church at all times but when this hits her, she starts screaming and becomes evil eyed. There is nothing I can do to argue with her beliefs 7) she felt someone was laughing at her on the phone line. I got her phone checked up but nothing was found She left the house and her parents think I’ve hurt their daughter, when I suggested a psychiatrist visit all hell broke loose. My wife though agreed to the visit with disgust, Her diagnosis came out perfectly okay even though she made some bizarre statements like .. 1)He walks behind me and spies on me. 2) He goes out in the middle of the night to drink tea 3)He laughs at me together with friends and security Her parents lied to the doctor saying that I had apologised to them for my behaviour to her The doctors said she is well behaved and well dressed and did not show any symptoms of a disorder when they kept her under observation for 7 days So now, her paranoia against me is grown more .. she has blocked me off all telephonic ways of contact. Which she refuses to accept.she stays in the US now where she is studying. I am funding her education and paying off her loan, she has got no regard for that. Just for your information she has accused several people in the past who were her friends of wrongdoing. All of them left. She accused them of the same plotting thing. To her, the beliefs are real and no amount of proof or convincing can help Some people don’t even know what my wife thinks of them. To everyone she is a pretty young girl with a perfect life. I love her and want her to get better. But her super overprotective parents and she are the biggest roadblocks. I’ve tried convincing them as well but got bombed. She says I have been an indecent husband and that I have spoilt her life and that she does not have any trust nor faith in me.. I don’t know how to deal with this ... This is sapping me of my life.. Is there anyone who could give any suggestions ? Thanks for reading this long post... Last edited by Snaga on Fri May 03, 2019 2:06 pm, edited 1 time in total.

So I’m recently married and I believe my husband is suffering from a form of delusional personality disorder. He’s yet to be officially diagnosed but the signs are there and he is going to see a doctor. I never even thought this was a thing and I always assumed his trust issues with me would eventually go away. But they haven’t. I should’ve seen the signs. I mean, I did, but I never thought it would get this serious. Long story short, my husband is convinced numerous friends of his are trying to inform him that I have a shady past or there are things I have done that I don’t want him to know about. This is 100% not true. I’ve lived a life I’m pretty proud of and there’s absolutely nothing I’ve ever done that I wouldn’t want him knowing. These friends of his though, have never actually said to him “Hey man, listen, [insert my name here] has done some shady $#%^ and as your friend I am going to tell you these things”. It’s always his friend speaking in “code” trying to tell him something. Just the other night his friend mentioned turning a new HVAC system that was just installed in to a tin man costume for Halloween. My husband literally just started a HVAC career so the comment wasnt completely off the wall. I obviously laughed at the comment by my husband took it as his friend trying to tell him I had been talking to some musician whose stage name happens to be The Tin Man. He was convinced of this. A bunch of other instances like this have occurred and the advice I need is how am I supposed to cope with this? I’ve read so many articles that tell me how to talk to him but how am I supposed to emotionally handle this?? I am the target of his delusions and it makes me so mad and so angry and sad and I get so mad at him for accusing me. I feel just disrespected. But everything I’ve read tells me I need to basically relax. But how can I? I’m so mad at him I don’t even want to see him right now. I’m so proud he’s actually opening up to this possibility that this $#%^ may be made up in his head and that he is going to get medica help but in the meantime I just want to crawl under a rock. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks.", "hash": "057c164a6bf32dea5c399ad6985331637bace53c7c801878cac696db782ec2fc"}

Your husband is convinced that his interpretation of things people say and do is correct. His brain is playing tricks on him. You are suffering. I wish I knew what to do. My husband refuses to believe his exwife is dead, even though I showed him the obituary from 2006. He still believes she is stalking him with her boyfriend who is a state cop. Yes, she came back to life just to torture him. He doesn’t believe the obituaries are real. All we can do is try to get the man we love some help.

I can unfortunately relate. My partner of several years had an episode just about a month ago and it’s been hell. I’m glad your husband is willing to seek help as that seems to be the main hurdle with this diagnosis. My partner’s symptoms started about two months ago, from fleeting persecutory type beliefs into full blown accusation inferring incestuous relations with a family member of mine. Just weeks later he moved two thousand miles away closer to his family (because of how infuriated he was) and has refused to talk to me on the phone for the past month. We’ve texted but his derogatory and insanely painful messages have been quite distressing. I know it’s the mental illness though and have stopped taking them personally but it sure does hurt knowing they’re not well. I started seeing a therapist right away (within the week of his episode as I knew what was happening after the shock faded) and I suggest you seek professional help as well to help you navigate through this. Mine has been instrumental in helping me cope and educated me on how to best approach him if communication was unavoidable (I.e focusing on his emotion and not the belief, avoiding confirming or denying the belief, etc). I sincerely hope all will be ok as can be (for you both) given the circumstances. I’ve been trying to get my partners family to recognize the urgency in getting him to see a mental health provider ASAP but to my dismay nothing has yet happened. I know it’s only been a month since his full blown episode but can’t but feel demoralized in thinking I may have lost someone I deeply loved and cared about and I couldn’t do anything to help him.", "hash": "ead4f0385f83c4fbc993e3afa4078d65d0bb16d878afaf1e56156f7ca2c5a431"}

When my dad or I ask to see the text messages she shuts off and refuses to acknowledge that it is not real. I believe recently she has started to abuse the drug ice, she has battled with addictions before I was born. I am now 17 and worried that this substance abuse has dug up a dormant mental health issue. She has always been a bit funny from her previous drug use but now it has escalated. My dad is worried and doesn’t know what to do especially when she says that he is trying to do her harm. He said she had two episodes in one night where she woke up screaming that people were trying to kill her. I don’t live at home but live in the nearby town to my parents and try to visit at least once a week after school and stay for the night. I am worried as she runs off and no one can get a hold of her until the next day. I don’t know what to do it’s just my dad and I and I can see that it’s exhausting him. He has tried asking her to seek help but she always refuses as she doesn’t acknowledge she has a problem. Please if I could have some advice would be great.

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/delusional-disorder/topic1281.html", "text": "by Alex47 » Fri Oct 24, 2003 5:22 pm BOOK COMMENT REVIEW SYNOPSIS GRB comments on Alistair Munro's Book \"Delusional Disorder...\" I highly recommend the website http://shop.ebrary.com/ , where you can read the above book online for free. The information below is taken from p. 232-234, which deserve to be read in their entirety. For me, this section of the book has given me some modest hope, as it paints a picture of the treatment process and some possible favorable outcomes. There is also some practical advice for the psychiatrist. By necessity, I will paraphrase Munro: Because of the patients reluctance to trust psychiatrists, ideally, assessment and treatment should be by a family physician... but they may not always have the necessary familiarity with this condition and recent advances in its treatment. The psychiatrist must be patient and will often have to spend more than one session gaining the patients confidence before even trying to persuade them to take meds. The patient will usually vehemently argue against taking medications, \"but calm persistence does finally pay off in a reasonable proporatioon of cases\". Medication should be started with a \"very low\" dose which is then raised \"gradually and cautiously\", to prevent sudden onset of side effects, \"an event guaranteed to induce immediate noncompliance.\" Munro recommends that the patient see the psychiatrist at least once a week during this early stage. Munro is a champion of the drug pimozide, used in low doses (\"starting with 1 or 2 mg daily...and in most cases [will need to be gardually raised to] no higher than 4 to 6 mg per day\"). He has used this drug primarily to treat delusional disorder of the somatic subtype, with good results. Minor improvements may be seen within a few days (e.g., reduced agitation, somewhat reduced preoccupation with the delusion), but it takes about two weeks (on the average; sometimes as much as 6 weeks) of treatment (assuming the patient is compliant and responding to the medication), before significant amelioration of the delusion is observed. I will quote the following passage in whole, as it addresses a scenario which has caused me worries (the person stops taking their meds), and actually manages to turn it around into something hopeful: Quote: Quite often the patient feels sufficiently improved early on in treatment that he or she decides to stop the medication. Inevitably the delusion and the accompanying agitation and preoccupation start to reappear and it is then that the treating physician has the best opportunity to obtain ongoing co-operation. Even when the patient is still adamant that his beliefs are real, the experience of improvement followed by incipient relapse seems to make a deep impression and if the patient now trusts the physician he or she will often become extremely compliant. In successful cases the complete turnaround from rejection to trust is both remarkable and heartily gratifying. Munro also observes that in the cases where the patient makes a \"good recovery\", it is often \"relatively rapid and notably complete... even when the delusion has been present for a very long time\". Sounds great, doesn't it? [icon_smile.gif] He also talks about long-term maintenance of treatment (which not surprisingly typically involves continuing meds indefinitely), and mentions that of the (admittedly small) group of patients he has been able to follow up with over the long term, about 1/3 have actually been weaned from meds. These occasionally have relapses, but apparently have sufficient insight at that point that they actually voluntarily resume medication. I also found the following passage very interesting: Quote: There is a dissociation between acquired insight as to the desirability of continuing treatment and in-depth insight into the illness itself. Many patients never accept fully the psychotic nature of their experience, but so long as they agree to take treatment, it seems unimportant, and probably unkind, to face them with the fact that they were delusional before the medication took effect. Munro concludes with a few thoughts on non-drug treatment of delusional disorder, stating essentially that psychological (\"talk\") treatment is essentially not helpful until possibly, in some cases, after the delusions have been resolved using medication. A final warning is given: \"There is a general consensus that psychotherapy of an exploratory, uncovering type is not appropriate in delusional disorder. \" I'll say it again, this section of the book deserves to be read by anybody dealing with a loved one suffering from delusional disorder. It helped me, and I hope it will help you, too. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Roger C comments on \"I am Not Sick, I Do Not Need Help\" by Dr. Xavier Amador Dr. Amador writes from his own personal experience, both as brother of a schizophrenia patient, and as a clinical psychologist. A large problem with treating people with schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders is that many times they won't stay in treatment. The usual explanation for this is that they lack insight into their illness. That is, they are not aware they have a mental illness, or in many cases even that they are exhibiting symptoms. Attempts to reason with such patients about their illness are futile. Dr. Amador postulates that this inability to perceive their illness is caused by the same kind of brain disfunction that is responsible for the illness itself. Experiments have proven this to be true. So, since most of these patients are incapable of understanding that they are ill, how can doctors and family members convince them to stay in treatment programs? Dr. Amador gives a four-step method for providing patients with insight into the benefit of treatment, thus giving them motivation to stay in treatment. For example, one schizophrenic patient wanted very much to be able to hold down a job, but had only a few jobs over the years, most of which lasted only a short time. Rather than simply telling this patient that a job was out of the question, the doctor empathized with the patient's desire, and then helped the patient look back to the times when he was able to get a job, and the events that led up to losing the job, and related these events to the patient's treatment program (or lack thereof). This helped the patient to gain insight into the benefit of treatment. The book finishes with a couple of chapters about knowing when to commit a loved one, and how to go about it. All the advice sounds reasonable, and Dr. Amador's track record of success with it speaks for itself. It should be universally applicable, since the method is based on identifying issues that are important to the patient himself; anything he is dissatisfied with and wants to change will provide a means to motivate the patient to stay in treatment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sean et al comments: I saw Dr. Amador speak at the 2003 NAMI National Convention, if you ever have a chance I suggest seeing him. He spent a great deal of time at the end of the session answering questions from people with a mentalli ill loved one. His sympathy and understanding towards the person with the illness was incredible. As he spoke he explained Schizophrenia and the inability to recognize the illness in simple terms: He asked someone from the audience to give a brief bio about themself. The woman who volunteered (I'll call her Susan) was a Psychologist with a loving husband and two children. She gave a brief description of her job, her family, and her life in general. Then Dr. Amador then went on to talk directly to Susan, saying basically the following: Quote: Susan, I have some bad news for you. You aren't really a Psychologist, in fact, the practice where you think you work called me and asked that I tell you to stop going there every day. There's more though, you aren't really married. Tom also has asked me to help you get help and to stop going to his house. Those children aren't yours, and the house isn't yours. You're sick Susan, and I'm going to take you to the hospital and get you some help. This demonstration, more than anything else, made me aware of how frightening it must be to have Schizophrenia and have your reality stolen from you. No wonder someone with such an illness has conspiratorial thoughts. If someone came and told me my entire life was imagined I'd think they were lying. When they went on to say I needed help and then started trying to make me take medication I wouldn't trust them. I know I haven't done the demonstration justice, but try and imagine yourself hearing those words. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GRB comments on Amador: One approach is to \"empower\" the patient to make their own decision about whether to stay on meds, by promising that no one will object if they go off the meds, under the condition that they keep a journal during the periods that they are not taking medications... Also, a thought on the idea mentioned above, about finding a motivator for the patient to stay in treatment (and which could presumably be used to motivate the person to seek treatment...). Roger had mentioned difficulties in applying this concept in his case. I would agree that this approach would work much better with schizophrenia, for example, than delusional disorder, because in the latter case the person is only affected by the disorder in a limited way, due to the \"encapsulated\" nature of the delusions. The person suffering from DD is likely to be highly functional within society in general and professionally, whereas the disorder primarily affects interpersonal relationships with those close to him or her. So, I think it is a general truth that many people with DD actually do not perceive a worsened quality of life as a result of their (untreated) condition. They might notice a positive change after starting medication, which might be helpful in assuring future compliance, but the problem of how to get the person into treatment in the first place remains vexing.... Dr. Amador introduces his four steps. Listen Effective listening is really a skill that needs to be cultivated. You will need to learn to really listen to what your loved one feels, wants, and believes in. Listening without learning is pointless. First, you need to walk in the other person's shoes to gain a clear idea of their experience of the illness and treatment. For the uninitiated, this is not as easy as it may sound on the face of it. Too many times we make assumptions without checking them out with the person about whom we are making assumptions. Knowledge is power. When you know how someone experiences the idea of having a mental illness and taking psychiatric drugs, you will have obtained the leverage you need to begin to build a treatment agreement. But you will also need to know what their hopes and expectations are for the future, whether or not you believe they're realistic. And finally, you want to identify the cognitive deficits (e.g. problems with memory, attention, focusing thoughts) that are creating barriers between you and the person you're concerned about and between that person and effective treatment. Empathize The second step involves learning when and how to express empathy. If there were a moral to each step and chapter, this one would go something like this: If you want someone to seriously consider your point of view, be certain he feels you have seriously considered his. Quid pro quo. That means that you must empathize with all of the reasons he has for not wanting to accept treatment, even the \"crazy\" ones. But don't worry; empathizing with how a particular delusion makes one feel is not the same as agreeing that the belief is true. This may seem like a minor point, but, as you will learn, the right kind of empathy will make a tremendous difference on how receptive your loved one is to your concerns and opinions. In the chapter devoted to this step, I give you step-by-step instructions on how to do this using techniques such as reflective listening. Agree Find common ground and stake it out. Knowing that what you want for the other person is something she does not want for herself can make it seem as if there is no common ground. She doesn't think she needs medication or therapy, and you think she does. Like any conflict of beliefs between two people, to resolve the disagreement to your satisfaction requires that you discover what motivation the other person has to change. Common ground always exists even between the most extreme opposing positions. The emphasis is on acknowledging that your loved one has personal choice and responsibility for the decisions he makes about his life. During this step, you become a neutral observer, pointing out the various positive and negative consequences of decisions your loved on has made. That means refraining from saying things like, \"See if you had taken your medication, you wouldn't have ended up in the hospital.\" Your focus is on making observations together - identifying facts upon which you can ultimately agree. Rather than making an observation or statement about what happened you ask a lot of questions such as \"So what happened after you decided to stop taking your medication?\" \"Did the voices quiet down after you stopped?\" \"How long after stopping the medication was it before you went to the hospital?\" If you are truly collaborating, asking questions rather than giving advice or direction comes a lot easier than it may sound. Partnership Forming a partnership for recovery is the last and, in my experience, the most satisfying step in this process. The aim of this step is to help you to collaborate on accomplishing the goals you agreed upon. Unlike the previous steps, this one involves both you and your loved one making an explicit decision to work together and to become teammates against a common opponent. You may call the enemy different names, but the names are irrelevant to arriving at a plan of action. The final step culminates in arriving at a treatment agreement. _________________", "hash": "0a21c3f0efb3ebdbc45d2367a18767ee2bf2bab60055b4c68e1c1b28e5b27467"}

I have been recently asked to moderate this forum on Delusional Disorder. I am not a doctor, but I believe I have some first hand experience. What is Delusional Disorder? This illness is a psychosis characterized by non-bizzare delusions which last at least one month. The intensity of such perceptions may wax or wane over time. The person suffering from delusions is often functional in all other aspects of their life. Statistically this illness strikes woman more than men. There are at least six sub-types: Erotomanic: Belief that another person, usually of higher status, is in love with him or her. This other person may be a boss, coworker, celebrity, or stranger. Grandiose: Belief that he or she is much more important, powerful, wealthy, or talented than he or she really is. Jealous: The belief that his or her partner has been grossly unfaithful without regard to substantiating evidence. Persecutory: Believes that he or she is being plotted against, spied on, followed, or harassed by unknown enemies. These delusions sometimes involve conspiracies of people out to \"get\" the sufferer. Somatic: He or she is ill or has other types of health problems. Mixed type: Suffers from more than one of the delusions listed above. Delusional Disorder is sometimes a associated with other personality disorders or a subset of other psychoses; and there is a certain overlap with Paranoid Personality Disorder. It may be helpful to you to check the posts in that forum as well. The above information was culled from various internet sources.

My husband is suffering for a DD and we have been dealing with this for almost 3 years now. His latest episode has drawn me into the delusions which it never has before. I am very concerned about that as I feel he doesn't trust me now and I wonder if that can ever be healed. As well, it makes me fearful for my safety. I know he would never harm me, but the delusional side of him may-who truly knows?!?! It is very difficult to hold together a marriage and family when someone is suffering from mental illness. We have been together for over 11 years and married for six. THree years into our marriage, he had a psychotic break and we have been dealing with that for the past 3 years. He went off meds after a year and then had another psychotic episode after 5 months. Again, he made a full recovery and remained compliant with his meds, although he did switch form Risperdal to Abilify due to hormonal side affects. After being on the Abilify for almost 6 months, he had a psychotic episode where he disappeared on me. HE was found within 12 hours, 600 miles away after taking a plane somewhere he had no reason to be. No explanation as to why, other than, he had a feeling he needed to go there. He was in the hospital for 10 days out of state (where the police found him) and then came home. 2 1/2 weeks after being home, he had another psychotic break and thought there was a stranger in the house to kill him and that's where his delusion brings me into it....I am part of the mafiA. WTF? I asked him when he thought I had time to be in the mafia...I am taking care of him, our child, going to school full time, running the household...cooking, cleaning, bills, garbage, etc. He just worked and I took care of everything else...to reduce his stress (and put it all on me!) Anyways, Currently we are living apart, as he is staying at his parents home since he doesn't feel safe in ours due to his delusion that someone was in our house to harm him. Does anyone know of support groups that can be found on the local level? I feel I am in desparate need of support. THere is only so much that friends and family can offer. I really feel like talking to others in similar situations will help me.", "hash": "75e702a2500254c598a5eb95a50e6c45d30d31adcfe2c992506927117cb1df9b"}

We almost divorced over the summer but he decided to come home and asked me to withdraw the divorce, so I did. I love him. I have tried to get him help for years. He has seen a few therapists but will not be honest with them. He believes that I cheat on him constantly or that's what he says anyway. I have taken two polygraph tests and passed them both, but his accusations continue and he finds fault in the tests. We are separated again. He left a few days ago. What I really need is some advice here. I have disagnosed himm with DDJ but there are other illnesses he also has the symptoms of. Paranoid personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, etc... He is abusive, verbally every day, mentally, and sometimes physically. He projects things that he does onto me, i.e. secret social media accounts, connecting with ex-lovers, interest in younger partners, secret cell phones, lying about where he has been, etc... He manipulates me, isolates me from friends and family, I have no friends. I can't visit my adult daughter without him with me or without our youngest son with me. I only get to visit family once or twice per year. I am not allowed to work outside the home. I am not allowed to do much of anything really. I have given into this for years because I thought it would help him to trust me. He believesthat people talk about him behind his back. He believes that compete strangers in public places are laughing at him and talking about him. He believes that I or my family have tried to poison him. He believes that myself or others are out to hurt him or take things from him. He believes that his mother tried to harm him when he was young. He believes that my mother put a Witch curse on him. And he believes that he has connections with certain younger women and when one of them rebuffed him and told my sister what that he had contacted her , he was convinced that she would not have turned him b down or.contacted my sister. He believes it must be a fake account set up by my sister or mother because he could not believe that she would have told on him. He also believed that a young woman that we have a ride once had secretly whispered to him that she wanted him. She didn't. I was in the car and she said nothing to him like that. And she also rebuffed him when he contacted her. Pretty sure I am codependent, I have been trying to fix him for years. I am struggling here. I love him. I knsow he sounds pretty bad this all laid out and this is really only a portion of our issues. Is this really DDJ, is it something else, or is it just an abusive husband? I agave him an ultimatum to get help first or no coming back this time because he has promised so many times and has never followedthrough.

He came up with ridiculous \"evidence\" that I proved time and time again was wrong. and I knew he had no proof of anything because I had done nothing. I know there is no hope for us which is sad as we have been together 27 years and I thought we would grow old together. I loved him.

He is a great dad and I listen while he talks to my daughter as if nothing ever happened, but calls me a liar and a cheat in messages Does anyone know if this gets better by itself or will get worse and other people will see this side of him. another thing he says is that if I just \"admit \" to what I have done, he will forgive me. what a joke.

There is no swaying from his beliefs and the more I defend myself the more I am guilty in his eyes. We have been together for ten years and prior to this he was lovely. I haven’t felt safe at times.

I think you'd benefit from an in person group that understands as well as this online community. I'd recommend calling NAMI (the National Allience on Mental Illness) 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) ask them the number for your state and / or local component if you are in the US. Sign up and go to a family to family course, or just start by talking to the Help line and asking questions about how to get someone help who doesn't want it, and where as a person with a loved one with mental illness, where you can get support. My aunt is a board member in her state (my cousin was diagnosed about 20 years ago), and my mom is a local component board member (she said she feels like she found her people, after I encouraged her to get involved), It's people like them who teach the classes for family-to-family, and offer real support. I also want to encourage you to listen to Dr. Amador on youtube, or read \"I'm not sick and I don't need help\", it's a great organization with a lot of people with experience personally navigating through really hard times. Again, I'm sorry you have to go through this, but there are a lot of great people struggling with this sort of thing too.

What happens to the kids? by VeryConcernedHusband » Sun Dec 16, 2018 4:33 am I am new here, I read many posts in this forum, and found a ton of useful information. My wife of 18 years is delusional, and our story is no different to many I read here. It has been 3 years since the first episode, when she was sure there were cameras at home looking at everything she did, and I was with our neighbors watching her (This happened after watching the Truman Show...) Everyone in the streets mock her and talked about her. These things went on during all this time, she never accepted that she is ill, no matter how much evidence I show her. About a year ago, she started focusing her delusions on me. She accuses me of lying pretty much every time I open my mouth, the members of my whole family are pathological liars. I mock her and copy all her gestures to the point that she starts crying when she is with me. I hide things to make her crazy, and I conspire with other people to steal from her. She also thinks that I have another woman, and sometimes that I have a male lover as well. I could go on and on, but I don't want to make this too long. Seeing that she is not willing to get help, I am thinking of divorce before I start getting sick. Reading the posts here, I didn't find any case in which the ill spouse gets good treatment, takes his/her medicine, and the marriage goes on without interruption and live together happily for a long time. It seems that divorce is the only way out. At this point I am totally convinced that our marriage is over. What I don't read much is about what is the effect of this problem on the kids. We have 14 and 16 year old boys. Their mother has been good to them, and although they are aware of her problems, and many times they witness her treatment to me, they are not too upset. Whenever she talks unreasonable things to them, they just laugh it out or ignore her, and she doesn't seem to mind. My main worry is that, once we divorce and I am out of the picture, would she start focusing her delusions on them? Has anyone experienced that situation. I am very worried about something like it happening. At the end of the day the most important is the well being of the kids. I'll appreciate any comment, suggestion or ideas about this.

I divorced because my ex stigmatized mental illness and didn't love me through it all. As for those of us who live with treatment in recovery, there are some of us on this site. The most important factor is insight, and accepting care. It is possible to recover. Many who recover move on with life and may not need this site when they take their medication and move on. For me, my emotional response to my experience has been slow to heal. My mental health is solid. My story just makes me sad. As for the kids, if she hasn't shown any symptoms towards them, it probably isn't an issue. As long as she is in care and addressing her mental health, she has rights as a mother. The one good thing about my ex, he used my love of my daughter to force me into care. Read \"I'm not sick and I don't need help\". You can find it on Amazon, and sign up for a NAMI family to family course to get an in person support network to help you make these touch choices, and to hopefully get your wife the care she needs.

Things were going great, we were eagerly making plans for retirement in the future, until recently when things have rapidly turned dark when the endless accusations began. The first major accusation was that I was having an affair with the girl that cut my hair. Then the laser beam focus shifted to my work. She began to incessantly drill me about who I had lunch with in the cafeteria, etc. Then I was accused of having an afffair with one of my female co-workers, and then another. She then started checking my home email, computer usage, text messages, and cell phone calls... demanding that I identify each number and the conversations that took place from 3 months prior. The accusations continued to grow. She \"knew\" I was getting up in the middle of the night and spending hours on the computer. Her health began to fail, she now needed Ambien to sleep and doctors prescribed anxiety and blood pressure medications. Because of her health, she asked if I was trying to poision her. She asked if I was secretly taking pictures of her, and asked if I had video tape equipment hidden in our bedroom. My beloved wife then began hiding tape recorders in my home office and car in hopes of \"catching me in the act\". The clincher came when I received what I thought were a couple of innocuous wrong number texts. One was about the individual going out to eat after church and the other was pertaining to someone's family reunion. I texted back they had the wrong number. My wife didn't think they were so innocent. Unbeknownst to me, she hired a private investigator. Together they tracked down who had the phone number and did research, background checks, etc. Apparently this individual was a known homosexual. So now the accusations came flying that I was having a homosexual relationship. That is when she moved out and filed for divorce. After 29 years I am left devasted, hurt beyond words, and left searching for answers. The woman I knew for all of those years bears no resembalance to the woman who she is now. Could this be DDJ, or some type of side-affect from the medications?

No matter what I did or said, I couldn't get through to him. When the children tried to rationalize with him, he said they were working in concert with me and that they were taking up for me because I'm their mother. He refused to seek help. The children even offered to go with him since he no longer trusted me, but he wouldn't. Like you said, he's turned into a completely different person. The man I love no longer exists. I think it's genetic. His mom has paranoid schizophrenia, and it manifested itself in her around the same age as him. I wish I could encourage you and tell you that she'll be her old self again.

My heart is still broken, but through prayer and my faith in God, He is seeing me through. Holidays are the most difficult. We did everything together. He and our children were my whole life.

I've been lurking on this board for over a year. But your post is the one that brought me into the light. If it makes you feel a little better, I will tell you that I've experienced almost EXACTLY everything you have experienced. I would regularly read other posts and nothing quite matched my situation. But your situation matched mine almost verbatim. It started 4 years ago with accusations that my personality had changed. That maybe I was having a mid life crisis. It then changed to me having an affair with someone. Then she figured out who the affair was with so I was then having an affair with a specific person. She made up stories about seeing this woman with us in restaurants when we went out. But never did she see us together. I worked with this woman at a previous job but had very little to do with her. Then 2 years ago, I think she had nervous breakdown. Her story changed to me surveilling her in our home with recording devices and cameras. This is so I could keep tabs on her thus allowing me to do all sorts of nefarious activities such as operating a porn site, having an affair, maybe even doing drugs. She claims that I took pictures of her and our daughter at night and posted them on the internet. But no pictures have ever been produced (because they don't exist). I was then accused of getting up at night to do all sorts of things. Funny thing is, I sleep very soundly and rarely wake up at all. I've been accused of giving cues in restaurants to people that are watching us. I've been accused of tricking her sister into taking my side in all this. I've been accused of gaslighting her (trying to make her think she is crazy) so that I can have her locked up and then taking our family assets for myself. So I've been living with this now for 4 years. I'm about at the end of my rope. I asked her why she still lives with someone that would do all these things to her. She says that she is keeping her commitment to God and our family. Death do us part. Needless to say, we both have a strong faith. I'm willing to work with her and help her but I cannot take the continued scrutiny and accusations that come out of the blue. I've tried to lay down boundaries but they do no good. She's just not dealing with reality. So she uses her \"faith\" to give her the right to abuse me at every turn by staying in our marriage and keeping her commitment to God. After reading all the posts on this site, I've pretty much given up hope for her to ever get better. I can't get her into counseling because that's part of my \"plan\". So I'm just trying to get along as best I can. There's much more to this story but that's enough for now. Good luck!!", "hash": "97e770a54bf1884faac5b52e0498f2cc76b03aed0079dcbd5682d139b3b0cd02"}

My wife has accused me of almost everything one can be accused of, the most reoccurring accusation centering around her clothes which constantly disappear, thrown her in a panic - followed by a host of strange reasons all centered around my stealing her clothes for various reasons. I too have been accused of affairs more times than I can recall, for reasons varying from a cord on a light in the wrong position, to a fast-food receipt that had a small change in what i normally order. This constant barrage has taken a heavy toll on my mental and emotional health, and I rely heavily on a counselor to help me keep myself together for the sake of 2 children, as well as continuing to try and help my wife. She has gone to the lengths of daily checks of my cell phone, mileage, pockets for receipts, and most expensive, a secret video camera system installed on our home she used to monitor my every movement for over 6 months before I discovered it accidentally. Now, the encouraging news, and hopefully helpful for others. Since she has always insisted I am the reason for all these events due to my many mental problems she constantly diagnoses, I was able to convince her to come to therapy with me in order to help ME. She is willing to do this as she feels sorry for me having so many mental problems. My therapist has worked with me in this, trying out each new technique on me first, before asking her to try it in order to help me feel more comfortable. I do not know if this will work for others, but at least i have her voluntary going to therapy twice a week in order to help her poor husband.

My beloved wife of almost 30 years and I had what I considered to be a very loving, satisfying marriage. Now, as we're approaching the holidays, she is accusing me of being a male prostitute. She is saying I have sneaked males into the house at night to have sex while she was in bed sleeping. She is accusing me of meeting men in parking lots, country roads and gas stations in order to be paid to have sex with them.

I thought the same thing, that it couldn't get any worse, when my now ex-husband began with his accusations back in 2000. But as time went on they did, it began with the accusation that I was having one lesbian affair, then spread to my co-workers, friends, and then to almost every female I came in contact with. I kept patiently asking for his reasoning saying, \"please help me to understand why you're thinking these things?\"... His response was, \"I can tell by the way you look at them\"... I asked for an example of \"the look\" and what I got was the most rediculous example, it was a look you'd see an actor having in a movie where they come upon a beautiful oasis after spending a week in the middle of an Arabian dessert. Get the picture? The sad part is that this IS WHAT HE SAW IN HIS MIND. He even accused me of possibly having our new born artifically inseminated by the brother of one of my alleged lesbian mates in order to have a child close to her DNA. Yes, I just had just given birth to our 4th child 3 months before when this was dumped on me. Over time I became somewhat callous, and perhaps a little cynical, it was my only defense mechanism for the emotional pain I was feeling. I was beyond pissed, I was bitter, just plain bitter. Why did my loving husband become a monster? I didn't know anyone who had this sort of situation to talk to, I only wish I had come upon this site back then. At the time I felt so ALONE. When I felt an episode coming, and believe me it got to a point when I could clearly see one coming, I would stop him in his tracks and say, \"look, at this point, nothing you can say would surprise me, even if you accused me of having an affair with your own mother!\" ... and then I would turn around and leave the room or house if necessary. In reality, what hurt the most was that HE BELIEVED ALL HIS ACCUSATIONS BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT. I remember telling my counselor how I'd like to trade places with him so that he could feel the pain he was causing me... He quickly interrupted my thoughts and said, \"don't ever say that again, there is no greater pain than what he's feeling as a prisoner of DDJ.\" So unfortunately, if your wife truly does have a delusional disorder, it does get worse... which is why I am now divorced and raising four children practically on my own.

I've also cruised the Mid Life crisis boards and the Menopause boards and many stories are similar. Something comes over people and they go off the deep end. They destroy everything they have loved and worked for and blame someone else (or everyone else) for the results. It's very sad. In this thread alone there are 4 men that have almost the exact situations. It must be diagnosable and treatable. You just have to trick the person into getting help. I had one chance with a marriage counselor and he didn't work out. I've read other threads on this board where people successfully get the person to go to a Dr only to have the Dr wimp out which then throws the other person under a bus. You have to play that psychiatrist card carefully. You may only get 1 shot. As for instigating a divorce, I find that my wife will make many threats and they all come up empty. Those were the mistakes I made at first: I would react to her threats. Now I just brush them off. She never follows through on anything. So if my wife threatened a divorce, I would challenge her to go ahead knowing that she would never pull it off. Nearly all of her threats are idle and are just attempts to hurt me to get some type of reaction I believe. And I do say it works most times. Because once she has broken me down, then she seems to become calm and we have a good spell for a while. I also read in one of our threads that someone can \"see the episode coming\". I'm with you there. I can always see them coming which helps me not to react. I just ride them out. But eventually, she has to hurt me to gain some inner peace for herself.

My wife and I have been married for over 5 years. For the last 2 years she started accusing me of having an affair and these accusations have got to a point where she has moved out of the house and is ready to file for divorce. She does not listen to reason and no matter who talks to her she will not believe that there is no affair. She also believes that my family has been doing witchcraft for her and after she moved out of the house these delusions have only gotten stronger. She refuses to go for counseling and thinks I am a psychopath and have bipolar disorder and that I am trying to make her look crazy. The thing is I understand her illness as she was always possessive over me. She didn't like me being on Facebook, so to make her happy I deleted my facebook all social media, she did not want me on Whatsapp so I did not bother to upgrade my phone. She always accused me of looking at other women, but I am not the type of person to even approach someone, I am a very introverted person. I used to be questioned every day about what I did for the day, and if I needed to work overtime I used to pick my wife up and she kept me company at work. The whole time we where married I never spent a night apart from her except when I was in hospital. I do not understand where her delusions come from and when I ask her to go for therapy she refuses. I want to help her but it seems like my marriage is over and she refuses to even talk to me. I have lost my job, my family, my health and my reputation trying to prove my innocence. All this stress of being constantly accused put me in hospital and now she does not even feel an ounce of guilt as she thinks it is punishment from god. I changed my religion and relocated to another town to prove my love for her and she still does not want to be with me. Recently I went through her old phone and noticed messages from her mum saying that she must not trust me and my family. This from a mother who abandoned her when she was 4 years old, and the only reason she is close to her mum was because I helped restore that relationship. Please help me in resolving this situation, should I give my wife time and space and hope she comes back to me, or is she going to be happier without me in her life. At the moment her mother says she is happier away from me but I don't know what to do because I love her so much and I cannot give up on her. Is there any possibility for reconciliation in our marriage?", "hash": "2443bb71f7c4eabb8cf3b1e2bb7205f1b7b7f61dbcf073e6b4101f8c5403459a"}

I don't think anything that anyone does or says causes delusion disorder. I think it's just a brain gone wrong. I'm not an expert, but I've read many accounts of people who have loved ones with this disorder and their backgrounds and life situations are all varied. With my mom, she will tell everyone that her ex-husband abused her, and she's very believable until she starts to mention the part about him scratching her cooking pots, or sanding the picture frame. But all the stories have changed a lot over the past 9 years that we've known she's had delusions. They divorced over 6 years ago, after he lived with constant accusations for 3+ years. We were worried about his stress. She accused him of multiple affairs, of stealing her things, etc. Now she thinks he is still entering her apartment to damage her things. Believe me, he did not abuse her, he did not steal or damage her things. They were together 30 years before she got delusions. Their relationship wasn't perfect, but it was nothing anyone did that resulted in her having delusions. I am relieved they are no longer together because of the terrible stress for him. I wish so much their being apart could have also relieved her stress that her brain is causing herself, but that can't be helped. She refuses all the delusion diagnoses she's received, from multiple doctors. Over the years, not only do her details of the delusions change but the types of delusions change, too. In the past year, she has acquired the type where she thinks she has tiny bugs on herself, like fleas or mites. I just don't want loved ones to think they could or should have done something different, or blame themselves. I've tried so hard to ease my mom's mind, but nothing works and I've learned to let it go and distance myself. It's very sad because in some ways, she is still 'there' and there are times when she seems fine. It's a tragic illness.", "hash": "5abdf9ca286ae3c1684cbb8014a3bd17c111b656d54cc838d5e5ca0a2a34bb61"}

I’m not even sure if this is the right forum, but I meed some advice. Sorry in advance, this will be a bit long. I’m an American student studying in China. I live on campus with a roommate, another American, who is also in most of the same classes as me. From the beginning (2 months ago) she was very quiet and somewhat lethargic, but neither of these things bothered me and we’ve had a pretty peaceful cohabitation so far. In the past week, things have changed drastically. I noticed she began doing little inexplicable things; keeping the window shut constantly, tossing my things onto my side of the room if I accidentally left them laying around. Then, 2 days ago as I was preparing to head out for class, she asked me suddenly if I had a “problem” with her. I confusedly said no, and when I asked her why she thought that, she responded that she kept “hearing my name everywhere”. This made as little sense in context as it does here, but she somewhat coldly dropped the subject when I assured her I had nothing against her. When I returned from class, she briefly stepped out almost immediately; when she returned, her mood had gone from her usual stoic silence to genuine anger. She accused me of insulting her on very petty points (her weight, skin color, etc) to other students around campus, and further stated that my comments, and comparisons between her and myself, were now being widely discussed. I obviously denied everything and, thinking there was some misunderstanding, asked her who had been saying these things. This is where things became odd: despite my asking multiple times, she would not name names, or even describe the people supposedly badmouthing her, but kept insisting that “everyone” was talking about her. She said she had been hearing my name “40 times a day” over the past few days, and that she had also heard my voice yelling “I hate her” repeatedly outside, while gesturing towards the sole window in our dorm room. At this point I remembered her sudden habit of keeping the window closed at all times; the window looks out over a large courtyard, one can only hear what people outside are saying if they’re shouting. I eventually got her to specify that she overheard our classmate outside, saying “she ought to tell her” in Chinese, to a male voice who replied “She won’t/didn’t tell her”. I don’t know how this dialouge was supposed to relate to the issue at hand. Please note that the accused classmate is extremely uncomfortable speaking Chinese in any context, let alone gossiping loudly outdoors. Still thinking that there was some misunderstanding, I became upset and teary. Besides denying any wrongdoing I asked her to tell me immediately the next time she heard any such comments, so that I could confront the people in question. By this time I was suspicious that these things could not be happening in reality, but I didn’t try to argue with her on that point. She calmed down, though I’m not sure what exactly made her suddenly passive. When I asked if anything else had made her think I hated her, she made vague comments about how we needed to mutually help keep our room clean, and pointed out that i often left the toilet cover down, as though doing so was a clear sign of ill will towards her. When she eventually apologized if she had falsely accused me, she offered me some tea in an abruptly cheerful way. For the rest of that day she was her usual (stoic, untalkative) self. The next day at 6 am, when I hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet, she repeated the same charges against me, only this time with certainty that was genuinely disturbing. She claimed to be hearing my name constantly, and at that moment gestured to the men outside chatting in what might have been Urdu, saying incredulously “You don’t hear it?” She refused to hear anything I had to say and produced a list of other dorm rooms that had vacancies, which i now realize she must have gotten the day she first confronted me, saying that if I had a problem with her then I should move out. When it became clear we were at an impasse I silently prepared to head out for the day, while she sat on her bed staring into space for what must have been 15 minutes. Since that discussion, which was yesterday morning, I have been avoiding her entirely; I went by the room briefly to get items I absolutely needed, with classmates watching over me, and am now sleeping on the floor of someone else’s room. I obviously can’t know exactly what she’s experiencing, but the thigs she’s saying have led me to believe she’s hearing things that are not really there, at the very least, and that it’s not safe for me to be around her. Today is Sunday; tomorrow morning, I plan to go to the dorm manager’s office as soon as it opens, and ask for a new dorm assignment far away from her. So here is my question (finally): besides moving out of the room, is there anything else I can do to improve this situation? We have the same curriculum, so I will still have to see her in class (although her attendance is very poor), and the thought of that fills me with dread. On the other hand, she has never threatened me in any way, and the Chinese government is extremely unsympathetic towards the mentally ill (to the point that she could be deported or even imprisoned if evidence of her illness was sufficient) so I’m hesitant to report her delusions to anyone. She probably needs help but we are in a country that is notoriously poor at providing it. Another problem is the language barrier; my Chinese is decent, but I am not at all fluent enough to descibe this situation accurately to anyone beyond “I don’t feel safe around my roommate, I must move as soon as possible”. I don’t have any way to contact her family or friends. I don’t know what else to do. Any advice would be appreciated.", "hash": "b71c8872583c02e1a89d406ea4388a1cdc80109ac7fe2ec13101eb0d182c22f5"}

I did not know that a di sease such as Delusional Disorder Jealous Type even existed till I first found this forum when googling desperately about what could be causing my wife to be so paranoid about me.And I think maybe she is suffering from it. She thinks 1. I have cameras set up around the house to spy on her and do what I need to do. She has removed smoke alarms and CO sensors in our bedroom since she feels there is a camera in it that I have planted. I have asked her to have it checked by someone if she wants but no go. 2. I write on her with my finger the initials of the person I am supposedly cheating her with when I hug her while sleeping. 3. She is suffering from an as of yet undiagnosed condition which causes her severe uncontrollable itching in the genital and anal regions. She thinks this is because of STDs I have passed on to her. I have taken STD tests 3 times in the last two years and still she doesn't believe the results. 4. She checks my pockets, my underwear, and everywhere to find the \"device I have hidden\". When she doesn't find anything she says maybe I have it implanted in me and use it to communicate with another woman when in the restroom. 5. I have given her my phone and she has set the passcode for it. I only use it when I get calls or when I call my family in front of her. And still she feels somehow I have hacked it to be able to communicate with others. She has accused me of hacking her phone, her mom's phone and everything possible. 6. She finds her own hair in our car, wrappers she put sometime back, her hair clips and she says they belong to some other girl. 7. She keeps hearing imaginary conversations I have with supposedly other women discussing how I am going to get out of this marriage. I have taken to recording my laptop screen (with audio) when I am working and even when I show her the recording which clearly has no conversations she says the video is rubbish and is manipulated. 8. She used to say she can smell perfume on my shirt after coming back from work. (I do not use any perfume at all). 8. She has accused me of flirting and showing interests in all sorts of women. Women who were old enough to be my mother and my own cousin. 9. She bought a bunch of spy cams and tried to keep them all around the home but I found out since I saw the email confirming her order. She used them only once and has not used it since. 10. If she is ever out traveling alone or visiting her family she will video call me up at the middle of the night and ask me to walk around the home to show that there was no woman in our home. She has now gone to her Grandfather's funeral and has set up some security cameras all over the house. But still she accuses me of turning them off whenever I want to. 11. I work from home nowadays because I find it hard to take the accusations that accompany me actually going to my office and even then she accuses me of communication with some woman through some means. Does this sound like DDJ? All these accusation have taken their toll on me. I get very agitated and start yelling when she makes these accusations or as she says it asks me questions. We have had very bad fights. We have gone to couple's marriage counseling and they don't really help as it mostly ends up in her accusing me and me defending and the resentment over the accusations. I always used to wonder why she is so desperately making up stuff to make me seem a bad person. It even seemed like she would actually like me to be the bad person just so that her thoughts of me are proved to be right. When I ask her she says no, she only want to \"correct\" me and get me back on the \"good\" path. I find that line very very insulting as I have not been unfaithful at all and I have done everything possible to help her trust me but she just ignores all my efforts and says I just find loopholes and cheat her and am controlled by the person I cheat her with. I want to reiterate I have never even been unfaithful and my wife is actually my one and only relationship ever. Reading up on this disorder makes me think she is most probably suffering from it. I have called her paranoid and imagining thing during our fights and she says I am gaslighting her and that she is totally normal. I am not able to live in such a marriage anymore and I am going to give her an ultimatum of going for therapy and stop accusing me here onwards or I am going to go for a divorce. The saddest thing here is I actually love her and she loves me too. When she is not having one of these suspicions she is so loving to me it breaks my heart even thinking of leaving her. I am just breaking down crying every few hours when I think of what I should do and all the happy moments we have had. I look at our photographs and it kills me to even think of giving up on our marriage. But she thinks of me as a cheater and a liar who is putting up an act for every other person in this world. I have been completely open with her. She knows the password to every account of mine. She has my phone 99% of the time. But still there is only distrust. I know I cannot continue in this marriage if I am going to be accused like this every now and then. This has affected me mentally. I have stopped socializing at work and have cut down on most friendships because of all the accusations. I know I cannot bring a child in to this world with her if we are going to be like this always. I am distraught and am depressed. Any words will help. Please help me through this horrible time. Why did my wife have to get this horrid horrid disease.

I can tell you that for us, it seems to get worse and professionals have told me that I need to maintain boundaries, because I can't help her, I can't solve her delusions, and I need to protect my well-being. In our case, my mom has been divorced from her husband for 6 years and her delusions about him keep changing and increasing. She has also developed another kind of delusion, in addition to the paranoia and jealousy kind. She now thinks she has little bugs on herself, she said it was fleas at first, then she said they went away, and now she thinks she has mites. She still spends money on a door alarm system to keep her now-ex-husband out, and calls police occasionally because of the break-ins. Of course, there is no one coming in and stealing her stuff (and sometimes she says he returns and puts the item back), or hacking her computer, or causing her water pipes to make a noise... on and on. She recently told me she's hired a private investigator, and joined an domestic abuse support group. I only wonder how many weeks it will take for these people to realize that the stories she tells never happened. They'll probably start to question when she talks about her ex putting dust on her through holes in her ceiling. She has had doctors tell her she's got delusions, but she won't believe that, and then won't see those doctors. She was on an anti-psychotic medication for a couple weeks, but it didn't help. I've tried and tried to comfort her and calm her fear by letting her know there isn't anyone after her, but she gets angry and accuses me of being naive and stupid. When it started, she thought her husband was having multiple affairs, even with some of my acquaintances, and that he molested my son, and had her car tracked, was damaging her furniture, and on and on. We were so worried about his stress level dealing with the constant accusations. He loved her and endured for 3 years, and finally she pursued a divorce. He's not my dad, but we are still connected with him and make sure he's okay. He's still like a step-dad to me, and he's a wonderful man. We are so glad they are no longer together because of the stress on him. Please don't feel guilty or blame yourself for needing to be away from the delusional person. Sometimes it's necessary. This illness is truly horrible. I will always make sure my mom has a roof over her head, but I need to minimize contact, and minimize my family's contact with her. It's very sad, because in some ways she's still smart, funny, cute, but in other ways, my mom is gone.", "hash": "558d554c576e4633748115fc791f316813893d0e1da50856877d013bc02ca36b"}

Just having someone respond helps me so much. We are living separately for the last month now and it is such a relief I am actually able to go to a store by myself and not worry if the line at the counter is too long. I gave my wife an ultimatum that she needs to accept that I have never cheated and to never again accuse me and that she needs to go and talk to a doctor. It went as well as I should have expected she said I am the one suffering from Bipolar disorder and I am the one that needs to go to the doctor. She completely ignores any questions that I ask about her obviously false accusations and only focusses on things which I cannot disprove. I have told her I need a divorce and now she says she loves me and we can start afresh and she will not accuse me if I do not do anything wrong. How can I accept that? I have never done anything wrong and have been called a thief, a cheat and a liar for no fault of mine. How can I accept that she would not repeat this. Even now she says she saw what she saw and heard what she heard and that I have done bad things to her. And she alleges the only reason I am asking for a divorce is to get married to the person she says I am \"having an affair\" with. Makes me want to cry. I am trying to hold strong to my demand for divorce but the time away some how makes me remember only the good times, look at our pictures and cry. I cannot let myself be treated that way again.

I need advice from people who understand how to interact with (or whether or not to try to interact with) people with certain delusions. My situation is as follows: I am a young female trauma survivor who posts online content for other trauma survivors. I have a bit of a following, not that big but pretty big for the type of content I make. About a month ago, I got an email from a guy who I thought might be delusional and beyond my help, but something he said indicated that he might be a survivor of the type of trauma I am, so I responded once, being supportive and casually opening the door for further conversation. His response was really nonsensical and included mention of something sexually inappropriate, so I chose not to respond further. Since then, I have received dozens of emails from him, none of which I have responded to. At first, I hoped it would stop and mostly didn't read what he sent. But it's been over a month now with no sign of ceasing, so I started reading his most recent ones. It appears that he thinks I am speaking to him in some kind of code through my online content and he has become increasingly angry that I am not replying to his emails directly. He has become demanding that I respond to him directly, believes that he deserves a response. He has told me he has a history of extreme violence (I presume from the context it was in his childhood, but that naturally frightens me). And has continued to send weird, sexual stuff. No pictures or pornography that I have seen, but keeps bringing up an erotic story site. He has also become verbally abusive, criticizing me for things I said on my website and calling me some not-so-nice adjectives. He uses lots of expletives in his emails and frequently goes off about psychotic and hypocritical people who he thinks are problematic (seems very angry towards society in general, which I relate to, but I digress). I'm currently at a point where I feel like I need to do something about this, but don't know what. I am unwilling to stop my online work over this or stop making my email available to people who need help. And I would allow this person to go on emailing me indefinitely with no response - I'm already doing that with someone else who I do not feel poses any physical threat - but I now feel like, given the level of anger this person is directing toward me and how delusional they appear, that I may not be safe and may need to take some action. The problem is, I don't know what. I grew up with people who were sicker than him, but learned that there was no effective way to communicate with them and went no contact. I don't know how to deal with this person effectively if it's possible to do so at all. If anyone has any suggestions, that'd be greatly appreciated. I do not want to make this worse.", "hash": "5d976a428ef181402882ad31339e1ae91b4d7c5d9a6d4ffc8f2779b8b2efb87b"}

The doctors havent confirmed it yet because he doesnt agree to go for treatment. But they are going in the direction of paranoid psychosis . Which is just another name for DD as far as i know . There are a lot of co incidences happening that are confirming his delusions . His delusion is that I along with his friends are family are talking behind his back and giving him hints about it to mess with his head . None of us talk to each other. The co incidences usually go like this . We have a conversation and a few days later or sometimes later whenever he talks to his friends they say a word or something similar to what we have spoken about. Sometimes he knows that he could be just over thinking but still doesnt fail to accuse me of lying to him. He also thinks God is talking to him and going out of his way to be a part for my boyfriends life . He also thinks that when he is high with consumption of weed he becomes more spiritually receptive . He asks god a question and the next word he sees or picture he looks at or something he hears is the answer . Talking about the co incidences with friends. An example of it when he told about his chat with God . He gave me a reference of his friend Gordon because it sounds like God . Later when he met his friend and spoke to him about God and his chat that friend took Gordons name. Gordon is a mutual friend of both my bf and his friend. They talk about him quite frequently . Now he thinks i told his friend all about what i spoke to my bf and he took gordons name to mess with his head . And many such incidences. I did not talk to any of his friends . Im not friends with any of them . He keeps accusing me of talking to them . He also accused me of having an affair with them . I cant take all this anymore.

How to convince him ? I'm trying to arrange a polygraph test but its very difficult to find one where i live . And I'm just 19 so i cant travel far away for it neither do i have the required amount.

My wife also has a major problem with coincidences, but they don't result in her blaming me for something. It results in her thinking she has \"proof\" that the other people in this town and at her work are plotting against her. Her delusion is that she thinks that these people wanted her to leave me for other single men that they know. And when she didn't leave me, they decided that to make their \"man friends\" feel better about themselves, they had to make her look really bad and break her down. So every coincidence that happens is proof to her that they are doing this to her. The problem for me is that they thought to fix her up with their friends because they found out that I was such an awful husband, and if I hadn't been so bad, they never would have thought to fix her up with their friends. So in the end, it's all my fault, but I'm not blamed directly for each of these coincidences. I was not a bad husband, not that I was perfect. So I end up apologizing for things from the past that I did not do. That seems to diffuse the situation, and prevent a nasty argument. I'm not sure what to tell you about your situation. He's specifically blaming you directly for these coincidences. I will tell you that simply saying \"I didn't do it\" probably will never work. I'm really grasping at straws for a suggestion, but how about this...... With this friend Gordon, there are sort of 2 parts to it. 1-that his friend new about his chat with God and 2-that you were the one to tell him. Is it possible to deflect this, sort of, and just say something like - \"I have no idea how your friend found out. I didn't tell him, but somebody must have. Are you sure you didn't talk about this with anybody else? Or did someone over hear something?\" You may have to defend yourself and prove that you couldn't have said anything. Like maybe you've been so busy that you haven't even had time to call your mother etc. I guess what I'm getting at is I think you might have more luck arguing how the coincidence happened as opposed to trying to convince him that nothing really happened. I have had absolutely no success trying to convince my wife that these coincidences are nothing. Absolutely no luck at all. So here's a recent example. She went for a 30 minute jog yesterday. While out jogging one of \"them\" passed by on a motorcycle. She was convinced that this was intentional and they knew she was going out for a jog and they are checking on her and plotting the next thing they're going to do to her. What I can't say is \"gosh I'm sure it's just a coinicidence. Why would they be out checking on you?\". Instead what I said was \"that's awful. Don't they have better things to do with their time. What is their problem? What kind of nut-case does something like that?\" I'm not sure if that's helpful or not. I wish I had better advice to give.", "hash": "2f6600c6e47aec29781210f61043273d0ccd4cc18bbe3049ae5796f603805a1a"}

I mentioned that a lot of people who post here who have loved ones with a delusional disorder talk about how their loved ones direct all their blame and anger towards them. So I asked if this was something that one day my wife might start doing to me - even though she's not doing it yet. And how would I handle something like that as I don't know if I could. She said the reality is that people with delusional disorders don't typically get better on their own. They need therapy and maybe medication. What's more, without help, they typically get worse, so yes it's possible that one day she may start doing that to me. She didn't have any magic answers for how to handle it.

I believe that my husband has delusional jealousy. It has not been diagnosed because he has not discussed this with a dr. We are going tomorrow for me to take a polygraph examination. My hopes were that this might prove my innocence. He has been accusing me of sleeping with our best friends - first it was both of them (male/female couple) and now he thinks I've been having an affair with just the male. He has been placing audio recorders in our bedroom, in my car and then he listens to these recordings and says its proof that I am having sex when in fact I am not. I don't hear hardly any of the things that he hears and the parts that I do hear are nothing but normal noises - but he turns them into something sexual. He also has a very strong jeoulousy fetish and has even asked me to be sexual with this same couple. I have always refused as I want nothing to do with that and I'm certain that they would not either. Several months ago it did come to a blow up where this couple was informed of what he thought was going on. Of course they denied it because it has never happened and we all chalked it up to him having side effects from taking Adderall. He apologized to them and said he was just going crazy but then it has continued with me. He constantly still accuses me of sex with this male friend. HE is certain that the recording that he has from last Saturday proves that this man was at our house and that we had sex. That Saturday I was home alone, no ne ever came here but in his mind there is absolutely no disputing it. He keeps telling me that it is OK if I have sex with him that he just wants me to tell him detailed stories about it because it turns him on. Again I want nothing to do with that. I feel that his DDJ is somehow tied into his overpowering sexual fantasies. I'm all alone. I have been keeping this to myself because our friends think this was just a bizaare mental breakdown due to his Adderall and that everything has been fine since; but this has been going on for almost 8 months. I love my husband and I want our relationship to get back to normal. The only way that can happen is if he realizes that he has a problem and gets help with it. My questions for you are - How can I get him to realize that these thoughts he has are not real and what kind of help do we seek?

It sounds like he is projecting his fantasies on you in a very strong way. DDJ people have very strong feelings that cheating is going on no matter what the evidence is or what the spouse says/does. Has he turned normal everyday things into “evidence” and refuses to believe anything otherwise? What about your male friends (if you have them), is he very jealous and suspicions of them? My advice is that if you plan to stay with him then do not give him any reason to doubt you on even the simplest things, be very open and transparent. Any hint that you are not being truthful or honest could be blown way out of proportion against you and he’ll think you’re lying to him about everything. A good relationship counselor should be able to help. His sexual desires make this a little more complicated at least from my point of view because they sound very strong.

I am an open book. I let him track my every move with find my i-phone, he reads all my texts, checks my phone continuously for incoming/outgoing calls and texts, has all my passwords for any social media... I tell him every where that I go. This week I had to go to a meeting at another work building just 5 minutes from where I work. I made sure to tell him that I was going and I called him when I was done. Yet in that 5 minute drive between buildings he thinks that I texted my best friends husband and said \"come n get it\" this is because he had another recorder in my car and thinks that is what he heard. Of course he can't see that text because it does not exist but he now thinks i have some other way of texting that does not show up on my phone. I left the meeting at 4:00 and was on the phone talking to him at 4:05 based on phone records. I recall being on the phone with him when I returned to my work after the meeting. These accusations never even make any rational sense. How could I possibly have some type of affair in that 5 minutes. This is the same with all of his accusations. Nothing is ever rational. On 4/2/18 I took a polygraph test. He had promised me that if I took the test and passed that he would get counseling. Well I passed and it did no good. All it did was waste a bunch of money because he does not believe the polygraph now. He had an appointment with a counselor and he cancelled it. He previously paid a company to evaluate part of a recording and they came back saying there was absolutely no sexual activity heard on the recording - he did not believe them either. When things are good I am so happy. He truly is the love of my life and I want to spend the rest of my life with him but when he is like this which is now about 70% of the time - my life is miserable. I feel so weak for staying and putting up with all of this #######4 but at the same time I don't want to end this marriage - I just need him to realize that all of these thoughts are ridiculous and untrue and to go back to the way he used to be. He is Jeckyl and Hyde. Last night we went out , we had a great time. This morning I wake up to him telling me he knows I did something and that he WILL catch me. You asked about guy friends - well that is who he believes I am having this dillusional affair with, a mutual guy friend. When he is with this friend he acts like everything is fine and doesn't ever say anything to him about it. He has questioned me about other men in the past but for this past year he is fixated on this one person. How did you come to realize that you had DDJ? I've brought this up to him but he refuses to consider it and just tells me to stop trying to diagnose him. Thanks!

I’ve always struggled with a girlfriend’s past, whether it was an innocent one or a more sexually active one. I would analyze over and over and over making them out to be “bad” no matter the past. I would ask questions about their past and then not believe what they told me and then obsess about it. After doing that for too many relationships I realized it must be me, there was no way all these women were that “bad”. Up to this point cheating was not really a worry for me (a little but not too much). I definitely had a trust issue though. I then dated two consecutive woman (not at the same time, lol) who both cheated on me and I stayed with each of them too long after finding out they cheated which only added to my analyzing and anxiety if they were cheating or not (I should have left them immediately but I stayed). This added to my struggle with trust. I finally left and I then met my future wife and I went through the same struggles about analyzing here past. Her past was conservative but I still analyzed it and made it “bad” in my head. This slowly lead me to think she cheating on me, it didn’t help that she lived an hour away when we were dating. She is not a big phone person so I would get very uncomfortable when she did not answer. My thinking went on and one but I hid it well and always seem happy on the surface. Eventually it would surface and I would ask if she was cheating. I’d analyze her answers, body language, etc. She had a coworker that turned into what she called a “good friend”. She hid their friendship from me, I eventually found out and confronted her, she knew him for two years, they texted/talked 4 times/week at least. I fell into another dark place convinced she cheated. She says I’m over analyzing and that she hid it because she was afraid I’d over react. That was six months ago and I still struggle daily. The DDJ mind is loves to analyze to the point that it seems like paranoia. Has he been deeply hurt in the past? If you plan to be with him, 100% openness is ideal and it sounds like you have been. The DDJ mind will find a reason to no believe almost anything, just like the lie detector test you took (I’m not surprised he doesn’t believe the results). My wife agreed to take one but I know it will only help me for a short amount of time. It’s like the DDJ mind likes to focus on the slightest chance of something bad happening (i.e. cheating) instead of facts or evidence to the contrary. Please don’t feel weak, you are very strong for dealing with this. One thing to consider is your own mental health. I’m sure you don’t want to look back and regret staying. He does need serious help/or medication. If you plan to stay know it will be a roller-coaster ride (as you already know). How does he react to misunderstandings? Does he turn them into “you cheated”?

My mother has suffered from delusional disorder for about 20 years now, starting around age 45. The delusions have grown over time. It started as somatic type (resembling hypochondria). Then, after ten years, she revealed that she also believes my father (her husband) was trying to poison/harm/kill her (persecutory DD). It's pretty much torn apart the family. She's kicked my dad out of the family home. He's stuck in limbo with a temporary housing arrangement for a few years now. In spite of his wondering, I don't think he'll ever be able to go back.

It wouldn't start, but couldn't see the point in calling her, that wouldn't fix my car. Called the tire store, had them come give me a jump start, went to the tire store and paid for that service, then ran home to pick up the kid so I could go back and get a new battery put in. Tire store said they would credit me for paying for the jump start when I bought the new battery. Done. Later, when she gets home, we had a conversation about it: Me: Thought of calling you when my car wouldn't start, but that didn't make any sense, because you wouldn't be able to fix my car, so I called the tire store and had them come give me a jump. They wanted me to go pay for it right away so I had to do that before coming to pick up little one. That's why I couldn't turn the car off. I had to go right back and get a new battery, and they gave me credit for what I had already paid. Her: They gave you credit for the tow truck? Me: What tow truck? Her: The one that towed you back. Me: I didn't get towed, they gave me a jump start. Her: Oh, and now you have to go back and get a battery? Me: No, I already got a battery after I picked up little one. Her: So now you have to install it? Me: No, they installed it there. Her: And they're going to pay you back? Me: They already gave me credit when I paid for the battery. Her: But are they going to pay you back for the battery? Me: Who? Her: The insurance company from the accident. Me: That was 2 months ago and the lady just backed into my driver's side door. It had nothing to do with a cell going out in the battery. Her: Oh, I thought it did. They should pay you back. I'm at a loss for words. Is she delusional (not being sarcastic).

Here's my story!! Background--- Me and my partner have been together nearly 29 years. I was 14!! He was 15. We have two wonderful boys that are now young men. He didn't have the greatest childhood, he wasn't nurtured at all by his parents and his mum had 7 children by 4 different men. His mum cheated on his dad too. Over the years he has always had jealous tendencies, I have lots count of the amount of times he has accused me of liking different men, including friends and family. He cheated on me when we were about 17, it was a difficult time but we managed to move on. He got into taking amphetamine for a couples of years when we were in our 20s but he hasn't touched it for about 19 years. He has suffered with depression for many years and takes anti depressants, about 10 or so years ago he was told he had bipolar and has been medicated every since. About 2 years ago, I suffered a devastating blow when I found out he had cheated again on me and had a son with another women!! The boy had contacted my oldest son to tell him that his dad was his dad too. I was totally heartbroken by this but I decided that I wanted to stay with him. I loved him and believed that he was a different person when he was taking drugs. 7 weeks after finding that out, I then found out that he was messaging a women who he was working with. I couldn't believe that he was hurting me again. He said it was because he needed attention and she had shown him it as I didn't want nothing to do with him as I had been shattered. What a selfish bastard!! But again I decided to stay with him. I ended up on anti depressants myself and had to have professional counselling. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with but I am a survivor. I love this man to bits and never want to be without him, I don't know what it is as you wouldn't think I could love someone who has hurt me so bad. When he is my normal happy go lucky hubby, I couldn't ask to be treated better. He is good looking, sexy, funny, kind and much much more. Present-- The last 18 months or so have been an absolute nightmare. I feel I am constantly watched, questioned, under investigation and he thinks he knows how I think. I am now at the point where I am ready to walk away from him. I have to put up with the following : - Every time we go out, he accuses me at looking at men, he tells me I look at nice cars as there are men in them. - I wear my sunglasses in the car as he says he feels better as he can't see where I'm looking. - I look out of my passenger window so I don't get accused of looking at the drivers coming towards us. - He asked me why I don't use my sun visor, I told him I don't ever think of using it as I have my sunglasses on, he says it's because I want to be on show. - it is very hot at the moment so I have had my shoulders out, he says I am parading myself as I want attention. - he says that men smirk at him which he believes it's because I must of smiled at them. He thinks men do this to to say 'your woman has just looked at me' mugging him off. - I started a new job, he questioned me about the men that worked there? I took pictures of the four men that are there to ease his mind. - I had a training course, I ended up taking pictures of the people in the course. He didn't ask me to do so but I knew he would feel insecure. He even took the day off of work to take me and collect me. - if I don't call him within a certain time in my lunch break because i am busy and haven't started my lunch, I will be presented with messages asking me if I am ignoring him? - when he has jealous thoughts he is nasty with his words. - I text him when I am back in the village where I live everyday. - i get a lift down a big hill from a couple of different ladies at work. I have took pictures of them to show him they are women as he says I wouldn't tell him if I got a lift off of a man. I would never accept a lift from a man!! - he has accused me of pleasuring myself!! Which I have never done. - I had a fete at work, I work in a school. When I got home, I was telling him about it and then he went quiet. He said he had forgotten about the dads of the kids at school. He said I might fancy them. - I had to go to an appointment with a policeman, my son came with me as he couldn't make it. When I got home, he asked if the policeman was good looking? I said he was an average looking man, he said that because I fancied him. When the policeman visited our home, I went in the bedroom and let him deal with it, I just couldn't face another load of accusations. I'm sure there are more i could list but I think you got the general idea...... life for me is draining, I feel so exhausted and stressed living day in and out with this. I am genuine, loyal and committed to this man. I have never cheated on him ever!! I have treated him with respect all throughout our relationship. I just want a normal happy life with him and to make happy memories but for whatever reason he just won't let us be. I am not interested in looking, smiling or getting attention from any man, I just want him to believe in me and trust me, but he doesn't believe any of it. He says everyone likes to looked at as it makes you feel good. I can assure you I don't want any of it!! I have done lots of research on delusional jealousy and I really believe he suffers with it. It is so painful to be viewed as a person I am not!! I'm just me!! Don't want much out of life other than a happy home. It also hurts to see him when he is behaving like this as I know I am not doing anything wrong and he really doesn't need to be suffering. I have tried to help him but currently I feel like I have lost him. I feel empty and numb and at breaking point. I love him to pieces but I can no longer live with this constant strain. I deserve so much more. I keep telling him I am his wife and should be treated like it but instead, I am treated like a suspect and his enemy. I would be grateful for any replies to help me decide what to do. I want a life with him but not this life. Thank you for reading my story....", "hash": "3a2c5c2235d8fe638b3cbef5b2c1e33f7012cd45a83931b8ddd59dd1743a98fb"}

This has rocked our entire world. We have had so many ups and downs due to his illness. I didn't know that many of the issues we faced in the past were due to his illness. There was a time where he \"knew I was cheating on him\" by the way I scrolled on my phone. Has shown up to work functions unannounced. Made a huge scenes about me going out with friends so I stopped wanting to go etc. Now, we are dealing with police following him, phone tapped, house bugged, etc. This has been going on for about a year so he says. He told me about 6 months ago and he finally agreed to see a doctor and they prescribed 25mg of seroquel to start. I have a couple of questions if you all would be so kind to answer. 1. He keeps a lot of things from me, so I feel very unsure about what is really going on in his head. Is this normal? I think he thinks Im part of the \"network\", but he wont say. 2. Are people with DD dangerous? He hasn't been violent with me recently but we have had some very terrible arguments in the past that got physical. 3. Will he ever be free of the delusions? He believes them so strongly and I believe, from what family members say, he has been experiencing them for over 20 years.

My father had major depressive disorder with psychotic features, but never schizophrenia or anything. With him things would get out of hand if his depression went unchecked. I don't really get much depression like my father did (just little minor episodes). But I do fear that I have delusional thoughts. To add to this its because of my past drug use (mainly pot, and psychedelics). I tend to get extremely deep thoughts. My thought process gets really deep. Like for some reason I have the feeling of the universe just making sense. I'm not saying I believe I \"understand\" how everything works, but I get the feeling that things just click in a very un-logical way. Like if us humans stopped thinking logically then we could begin to understand the point of life without the black and white filter of our own logic. Before I touched drugs I was very over analytical. I'm a computer software engineer so its in my personality to think things are either ones or zeros. But after I tripped for the first time I saw things were not so black and white. Things had color, and I felt kind of \"enlightened\" and felt there was something else to this life. This feeling of \"enlightened\" isn't always good either. I get really deep into thought and how the universe works that I feel it could be signs of delusions of grandeur which is a sign of psychosis. So I ask am I just a really deep thinker, or could this be signs of psychosis?", "hash": "d78dbf914f069b748ae446193eb7ce471455b75079d1d8ddd771fcf2850ee048"}

It seems I suffered from some kind of delusional disorder for about a year from Feb 2007 to Feb 2008 before being cured by an anti-psychotic, Risperdal. Looking back now, I had no idea I was delusional (none of my family even suspected anything was wrong with me for an entire year) -- for many months I firmly believed that professors, co-workers, and friends were either secretly in love with me or were somehow plotting my demise. For a long time I had difficulty leaving the house because I thought that complete strangers were staring at me, trying to communicate with me through secret body language signals. I thought the footsteps of the people living above me were in fact coded messages directed at me, and I responded by knocking on the walls (in code) and hanging written responses outside my door that I believed they would understand. It became a full-blown psychosis by the time I got to the hospital -- I believed I had powers to move objects with my mind and that I could telepathically communicate with anyone in the world. The Risperdal almost immediately ended all these bizarre thoughts and sensations, and that was the end of that strange, year-long experience. Right now I'm on no medication. It's been like this since the end of Feb. I'm wondering if it's possible to have had DD for only a short period of time in your life? Like, I was completely normal before 2007, then came that tumultuous delusional year, and now it's back again to normal. I feel like this DD/psychosis bit me in the butt of nowhere -- I wasn't using drugs and I wasn't under any stress. I don't have schizophrenia and I don't believe I'm bipolar. Is this possible?", "hash": "e47abc8cb379625a04b8922ab0c2364a4f586e4c52ee0e12752746e3d3f4b393"}

It hit her out of the blue for about 6 months, then went away for about 9 months, then came back again for 3 months and so far hasn't returned. While the second episode was shorter than the first it seemed to have stretches where the delusions were much more intense than the first time. Unfortunately I understand a common pattern is for people to have one or two early episodes before the DD comes back as a more or less full time thing.

Based on that and the content of your delusions (ideas of reference, thought insertion and other rather bizzare delusions towards the end) this doesn't sound like classic delusional disorder to me (this is not professional opinion, obviously). Note that that's not necessarily bad - from what I have seen/read, even people with schizophrenia which is responsive to medication and well controlled are often better off than those with supposedly milder diagnosis of delusional disorder who are left untreated. I found literature references to psychotic episodes that were \"one time only\" and even to spontaneous recovery so I guess there is still much we don't know about how psychosis actually gets triggered. Are you still seeing psychiatrist? IMO it would be good idea to have some continued contact with psychiatrist while you are off the medication so that any signs of reccurence can be caught early. Another thing you might want to investigate now when you feel well is whether your state has concept of psychiatric advance directive document - that could help ensure that you can get treatment if you get into another psychotic episode even if you lose insight.

Throughout the year I absolutely believed (at least) nine different people were in love with me or wanted to sleep with me, and I thought they were constantly conveying secret \"hints\" of their love -- by raising a coffee cup a certain way, by wearing a certain color shirt, or even by looking at me when passing by. What is devastating about this is that I actually started to develop feelings in return for some of these people. (It's a damn good thing I did not actually act upon my feelings, even though I was CERTAIN they wanted me and CERTAIN it was a match.) So when the Risperdal hit me, and when I realized that not a single one of them was actually communicating any secret messages of love to me, I was heartbroken! The sense of knowing what they were trying to do to me was so incredibly real... Now that I am sobered up, I hang out with some of these people (to this day they have no idea what I was interpreting from their benign actions) and sometimes, all I can wish is that the delusions had been real. It was a very foul trick my mind had played on me. I really thought they liked me back. I also had a delusion that a friend was trying to sexually harass me. Even though I'm \"sober\" now, and the action of him looking at his watch means absolutely nothing to me (when I was delusional it meant he wanted to kiss me), I can still recall the feeling of being uncomfortable quite clearly. For me, I don't think these delusions will ever return so I've actually stopped seeing my doctor altogether. If I do relapse in the future, that's fine by me -- at least then I might be able to get a solid diagnosis. But for now, it's just a mystery.", "hash": "714a29e825ee89d640a3824d192e249d1f40322e15ce600315968d623ff70c79"}

That's what they did with me in Feb of this year, but now it has become apparent that I am not schizophrenic as I am not on medication and have no symptoms at all. My wife was having delusions that were mostly a combination of persecutory and grandiose. She was convinced there was a vast conspiracy (she called it The Intervention) that was monitoring us, and had been for years. On her good days she saw The Intervention as something that was trying to help us; all our friends and relatives (not to mention an army of total strangers) trying to help our marriage. We were going to get a new house from a reality TV show, I was going to be given a new car, they were going to send us and all our neighbors on a free cruise. On her bad days she saw The Intervention as a malignant, potentially dangerous attempt to invade and even control our lives, recording our every conversation and action and putting it all on the Internet for people to watch, for profit. She also had maybe a smattering of Jealous subtype (early on she accused me of having an affair) and even Somatic (she mentioned that she thought some kind of microchip had been implanted in her toe on which she had had surgery several months previously). Unfortunately we never got a diagnosis, when my wife was having symptoms she refused to see anyone, and she was never quite sick enough that I had to have her commited against her will. Now that she is (mostly) asymptomatic she still refuses to see anyone, on the grounds there is nothing wrong with her. She has started seeing a psychiatrist for ADHD, which she has just recently been able to accept that she probably has (I agree that she has it but I don't think the delusions had anything to do with the ADHD). She has convinced herself that I can't handle her ADHD and that is why I keep trying to convince her and other people (MDs and close family) that she was genuinely exhibiting psychotic symptoms. Unlike you my wife was in her mid-forties when this started, my understanding is this is quite a typical age for onset of DD, you seem to be younger than the average victim. Prior to this she had never had any mental problems, at least not anything a layperson would really pick up on.", "hash": "7909887ca5f184fbfb01519007c0d80dbcc87cab55fc97bcbcb2fb1f7bd1da27"}

And I'm just so worried for her health. SHe's so young, I fear that she'll die from a cancer or whatever. I know we have a very difficult life, and she had a lot of problems but she's brillant and I don't want her to die, or to lost her teeth. She does this every single days, and I fear the worst for her life. She is very thin, well my mom gives her dietary supplement that she takes. But even with this, even if she doesen't die from an heart attack she'll probably from a stomach cancer with all this acid...

It's like, if I talk to her she wants to suicide because she feels bad about it, and if I don't, she'll also die from her illness.

Reading the descriptions it is SHOCKING how it was like reading a detailed description exactly of my life the last 6 years. I never realized it was a mental illness until October when he had a breakdown. I thought “he’s paranoid” “why would you think that???” Trying to reason with him or help him understand the truth about whatever circumstance but it never works. Anyway so now on to describing the current situation and asking for advice. My husband has been convinced I cheated on him for years, he had specific people he thinks I cheated with, he thinks none of our children are his, he has particular people he thinks each kid belongs to, he’s had multiple paternity tests done and when they came back showing the kids are his he was convinced someone hacked the system and results. So we’ve lived like this for 6 years and it’s gotten very ugly. This past fall he got a gun out he was threatening to kill himself if I didn’t confess to cheating on him (I never did obviously or it wouldnt be a delusion). I’ve never been so scared. It’s not only that, he doesn’t trust anyone. He in the end cut himself off from every community or church group we’ve ever been in because he becomes convinced they don’t like him, he’s not welcome; he comes up with ideas about people like everyone is cheating on their spouses and everyone is horrible and doesn’t want to associate with all these horrible, immoral people who hate him and are out to get him. It’s like the whole world is a constant threat. He’s always on edge, like a constant fight or flight mode. When he had a psychotic break in October he became convinced that I was into witchcraft that I was cursing him at night and my lips were moving while I was sleeping and I was preventing him from sleeping and he would drive around all night not even staying in one spot because he was convinced people would find him and he wouldn’t sleep for over a week and then he called or texted like 40 or more people that I am currently or have been friends with in the past telling them that I was involved in witchcraft and please pray for me and don’t tell her I told you. When I found out about this and I was very very upset and I had to message everyone again and tell them the situation and after that he did actually realize he needed help and he went and got prayed for for deliverance which made a DRAMATIC CHANGE and after that one day that he had freedom as a result of being prayed for but soon it was back to his same issues. Anyways some really weird incident happened where he took off while I was at women’s retreat and drove three states away to see someone he hasn’t talked to in 20 years and when he got there he thought someone was trying to steal his stuff and he took off and said they were chasing him and he drove right back and I ended up filing a missing persons report and I was freaked out and thought he was in an accident and he finally showed up again at his aunt’s house... But he seems so normal so much of the time and when he sees a doctor or explains his issues nobody ever recognizes this because these are a lot of the time plausible things or he doesn’t even talk about his ideas about this crazy stuff. Now the current situation is that he thinks that me and his parents and basically everybody else in his life is trying to kill him and wants him dead because we are trying to steal his stuff or maybe have a life insurance policy you were trying to cash out on. So he left the state 4 months ago That’s also a long story it was supposedly temporary but he just told me three weeks ago that he is filing for a divorce and he’s not coming back to Michigan at all and we have four little boys their age is 3, 4, 9 and 10. He has been extremely resistant to any other possible interpretations of his beliefs like he thinks I poisoned him two times at least he says he has proof for all these things that he thinks and he is basically abandoning us based on false ideas and refuses to recognize has any kind of problem. His parents and myself and many many people are beside ourselves just not knowing what to do about this or how to get him to see he has a problem. I don’t want a divorce; I want to help him, I want him to get back to being the man I knew and married, I want my kids to have their dad whom they love and miss terribly...but I don’t know how to get him to recognize this problem or seek help.

My boyfriend and I have been dating on and off for a little over a year. When we first started dating, I wasn't aware of any \"delusional\" thoughts he might be having. But as time when on he told me that he thought I might have spies that follow him, his friends were drugging his cigarettes, that am cheating on him, and other things. The good news is, he never seems out of control. He never accuses anyone of anything, but these thoughts still affect his mental state. The thought of me cheating on him with several people seems to be the most problematic. He has said he can't take it anymore, it's like he had a dream that I am cheating on him and knows it's a dream, but still feels depressed and angry about it. I don't know what to do to help him, and it's and to imagine what he feels like. I'm not cheating on him, and I've told him that many times, but the conversation comes up often. I think that he should see a doctor and get diagnosed with something. He's been to a doctor before but they did not diagnose him with anything other than substance abuse (marijuana) and anxiety/depression. I'm confused to as why they didn't think it was anything else. It might be because he is good at controlling his outward emotions, but I'm not sure. We are both in college though, so I'm not sure how realistic it is for him to be able to see a doctor. I just want to help him, because I love him very much and I hate to see him in having to deal with these thoughts, because I know it is hard on him.

When I accepted this delusion as some form of truth I questioned if I should care about walking naked through my home to the laundry room for clothes lol. I like going out in public, getting ready to go out the door seems more fun than actually going out to a store or something out of exhaustion of looking over my shoulder. It has increased with a passing manic episode that lasted for quite a while. While I accept these as delusions I also accept these as possibilities. About a month ago I was standing in my driveway by the garage where a couple floodlights were mounted. It started humorously like hah maybe theirs a camera there that would explain a lot (probably not) so I'd shoot it the bird every time I was alone near it entering the house because of this hidden camera garage door conspiracy so it was in the afternoon and I just looked at it and said to myself well if it's in your head...so I ripped it off the fixture. The light never worked to begin with. Turned out to be a sensor but it almost doesn't matter made me feel so stupid and relieved by the halarity of you just ripped down a bunch of wires because you think \"they\" are watching you. It somehow helped and put things into perspective and make me feel kind of me again. Now i haven't ripped the dish off the house smashed the smoke detector and crawling above the ceiling for monitoring devices. But the delusion is still there. But like your boyfriend I've kept enough of a composure to not be worse off and it's good your concerned. These thoughts are intrusive and obsessive but like your boyfriend it hasn't gone away for me either. Honestly I'm just waiting patiently for it to end (the delusions).

But I’m very glad that you want to help him that you care enough to do that. Does he recognize that these are delusions and if he’s been to the Dr. it sounds like he might know he needs help? Substance-abuse can cause delusions and paranoia - I know that I was never more full of conspiracy theories and paranoia than when I was smoking pot. But I don’t even normally have any such tendencies so if someone did that could be part of the cause of his paranoia. So for one, stopping any substance abuse would be a good start. But a family doctor would not have experience with something like DD he would have to see a psychologist trained in that to be properly diagnosed. DD is very rare. I would recommend you research and find a therapist/psychologist who specifically has experience in DD and suggest to him to see that person for an assessment.

My wife had to put up with me doing similar things when I was acutely ill. So the next thing is to see it for what it is - an illness. It does not matter whether or not you are faithful - the issue is what his mind does with the possibility that you are that exists in every relationship. So, once again, it is not your fault at any level. It is very hard on the sufferer of the disorder, but also on their loved ones as you are finding out the hard way. Firstly, get him to see a good clinical psychologist who can try some cognitive behavioural therapy. The advice I received was that the spouse's reassurance never works, but makes matters worse: if there was reassurance then it meant the spouse took the allegation seriously. Other things that worked for me were that the 'checking' behaviour had to stop. There was a seemingly irrisistable urge to 'check' in many different ways, but if I resisted, then the urge passes. Get help for yourself too. from your doctor and a clinical psychologist, who should be able to help you through this to wherever it leads you. Get him to see a psychiatrist, too. I recovered from the jealousy, mostly. But then the illness found other outlets - such as persecutory beliefs. So therapy is unlikely to be the answer on its own. I took anti-psychotics for a while, but they did not really work. For me, this only resolved once when I took B-group supplements - Blackmore's executive stress. I suspect the supplements work in me because I have a metabolic disorder that responds to the way the supplements inhibit ornithine degarboxylase and get rid of excess ammonia. But severe vitamin deficiency alone can cause these type of symptoms e.g. pellagric psychosis. If you intend to try any form of supplement treatment, discuss it first with his doctor to ensure it is safe for him. Supplements are drugs like any other and have side effects and risks, and they are less well researched than many drugs. Also, ensure his doctors investigates the possible causes of the disorder by carrying out appropriate tests which should be performed, subject to the doctor's advice, before he trys any supplements or drugs. To my mind, these tests should include but not be limited to in order of importance to my mind: 1. Serum amino acids; 2. B vitamins, but particularly vitamins B6 and B3 and B12; 3. Urine amino acids; 4. Metabolic screen; 5. Heavy metals screen; 6. FBC. Your doctor may say that the serum amino acids are not likely to establish a treatable cause of the disorder. However, there is a lot of evidence that abnormal amino acid biomarkers may turn out to be crucial biomarkers of underlying metabolic disorders that cause psychiatric and neuro-degenerative disorders. There is a lot of good quality research that says that these disorders often present with patterns of serum amino acid abnormalities. When doctors understand what the abnormal patterns mean, the disorders become metabolic and are no longer regarded as psychiatric. There are likely to be multiple different metabolic disorder that cause psychiatric conditions. My abnormalities were repeat low serum amino acid ornithine and low serum amino acid serine, with high B3 intermediary and high B6. My doctors regarded these as being in effect meaningless results because they did not understand them, but after researching my abnormal results and my disorder (I do not recommend patients do this and do say that if they do this they should do so under the direct supervision of their doctor and only if their doctor does not advise against it), I established that my disorder may find expression in up-regulation of a cortisol up-regulated pathway that probably leads from proline to ornithine decarboxylase to polyamines. This up-regulation explains these and other abnormal results that I have and is currently being investigated by my doctors, so I could yet be wrong about this. Your partner probably does not have my disorder, but his disorder may be caused by a metabolic derangement and he may or may not have different abnormal biomarkers. If he does have abnormal biomarkers such as amino acids then they are probably not currently understood, but it is better to know what they are so that when they are understood by doctors better targetted treatment can be provided. If drugs or supplements work, they are more likely to be targetting ameliorating symptoms than the cause, until the underlying cause of the disorder is better understood, so treatment can be targetted at the cause. I am mostly hapilly married with a young son, so whilst I am looking at life differently these days, there is hope it can turn out well.

Doc referred him to psychiatrist appointment.

But the one thing I have read about is that this syndrome does not go away on its own and that he will always have it, no matter who he is with. My cousin's husband had it and they divorced. He remarried and he is doing to his second wife the same things he did with my cousin. The new wife doesn't have any independence. She barely opens her mouth when they are out she is afraid to look at anyone directly. My husband is the one who has filed for divorce twice already and then canceled it. He is always asking why we can't move far away. \"Things would be better is only we moved away\". But I know he would just start up again wherever we go. The triggers for his jealousy are all in our area, but he would develop new ones if we move away. Rest assured it is not YOU that created his sickness.", "hash": "1344be0b284d8d5aea1b2d6022393afdfcd16d3ac5fd3d66782b1ceadc00609a"}

All delusions are objective and formulated through subjective reasoning. Consensual validatable reality should be valued more than a projected subjective reality that can not be persuaded false to the delusional. Delusional reality or manifestation would be projecting a subjective meaning and believing it to be the factual (objective)reality of what’s happening. A Dual-subjective reality arises when an individual's mind interprets information and, instead of creating only one interpretation that the conscious mind can make sense of, creates several. These differing \"realities\" then cause conflict within that individual who may confuse what is actually happening around them with alternative realities formulated in their mind based on their own subjective experiences. The psyche, in some, resorts to a psychotic episode when it feels it is powerless and this is the only way to gain anything and triggers an episode that destabilizes the brain. This can be contributed to a variety of factors leading to the onset of psychosis, brain damage medication changes in those who are already diagnosed with mental illness. During this time the mind enters a psychotic process of disintegration down to its basic fundamental functions. However dangerous psychosis is, it can however lead into a much more renewed and refined reintegration of self that can promote growth .", "hash": "4859602909ffdd365284ce52d4bd08a0bfb0650d574d9e34b321c4023a7188c8"}

Before we started dating he had on several occasions made false accusations towards me. We met each other through a mutual friend whilst we were at university, he picked interest me in me and we talked for a while and lost contact. When he resurfaced back into my life shortly before I finished my course at university, he asked to take me out for dinner. I agreed to meet up with him, on the day we were to meet up, he called me and at the time I was in the library when the call came in. Although I picked the call I had to whisper. Fast forward to the date and he told me that when he called me and heard me whispering he thought I was with another man (hence me whispering to him on the phone). At the time I laughed it off and did not read too much meaning to it. On several occasions he would make reference to me being with another man for example, one night he rang me, and as we were speaking his tone changed and he said he heard voices in the background and again asked if I was with another man (I had to explain to him that the phone was on speaker and the noise he heard in the background was from my housemates who were in the living room (my room at the time was on the ground floor next to the living room) even with this explanation he was sure there was a man in my room causing the noise he heard in the background. He also went on my social media and saved images of me with comments from a guy he was convinced that I had had sexual/emotional relations with (he based his claims on the names the guy referred to me as e.g sweetheart, dear). Bearing in mind this guy was in a different country and continent, we became friends via social media. When I told him I had to travel to go and see family, on my arrival he requested that I take a picture to prove that I was really with them. Anyways fast forward to when I went to visit him at his place, this is where things took a turn for the worse and the false accusations tripled. Firstly, it started off as him saying he saw how I looked at his housemate and he was convinced that I sexually desired his housemate. He would say things like \"I saw the way you rolled your eyes at him\", \"I saw the way you walked past him, flaunting your bum so he could have a look\". Then one morning I woke up to a letter requesting that I get out of his house. The days and weeks that followed were filled with more accusations, apparently he said I woke up in the middle of the night and snuck to his flatmate's room and had sex with him, he even added that his flatmate confirmed that he had sex with me. When I requested that we confront his housemate to confirm these claims, he refused and made excuses saying that it was not necessary. He would send me messages asking me why I betrayed him by sleeping with his housemate, he said that I nearly drove him to suicide. For a while we had no contact and we later started talking again, but nothing had changed even as friends, he would bring up his claims of my infidelity when we talked and texted and even try to make me admit to his claims. He tried so hard to get me to agree to his version of events and would get angry and call me a lair when I refuted his claims and disagreed with him. He would say things like I cannot be wrong and I have facts that you cheated and when I would ask for proof, he would say the same things he always says \"I saw the way you looked at him, I am sure you slept with him\" I remember one night he woke up and woke me up and told me that I had been on the phone to his housemate. Some of his other claims involved him accusing me of sleeping with my ex housemate who he was friends with, apparently he had spoken to my ex housemate and when he mentioned my name to him, he had a look on his face which was similar to how I look when I have orgasms. With this he concluded that I had intercourse with my ex housemate. At the early stages he had mentioned that he was a really jealous and paranoid person, again I did not read too much meaning to this until he started to exhibit behaviors that clearly confirmed his claims. Fast forward to a few days ago he still messaged me trying to get me to admit that I cheated as well as laying other accusatory claims and insisting that I had a problem and needed to change my ways to avoid ending up in trouble and lonely. I am glad the relationship ended because the accusations were constant and he would find reason to question my intentions and motives towards him under the disguise of his claims that I gave him reasons to doubt my intents.", "hash": "978090ca936934de842dd579c818944d013ec259802d39fcc4c0d88265421a86"}

I try to take my medication every day. I always relapse when I forget for more than a week. 3. I managed to form a language of my own to interpret \"messages\" that I get. It is a language of love and that has limited characteristics in it. It works for me, but I'm an erotomaniac, so it kinda turns me on and may in some ways make me more vibrant. 4. build your support network of people you can call and talk to. Having social bonds makes it so much better when you need to figure out what is going on. Even if you don't want to share about your symptoms, just talking with someone else can be theraputic. 5. do something you enjoy doing. it will help you stay positive, and it will take you outside of your internal battle. Sometimes distraction is a good medicine (if you have gotten to the point where you can master the \"messages\" coming at you). 6. Did I mention to set reminders to take the medication? I'm never sick when I remember the medication regularly. 7. It took me several medications before I found one that fit my chemistry. Good luck.

When I had my first outbreak I did not beleive anyone who told me, my thoughts were not true. But after a few years I started to learn how to deal with this problem. I thought my friends mother was out to kill me and I was sure of it. There are little things I see that put 2 + 2 together for my delusions to get bigger. I realize I even make up things so everything makes sense in my head. What I try to do is pick out the things that dont fit. That makes me calm down. For example someone rang my door bell and I was in the height of an episode, I thought he was there to kill me and my family. He said he was a salesman. So I thought to myself If he really is a sales man he will be going to other doors too. So I followed him to make sure he was going door to door. Once I saw that I calmed down a bit. It seems the older I get the more frequent I get these episodes. Sometimes it goes for a year sometimes a month without fear. When I do get them they seem to last for at least 2 months. I think that is because nothing I think is actually happening so I give up on the theory. But they never entirely go away. I started to take the drug fluanxol it is an injection that I get every 2 weeks. I have not taken the drug for about 4 months now and I am again in the hight of an episode. I did not want to take the drug because it makes me feel like jumping out of my skin. They give me side effect medication but It makes me into a zombie(Cant think straght). I will have to endure the side effects because I realize I must take this drug. I am also an alcoholic I drink at least 8 beer a day. This is to stop the feelings and thoughts I have. I still have the thoughts when drinking but I am much calmer and I start not to care what will happen. Well thats my situation. If any one has any questions post them here I will come back to see.

Oxytocin also reduced the patients' irritability and increased their overall ability to function. http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01568528 is a trial that will be coming up on Oxytocin as Adjunctive Treatment of Schizophrenia", "hash": "aeb3a2f67db8faa7c7c1145dd6700665bab610a97f4ab21f331b000e39522591"}

She didn't give much explanation just that she didn't love me anymore. We have been together since high school for sixteen years and married for ten. I was/am crushed but there was nothing I could do. we have a loving relationship, great sex life, spend time together etc... We have two kids under 9. She is a stay at home mom, doesn't drive or have any friends. A week before she broke up with me she started acting strange... She became withdrawn and sad the week before she broke up with me. She was talking to herself and laughing at nothing. I agreed to sleep in the basement and delay the divorce until she got a job and on her feet. A couple days passed and that's when the delusions started. She told me one day she could read minds and give people visions. She said our son had this ability too. She also said my aunt tried to poison her and was a witch. Two days of this passed and she was in full blown panic. I took her to the hospital and they released her saying it was a panic attack even though she said she was suicidal and having delusions. We went home and a few days later the delusions were worse. She was taking all the light fixtures off the ceiling saying my brother put cameras in them so he could watch us. She said my brother also is trying to poison me so he could have her all to himself. Every gesture and thing I said \"meant something\" and she became very suspicious of me. Two weeks ago she accused me of molesting my kids and raping her repeatedly over the last sixteen years. She left with the kids to go to her moms house and refused contact with me or the children. She then took an order of protection out against me. While she was at her parents she accused her brother of molesting the kids as well but her family refuses to get her help and think I'm a terrible person. She painted this abusive and controlling picture of me which is completely unfounded. I took her to court to fight the order of protection and filed for a separation to force the custody issue. It didn't go well. I got supervised custody on the weekends and the judge bought her every word. I pulled my petition and am now filing for a divorce. A divorce I don't want but feel I have no choice bc I need to fight for my kids and this defamation. I pulled my petition and filed for divorce to get a new judge who will hopefully see she has mental health issues. I'm beyond heartbroken. Do people snap out of this and realize what they've done? What should I do? I love her with all my heart but she is ruining my life. I'm scared for my kids. I can't just roll over. She screamed I'm a child molesting pig in front of my nine year old and I could lose my job over this order of protection.", "hash": "0d676d696ff2a2bf8e2986e8a3481d83707e7c5255a2bf6ccb3a1ad0ffee0dfb"}

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/delusional-disorder/topic1281.html", "text": "by Alex47 » Fri Oct 24, 2003 5:22 pm BOOK COMMENT REVIEW SYNOPSIS GRB comments on Alistair Munro's Book \"Delusional Disorder...\" I highly recommend the website http://shop.ebrary.com/ , where you can read the above book online for free. The information below is taken from p. 232-234, which deserve to be read in their entirety. For me, this section of the book has given me some modest hope, as it paints a picture of the treatment process and some possible favorable outcomes. There is also some practical advice for the psychiatrist. By necessity, I will paraphrase Munro: Because of the patients reluctance to trust psychiatrists, ideally, assessment and treatment should be by a family physician... but they may not always have the necessary familiarity with this condition and recent advances in its treatment. The psychiatrist must be patient and will often have to spend more than one session gaining the patients confidence before even trying to persuade them to take meds. The patient will usually vehemently argue against taking medications, \"but calm persistence does finally pay off in a reasonable proporatioon of cases\". Medication should be started with a \"very low\" dose which is then raised \"gradually and cautiously\", to prevent sudden onset of side effects, \"an event guaranteed to induce immediate noncompliance.\" Munro recommends that the patient see the psychiatrist at least once a week during this early stage. Munro is a champion of the drug pimozide, used in low doses (\"starting with 1 or 2 mg daily...and in most cases [will need to be gardually raised to] no higher than 4 to 6 mg per day\"). He has used this drug primarily to treat delusional disorder of the somatic subtype, with good results. Minor improvements may be seen within a few days (e.g., reduced agitation, somewhat reduced preoccupation with the delusion), but it takes about two weeks (on the average; sometimes as much as 6 weeks) of treatment (assuming the patient is compliant and responding to the medication), before significant amelioration of the delusion is observed. I will quote the following passage in whole, as it addresses a scenario which has caused me worries (the person stops taking their meds), and actually manages to turn it around into something hopeful: Quote: Quite often the patient feels sufficiently improved early on in treatment that he or she decides to stop the medication. Inevitably the delusion and the accompanying agitation and preoccupation start to reappear and it is then that the treating physician has the best opportunity to obtain ongoing co-operation. Even when the patient is still adamant that his beliefs are real, the experience of improvement followed by incipient relapse seems to make a deep impression and if the patient now trusts the physician he or she will often become extremely compliant. In successful cases the complete turnaround from rejection to trust is both remarkable and heartily gratifying. Munro also observes that in the cases where the patient makes a \"good recovery\", it is often \"relatively rapid and notably complete... even when the delusion has been present for a very long time\". Sounds great, doesn't it? [icon_smile.gif] He also talks about long-term maintenance of treatment (which not surprisingly typically involves continuing meds indefinitely), and mentions that of the (admittedly small) group of patients he has been able to follow up with over the long term, about 1/3 have actually been weaned from meds. These occasionally have relapses, but apparently have sufficient insight at that point that they actually voluntarily resume medication. I also found the following passage very interesting: Quote: There is a dissociation between acquired insight as to the desirability of continuing treatment and in-depth insight into the illness itself. Many patients never accept fully the psychotic nature of their experience, but so long as they agree to take treatment, it seems unimportant, and probably unkind, to face them with the fact that they were delusional before the medication took effect. Munro concludes with a few thoughts on non-drug treatment of delusional disorder, stating essentially that psychological (\"talk\") treatment is essentially not helpful until possibly, in some cases, after the delusions have been resolved using medication. A final warning is given: \"There is a general consensus that psychotherapy of an exploratory, uncovering type is not appropriate in delusional disorder. \" I'll say it again, this section of the book deserves to be read by anybody dealing with a loved one suffering from delusional disorder. It helped me, and I hope it will help you, too. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Roger C comments on \"I am Not Sick, I Do Not Need Help\" by Dr. Xavier Amador Dr. Amador writes from his own personal experience, both as brother of a schizophrenia patient, and as a clinical psychologist. A large problem with treating people with schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders is that many times they won't stay in treatment. The usual explanation for this is that they lack insight into their illness. That is, they are not aware they have a mental illness, or in many cases even that they are exhibiting symptoms. Attempts to reason with such patients about their illness are futile. Dr. Amador postulates that this inability to perceive their illness is caused by the same kind of brain disfunction that is responsible for the illness itself. Experiments have proven this to be true. So, since most of these patients are incapable of understanding that they are ill, how can doctors and family members convince them to stay in treatment programs? Dr. Amador gives a four-step method for providing patients with insight into the benefit of treatment, thus giving them motivation to stay in treatment. For example, one schizophrenic patient wanted very much to be able to hold down a job, but had only a few jobs over the years, most of which lasted only a short time. Rather than simply telling this patient that a job was out of the question, the doctor empathized with the patient's desire, and then helped the patient look back to the times when he was able to get a job, and the events that led up to losing the job, and related these events to the patient's treatment program (or lack thereof). This helped the patient to gain insight into the benefit of treatment. The book finishes with a couple of chapters about knowing when to commit a loved one, and how to go about it. All the advice sounds reasonable, and Dr. Amador's track record of success with it speaks for itself. It should be universally applicable, since the method is based on identifying issues that are important to the patient himself; anything he is dissatisfied with and wants to change will provide a means to motivate the patient to stay in treatment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sean et al comments: I saw Dr. Amador speak at the 2003 NAMI National Convention, if you ever have a chance I suggest seeing him. He spent a great deal of time at the end of the session answering questions from people with a mentalli ill loved one. His sympathy and understanding towards the person with the illness was incredible. As he spoke he explained Schizophrenia and the inability to recognize the illness in simple terms: He asked someone from the audience to give a brief bio about themself. The woman who volunteered (I'll call her Susan) was a Psychologist with a loving husband and two children. She gave a brief description of her job, her family, and her life in general. Then Dr. Amador then went on to talk directly to Susan, saying basically the following: Quote: Susan, I have some bad news for you. You aren't really a Psychologist, in fact, the practice where you think you work called me and asked that I tell you to stop going there every day. There's more though, you aren't really married. Tom also has asked me to help you get help and to stop going to his house. Those children aren't yours, and the house isn't yours. You're sick Susan, and I'm going to take you to the hospital and get you some help. This demonstration, more than anything else, made me aware of how frightening it must be to have Schizophrenia and have your reality stolen from you. No wonder someone with such an illness has conspiratorial thoughts. If someone came and told me my entire life was imagined I'd think they were lying. When they went on to say I needed help and then started trying to make me take medication I wouldn't trust them. I know I haven't done the demonstration justice, but try and imagine yourself hearing those words. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GRB comments on Amador: One approach is to \"empower\" the patient to make their own decision about whether to stay on meds, by promising that no one will object if they go off the meds, under the condition that they keep a journal during the periods that they are not taking medications... Also, a thought on the idea mentioned above, about finding a motivator for the patient to stay in treatment (and which could presumably be used to motivate the person to seek treatment...). Roger had mentioned difficulties in applying this concept in his case. I would agree that this approach would work much better with schizophrenia, for example, than delusional disorder, because in the latter case the person is only affected by the disorder in a limited way, due to the \"encapsulated\" nature of the delusions. The person suffering from DD is likely to be highly functional within society in general and professionally, whereas the disorder primarily affects interpersonal relationships with those close to him or her. So, I think it is a general truth that many people with DD actually do not perceive a worsened quality of life as a result of their (untreated) condition. They might notice a positive change after starting medication, which might be helpful in assuring future compliance, but the problem of how to get the person into treatment in the first place remains vexing.... Dr. Amador introduces his four steps. Listen Effective listening is really a skill that needs to be cultivated. You will need to learn to really listen to what your loved one feels, wants, and believes in. Listening without learning is pointless. First, you need to walk in the other person's shoes to gain a clear idea of their experience of the illness and treatment. For the uninitiated, this is not as easy as it may sound on the face of it. Too many times we make assumptions without checking them out with the person about whom we are making assumptions. Knowledge is power. When you know how someone experiences the idea of having a mental illness and taking psychiatric drugs, you will have obtained the leverage you need to begin to build a treatment agreement. But you will also need to know what their hopes and expectations are for the future, whether or not you believe they're realistic. And finally, you want to identify the cognitive deficits (e.g. problems with memory, attention, focusing thoughts) that are creating barriers between you and the person you're concerned about and between that person and effective treatment. Empathize The second step involves learning when and how to express empathy. If there were a moral to each step and chapter, this one would go something like this: If you want someone to seriously consider your point of view, be certain he feels you have seriously considered his. Quid pro quo. That means that you must empathize with all of the reasons he has for not wanting to accept treatment, even the \"crazy\" ones. But don't worry; empathizing with how a particular delusion makes one feel is not the same as agreeing that the belief is true. This may seem like a minor point, but, as you will learn, the right kind of empathy will make a tremendous difference on how receptive your loved one is to your concerns and opinions. In the chapter devoted to this step, I give you step-by-step instructions on how to do this using techniques such as reflective listening. Agree Find common ground and stake it out. Knowing that what you want for the other person is something she does not want for herself can make it seem as if there is no common ground. She doesn't think she needs medication or therapy, and you think she does. Like any conflict of beliefs between two people, to resolve the disagreement to your satisfaction requires that you discover what motivation the other person has to change. Common ground always exists even between the most extreme opposing positions. The emphasis is on acknowledging that your loved one has personal choice and responsibility for the decisions he makes about his life. During this step, you become a neutral observer, pointing out the various positive and negative consequences of decisions your loved on has made. That means refraining from saying things like, \"See if you had taken your medication, you wouldn't have ended up in the hospital.\" Your focus is on making observations together - identifying facts upon which you can ultimately agree. Rather than making an observation or statement about what happened you ask a lot of questions such as \"So what happened after you decided to stop taking your medication?\" \"Did the voices quiet down after you stopped?\" \"How long after stopping the medication was it before you went to the hospital?\" If you are truly collaborating, asking questions rather than giving advice or direction comes a lot easier than it may sound. Partnership Forming a partnership for recovery is the last and, in my experience, the most satisfying step in this process. The aim of this step is to help you to collaborate on accomplishing the goals you agreed upon. Unlike the previous steps, this one involves both you and your loved one making an explicit decision to work together and to become teammates against a common opponent. You may call the enemy different names, but the names are irrelevant to arriving at a plan of action. The final step culminates in arriving at a treatment agreement. _________________", "hash": "0a21c3f0efb3ebdbc45d2367a18767ee2bf2bab60055b4c68e1c1b28e5b27467"}

I have been recently asked to moderate this forum on Delusional Disorder. I am not a doctor, but I believe I have some first hand experience. What is Delusional Disorder? This illness is a psychosis characterized by non-bizzare delusions which last at least one month. The intensity of such perceptions may wax or wane over time. The person suffering from delusions is often functional in all other aspects of their life. Statistically this illness strikes woman more than men. There are at least six sub-types: Erotomanic: Belief that another person, usually of higher status, is in love with him or her. This other person may be a boss, coworker, celebrity, or stranger. Grandiose: Belief that he or she is much more important, powerful, wealthy, or talented than he or she really is. Jealous: The belief that his or her partner has been grossly unfaithful without regard to substantiating evidence. Persecutory: Believes that he or she is being plotted against, spied on, followed, or harassed by unknown enemies. These delusions sometimes involve conspiracies of people out to \"get\" the sufferer. Somatic: He or she is ill or has other types of health problems. Mixed type: Suffers from more than one of the delusions listed above. Delusional Disorder is sometimes a associated with other personality disorders or a subset of other psychoses; and there is a certain overlap with Paranoid Personality Disorder. It may be helpful to you to check the posts in that forum as well. The above information was culled from various internet sources.

It's overwhelming, I can't think about anything else besides this, I can't sleep or do work properly. I'm currently on antipsychotic drugs, because I had psychotic episodes in the past. I didn't have thoughts like this before. Can I be delusional? Does others feel the same way sometimes? Is it possible that I have delusions and I'm afraid at the same time?

Adorno, Minima Moralia 103 Boy from the heath. – What one most fears for no real reason, apparently obsessed by a fixed idea, has the unnerving habit of occurring. The question which one would at no price like to hear, is asked by an assistant in a perfidiously friendly manner; the person, who one most wishes to keep distant from one’s beloved, will end inviting the latter, even if the former is three thousand miles away, thanks to a well-meaning recommendation, leading to precisely the circle of acquaintances, from which the danger threatens. It is an open question as to what extent one invites such terrors oneself; if one perhaps elicits that question from the malicious one by an all too eager silence; if one provokes the fatal contact, by requesting the mediator, out of a foolishly destructive trust, not to mediate. Psychology knows, that whoever envisions the calamity, also somehow wishes for it. But why does the latter seem to eager to meet them? Something appeals, in the reality, to the paranoid fantasy which distorts such. The latent sadism of all unerringly guesses the latent weakness of all. And the persecution fantasy is infectious: whoever encounters it as a spectator is irresistibly driven to imitate it. This succeeds most easily, when one gives it justifiable grounds, by doing what the other fears. “One fool makes many” – the abyssal loneliness of delusion has a tendency towards collectivization, which cites the picture of delusion into life. This pathic mechanism harmonizes with the socially determining one of today, wherein those who are socialized into desperate isolation hunger for togetherness and band together in cold clumps. Thus folly becomes epidemic: vagrant sects grow with the same rhythm as large organizations. It is that of total destruction. The fulfillment of persecution manias stems from its affinity to bloody being [Wesen: nature, essence, character]. Violence, on which civilization is based, means the persecution of all by all, and those with persecution manias miss the boat solely, by displacing what is wrought by the whole onto their neighbors, in the helpless attempt to make incommensurability commensurable. They burn, because they wish to immediately grasp, with their bare hands, as it were, the objective illusion which they resemble, while the absurdity consists precisely of the perfected mediacy [Mittelbarkeit]. They fall as victims to the perpetuation of the context of delusion. Even the worst and most senseless conception of events, the wildest projections, contain the unconscious effort of consciousness, to recognize the fatal law, by virtue of which society perpetuates its life. The aberration is actually only the short-circuit of adaptation: the open foolishness of the one mistakenly calls, in others, the foolishness of the whole by its correct name, and the paranoid are the mocking image of the right life, by choosing on their own initiative to make it similar to the wrong one. Just as sparks fly in a short-circuit, so too does delusion communicate with delusion truly like lightning. Points of communication are the overpowering confirmations of persecution manias, which mock the one who is ill for being right, and thereby only push them in deeper. The surface of existence immediately closes up again and proves to them, that things are not that bad and that they must be mad. They anticipate subjectively the condition, in which objective madness and the powerlessness of the individual pass, unmediated, into each other, as in Fascism, where the dictatorship of those who are persecution maniacs realizes the fears of persecution of its victims. The question of whether an exaggerated suspicion is paranoid or realistic, the faint private echo of the tumult of history, can thus be solely determined retrospectively. Psychology does not reach into horror.", "hash": "ac2b33dbb233f3acba421de67e5e7e3a6f984ea794f44ebd2382341c794dbbff"}

I have a friend I see infrequently (she lives 30 miles away) but we communicate fairly frequently via text and Facebook. For the past year or so she has been sharing with me her concerns about her being stalked by next-door neighbors (married M/F couple) who have allegedly hacked into her computer, phone, Wi-Fi and Facebook account. Her garage door opener has been messed with, her electricity has gone off at inopportune moments, strange cars have sat parked in her driveway, and her cable TV has done odd things from time to time. They have allegedly managed to get into her house. She changed her locks but reports that the key maker made extra keys and accidentally left them somewhere that her stalker could have easily gotten to when she wasn't around. She sent me a list of phone numbers she wanted me to call to see who answered. They were calls she had gotten and when she answered, no one was there. When she called the numbers back to see who had called she'd get a variety of responses (if any). I researched a few and called a handful. I didn't find out much. One call I made produced a recording that said the number wasn't in service. The red flag came when I told her my result and she later reported that she called the number again to see what would happen. A man answered so she blocked him. I called the same number again and got the recording. I said nothing to her about it but kind of dropped all my research once I realized it was probably a \"wild goose chase.\" I had pretty much believed her stories (though I often wondered about mental health issues) until this experience because I really had no proof of any of it one way or another. She has security cameras on all four corners of her house but has never been able to produce any evidence of any strange activity via cameras because \"they know how to avoid detection.\" (She claims they - or someone - has vandalized her decorations and plants outdoors.) She has spent, I would imagine, hundreds if not thousands of dollars on this equipment. Recently she alleges that they have caused the camera on the side of her house that is directed at their house to malfunction. There are times when I have thought that she actually enjoys this drama because when I have made suggestions that I think are solid ways to stop the stalking, she will have a reason to not carry them out, or says she has but they didn't work. There is so much more that has happened to her according to her report. All strange and mysterious. Yet I haven't been able to SEE any evidence of strange activity. All I have seen are photos of these neighbors on their deck barbecuing, smoking or just sitting, or standing by the glass doors leading to the deck. And she has shown me a couple photos of vehicles sitting in her driveway with license plates that can't be deciphered. But to her they are all suspicious. I would like to know if you think she is dealing with delusions, and if so, what suggestions you have as to what I should do, if anything. I don't know any of her family members or friends. Most of her information on Facebook is private. Feel free to ask questions if you need more info. Thanks for your help!", "hash": "d41445aeb2ed8c8bfb88a0348e91c386a64f07c094940cc38486d0842e09b4d9"}

I don't do games but I do quizzes and do them one or twice a week, maybe. She is an avid participant in a forum/page for people who grew up in our state in the U.S. She posts in there many times a day and I think she may be the administrator of another special (private) forum. Sbe worries when she thinks a post has not appeared there or has been deleted and will have me check to see if I can find it. She does really try to keep her life and activity locked up so the troubles she's having are mysterious and I can see how she could conclude that someone is cyber-harassing her.

I'd like to raise the awareness of all who suffered from the effects of DD to the latest studies regarding autoimmune disease masquerading as a psychiatric disorder. My ex-husband suffered autoimmune disease which caused him to have diabetes and grave disease at a very young age. Prior to his first delusional episode, he had a very serious virus infection which hospitalized him for a short period of time. After suffering from DD for 10 years, he eventually ended his own life. One of the studies estimated that 1/3 of the psychiatric disorder cases might be related to autoimmune disease and could be greatly improved after treating the patient's autoimmune system. I wish these studies were found 10 years earlier, but maybe they could help many of others on this forum.

She thinks she's right and everyone else is delusional. I've now reached the age she started getting delusions and I'm starting to get them too. Different type though. Another difference is they only last a few days or weeks and then I 'wake up' from them, realizing it was just a delusion. Every time I'm in the delusion, I 100% believe it and not thinking I'm entering another delusion again. So it's like a vicious cycle. I enter the delusion, wake up from and realize it's not true, just to enter the delusion again a few days later. Rinse, wash, repeat. So my questions are, do these really count as delusions if I stop believing in them after awhile? And is there a term to describe this condition?

It sounds like he needs professional help in a judgement free environment where he won't be frowned upon for having such a delusion stemming from childhood but with someone who understands psychology enough to work through his issue of erotomania. I think if he can give up on this through the help he needs then he may be able to open his eyes enough to understand not only the flaws of his logic but to be open to a new appropriate healthy and honest love for someone like you who clearly cares as an adult. He's far from actual fulfillment for these things he feels he's lacking like finding an actual soulmate and not living in a childlike delusion that for whatever reason he's clung to into such a later stage of life. He needs help to understand the root cause of why he feels that way and why he's attached so many things to a person of make believe.

While she has always \"felt\" that people were talking about her (and I believed that was true, to a lesser degree than she thought), I attributed it to her low self-esteem. But now, she has developed full-blown paranoia. I have \"entertained\" some of her concerns and searched for cameras/bugs/hacked accounts/devices, etc. She has absolutely no evidence for her allegations, except the way people \"look\" at her and many other irrational assumptions. She's desperate to move, but doing so will be very detrimental to the kids and will be financially next-to-impossible. On top of that, I have little doubt that wherever we land, the same things will happen again. To make matters worse, she's subconsciously torpedoed her work opportunities.

The basic gist is the clouds in the sky are not really clouds, they are fallen angels making shapes, such as symbols found in Egypt, as well as pagan symbols. He believes the clouds are empty, like a portal, and the angels are related to Satan. He says his eyes get blurry suddenly, he snaps a picture of the clouds, then when looking at the picture he sees all the symbols. He states the trails left by airplanes in the sky are the creation of these fallen angels. He said it all makes sense to him now, he is part of the chosen people, and when the angels come to fight us, he is ready.

My DDJ husband has been having an episode since Father's Day weekend, actually maybe longer, its hard to tell anymore as the episodes come closer together and last and last. We have been together 18 years, married 14 years, and I believe this disorder has affected him for at least the last 12-13 years. He was always very jealous and controlling, but I attributed that to issues we had before the marriage. He has been tossing around the idea of divorce off and on for a week or more now, not the first time for that. But it is only the second time that I have been so worn down by this, that I have not been broken down by the threat. I love him, we have 4 children, well two of them are from a previous relationship of mine, they are 19 and 18, and he has raised them since they were 2 and 1. Our two children together are 12 and 4. I have tried and fought all these years to keep our family together. I have taken a lie detector test, offered to take more, dealt with emotional, verbal, and sometimes physical abuse, etc... I have prayed, begged, bargained with God to fix him and us. I feel like he has an illness which is not his fault, and if he had cancer, I would not leave him for that, just because of the stress it put on me. So, I have always felt guilty even considering leaving our marriage when he is obviously sick. He will not go get help. He has promised to in the past and has said he would a few times the past week, but I doubt he will stick with that. He had secret social media accounts where he talked to women behind my back. I am not allowed to even look at another man. These came to light last year after he contacted a close relative's ex girlfriend with the secret account and she immediately told on him. He was convinced that my family had a hand in that because in his mind there was no way she would have done that. I found a message that he sent to a young woman telling her that he \"would give anything for all of her love\". It was soul crushing. I screamed and yelled and told him to leave that I wanted him out but he would not. He blamed me for all of it, saying that I was a cheat and he deserved better. He ended up moving out a couple of weeks later, after discovering I had set up a new bank account and paypal account for myself and had applied for some credit cards in my name, in order to set up some type of financial security for myself (I only had $100 in the bank account and $7 in paypal.) But he accused me of stealing from him and decided that he needed to leave me and start a new life. So he was gone for a couple of weeks but came back home, made me quit my job that I had just started, because he will not let me keep a job, and made promises to seek counseling. He saw a therapist twice, and claimed the therapist told him he couldn't see a marriage counselor and him because insurance wouldn't cover both. But he claimed the therapist had agreed to see us together. I went to his third and last appointment with him. It became pretty obvious that he had been lying to me and the therapist and the therapist immediately came to my defense. That was the end of our counseling. I feel cheated. I have loved him all these years, sacrificed for him by having no friends, no outlets, and controlled and limited time with my family. I have given him 18 years of my life. I have not been allowed to dress nice or keep up my appearance. I have gained weight and not been allowed to diet without accusations and threats. He has worn down my self image and confidence by his many put downs over the years. Everything we own is in his name. He controls everything. He has told me that he will leave me the house so that our kids will have a home, but that's it. he said he will make sure the kids are taken care of. He bought a very lovely piece of land right by a river, that was basically both of our dreams to have one day. He is going to move a trailer to it and live in that paradise while I am stuck in a neighborhood that I hate and have been begging for him to move us out of for years. We have another piece of land out in the country that we could have put a house on for years, but he would never do it. He says that will remain his as well. He has made statements to me before that he didn't want me to have anything nice. I don't even have a car. If I say anything, I am called a greedy, selfish, gold digger, plus many other expletives. I have never had anything nice that I could call my own, because I have not been allowed it by him. Maybe its petty of me to complain about material things, but it is part of life and it is hard to function without a vehicle in a small rural community with no mass transit. I only complain about these things, because I could have had things on my own by now, had I been allowed to work and buy things for myself. I know that he did not allow me to do that as a control thing, but I didn't raise too much hell about it because I didn't expect to be 40 years old and having to start over. I really wish there was some way to get him to seek help. I have personally diagnosed him but he has never been diagnosed by a professional. He told me today that I just wanted to dope him up so that it would be easier for me to cheat on him. I am sad because I truly see no hope at this point. He refuses treatment, so what can I do? I know everyone will say, let him leave, good riddance, etc... But this man has been my world for 18 years and it is hard to just walk away from that. I feel broken.", "hash": "ccfef1446b0dde6796386bb3944f7fd2c7a9792c7f75158ab65a9ff783ecdb2f"}

I think that feeling broken and crushed and terrible is completely normal in a situation like this, and there is not really any way to avoid it. You're gonna have really bad days. But I do think it is super important for you right now to get some space apart from him. I totally understand not wanting to \"punish\" him for his illness....but staying around isn't helping him anyway. And it's really harming you. If anything, maybe there is a way to get a friend of his, or a family member, to check in on him once you've gone. He might respond better to the caring expression of someone he is NOT deluded about. I understand how emotionally wrenching this is for you, not to mention how much it sucks to be unfairly accused of so many things, not to mention the prospect of having to start over from scratch with no closure and no advantage.

They gaslight and bully you and make you think you are the problem. That way they transfer all their shame and guilt onto you and wash themselves \"clean\" of their own sin. It's that sick!

I often feel watched and monitored that connects on a grander scale than it should which leads me to believe It's psychosis given a history of psychosis. I said some things in a group chat amongst friends which I believe to have been forwarded to others which is actually very plausible on at the very least a small scale when someone is mentally unwell. I referred to myself as a baby being put to sleep (not in a homicidal manner like actual sleep) to describe something when I was manic which I still am to a very small degree. I work in a busy outlet mall at a kiosk and I was busy with a line of customers and I guy walked by and said \"hey baby\" like mocking me. I just focused on work and didn't let it phase me because I can't afford to collapse but I could see it when he looked over he said it with that sort of purposeful intent. I've had a lot of anomalies happen a lot of suspicions. I looked up different techniques of investigating and stalking and a lot added up but I just tried to brush it aside and make sense of it by saying well I am in a battle with my insurance company over a major automobile accident. A lot of suspicious things, some supportive evidence that legitimizes my claims but everyone I talk to has said well maybe they weren't looking at you or I didn't see them and likewise. A lot of guys in veterans caps (one pictured looking directly at me with a grin with no child in a kid's Muesam in a very small town. A purposeful photo bomb while I took a picture of my wife. I'll go into a store and the same people will be there shopping with little or no items. Like picking up random toys and putting them back on the shelf at the dollar store while I'm with my wife and son. One guy also in a veterans cap looked suspicious in the motor oil aisle at Walmart so I went down the aisle and pretended to be looking for motor oil and then said \"eh I don't want to get the wrong one\" as if I were talking to myself out loud. Then I went and met my wife and child in the toy aisle where we were letting him pick out a toy and then he walks down there no item or cart in Walmart. I go to the grocery store and the manager is pretending to straighten up a bread display so I move over towards the bread and he moves to the other side where I was originally standing now he's pretending to do another task, this continues and so forth. My wife and I were hovered over by a very large thuggish looking man picking out grapes so I turn around and he shoulder bumps me then maintains a clear visual of us throughout our shopping with 0 items in hand. Manager races by frantically. (Should have called 911 and pulled up surveillance but I didn't) wife of course doesn't notice these anomalies. The other night I pull up to a convience store and and old black sedan with a completely black tint (illegal outside law enforcement) and a barcode on the window pulls up and parks Cady cornered at an odd angle. So before entering the store I pop out and pretend to check the air pressure in my tires while glancing intently in their direction I couldn't see in past the blacked out tint and then they took off like go, go! I don't know man a lot of anomalies but maybe I'm unwell.", "hash": "85c8f904bd1cd004c181cc2887539a1b94da3951120dbcbf715f6b792e213a35"}

My DDJ was/is very strong but every now and then I’d usually have an idea deep inside that it was my imagination and my jealousy that made me so suspicions. I was always looking for evidence of some kind. Unfortunately that changed recently when I found some text messages on my wife’s phone from a former co-worker. I could tell the previous message threads them between had been deleted. Needless to say I concluded she was sleeping with him. I did not confront her though. All of the messages I saw where innocent type conversation, nothing sexual, although he offered her a massage on message and added a LOL to it at the end, she did not reply. A few weeks later I eventually confronted her about the situation to which she said answered a few questions correctly but lied about his name. I told her I knew she was lying, etc and told her I was going to divorce her (did I over react?). After 5 days of no speaking to each other we eventually sat down and talked. She said she knows she was wrong and that she knows she hurt me (she knows I struggle to trust, I’ve been cheated on before by 2 other woman but also had DDJ before that….ironic) but she was scared because she thought I’d have a jealous reaction and that is why she lied about his name and never told me about him. I told her I needed transparency and open communication and for us to get on the same phone plan, etc. She agreed and she told me that since the day we met she have never been with anyone else but me. However after our talk I noticed she google searched how to not have contacts show up on an I-pad and she did delete him from our I-pad contacts and it was not because she didn’t plan to talk to him again. I just recently started using the I-pad a few weeks ago, she’s used it for a year. So to my point, I read a post a few years ago about a guy who suffered from DDJ. He said all the signs of a cheating spouse were there and he was convinced his SO was cheating on him. Then for some reason he realized it was him and he explained it in great detail. I keep looking for the post but can’t find it. Also, I’d really like to hear from anyone who had a situation like mine above where something similar happened and the results turned out innocent. I know I suffer from DDJ but I can’t over look this. Thanks", "hash": "975ac61df944e77ac3c89058883facbd45996fdfffa7e330e6aa866ff200a488"}

I haven't been \"officially diagnosed\" with delusional disorder but I believe strongly that I have it. My official Dx is mood disorder but I don't think that sums up what I went through at all, even if there were some aspects of a bipolar nature there. Summary of my issues: Symptoms: 1) Delusions of reference - everybody was talking at or to me in indirect ways for purposes unkown 2) Delusions of Surveillance - Specific people are watching me from a distance, using satellite technology and infrared imaging devices from afar. Along with complete audio recording of my every move. 3) Erotomanic delusion - 'deeply in love' with a girl I barely knew, and she was secretly in love with me 4)Suspicion of almost every person - that they were involved in a conspiracy to get me to act a certain way 5) Erratic mood swings - deep depression to hypermanic states, laughing for no good reason 6) Extreme loss of self constitution - I felt I was a broken personality and had to rebuild and reshape myself every day. 7) Hyper-sexuality Extreme anxiety due to paranoia 9) Talking to self whenever alone, thinking that I was talking also to the people that were recording me These all lasted in one way or another for approximately 4 years. It was not until my Psychiatrist prescribed the right medication and I found a new therapist that these started to wane and now they are all but eradicated. However, I still find myself looking back and obsessing over things.

My boyfriend is going through exactly what you went through. Its a nightmare . Its been just 4 months . You took 4 years . Some take forever . I have realized by now its a long long way to go . Unless my boyfriend makes up his mind to never talk to me like hes been doing almost everyday for the last 4 months and actually does it . So heres my story , we're 19 and have known each other for more than 6 years now and have been in a relationship for almost 3 years . It started with him accusing me of having an affair with all his friends . He accused me with them one at a time . And then when he couldn't find any proof he jumped to the conclusion that i along with his family and all his close friends are talking behind his back and are planning something for him or against him . Its a nightmare of constant accusations and questioning. There are days where i feel like lying to him and telling yes there is something and make up a fake story and end this! But i know thats not the right thing to do and will just worsen things. The main problem in my situation is ... His friends talking about things to him which sometime coincide with something he has told me in private . For example , he told me about a weird dream he had with me and person . A in it around 2 months ago .. a few days ago his friend told him about him having a weird dream about person A .. person A and my boyfriends friend are friends . The blame is all on me now. I told his friend about the dream and now his friend is trying to tease him . There have been quite a few instances like these which can be mere coincidences which have completely strengthened his belief that weve been conspiring against him . I really love him and i know he loves me equally . All the important people in his life are the villans right now and since im the most important person to him . Im his main target to get to know the \"truth\" . He thinks breaking up with me will be the best way out since hell have the toxic person out of his life and him not being with me will be punishment enough for me. He breaks up and then comes back asking the same question to tell me the truth . And when i tell him what bes thinking is wrong he gets aggressive and leaves again . I dont know what to do ! I dont understand what im being punished for . Its very difficult to see him like that. He says im the only one who can calm him down and make him happy . I go to him everytime he needs me because i love him and that is why i cant leave him in this difficult time of his life . But again he thinks im taking all of the suffering because im guilty . He has been to several psychologists and psychiatrists but there has been no change in his thinking. He thought they were involved in the conspiracy too . He saw one recently on his own so that he could make sure hes legit. He doesnt want to tell me about how it went. But since his thinking hasnt changed im sure it was ineffective . I dont want to involve my parents in this situation and from whatever little they know they want me to stay away from him . It gets really difficult at home too . Im swinging between my mother and boyfriend. I just need an answer to the question ' what do i do now'? He's been on some medication which calms him a little and helps him sleep . But the delusions are still strong as ever . Could you please tell me from the point of view of the person with the delusions what would you have liked to hear and treated when you were ill. What medication helped you ? And do the delusions really go away? For does medication and treatment just stop it from happening further . Please help.", "hash": "7de2329210ee24eaad8cc0bce4738205c2d2820d443abb72e40996f0003392d0"}

I am a fan of encryption tools that are apparently monitored by various government agencies. I am very very very very worried I am going to be labeled as a terrorist and killed due to this. I have never ever done anything remotely illegal and I love this country very much and am a proud American, and I use these tools for safety and security and privacy while online. When I say \"encryption tools\", I am talking about more \"extreme\" measures such as using tor and tails and truecrypt and pgp, all of which there are rumors going around that the government thinks anyone who uses these is a terrorist. I am not, and as I said, I am a very very proud American and I despise terrorism! Now onto how this affects me. A few weeks ago, I almost *mod edit* due to psychotic episodes I have been having. One was so real, I heard someone talking (while awake) about me and how I should be hunted down and killed for using these tools. It has only gotten worse, to the point that I am convinced random people in the store are FBI agents coming after me and I see people where there are none. And the worst part is, they seem so real. I cannot function properly in my daily life because I experience these psychotic episodes and spend nearly every waking moment freaking out about being interrogated at airports and being stalked. I am in circumstances where it would not be favorable for me to go to a psychiatrist and talk about this, because I would be viewed as insane and off my rocker. As a note, I am not interested in stopping the use of the tools, as they make me feel like i have privacy online. I want to live in peace and in harmony with nature, my community, my country, and my government. As of right now, I am not using any drugs that would cause this kind of paranoia. Please, I need help.

Destiny is one of my friends on a website called *mod edit*. She attempted to kill herself while I was on break from school and she's back now, but I started hearing her as one of the voices in my head. This isn't the first voice I've ever heard, I've heard several with the main two being Reaper (my very first voice) and Annie. She says things like \"please let me kill myself\" and tries to comfort me when I'm hurting. Honestly, I'm scared. I'm currently on a medication for hearing voices, but I'm not sure what my disorder is (currently considering shared psychosis) and it's not helping at all. Does anyone know what I should do or anything that could help me? Last edited by lilyfairy on Sun Jan 07, 2018 11:14 am, edited 1 time in total.

I also go through periods of where I hear voices, but they sound like whisper and most of the time it's kind of hard to tell what they're saying. The reason I know they are just voices in my head is because they say really strange things like, \"We're gonna kill them\", and they keep saying things like \"He's nervous\", all the time. It made me even believe I was under some sort of investigation and someone was watching me. I have done a lot of Crystal Meth in my past, and I have a friend who also experiences meth psychosis, which can last for some time. So after much hardship, and feeling nervous and paranoid, I finally came to the conclusion that I'm suffering from meth psychosis. It's such a difficult thing to deal with, because you start believing some of what you hear. I just know that it's in my head because I'm not a criminal nor have I ever done anything where I would need to be under an investigation. Suffering from psychosis is a very scary thing and very complex, like sometimes I don't hear them everywhere, but after hearing it so much at my house, I started hearing it elsewhere. But I recently changed my meds around (Risperdal > Trilafon, Klonopin, Lexapro & Hydroxyzine), and that is helping me deal with all the symptoms of anxiety, depression, meth psychosis and stuff... Just hang in there, and try different meds and see what works for you, 1 med doesn't work all across teh board, remember that. Find what works for you.", "hash": "73406ee833c3f7c07a970917bfd3b90f92bd2333a478bd7bcce01aadd7540ee3"}

I am just looking for any possible insight to what I am dealing with, and though this forum doesn't seem very active I think worst case I get to unload a little bit. It's not something I am really able to talk to anyone in my life about. So I have been in a long distance relationship with a girl I met online for about a year now, and she has told me that this Christmas will be our last time seeing eachother. The main delusion she seems to have is that I am stalking one of her former friends on instagram. This one was probably the first red flag that came up, and has continued to be the most persistent and damaging idea that she holds regarding me. There is some girl who was at one point her friend on instagram, who for some reason I don't understand my girlfriend despises now. My gf believes that I am obsessed with this girl and thinks that I am spending all day looking at this girl's pictures. The truth is I never have looked once, not out of respect for my gf even, I honestly don't care about social media at all. It isn't really my thing. I'm not going to become infatuated with anyone on social media as far as I'm concerned, for it even to be possible I would have to know them. So I will spend hours arguing in my own defense over this, asking why she thinks this, and she will say that the things that me and this random girl tend to talk about and specific words we use are too similar to be coincidence. Like I have had her turn on me for using the word \"good\". My gf says she knows when someone is lying to her, and that she \"knows what I'm up to\". Sometimes she will just say that, that she knows what I'm doing, and refuse to elaborate. There are other times where she will be insecure and weirdly jealous, like when we are out she will get upset any time I appear to look at a woman, assume the worst, and think I only look at other women because I am not into her. To me that seems like normal jealousy though, because there is at least a grain of truth there in that I do look at other women. The main thing that seems to prevent her from trusting me though, and the thing that she has broken up with me several times over, is this delusion where I am stalking this random girl on instagram. Like at best I will be able to get her to table it, and admit that she feasibly could be wrong only because there is no evidence, but that never lasts and that partial admission never makes me feel any better. Before long she is 100% certain of it again and expects a confession, insists that I am a liar, and says that if I would confess we could work it out. I was planning to move to another country to be with this girl, and honestly nobody has ever made me feel happy and satisfied in my life like she does. After reading some accounts here I am really starting to believe that things are extremely unlikely to work, and it would be better if I cut ties. I think that some of this is relatively moderate, and we often just write it off to stress from being apart so often, but more and more I think that things will only get worse for us. I just wish I could help and am extremely frustrated, but it doesn't seem like there is anything I can do, and I can never realistically expect her to have trust in me. I feel like I am abandoning her, even though she is the one who keeps breaking up with me, but I don't know what else to do.", "hash": "ce2d3f9740b9ede728fa68170805fe83624885a11e958ebb3e6c2adcfc327f86"}

IN SHORT: I FEEL LIKE WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE IN AUGUST AND FEEL LIKE JUST A MINOR PART OF MYSELF STILL LIVES. LONG VERSION: r/SuicideWatch Finally lost my ability to think rationally u/Nadosa Hi, so basically what I was going through this year was just insane. First half Derealization/Depersonalization, second half Depression/OCD but feels like psychotic, because everything seems so surreal. I was diagnosed with OCD and adjustment disorder btw. OCD and not psychosis because I know those feelings and thoughts are somewhat strange. So basically I recovered from Depersonalization this year...but as the symptoms slowly vanished, I still battled irrational thoughts from day to day when suddenly my mind switched to: ur life is over. I was overwhelmed, suddenly paranoid of time/the date, feeling like I shouldnt be here anymore as the time went on and feeling like trapped in this concept of time. This feeling...it feels like I shouldnt be alive anymore since August, like I shouldnt have lived past August and should be dead until August. It just feels like it is wrong to be alive, when I go to the hairdresser for example, my mind goes like this: You are dead inside, you died, you dont need to do this, you are trapped in hell, you shouldve killed yourself as I told you! When I look in the mirror: \"Why are u still alive?\" It just cant make sense why I am still alive, and I am super overwhelmed, feeling insane, because I know something IS TERRIBLY WRONG IN MY ORGANISM. You may ask yourself why \"August\"? I dont know, I somehow wanted to be recovered and fine from mental health issues until August, I didnt know what would happen if I didnt recover until then, but my mind has adapted to my expectations and as the time went on without me recovering, my mind realized that and switched to this surreal psychotic limbo mode, so basically I guess false expectations triggered this mess in my mind. I remembered when these thoughts sneaked in in the last week of July, I felt like after this week I would pass like a strange \"threshold\", like my old self had to die (idk it felt so strange, I just got very depressed, nervous and obsessed with the future and thought if I couldnt cope I may commit suicide, but I wasnt suicidal) It felt like life after July was just black, I didnt want the future to come and felt like I was involuntarily pushed to experience this future pain, but then there was the 1st of August where I had these painful thoughts that I cant live anymore and got anxious. And this whole \"anticipation\" made me BELIEVE that this is destiny and I cant recover from it! Furthermore I told my psychiatrist that I feared that I'll lose myself in time, which I know sounds strange but I definitely felt like there would be no future for me and honestly I keep questioning how I survived the last months, making me feel like I shouldnt be alive because the feelings were so surreal. I cant stop thinking that this $#%^ is something supernatural and keep questioning if people had already commited suicide if they would have been in my shoes, what freaks me even more out. But I have no clue how to get out of that hole at all. I am depressed and scared to death. I dont know, this is just a nightmare and I am 19. Everytime I think about me as a person, I get a feeling of doom: who is \"I', why am I still alive? Etc. It is terrifying. Unknown mental illness?!", "hash": "1c770f0bc5080cc90d5b0188f4d02d983fde0b01a512b75ea4be8e8d57481df3"}

The word \"Delusional\" seems appropriate. I'd like to start by saying 'thank you,' for taking the time to read this. It is something that I find particularly bothersome and, as best I can tell, has be present for most of my life. The \"mixing\" came as a sudden realization, a few days ago, after getting off work. I have been following an exercise, in which, I contemplate my life as if writing an autobiography in my head. Though, I cannot say exactly what I am looking for, it does often bring to light both positive and negative aspects of my life that I may have forgotten. One such aspect stuck out to me this time. The emotions that I associate with love are identical to those I associate with death. It's a strong feeling, hard to exactly put into words honestly. In dreams, fantasies, and past romantic experiences I have felt a warm peace. A strong vulnerability tied with acceptance and bliss. For me, this is happiness, near euphoria. But, while I've known this feeling for quite some time it has only recently occurred to me that fantasies and dreams of myself dying bring about the exact same response. The feelings couldn't possible be more similar. I feel it necessary to say that I do not believe that I am depressed, in any way. Though I have ups and downs in life, like most do, I am a relatively content person. I have decent goals and ensure that I further myself towards them. The concept fascinates me, and I would very much like to learn more about the phenomenon. The \"mixing\" occurs with several other emotions, that I feel that I should feel in certain circumstances, but non as prevalent as this. I have read about emotional confusion, though it seems hard to find any legitimate literature on this in particular. If anyone has any light to shed on this situation, or has any information that might help me further understand it please share. I am more than happy to answer any questions that may help as well.", "hash": "22f9e7adad751b61c06aa4d43499703d083b35d3fc828f35add4ceb32f24e295"}

When I was in elementary school I would often imagine people I liked, maybe boys I had crushes on etc. Whenever I was alone home or just wherever I would imagine them being with me and had conversations with them. As I grew older the people I would imagine often changed, and so did the circumstances. I would talk out loud, maybe a loud whisper when I talked to Them. When I was in middle school I started imagining idols and people I looked up to or just thought that had really fun personalities. The people I talked with didn't even know I existed but in the situations I created we were often best friends or living together etc. I'm now 17 and I still do this, but lately I have been more and more aware of it. Another thing that worries me is that my thoughts tend to get mixed with reality and well - Them. They are with me constantly, even when I talk out loud to communicate with them or not. Even when I'm watching netflix or youtube or whatever and not really focusing on anything else - for me they're still there, reading a book or maybe watching with me. If I'm having a conversation with someone (that actually exist) I sometimes blurt out something weird that has nothing to do with the context of the conversation we're having at all. For example - some time ago I was on a cabin trip with my (now ex) boyfriend, and we were under the covers of a bed talking about how hot the room was. And as he commented the heat I simply answered \"But shouldn't it be cold in LA by now?\". I live in Norway and have never had anything to do with LA whatsoever. I said this without even thinking cause in my mind I was currently on a trip to LA with the people I usually tend to imagine - this was how I imagined the whole cabin trip. Normally people just brush it off and laugh or give me weird grimaces whenever this happens, cause I'm known to be quite the clumsy, outgoing person. When this first happened I didn't give it much thought, but now it kind of worries me. The situations I imagine now are often played out in the future, or at least a different now. I'm good friends with this group of idols I keep imagining since April now, and since I'm known to a certain degree, I'm often at interviews making people laugh etc. It sounds really weird and I tend not to think too much about the situations when I'm aware. Personally I don't think it's unhealthy or whatever, I love communicating with them and being with them makes me happy. If anything, I'm quite happy about it, considering I'm always looking forward to being with them and so on. I'm not antisocial or anything, and have too many friends for my own good, so it's not influencing my social life. If I'm invited to a party or a cabin trip or whatever, I always imagine it being them who invited me and that's what I'll be looking forward to too. I don't really consult anyone at all about my personal issues or well, anything. In all my (soon) 17 years of life I have only opened up this last month. I talked to two of my friends about two different issues. One being my childhood and the other one this issue about the people in my head. The friend I consulted about the people and the situations I imagine said I should go see someone just in case this was something unhealthy which should be dealt with. She knows about my childhood, and said that it might have something to do with that. I am unsure if this has anything to do with my \"issue\" or not, but I'll explain it just in case. When I was younger I used to get beaten and scolded a lot by my parents. As i grew older the abuse would decrease. Recently my parents divorced and now I only live with my mother. We have a really good relationship and I'm happy. I'm often left alone a lot at home, though. My mom is often at work or with her boyfriend, and my older sister usually stays at her boyfriend's apartment. When it comes to my mental health I'm usually happy but have periods where I'm seriously depressed. I've been diagnosed with winter depression so it's often that time of the year its worst. So I guess that was the most of it. I could consult a psychiatrist in my city but I'm just so unsure if I need to or not. So if you have any knowledge or experience about this or something similar, maybe even just some advice - please help me!", "hash": "9cc7e155de64fc20f7daf26b403b8549db9274466a2396385e19d0222f5ec1ac"}

You kind of have to laugh and ask yourself \"how does any of this add up to a plausible scenario lol\". As far as the persecutory delusions that are more plausible, people may genuinely unlike me for reasons I can't even blame them for but let's not strike up a conversation of how a conversation could go down. Now as far as the wanting them to be the one to invite you to a cabin trip I think you mentioned. I think their's something to be read into about that as well that I can't really pinpoint.

Dunno about you, but if you are anywhere on the autism spectrum this is even more normal; not saying you are, but I am (mild/high-functioning case), and I've always done this. Two terms that come to mind are: the \"fantasy\" defense mechanism, and maladaptive daydreaming, but basically, all you're doing is using your imagination as a substitute for human interactions . Do you have many friends in real life? If you don't it would explain this even more, I mean if you're alone most of the time and rarely talk to people it's pretty much a given that you'll eventually have to figure out a way to starve off loneliness and boredom. Honestly nobody talks about this but I'm sure most people do this to a degree, show me a person who hasn't ever dreamt about an ideal relationship or friendship and I'll show you a dozen more who have. You likely just do it more than others, you know, living in your head and all that. It's not delusional disorder, it's just living in a fantasy world, nothing wrong with that unless it impacts your life severely. If you mean you sort of recall a memory, and then sort of talk to it though your internal monologue, then yep I do the same.

I have a history of abuse and neglect in childhood, and abuse in adulthood as well. Like Ubinix800 said, for me personally, loneliness and detachment are major influences for how often and how intensely I engage in this. I've heard it's a form of dissociation. When I was younger, in my teenage years, I had such a rich imaginary life, that I would list important dates of my imagined friends I had relationships with and I would also draw the house I imagined I lived in, places I went, etc. On a couple of occasions, I contacted the actual real people (like celebrities) I had imaginary friendships with, imagining that we had such a bond that they would contact me back and this would begin the real friendship and save me from my current situation. Recently, I had to make a point of being more mindful throughout the day, because I had been escaping my entire life through this daydreaming. I was irritated when anyone interrupted my time with my imagined world and could not accomplish anything. I think if it gets to that point, it can be unhealthy. But, if you're functioning well, still care for your other relationships, self care, and any responsibilities that you may have, then I think it's completely ok. Maybe explore if you believe it is an escape for you. If it is, then what are you escaping from? “The best way to escape reality without running, is smiling even though, it is obviously fake.” Devil’s Little Sister", "hash": "e228a46874a3d7131a48e92e20b3182a12efa94259a47dc32cd1ad8089a7fc9c"}

That said I have become convinced that I am affecting the world's population with my actions, and I feel a very strong need to say something about it...I feel like saying this to everyone. If you care, if you want to help in any way, then please read all of it... Everyone in this world, on this planet earth, especially in America, please listen to my words... I have, truthfully, become very, very, VERY stressed over all of this in the past few months. And I can tell other people felt that way, too... It isn't what I want. I'm gonna say exactly what I WANT, not what im feeling, not the anger or sadness that that I feel, not something crazy. I want people to disregard my past words and actions. I don't like vulgar, greedy, or arrogant people, as a matter of fact, those traits are without a doubt, 3 of the most disgusting traits on the Earth. The opposite are some of the best... empathetic, not greedy, clean in their actions and their hearts, open to others' perspectives. People with those traits are already pretty good, worth while, model people. In addition, people who do hard work, solve problems instead of creating problems, and don't cause trouble for other people, are very deserving of respect; I will always value those traits in others, appreciate them, and feel respect for the people with those characteristics. People who make trouble for no reason are always sad, weak people, who can't achieve much in life. This world NEEDS more of the good traits. On that same point, if anybody feels hatred, sadness, even happiness or anything else towards me because of my actions \"influencing your lives\" emotionally or psychologically, then STOP. just STOP, really. Just stop-- don't feel this way. You shouldn't be concerned with me, or any of this, really; Focus on useful information in life, critical thinking, working hard towards achieving your goals, and being happy. Everybody has a right to happiness--especially the good people in the world. And the evil people--- the ones who are detrimental to society, who care only about themselves, who don't care about the suffering of others, who hold bad traits such as vulgarity, arrogance, greed, who hold hatred, anger, or violence--- people like that will be incredibly unhappy. People even SIMILAR to that will find only depression, and ultimate failure. The one's who act deceptive, use others, try to make the world worse, those people are the most worthless, and they will definitely falter, fall, fail, until they change. People who worsen other's lives, will suffer from sadness. And the ones who know they are bad people, but choose not to change, or are proud---they will never find happiness or satisfaction, or true success. They will suffer and fall even harder. The good people-- who desire to solve our problems, help others, love peace, the people that, really want to do what's right, they will be the most motivated, the most passionate, the most successful, and the happiest. And that's because they deserve success. That's what I want, that's what I believe! Racism is evil, and I believe black people and those who receive prejudice should portray themselves in a better way and convey themselves in a positive way. That's very important in my belief, and there are singers these days that flaunt their vulgarity, their wannabe \"toughness\", their gross lifestyles and basically spread their unlikable personalities. People who represent themselves in a bad way have affected views towards their entire ethnic group, and those people need to stop. Show you're good qualities, your human qualities, your kind qualities. And people will respect those things. The weird things that people show interest in today are truly sad... People talking about porn and drugs as if they are normal things just disturbs me...I find it disgusting. How can some people be so gross? Pot, is not too terrible; It helps some people, and relaxes. But drug use overall is bad and so is marijuana. The media today would be much, much more entertaining if they didn't display those things and almost flaunt them as often as they do. I think it's sad, and those kinds of things are detrimental to society. People please respect the taboo things in our society, some things are not meant to change. I want the good people in the world to succeed -- I always have. DON'T misconstrue my feelings. For the past month I've tried \"following my heart\" but it's turned out to be somewhat similar to just doing what I feel. I feel anger and frustation at times, but I don't wish for others to actually hurt. Please, don't misunderstand my feelings, instead, LISTEN TO MY WORDS!!! I have said many things this past year, but 99% have just been emotions that I feel, meaning little and not conveying my thoughts at all. Emotions are fleeting but beliefs are more permanent. I believe those who want goodness to win, people who don't hold anger or violence in their hearts, who respect hard work and always consider the lives and emotions of other people, who try to do what's best in any situation, the people who hold any one or more of these traits; I want to see more people like that in the media, I want to see those kinds of values succeeding in the world. I want the people who have standards like those to value them, and find motivation, find happiness, find strength, and success, so they can rise higher in the world. THAT'S something I want---for the people who WANT to the do the right thing, to SUCCEED! To get what they need. To solve their problems, and win at life. I desire that more than almost everything else in life--- for those people to succeed greatly in the world. And it makes me depressed to see the opposite---to see good-for-nothing, problem causing, conflict creating trashy people winning; it's one of the worst things to see, truthfully. Motivation and happiness--- if the good individuals in the world have more it makes me feel a lot better. I love to see those people succeed. Thanks for listening. I see people today, and in the past I've thought that the people today don't feel as much, or are more cold hearted than before, or don't feel as much happiness or depth in their feelings. But I know now that that isn't true. I know there is just as much depth to the hearts of good people as there is in mine. There is great happiness in their hearts, with real meaning and persistence. There's a ton of fight left in good people's hearts, I know. And I know that people feel the same emotions that they always have, and just as strongly---happiness, peace, relaxation, satisfaction, and all the rest. That's the way it should always be; I would not have it any other way. The depth in their hearts is immense. And with that, I'm done. I felt the need to say these things to, well, everyone--- and there's more I want to say but it's too much for just this forum. Some things I say, they appear to go against the things that I stood for in the past. People misconstrued my messages in the past, while I did not speak in a clear way. These words are crystal clear; they are my true beliefs, the standards that I hold, the same beliefs I held a year ago, years ago, possibly my entire life. I have always felt the same but haven't been able to communicate it as well in the past... Now, please, listen to the words I said here. It's the truth.", "hash": "64ad2f83c7e15eaed17aeffa0f302c8bfe0f0da39032952693dda008c4afe187"}

How refreshing to hear such positive and uplifting words, words that I truly needed to hear, especially now.

I've been trying to break free from this individual for several years now, with no success. But when I read your words when you say \"I want the people who have standards like those to value them, and find motivation, find happiness, find strength, and success, so they can rise higher in the world\" it gives me strength and hope to go on, and to persevere against the evil that has been slowly killing me day by day. Your words are healing and empowering, and I appreciate you for sharing your positive message here. I could not agree with you more about the state of the world. You are so right about what will happen to those who cause pain and suffering, they will never be happy and are only hurting themselves as well. I thought if I were loving, caring, empathetic, and accepting of this person that they would learn to appreciate those things and would start to change...but it was only wishful thinking on my part. They cannot feel what I feel. They cannot see what I see. They accuse me of having an 'agenda' and twist my words around to mean something bad when I am truly wanting only the best for them and everyone. I found out it is called \"projecting\" in that he is projecting his negative traits onto me. In reality, he schemes against everyone and always has a hidden agenda to take what he wants from them when he wants it with no regard for anyone else. It's really sad. I feel bad for him. All the same, I cannot allow him to use me anymore. I can't heal him, so I must leave him before he succeeds in killing my soul. You are very insightful and are a good person! Don't worry that they say you have some kind of psychosis, you are not bad, and you have helped me tonight and many others who read your thoughtful words!

Let's say this false dimension to our being that we devote our unbalanced energy towards into trying to untangle like a net in front of us and something that sways around us, let's say this fantasy world exists simply because it feels alarmingly real to us. Then we have to think about what exists in our physical reality. Our family, friends, our job, who we mingle with, OUR dreams, WHO we are. These are in essense the reality of our lives. if their existed a realm in which we occupied that sort of position of influence but we lead normal lives then the question over these things being true or false are immediately irrelevant because this realm doesn't exist in OUR realm. We're not always around when we are discussed so we don't know what's said or was withheld at any level of communication but in our daily reality we exist with a purpose that doesn't call for rockstar. We can still understand ourselves as not being rock stars because we admit to having a PROBLEM, so we might as well ask ourselves the question of whether or not we even Want to be a rockstar. My issue with this whole thing derives from a psychotic episode with many unanswered questions to which I began believing to have some sort of recognition. It's a paranoia of being leeched or monitored or something of that nature. It's psychotic and sick but it's not real. I didn't write commercials or come up with blue wildnerness's slogan, I just happened to say the exact same stupid thing about my cat having the soul of a panther. But the realm in which it exists is wherever the advertisement was created thousands of miles away.

What you're experiencing isn't real. The \"psychic power\" you have is just plain old luck, a chance of winning, a chance of losing. They do not have a psychic team that is working against you and everyone else. It's all odds and probability. What you're experiencing is called a delusion. I go through them, too. I sometimes believe my boyfriend is going to murder me in my sleep, or that they have invisible camera planted across my area at work, and are spying on me 24/7. As for the aircraft, that probably has nothing to do with you. I used to follow a car that would drive down the road I live on and park at the end of the street. I live on a dead end road, and thought they had no real reason to be parking down there, other than to spy on me. I actually confronted the man that drove the vehicle, and he told me he was just visiting his mother. Do you see a psychiatrist at all? I'd recommend one, in all honesty, or even maybe a therapist. They can help with the gambling issues and talk to you about these psychic powers that you think you have. Have a nice day.

Around 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with depression and was put on an anti-depressant and saw a therapist regularly. After a year I was able to taper off my anti-depressant with the help of the dr until i wasn't on it anymore. When I first went on it, I felt like for the first time in my life I had clarity. My daily life wasn't as painful as it normally was. The thing is though, before seeing the dr for the first time my mother was the one who insisted that I see him because I was saying things that didn't make sense. At the time I believed that: -Because I cried in front of my kids, my husband will divorce me and take our kids away -That my husband wanted to divorce me so he could marry someone -I believed that I should leave him first so that he wouldn't take the kids I believed those things 100% and didn't want him to know if I had cried earlier in the day. Recently, I brought this topic up to him and he was shocked as he had never thought any of that. More recently, I had a small problem with a close family member. It was nothing. A silly squabble. But I had extreme and inappropriate anger about it. I apologized and the other person still responded with anger. Instead of just letting it go, I would get angry about it every once in a while. Among the things I said/thought about the situation: -My family sees me as a bully that must be stopped -My family doesn't defend me because I would never be right -My family constantly defends the other person because they feel that I am a bully to that person -My family constantly makes excuses for the other person's behavior because they care about the other person more than me -My family never makes excuses for me- they always make me out to be evil I even called my mother crying to \"confront\" her about theses things. She hadn't even heard about the fight and started telling me that I'm imagining this perception of things and that no one sees me as a bully. I could hear her not even knowing what to say and feeling as at loss as she was when I used to tell her my husband was leaving me/hates me. A therapist I was seeing for the past few months wondered if my belief that my husband was going to leave me was psychosis of some form. It was really hard to say. At the time I was hardly ever sleeping and would take a long time to leave the bed so it was possible that if I did suffer psychosis it was a side-effect of the depression. After that \"confrontation\" with my mother, things appeared to calm down and I was able to be somewhat normal and saw the other person that I had the fight with and talked normally. Then a week or so passed and we all gathered at a mutual acquaintance's house. That person and another person brought up a topic similar to the one we fought about. I immediately felt defensive and even started getting visibly upset. Later that night, when I was at home, I started breaking down again. Those thoughts started coming and I started feeling out of control. I kept crying and shaking and feeling like a worthless waste of a human. The next day, I felt blank. Almost normal. As if I had a cup that at times gets full of all these negative emotions that overflow until it empties out and then there is nothing. I feel normal, but I have not felt \"joy\" in a long time. Another thing to add is that this person I fought with, I am constantly paranoid of them. Whenever they bring up a situation I feel like they are talking about me. I often feel like they purposely exclude me of things along with a few other people. I get very suspicious that they lock down on me and make comments that outline my weaknesses. Even though \"logically\", that would be very weird and when right now I try to think back to what they actually said to make me feel that way, I just can't remember. So here's what I'm wondering. This internal monologue that occurs when I am in my \"bad days\", could it possibly be a delusion or hallucination of some form? I just can't tell anymore. And I don't feel like I can silently wait for another \"break-down\" but I feel like I know that it's coming. I know no one here is able to really tell me what's happening, but could someone maybe relate? Does any of this sound familiar to anyone?", "hash": "50889bfeb66f9ca0db6d6b8e01f3f04338c3618f52783a164349568b21c0473c"}

Often I was told I was acting out against him because he was a new Step Dad and that was normal. I sort of accepted that, and moved away very young. years years I had a psychotic break in January 2017, got treatment-help-therapy, felt pretty good. Was diagnosed as Paranoid, and self diagnosed as delusional. Moved in with Moms and SD, now I have this feeling again, that he is trying to hurt me, trying to make me question my morals and what I do. I'm 40 and physically uhhhh not intimidated nor mentally either. There are some scenarios that are definitely not Delusion, but again not enough to seem malicious to anyone EXCEPT TO ME, OF COURSE!!

Any professionals on here? by Overwhelme123 » Mon Aug 07, 2017 12:21 pm I am not trying to diagnose my husband, but reading this forum has been the closest I can see to what I believe he's experiencing. This is an email I have just sent to a private psychiatrist as I appear to be running out of options. I wondered if anyone on here had any luck getting professional help or had any advice for me? Dear Sir/Madam I need some urgent advice and I do not know where to turn. My husband is becoming increasingly paranoid and I believe he is experiencing delusions of persecution. Six months ago it started with him believing cars were following him and watching our house, since then it has spiralled and has included but is not limited to him believing the following: 1. 'They' have been planning this revenge on him for at least 20 years 2. He is the victim of community mobbing, gang stalking and work place gas lighting 3. Everyone is 'in on it' and let him know this by coercive conversations 4. I have been recruited 5. He has been poisoned with arsenic 6. It is linked to the Freemasons 7. I am emotionally abusive... or he is possibly 8. 'They' have plotted to let us build up our lives and then every 4 years they destroy it 9. 'They' are responsible for my brothers and mums deaths 10. We have been bugged and they are most likely monitoring our internet usage and emails 11. He has been to the police 12. The doctors can't be trusted 13. They are either going to come and hurt him or they are going to make him look like he's gone mad or they are going to set him up for something bad There are many more, this has resulted in obvious problems within our relationship and he has threatened to leave several times now. It has also resulted in him not working properly (he is self employed) and we are now really behind with all bills and have serious financial issues. He is also now suffering with physical symptoms due to anxiety and stress. He will not listen to reason. It is not him, he is not ill, it is everyone else and he simply does not trust anyone. I have been to my doctor, I have called the doctor, I have called my local crisis team, I have called and emailed MIND. I emailed a local private psychiatrist. I have spoken with his family. I have looked online for advice. The only information I have is that I should neither agree or disagree with his delusions. I shouldn't argue and I should get him to a GP. How do you get him to a GP? He did go last week, because he had headaches, high blood pressure and liver pain. Despite me telling the doctor in advance and him telling me to get him to go there urgently, the doctor just dismissed it when he said he thought he'd come in to contact with arsenic!!!!! So what do I do now? I am very scared and could really do with some advice from a psychiatrist who has had experience with this. If I can't get him to get help how can I talk to him? How do I get financial help for my family if he won't get signed off? If I talk to other people I feel like I'm betraying him. If I just sit and wait I panic that it's going to get worse. What's the prognosis with this kind of thing? I just feel so stuck and overwhelmed and really would like someone to tell me something other than I need to get him to GP.... which is obviously not working for me. Are you able to assist or point me in the direction of someone who can? PS. There is no history of mental illness in him or his family. We have been together since he was 16 (25 years) and there has never been any indication of this happening before. He is now 42.

Any professionals on here? by Alucard » Mon Aug 07, 2017 4:58 pm These kind of conversations can be hard because trying to figure out what to say is hard, knowing he's only going to dismiss any 'logic' and twist it around. As someone who has been delusional, and someone who lives with her father who believes the neighbors are listening to us through the vents, are moving things around in our house, are stomping upstairs just to mess with us, I know this isn't always rooted in just \"oh, he's sick\". For me, isolation is a huge one. I'll start of semi-isolated, get deeper in my thoughts, and isolate completely, at which point I'm stuck until some miracle happens or something yanks me from it all. Trust is also huge. Not being comfortable in myself, around others, having constant feelings of being threatened as a result of trauma, it fostered ill trust in people. That ill trust, over years and years, developed into ideas people were controlling me, telepathically, just so they could ruin my school career and my work as a counselor. I thought jobs/bosses were framing me, were creating clones in the basement of the amusement park I worked for, and setting me up to get arrested and fired. I quit a lot of jobs because of that. So there is a lot involved here. Trust, you mentioned, and that could be a huge one. In fact, it could be a root in all this. When I speak with people with these kinds of beliefs at work . . . well, I'll just give an example. If someone walks up to me and says \"you know what, my roommate keeps stealing my thoughts and he keeps poisoning my food\" I say \"you really don't feel safe right now, you feel targeted\" they would continue on, and I would continue to reflect back the FEELINGS I'm hearing, not exactly the thoughts. So the fear, the lack of trust, the anxiety, the pain. That's the only way you can get to a place where you can say, well, what would be helpful for you, or maybe we can do this, e.t.c. In your case, going to your husband and saying you're not thinking straight, you need to see a doctor or trying to deny his thoughts as real and logical . . . well . . . it's more of an attack and that can only worsen the trust. Obviously that's not how YOU mean it, but because he is where he is, he will only see it as a force against him. You could work the conversation to a point where you can ask him what he thinks you two can do to help this situation, and ask him if he would feel comfortable talking to someone about trust issues or his fear or his anxiety. Sometimes a change in environment and a change of the people around us can make a huge difference, with or without doctor involvement. I know it's a lot and it takes time and patience. I'm not saying be his new counselor, I'm just saying try and see past the \"unreal\" side of what he says, and see the real feelings behind it. Whether or not the feelings come from something that exists or doesn't, they're still there and they're very real, so they need to be attended to and treated just like anyone else's feelings. I hope things go well for you two, it's a long road.

But here's the story. My best friend is someone I met online. We've been friends for 7 years. But sometimes, when I get in a fight with my mom, and the fight gets really bad...Well, if I text/message my friend and she doesn't reply soon or quickly enough, I start thinking she hates me. I never told her about my worries...until last week. My mom had been really difficult. I got in the car and started driving just to get away. So then I started texting my best friend and it was fine at first. But then I'd look at my phone and see a hurtful text from my mom. I would ignore the text and then another buzz would come. It'd be my mom again. Every time I saw a text from my mom, I started believing my best friend didn't want to talk to me. I don't know why. But by the time I drove back home (4 hours later), I sent my friend a text. Then I went inside and my mom yelled at me. I went back to the car and my friend still hadn't responded. I really didn't know what to do, because my car is super old and is NOT designed to drive around for that long. It was started to overheat and I was freaking out pretty badly. But eventually I went back inside again and went to my room. After some heated exchanges, my mom finally stopped yelling for a bit. I was so angry and convinced that my best friend didn't give a crap about me. Then she texted me back. I have since deleted our conversation, but I responded with something like, \"Nevermind. I know you don't care anyway. You don't have to pretend anymore.\" She was extremely surprised by that. I said, \"I know you hate talking to me. I know that you sigh whenever you see a text from me. You're always hoping the next text will be the last. I just wish you would stop pretending. I wish you would stop lying to me.\" I truly didn't mean to hurt her feelings when I was texting these awful things. At the time, I really believed what I was saying was true. I was mad because I was convinced she hated talking to me and stopped wanting to be my friend years ago. I then went to bad and texted her the next day that my sanity was getting lower and I would try to explain what happened later, but for now I'm sorry. We have since worked it out. I'm now able to look back on the situation and I believe her. I believe that she cares for me. And I'm disappointed in myself for doubting her. And I'm Extremely grateful for how understanding she has been. I don't deserve a friend like her, and I hate that I took my frustrations out on her. But I am now worried that these times where I convince myself she hates me will become more and more frequent. I almost ended our friendship that night. I'm a lucky son of a gun to have a friend who doesn't even get mad at me for behaving like that. But how could I prevent it from happening again? Why did this happen? - - - - - Here are some \"highlights\" of the conversation that happened the day after the texts: Friend: If I didn't enjoy your company anymore I wouldn't tell you you're one of the most important people in my life & regularly try to reaffirm how much I care about you. Why do you call me a liar? Why do you accuse me of pretending? What would I gain from this? What incentive do I have for what I say or do, other tha, sincerity? Is that really what you think of me? A liar & pretender who is a fake friend & only sticks around because- what? The views? The lols? I'm sorry I haven't been able to convey my appreciation for you. I'm sorry I'm so bad at words & feelings & at getting up in the morning & holding conversations. But I can't think of anything I've done that has earned the accusations you launched at me yesterday/today. Me: Part of what drove me to write such extreme texts is because I couldn't stand it anymore. I couldn't stand not knowing and I still can't stand not knowing. I can't stand being unsure of what relationships are real and which are fake. I can't believe that anyone cares, not even you. And it's nothing you did. I just hate this hope that feels so false. I hate the feeling. When I originally read this message, I was happy. I was happy that you said \"I can't think of anything I've done that has earned the accusations you launched at me yesterday/today.\" Because that means I really am being unreasonable and that means that my insecurities are not justified. That there really isn't any reason for me to feel the way that I do, and that maybe my worries really are for nothing. If I made a false accusation, that means maybe you don't hate me. Or at least you haven't done anything that should make me think you do. It's not worth it.", "hash": "0db0207ad88df4b5564732d4724bd180d9e349b53a93b3ac715c845c303fbd39"}

It is impossible to forget the memories of the delusions that set in when I got sick after the birth of my daughter in 2005, that were treated long enough to clear a break, but then slowly crept into my memory bank. For me, medication is essential. The only type of therapy that I believe in other than taking an antipsychotic is love based community oriented therapy where people who love you share their truth. This is extremely hard to overcome - erotomania. Sometimes even 11 years later I still have emotional feelings in response to the deeply seated memories I developed in my postpartum - I believed my physician loved me an was sending me secret messages in the form of wrong number phone calls. It took writing my truth in the form of a book that is \"fiction based on a true story\" I mean, how can you write a delusional memoir without calling it fiction? It also took releasing it into the world, years of continuous and rational choice to take medication and live in the reality people say is true, and the love and support of my friends and family to share their perception regarding my story. They couldn't understand my story when I tried to explain it in conversation, it was too challenging. So I learned to write. I spent 10 years crafting my story. I still take medication every day, and will probably need it for the rest of my life. Today, I understand that the physician will never love me, and that my experience was a natural response to the trauma of an exam during childbirth, and the isolation I felt in a rural community. For me, learning to accept my illness was heart breaking, realizing you are delusional is very upsetting. The disillusionment of it is devastating, but I lived through it to live in recovery which for me is the desire to stay in reality with the people around me. The people who love me read \"I'm not sick and I don't need help\". They joined the National Alliance of Mental Illness, and took the Family to Family course (which helped them learn how to help themselves and me). As for how you decide to live your life, that is a decision only you can make, because you have to be able to live with whatever you decide is best.

Based on your story, Sunny, I have handled this entirely wrong. I guess I should have essentially forced her to take medication. I instead believed that taking stress off of her might help her let her delusion go. But she has never improved, and is currently as bad as I have seen her. She resists any effort to see a psychiatrist or psychologist. So, I think we will start with marital counseling, with a hope that will lead to individual counseling, and then a psychologist, and then a psychiatrist.

In my experience if people feel something is wrong in their gut, there likely is. That said I don't believe people are the same way with every individual. For example I wouldn't behave the same in every Intimate relationship, my thoughts and feelings + actions would be based on my partner and how we connected as one. I mimic my partners a lot, especially in the emotional realm. Bc I'm never exactly sure how to express myself that makes sense to anyone but me heh I watch and listen to how they act and react. I focus on what they need or want and try to give them this effortlessly. When I am comfortable emotionally only then can I be emotionally expressive without any walls up. To answer your question there is no way of knowing how he would behave with another. First you need to find out why he doesn't trust you. It could be something you are doing you are not aware of. Maybe your actions don't match your words etc. We won't always behave the same way with different people. If he is telling you he wasn't this way before you, that should be enough.

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/delusional-disorder/topic1281.html", "text": "by Alex47 » Fri Oct 24, 2003 5:22 pm BOOK COMMENT REVIEW SYNOPSIS GRB comments on Alistair Munro's Book \"Delusional Disorder...\" I highly recommend the website http://shop.ebrary.com/ , where you can read the above book online for free. The information below is taken from p. 232-234, which deserve to be read in their entirety. For me, this section of the book has given me some modest hope, as it paints a picture of the treatment process and some possible favorable outcomes. There is also some practical advice for the psychiatrist. By necessity, I will paraphrase Munro: Because of the patients reluctance to trust psychiatrists, ideally, assessment and treatment should be by a family physician... but they may not always have the necessary familiarity with this condition and recent advances in its treatment. The psychiatrist must be patient and will often have to spend more than one session gaining the patients confidence before even trying to persuade them to take meds. The patient will usually vehemently argue against taking medications, \"but calm persistence does finally pay off in a reasonable proporatioon of cases\". Medication should be started with a \"very low\" dose which is then raised \"gradually and cautiously\", to prevent sudden onset of side effects, \"an event guaranteed to induce immediate noncompliance.\" Munro recommends that the patient see the psychiatrist at least once a week during this early stage. Munro is a champion of the drug pimozide, used in low doses (\"starting with 1 or 2 mg daily...and in most cases [will need to be gardually raised to] no higher than 4 to 6 mg per day\"). He has used this drug primarily to treat delusional disorder of the somatic subtype, with good results. Minor improvements may be seen within a few days (e.g., reduced agitation, somewhat reduced preoccupation with the delusion), but it takes about two weeks (on the average; sometimes as much as 6 weeks) of treatment (assuming the patient is compliant and responding to the medication), before significant amelioration of the delusion is observed. I will quote the following passage in whole, as it addresses a scenario which has caused me worries (the person stops taking their meds), and actually manages to turn it around into something hopeful: Quote: Quite often the patient feels sufficiently improved early on in treatment that he or she decides to stop the medication. Inevitably the delusion and the accompanying agitation and preoccupation start to reappear and it is then that the treating physician has the best opportunity to obtain ongoing co-operation. Even when the patient is still adamant that his beliefs are real, the experience of improvement followed by incipient relapse seems to make a deep impression and if the patient now trusts the physician he or she will often become extremely compliant. In successful cases the complete turnaround from rejection to trust is both remarkable and heartily gratifying. Munro also observes that in the cases where the patient makes a \"good recovery\", it is often \"relatively rapid and notably complete... even when the delusion has been present for a very long time\". Sounds great, doesn't it? [icon_smile.gif] He also talks about long-term maintenance of treatment (which not surprisingly typically involves continuing meds indefinitely), and mentions that of the (admittedly small) group of patients he has been able to follow up with over the long term, about 1/3 have actually been weaned from meds. These occasionally have relapses, but apparently have sufficient insight at that point that they actually voluntarily resume medication. I also found the following passage very interesting: Quote: There is a dissociation between acquired insight as to the desirability of continuing treatment and in-depth insight into the illness itself. Many patients never accept fully the psychotic nature of their experience, but so long as they agree to take treatment, it seems unimportant, and probably unkind, to face them with the fact that they were delusional before the medication took effect. Munro concludes with a few thoughts on non-drug treatment of delusional disorder, stating essentially that psychological (\"talk\") treatment is essentially not helpful until possibly, in some cases, after the delusions have been resolved using medication. A final warning is given: \"There is a general consensus that psychotherapy of an exploratory, uncovering type is not appropriate in delusional disorder. \" I'll say it again, this section of the book deserves to be read by anybody dealing with a loved one suffering from delusional disorder. It helped me, and I hope it will help you, too. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Roger C comments on \"I am Not Sick, I Do Not Need Help\" by Dr. Xavier Amador Dr. Amador writes from his own personal experience, both as brother of a schizophrenia patient, and as a clinical psychologist. A large problem with treating people with schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders is that many times they won't stay in treatment. The usual explanation for this is that they lack insight into their illness. That is, they are not aware they have a mental illness, or in many cases even that they are exhibiting symptoms. Attempts to reason with such patients about their illness are futile. Dr. Amador postulates that this inability to perceive their illness is caused by the same kind of brain disfunction that is responsible for the illness itself. Experiments have proven this to be true. So, since most of these patients are incapable of understanding that they are ill, how can doctors and family members convince them to stay in treatment programs? Dr. Amador gives a four-step method for providing patients with insight into the benefit of treatment, thus giving them motivation to stay in treatment. For example, one schizophrenic patient wanted very much to be able to hold down a job, but had only a few jobs over the years, most of which lasted only a short time. Rather than simply telling this patient that a job was out of the question, the doctor empathized with the patient's desire, and then helped the patient look back to the times when he was able to get a job, and the events that led up to losing the job, and related these events to the patient's treatment program (or lack thereof). This helped the patient to gain insight into the benefit of treatment. The book finishes with a couple of chapters about knowing when to commit a loved one, and how to go about it. All the advice sounds reasonable, and Dr. Amador's track record of success with it speaks for itself. It should be universally applicable, since the method is based on identifying issues that are important to the patient himself; anything he is dissatisfied with and wants to change will provide a means to motivate the patient to stay in treatment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sean et al comments: I saw Dr. Amador speak at the 2003 NAMI National Convention, if you ever have a chance I suggest seeing him. He spent a great deal of time at the end of the session answering questions from people with a mentalli ill loved one. His sympathy and understanding towards the person with the illness was incredible. As he spoke he explained Schizophrenia and the inability to recognize the illness in simple terms: He asked someone from the audience to give a brief bio about themself. The woman who volunteered (I'll call her Susan) was a Psychologist with a loving husband and two children. She gave a brief description of her job, her family, and her life in general. Then Dr. Amador then went on to talk directly to Susan, saying basically the following: Quote: Susan, I have some bad news for you. You aren't really a Psychologist, in fact, the practice where you think you work called me and asked that I tell you to stop going there every day. There's more though, you aren't really married. Tom also has asked me to help you get help and to stop going to his house. Those children aren't yours, and the house isn't yours. You're sick Susan, and I'm going to take you to the hospital and get you some help. This demonstration, more than anything else, made me aware of how frightening it must be to have Schizophrenia and have your reality stolen from you. No wonder someone with such an illness has conspiratorial thoughts. If someone came and told me my entire life was imagined I'd think they were lying. When they went on to say I needed help and then started trying to make me take medication I wouldn't trust them. I know I haven't done the demonstration justice, but try and imagine yourself hearing those words. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GRB comments on Amador: One approach is to \"empower\" the patient to make their own decision about whether to stay on meds, by promising that no one will object if they go off the meds, under the condition that they keep a journal during the periods that they are not taking medications... Also, a thought on the idea mentioned above, about finding a motivator for the patient to stay in treatment (and which could presumably be used to motivate the person to seek treatment...). Roger had mentioned difficulties in applying this concept in his case. I would agree that this approach would work much better with schizophrenia, for example, than delusional disorder, because in the latter case the person is only affected by the disorder in a limited way, due to the \"encapsulated\" nature of the delusions. The person suffering from DD is likely to be highly functional within society in general and professionally, whereas the disorder primarily affects interpersonal relationships with those close to him or her. So, I think it is a general truth that many people with DD actually do not perceive a worsened quality of life as a result of their (untreated) condition. They might notice a positive change after starting medication, which might be helpful in assuring future compliance, but the problem of how to get the person into treatment in the first place remains vexing.... Dr. Amador introduces his four steps. Listen Effective listening is really a skill that needs to be cultivated. You will need to learn to really listen to what your loved one feels, wants, and believes in. Listening without learning is pointless. First, you need to walk in the other person's shoes to gain a clear idea of their experience of the illness and treatment. For the uninitiated, this is not as easy as it may sound on the face of it. Too many times we make assumptions without checking them out with the person about whom we are making assumptions. Knowledge is power. When you know how someone experiences the idea of having a mental illness and taking psychiatric drugs, you will have obtained the leverage you need to begin to build a treatment agreement. But you will also need to know what their hopes and expectations are for the future, whether or not you believe they're realistic. And finally, you want to identify the cognitive deficits (e.g. problems with memory, attention, focusing thoughts) that are creating barriers between you and the person you're concerned about and between that person and effective treatment. Empathize The second step involves learning when and how to express empathy. If there were a moral to each step and chapter, this one would go something like this: If you want someone to seriously consider your point of view, be certain he feels you have seriously considered his. Quid pro quo. That means that you must empathize with all of the reasons he has for not wanting to accept treatment, even the \"crazy\" ones. But don't worry; empathizing with how a particular delusion makes one feel is not the same as agreeing that the belief is true. This may seem like a minor point, but, as you will learn, the right kind of empathy will make a tremendous difference on how receptive your loved one is to your concerns and opinions. In the chapter devoted to this step, I give you step-by-step instructions on how to do this using techniques such as reflective listening. Agree Find common ground and stake it out. Knowing that what you want for the other person is something she does not want for herself can make it seem as if there is no common ground. She doesn't think she needs medication or therapy, and you think she does. Like any conflict of beliefs between two people, to resolve the disagreement to your satisfaction requires that you discover what motivation the other person has to change. Common ground always exists even between the most extreme opposing positions. The emphasis is on acknowledging that your loved one has personal choice and responsibility for the decisions he makes about his life. During this step, you become a neutral observer, pointing out the various positive and negative consequences of decisions your loved on has made. That means refraining from saying things like, \"See if you had taken your medication, you wouldn't have ended up in the hospital.\" Your focus is on making observations together - identifying facts upon which you can ultimately agree. Rather than making an observation or statement about what happened you ask a lot of questions such as \"So what happened after you decided to stop taking your medication?\" \"Did the voices quiet down after you stopped?\" \"How long after stopping the medication was it before you went to the hospital?\" If you are truly collaborating, asking questions rather than giving advice or direction comes a lot easier than it may sound. Partnership Forming a partnership for recovery is the last and, in my experience, the most satisfying step in this process. The aim of this step is to help you to collaborate on accomplishing the goals you agreed upon. Unlike the previous steps, this one involves both you and your loved one making an explicit decision to work together and to become teammates against a common opponent. You may call the enemy different names, but the names are irrelevant to arriving at a plan of action. The final step culminates in arriving at a treatment agreement. _________________", "hash": "0a21c3f0efb3ebdbc45d2367a18767ee2bf2bab60055b4c68e1c1b28e5b27467"}

I have been recently asked to moderate this forum on Delusional Disorder. I am not a doctor, but I believe I have some first hand experience. What is Delusional Disorder? This illness is a psychosis characterized by non-bizzare delusions which last at least one month. The intensity of such perceptions may wax or wane over time. The person suffering from delusions is often functional in all other aspects of their life. Statistically this illness strikes woman more than men. There are at least six sub-types: Erotomanic: Belief that another person, usually of higher status, is in love with him or her. This other person may be a boss, coworker, celebrity, or stranger. Grandiose: Belief that he or she is much more important, powerful, wealthy, or talented than he or she really is. Jealous: The belief that his or her partner has been grossly unfaithful without regard to substantiating evidence. Persecutory: Believes that he or she is being plotted against, spied on, followed, or harassed by unknown enemies. These delusions sometimes involve conspiracies of people out to \"get\" the sufferer. Somatic: He or she is ill or has other types of health problems. Mixed type: Suffers from more than one of the delusions listed above. Delusional Disorder is sometimes a associated with other personality disorders or a subset of other psychoses; and there is a certain overlap with Paranoid Personality Disorder. It may be helpful to you to check the posts in that forum as well. The above information was culled from various internet sources.

I learned to read people and quickly became intuitive to their body languages and inuendos. As life progressed suspicions became all encompassing at times to the point of isolation. The. In my thirties I learned of friendships that were pure and honest. (These few friends I still have 20-some years later) however there is a great distance of country between us so contact is minimal. I've been in a couple long term live in relationships in the past decade and both have ended miserably. Mine is the part of what has become full blown pdd with psychosis breaks. I've been medicated on every bloody aap that is or was available over the last 15 years and to no avail. I've had some contact with pdocs, gps and councillors however in my line of work I'm not always able to set a regimented course of therapy. My question is simple.

I have a 17 yrs old girlfriend who has been diagnosed last yyear with severe anxiety and depression. She was prescribed medication but quit the therapy and the medication because her parents kept stressint her about it saying that she is crazy and all that. She comes from a horrible past (extremely abusive parents, with whom she still lives). She was always scared of public speaking (she fainted when she had to do a presentation in front of her class) but she was determined to get rid of, so last weekend she participated in a debate competition. Her team actually won the competition, but it was an extremely traumatising experience, with her anxiety, and she was extremely stressed out. She keeps believeng that she performed horribly. On monday we met and she had a psychotic episode, she kept twitching and trying to remove stains from her face that weren t there, then she would laugh maniacally then cry uncontrolably and say that everyone is dissapointed in her and everyone hates her. She calmed down eventually, after about 20 minutes, and she had no recollection of what she did, she just remembered that she was sad. Later throughout the day she had mild, one second hallucinations, but she was generally ok. I didn't worry about it too much, as she had these types of episodes before when she was extremely angry. She would be extremely violent and delusional for about 20 mins and then not remember anything about it. The problem is, because she won, she qualified for the national phase of the competition, and everyone (parents, teachers, friends) are stressing her about it, saying that she should go and not dissappoint everyone. This was so stressing for her that when we met again yesterday she had another psychotic episode, more violent and being generally more stressed and repeating that no one loves her, no one appreciates her, everyone is dissapointed in her and being distrustful of me and asking me to leave her alone and all that. After that she calmed down, again not remembering anything, and then she had another episode, much more mild, (it might have just been a panick attack), in which she was scared that she was going crazy. But all throughout the day she just seemed out of it and she was distrustful of me and everyone else, talking gibberish and losing focus oftenly. As I hear, she had another episode in class, where she was much more violent and actually hit someone (i think it helps her a lot when I am next to her during an episode as she is less violent and calms down more easily when I tell her reassuring stuff). When evening came I just couldn't let myself send her home and we went to a hotel. As soon as she realized she wasn't going home her state improved visibly. She had mild hallucinations that she doesn't remember, but no episode and she seemed much better. Today she was in almost normal state, though she had nightmares abour the competition, and she said that she feels normal again (she doesn't remember her episodes but she is aware of her horrible mood). While she was calm I tried convincing her of seeing a therapist together, but she panicked and refused vehemently saying that she can solve her problems on her own and that she did that before. She s at home now and she says she feels ok. I don't know if that will last, so that's why I wrote this. I am begging you help me. Do you know what this is? How can I convince her to go to therapy?

There is a great book called \"I'm not sick, and I don't need help\" By Amador. I recommend this book for anyone dealing with a someone experiencing anosognosia or the lack of insight into their illness. The book provides strategies for helping people help themselves. Insight is challenging without medication. Getting treatment (medication that works) may help. I've found my experience improved with medication. Therapy helps now that I'm in recovery, but I doubt therapy alone is enough for psychosis. If she is a threat to herself or others, you want to reach out and get help. Some places have a crisis intervention team - Usually made up of a mental health professional, police officer, and medical support person. Hope that helps.

At the time, I was with my girlfriend of 6 years. I became psychotic. I started believing I was going to save the world, and I was psychic and this friend of mine was going to fall in love with me. I was convinced she was my soulmate. Arrogant, no? Problem. Two weeks earlier she proposed to her fiancee. I felt like I kept seeing signs that she was in love with me. She clipped her toenails because I complained they were long and I was convinced that really meant something. Giving me special looks, hinting she was going to fall for me. I had serious erotomanic delusions. I told a mutual friend all of the signs I was seeing. So I was convinced I was seeing all these signs and broke up with my girlfriend. I had liked this friend for probably 7 years. The night I broke up with my girlfriend, I went to her house. I was delusional and thought if I was there when my girlfriend got home from work, I was going to literally die. Anyways, that night an affair started. I was convinced it was destined to be. I told her I knew she was in love with me and she was my soulmate etc etc. I told her I was a psychic and it was our destiny to be together. At first, I believe it was just an ego boost for her. She was telling everyone the affair was in my head as a cover up for having an affair with me... It wasn't until someone caught us kissing that she fessed up. She eventually fell really hard for me. My own erotomania somehow presented the conditions for her her actually fall for me. I just find that hilarious and such a great self fulfilling prophecy. Anyway, since I thought I was psychic and she was my soulmate it presented pretty poor conditions for realizing I was delusional. I even spoke to a psychiatrist and he said I was fine. Since I thought I was psychic, predicted her falling for me I thought my other delusions were also real. I eventually ended things when I realized what I was doing was wrong. I told her fiancee about the affair for the third time. A month or two ago, I dropped off a letter to my \"soulmate\" apologizing for exposing the affair. After I dropped off the letter, I checked her instagram and she put a bunch of \"inside jokes\" in the comments and even uploaded a video of our song. I thought maybe she wanted to tell me she forgave me. The unfortunate part was that I asked her why she did this and did not respond. She blocked me and I'm sure she's telling her fiancee that I'm seeing \"signs\" again. Hurts to have my credibility insulted like that. It seems vindictive of her. Not only did she cover the affair for a while telling everyone it's all in my head, now she's putting in legitimate messages that only I would understand. It's frustrating, but I wanted to share my story. Briefly psychotic women whose delusions became self-fulfilling. This was what I told my \"soulmate's\" fiancee before she fell for me. Understandably, when she started falling for me it cemented my delusions pretty securely: rachel, it's ashley. i need to talk to you. this is very important, i know you must have so much hurt inside i need to talk to you and explain and i am unfortunately going to cause a car crash in your relationship i'm talking to you as a soul that sees you have a kind soul you are going to go through some very hard times ahead and i'm sorry to do this to you both i never wanted to hurt your relationship because i know how sweet you are when i look in your eyes i see myself i have ripped her walls right open at the most important part of your relationship everything has to be this way and everything had to be this way i was meant to be the test in your relationship i will bring a lot of pain into your life and you may never understand why but it's my destiny and yours and hers goodbye and i hope you stay strong , okay? but you need to be prepared for what is coming and you will grow", "hash": "13c194fcbd84c063a9b2452a9e944440383e6f2fd073ff7460d813930e7132dd"}

I've thought about leaving and I decided to move out for a few months to see if a break would wake her back up to reality but that just led her into depression until I returned. Since then, she promised to get help and do whatever it takes and acknowledged she has a problem. I never knew to how pervasive her thoughts were because she acts so normal until we go out and have drinks. She can't go out without drinking or she is anxious and bored and if she has one too many, the night goes from fun to accusations and conspiracy theories over anything I do! Then I find out all about the thoughts she has been having all month that make her believe I'm cheating. Anything can trigger these accusations and her logic behind everything never makes any sense and the next day she breaks down and cries and apologizes and realizes her story is so far fetched! Then I forgive her..we make up and go on with our life until the next time we go out. The problem is, she can't stop these thoughts from entering her mind throughout the day but she doesn't react to them until we go out to a bar, club, party or even on vacation where we are around other people. It doesn't matter where we go, it could be all the way to Cancun and if we meet some random nice couple and start to socialize, out of no where, I'm accused of personally knowing them and setting up this whole trip in order to meet them and make her look stupid. I've had to cancel trips and make up excuses why we leave friends parties or events as soon as I get accused of something. At first, I thought all girls were like this that are insecure but we've been married 25 years now and it's obvious to me not everyone is going through this much. So basically, we have no friends left because I've pretty much given up on trying to salvage any types of relationships. I've been living in a bubble like her, only focusing on work and family. I go straight to work and home and have gotten off facebook. No one knows or seems to care why because they think we are probably stuck up by now. No matter what I have done to prove my innocence, the issue still persists but we are now trying everything possible with natural remedies instead of prescription drugs. She is totally on board to try anything because she realizes now more than ever when others and our own kids have had to correct her accusations about me. One time, she thought I was up in a VIP section of the club laughing and mingling with a group and when I showed up behind her after returning from the restroom, she was totally shocked how I could go from upstairs in the VIP right behind her!! She thinks I'm a magician!!! She still tells me it's not rational but her mind still tries to figure out how I did that trick! Another time, I decided to wear my punk rock ring I haven't worn for over 10 years out to the club and she thought some sort of mistress at the club gave it to me as a message to her and got so upset! She said I never owned that ring and thankfully, we took pictures of ourselves before leaving the house that night and when she saw the ring on my finger in the picture, she broke down crying and felt stupid!!!! But guess what!! Soon after she still tried to figure out if I pulled another stunt to trick her!! Like I wore it on purpose to make her think that way! I don't really want to give up going out, having friends and having a social life and we both enjoy traveling but it's like playing russian roullette planning, getting all excited, buying tickets, airfare, etc just to end up fighting and leaving, losing the money and feeling frustrated once more. I know one thing is for sure, alcohol does not help with this problem! She does not react to these thoughts all month, but when we go out and drink, she has no power over them and everything comes out and I never know what the trigger is going to be so I'm always on egg shells and can't be myself but then it's not right because it's perfectly ok for her to talk to others and laugh but if I do...something is up. No one knows she has this problem I'm dealing with because she covers it up really good in public but will start accusing me in my ear or with a look or pinch and that's when I know it's time to leave because I've tried reasoning with her and it just escalates. She doesn't trust me or anyone else when these thoughts occur and thinks everyone is laughing at her.

This is my first time finding this site and finding out about DD. I was researching online just trying to understand what my wife is going through mentally so I can be more helpful and this really sounds like what she might have. We haven't seen anyone about this but 10 years ago we did try a marriage counselor and all the female counselor did was reinforce her beliefs that I must be cheating because her beliefs sound real. We got married at 18 and have been married over 25 years. We were H.S. sweethearts and everything was good except the occasional jealousy and insecurities I thought was normal. It's kept getting worse over the years and it's been hard dealing with the jealousy, conspiracies, panic attacks, anxiety and isolation from friends and family because of it. I guess the warning signs were always there but I always thought her jealousy and insecurities were just normal so I tried to do everything possible like setting up gps on my phone so she knows where I am at all times! Going to the gym at lunch so I have no life outside working hours! I will even give her my phone in a moments notice If I'm accused of anything. We do practically everything together! I mean, if you saw our life on facebook, you'll see that we are inseparable and always doing stuff together which would be great if I didn't also have to isolate myself from everyone. I certainly love being with my wife and all of the fun activities we do, but the problem is whenever we meet others, it triggers her jealousy and conspiracy thoughts against everyone. For example, we can travel all the way to Cancun and end up meeting a really nice couple but somehow I know them and planned this entire trip to meet them and didn't tell her! One time I signed us up for a party bus tour in Vegas and the hostess recognized my name over the phone and came over and said \"Hi, I'm the one you talked to on the phone\" and the night was ruined from the start! All of the sudden, I knew her personally and it's all a setup and she felt stupid thinking we are trying to fool her so we end up in a big fight and ditch the tour. I keep trying with my wife because I love her but it gotten to the point with money and accusations that I'm at a breaking point. I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't because no matter what I give up, there's always a new accusation. I must have a secret phone she doesn't know about! I have spent so much money on vacations that we cancel as a result and have to be so careful and refrain from talking to any strangers or it's a conspiracy! It's been hard on me and I know that she literally can't help it. She is suffering with these thoughts and will break down crying and apologizing the next day and it hurts me because I can't help her and I suffer from the frustration and pain I feel with the one I love not being able to trust me and the frustration I feel having to give up a life outside of our relationship too. No one knows about this struggle because we both hide these issues and just conveniently leave parties and events by making up some other excuse but the real reason is that my wife just came over and questioned my whereabouts when I had to go to the bathroom. I've learned that it's better to leave without fighting by getting her out of there ASAP instead of things escalating into more serious accusations that I upset me even more. We've had too many nights where we were lucky to make it home so now we just show up and leave just to make our presence known. Sometimes I think the night is going so well we stay later but all it takes is one too many drinks for her to bring out everything shes been holding in the entire week or month I had no clue about! I have left her once for a few months just to see if a break would help and that just put her into depression. Since then, she has acknowledged her problem and has opened up to me much more about it and I've been shocked and hurt to find out some things she has been thinking about She deals with these conspiracy thoughts on a regular basis but I never notice until we go out. I like to have fun and socialize and drink, gamble, dance, etc but that's when the real problems come out because I never know what the trigger is going to be tonight! She is the type that can't have fun without drinks or she'll just be bored but if she drinks one too many, her conspiracy thoughts spiral out of control and we have to leave before it gets worse! Anyways, we are trying natural remedies because I seriously do not want my wife on drug care. Has anyone ever found any natural remedies that actually work?", "hash": "59aa8ac497e0badc424d353f12e54190dbe28a214f07ec393145625432de4b87"}

{"url": "https://www.psychforums.com:443/delusional-disorder/topic18356.html", "text": "Delusional Jealousy - so tired of it by BadTwin » Thu Apr 12, 2007 3:25 pm I've been dealing with delusional jealousy with my wife for almost 3 years. We have 3 kids (17, 15, 8 ) so it's been stressful trying to maintain a sense of normalcy for them while living with the chaos of this illness. We've been married almost 24 years. We have been through both counseling and psychiatric care. The counselor and psychiatrist both agree that my wife has delusional jealousy and she was given medications: Risperdal - seemed to help a little but caused weight gain so she quit taking it. Seroquil - turned my wife into a zombie. The doctor never could find a level that didn't almost make her catatonic. She couldn't function as a parent in this state. She hasn't been on any medications for about 2 years now and refuses to attend counseling because in her view the last counselor was on my side because I paid the bill. I've encouraged her to find a different counselor but she refuses and it won't do any good if I find another one. All of the counseling in the world won't help if she just adds each counselor that doesn't agree with her to the idiot list. There is at least one difference between our problem and most of those I have read here (and elsewhere). My wife's delusional jealousy does not involve accusations of infidelity. She doesn't accuse me of sexual relationships with other women but instead accuses me of looking at other women. Now, mind you, when my wife says \"looking\" it sounds like a sex act. It's hard to put down in words just how debilitating this issue is. I've made major changes to my life to reduce her stress as much as possible like dropping my YMCA membership (women there), TV (women), woodworking magazines (a few women there), the newspaper (yep, women there too). When I drive to work (3 mile residential type driving) she calls me on the way and asks me how many women I have looked at. She picks out women we see regularly in the neighborhood as my \"friends\". She's not accusing me of having sex with them, just leering at them. She even picks out women at church that I am supposed to be leering at. And to really twist the knife she usually points out some other guy (just like me) and says \"Joe, wasn't looking at other women\". My most cruel experience with DJ was when my father was in the hospital last summer close to death (end stage Alzheimer's) and I had to stay in the hospital with him. In addition to the stress of my father being near death I had to hear constantly from my wife about \"What women are you looking at\". I also was expected to drive the back roads from my city to my father's so that I wouldn't see any billboards with women on them. Our families have been of no help. My family believes that \"I let my wife behave this way\", even though she is mentally ill. Her side doesn't know at all and even though I think my mother-in-law would understand and help my wife doesn't want them to know. I'm reaching the end of my patience, my wife seems to be getting progressively worse. I have stuck around in what is a toxic situation for me to allow my children to live with both parents but it's getting to the point where I think the children would be better off with us apart. I would love to hear from anyone who has had experience with delusional jealousy not involving accusations of infidelity.", "hash": "7bd4df02940b00b181bcd8de3db9222e6c7e5e41f01245b5b68969806400fb44"}

If she accuses you of infidelity don't reward her by explaning your innocence, leave the premises If you can. Eventually she will learn her accusations will make you leave, and I believe she'll try to control herself to prevent an unwanted outcome. If she is isolated encourage her to take classes, or pursue and interest she has. I think social isolation makes this condition worse, you don't want her have a lot of free time to focus on you. Yes, it seems my wife isn't the only one ignoring what the counselor tells them . I received this same advice from our counselor about 18 months ago and was unable/unwilling/scared to put it into practice. My wife gets so stressed and angry at anything that doesn't go her way I've been reluctant to force the issue. She behaves like a 3-year old and says horrible things without consideration whether our children are present or not. Of course, at this point, I don't think matters could get any worse so it's probably time to do it and not worry about her behavior. Thanks so much for your response.

In my wife's case she says that she didn't realize that married men like to look at women. She does say that it's perfectly normal for non-married men to look at women but that when we get married we're supposed to undergo some change that makes us no longer interested in other women. I have become the biggest liar on the planet dealing with this issue. I routinely tell my wife lies (didn't see any women on the way to work, she's not attractive, etc.) just to avoid a fight.

The fact that he did not trust me ended the marriage.

Before I was in Iraq I was good no delusions or anything, just a normal soldier doing a job. well when I came back I was very controlling very jealous and all kinds of other crazy crap. Well I met my now fiance who has stuck by me the whole time and without her I would have been lost. Well it has been a whole year and a half since I have been diagnosed and since then I have wanted to get better and better. With these guys you have to make them think that what they think is not true. Its a pain I know but they also have to be willing to give up their delusion. To be honest the medication was worse then the illness itself so don't always count on that either. Well let me tell you something if you have an extremely jealous person and they are afraid of you having sex with somebody or cheating on you then tell them go do it themselves if they are so scared of you cheating on them tell them to find out why other women or men would cheat and have them cheat on you. So they know about it. Its a fear of unknown to these people they don't know about it and they themselves are very loyal and very rightous per say. Tell them that its o.k. to feel a little bit jealous but don't get out of hand. The Truth is they love you a lot and they truly care about you more then you will ever know. They just don't know about cheating and are afraid to be lied to. they have to be insightful and willing to talk to other people like mental health professionals and even research their illness. Inform them on whats out there.

I met the man of my dreams over two years ago after being a single mom for years. He was everything I had dreamed about - tall, goodlooking, tender, hard working, family oriented. We became engaged, and right after that problems started. He accused me of looking at men no matter where we went or what we did. I would reassure him that I looked at everbody when we were out - men, women, children. Normal to do when out in public - you look at the world around you! He would say I stared at them, and they stared back. He said some would look at him and smirk or wink. He mistrusted everone, and analyzed to the nth degree everything everyone said or did. It became so bad I was afraid to lift my head in public. Even that was not enough. We started going to counseling, first him alone and then us together. When the counselors just talked to him, they seemed to think he had a legimitate view. But when they heard the other side, they started to see things differently, which made him angry. He was convinced I somehow had dazzled them to my way of thinking. He has absolutly no insight to the condition, and refuses to even consider it. He never accused me of actually being unfaithful, only looking at men. But he carries it to the next step inside and thinks that I will someday. I love him with my whole heart, and could never think of another man. But I don't think he will ever get that. We have been living like this quite awhile. He has left a couple of times before, and left again this week. Even though this relationship has caused me so much anguish, I can not seem to let go. I keep chasing the dreams I had when I first met him. I think this leaving may be different though - he has been out of contact and very cold. So maybe that is what it will take - for him to end it. I don't think I am strong enough to - no matter how much I read about it, and the negative prognosis, I can not seem to believe it.", "hash": "45fd3dc449ec28b3ec88092bae98c2b0fb25e00634524a24bed572989e746e4a"}

You can read my other posts about my wife to see some of the symptoms that I have been dealing with for the last 7 or 8 years. My wife was classic DDJ and paranoid. Although my last post was in 2014, in 2015 things really went down hill in a major way. By the end of the year my wife was in hospital (for 5 weeks) and had a court order baring her from our home or contact with our kids. While in hospital they tried everything to get her better, and finally risperidone worked and her delusions lifted in the space of a few days. Since then she has moved back into our home and reconnected with the kids. She is a brand new person and is definitely back to the woman I originally fell in love with and married. She is very remorseful about all the harm she has caused, but she is not letting it get her down and is powering ahead with life. She has been great now for over 6 months and I haven't seen any signs of delusions or unusual behavior. We are fortunate that we can afford the injectable version of Risperidone (its not covered by our insurance), so I can administer it and I don't need to rely on her taking her meds, which I know is a huge win for the prospects of continued success with her treatment. (I know 6 months is not a long time and I am not declaring victory by any means and will always be on guard, but so far so good ) Good luck to everyone out there and know that this condition is treatable.

I've been briefly part of the Tumblr community, but from what I've read of those posts, none of those people seem to have psychotic symptoms; or, if they have, they don't talk about them. I find that a bit weird, because I struggle a lot with psychotic symptoms. I've had four psychotic episodes in the last three years. To summarize: I was certain I was a dead famous personality; I was certain I was a completely different person that travelled in time from the 19th century; I was certain I had multiple personalities and I showed signs of personality dissociation, according to my therapist; I was certain a person in my life wanted to harm me. Aside from that, I also have hallucinations. They are minor, just shadows I see and sometimes when I look back when I'm walking I see people that aren't there. Occasionally I have terrible hallucinations of monsters jumping towards me and I hear things that aren't there. I've never heard voices in my head (except for the time when I thought I had dissociative personality disorder). My therapist and my psychiatrist never told me if this is psychosis. I've never really discussed these episodes with them (except for the third one), and they never gave me a diagnosis for these symptoms. They only gave me the borderline diagnosis after I pushed them for it, because I fit the entire criteria for the disorder, but, while my therapist diagnosed me, my psychiatrist was reluctant because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. I'm asking this because I was wondering if I should get a separated diagnosis for psychosis. These episodes are frequent, they last for months and sometimes I have delusions even when I am on medication.", "hash": "d0f312e252d800d3c283bbbffc19bb0df7dd52cb41d9f1330754dbb7d19eb63d"}

I also have Aspergers. Aspergers alone doesn't cause much more than social difficulty but when that's combined with OCD it makes for a very weird situation. So before you read on, just make sure to keep in mind when I say races I don't mean stuff like Black and White, but more like genetic bits of information that are in all of us. I'm not a physical actual racist. I feel like some races are there to destroy others, that the world is a battle between the good and bad, and that we must stop or eliminate the dangerous ones. Some are conspiring against others, and their whole purpose is to infect the clean races with degenerate and inferior DNA to destroy the rest. I am a member of the failed species, so I must be stopped and detained. Usually the races that are the same have similar features. The bad races are caused by viral infections that mutate and breed inside of humans, and with each generation of human children distortion occurs. Also, the bacteria is not from earth. It was engineered by the hidden forces. I do not yet know what these hidden forces are. There is only a matter of time before the bad races take over us all. Any of us (I'm already one) could also be bad races! It's scaring the hell out of me. The bad races typically have ugly features (I'm extremely ugly, and sometimes as I'm walking around I can clearly distinguish the ugly ones, but many other people can't because they live in denial of the ugly features\". The media is run by the bad ones, who try to make us feel like beauty is not an ideal, and that ugliness must be accepted. I could just go on and on, so I'm going to stop here. I also feel like the universe is empty, save for a few particles. We exist in a \"dream\" state, and our whole world is just part of the imagination of some massive entity. We are a disorder, a virus, of this massive entity, so it tries to rid us from the world by causing this horrible disease that kills us called DEATH I've gone into hiding and I feel like shooting myself in the leg because I'm absolutely disgusted by these thoughts, but I'm at a loss for what to do. I believe them, and the only thing that keeps me from going out there and preaching my beliefs is the fact that people who are close to me tell me they're not true. Also I have 30-40 people on the street come up to me and physically threaten me because of my \"neo-Nazi beliefs???\". I'm not a neo-Nazi! I truly believe this, and for some reason no matter how many facts I read I can't shake it. If it helps to say this, I am on a medication, which could be causing these thoughts.", "hash": "82946d1bb4d57240fdf4ab5c5a74912d6d8d0f0745e97479066239fc8ddc6c8f"}

Now I usually have very bad memory especially when it involves directions or locations. But recently ive been doing a lot better in reguards to my depression and also in reguards to my directional memory. I know how to get places that ive only been to once over a year ago, something that i would never have been able to do before. But how is it working, I thought. What makes the most sense is that the meds that ive been taking are disrupting the government signal thats being transmitted through the microchip. The signal was blocking my memory of how to get places so that i would be easier? To control? Or keep track of? Or something like that. I think that the signal is being broken up somehow?

I am currently being treated for it but the stress overwhelms me sometimes, there is something that I really want to get off my chest and it is quite serious and a heavy topic so if your not in the mood I suggest not reading any further. Its about this election this year. During my psychosis I became paranoid that Donald Trump was supposed to represent me and the reason he is so hated is because people really hate me. That sounds crazy but it honestly really stresses me out so I just want to say, Im sorry I voted for him. I am not a hateful person really, in fact I hate racism, bigotry, evil, hatred, those are all wrong. The only reason I voted for him is because I wanted to support myself, and love myself more. I believed that the hatred towards him was actually towards me, and so I cast my vote simply for myself. I have since come to my senses, and after seeing his administration in action, I just want to say i deeply regret my decision. Since then, I just want to say that I have come to love the left side, I fully support black lives matter, I love the liberal movement, LGBT community, feminism, and I have always supported marijuana. I hate the wave of racism and bigotry that has swept this country, and I believe that I might actually have played a hand in causing it in the first place. I am deeply sorry for this. I have come to hate the entire right side and I believe that their message of ignorance and hate is wrong. Most of all though, I am sorry for what I have done and the hateful things I have felt towards such kind, and loving people. Overall I just want to say that Hate is wrong, and love is right. i believe in this with all my heart and I am disgusted by how much racism and hatred has grown after the election. I am sorry, to the left side. Black lives DO matter, and my attitude before was just naive, and living in the past...

What you have described so far seems typical and commonplace among witches. However, such a thing could easily turn into a delusion sinply because religous beliefs cannot be proven with hard facts. Here are aome helpful stepa I follow to check my religious beliefs against delusions: 1. If you can find scientific facts to prove any part of it, do it. Be mindful, however, of hindsight bias. Once you've researched something it is easier to convince yourself you knew these things in advance (past life memories). 2. Ask yourself if what you believe has any logic to it. What are the moat unbelievable parts? Does your religious community as a whole also believe these things? Are they part of a core doctrine or just specific to you. How did you decide to believe this? If it seems illogical what experiences have you had to confirm your beliefs? How possible is it that these experiences are imagined? Did they happen here and now or in another time? Is there any physical proof of your experience? 3. How do your beliefs affect your life? How do they affect the world around you? Since you atarted believing these things have you or your peers been negatively affected? 4. The last suggestion I have is something you won't want to hear and probably won't believe. Having come from a history of witchcraft, I find that the beat way to ward off major symptoms of mental illness is through prayer, worship, and study of the Bible. It has helped me greatly.

She is confused and does not understand that she is mentally ill. The head psychiatrist told me that people with this illness can't realise that what they are experiencing is not reality, although some can achieve it if they are on medication, undergoing therapy and are 'lucky'. We were also told we can't tell her she is unwell or it will break up her relationship with that person, and she will always resent them for it as she will probably always believe it was real. To be honest, the health system that are helping us have been extremely unhelpful and we are really struggling. My mother has not been eating or sleeping well for a while and is under constant surveillance from the family. Although she is not panicking like she used to about the voices she hears and the facts that they tell her are true, she is adamant that she is not unwell. Unfortunately her social worker included me in the conversation of persuading her to take medication. However she has not turned her back on me as a result so far, which she was doing if we said that something was what it was-and not what she thinks it is. As she is not a danger to herself she has to come to some sort of realisation to accept psychotic medication or accept going into the hospital ward again. She did agree to medication when faced with the social workers persuasion, but then quickly went back on it because she doesn't think she is ill. Does anyone know if they can come to realise that they are ill? The head psychiatrist said it as if it is brain chemistry but I can see some people in this community know that it's not real by themselves. I'm wondering if it is chemical or psychological. It's been about a month and we haven't had any evidence or any proof that these 'stalkers' planting things and posting things online exist and are doing what they say they are doing, to her. Our assigned long term planner won't get back to us on a plan for my mother and the social worker hasn't got back to us after my mother said she would take them. Which now she decided she won't. I don't want to loose the bond I have with my mother and I'm scared that while my family are seeking advice on how to deal with this situation, and not tell her she is ill, something will go wrong, and I might loose that bond. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.", "hash": "3939577706f94d7abb80951977b43dec58fbc1a8c4cc82e05a9304fd4ebe1c00"}

I dont know if there are any legal ramifications of stopping treatment with this program. As far as stoping treatment. It is always your choice. I believe that my medication and therapy has helped me be less depressed and not hyper focused on my \"delusional\" beliefs which has helped me in my functioning at work and socially. I believe that medication and therapy can be an aid to \"getting out of your own head\" a bit so that you can get a different perspective on how your living life and dealing with stress. Some people just dont want to be on meds, some people cope enough to keep a job or stay in school and some cant function at all and end up on the street. Not saying that might happen to you. I just know how hard it is to keep up your everyday appearances when struggling with psychosis and suicidal thoughts. Its unbearable at times and tolerable at times. Its also something that can improve. Life can sometimes be mentally, horrifyingly painful. Its hard to be in it alone. I would recommend giving treatment another shot and try a different medication, there are a lot of different medications out there and something will work better than something else. Also if you decide that medication is not what you want to do then maybe just therapy to help with coping skills when things get really bad and suicide has come into the picture again. It is good to have social support. Hope all goes well.", "hash": "19f223d6267f7bfcb92ba8dd8bfde289fd3c14219fe1ed5ada9aa7188cec01cc"}

My boyfriend (now ex?) of 4 years has been experiencing persecutory delusions that have become increasingly worse over the past year. I work in the mental health field and managed to get him to the hospital in early January. Prior to being admitted to the hospital, he started involving me in the delusions...saying that I had knowledge of or was involved in this conspiracy that was happening to him. He believes that some kind of paramilitary mafia like organization is monitoring and surveilling him...invading every portion of his life down to the food he orders and his care providers. While he was in the hospital, he started distancing himself from me...he would hang up on me or tell the nurse to tell me he wasn't available. When I came to visit, he asked me to leave early because I was \"triggering\" him. He discharged from the hospital against medical advice after 10 days and had started refusing his antipsychotic medication several days prior. When he left the hospital, he didn't come home but instead went to live with his parents in a different city. He maintained contact with me for about a week and then broke up with me and cut off contact with me. He then insisted on coming to move his belongings out of the house because he did not feel safe with his things here. After he moved out, he reached out and was apologizing and begging to have me back in his life. This gave me hope and made me believe that our relationship might be able to work. He came to visit the weekend before Valentine's Day and even brought me gifts. He left abruptly on Valentine's Day before we even got to go to dinner claiming that I was evil and had conspired against him with the neighbors. He felt horribly about how he treated me and tried to continue being in contact with me. He then cut off contact with me about a week later insisting that talking to me was keeping him sick. He sent me a heart shaped note in early March that said he would always have hope in his heart for me. I mailed him a sweet greeting card that let him know how much I cared about him and his mom texted me with a message from him. (He destroyed his phone in a fire). He said that he found my card heartbreaking because he needed me to be honest about the \"barriers to trust\" and never wanted to talk to me again. I don't know, but I'm guessing that he wanted me to confess to things that I didn't do. That was almost 2 weeks ago and I have not heard from him since. I feel so heartbroken and am at a loss as to what to do. It seems like reaching out to him makes things worse but I'm having such a hard time letting go because I love him so much. Does he really mean it when he says he never wants to talk to me again? Will I really never hear from him again? Will the distance from me help to dislodge me from his delusional system? Is there anything I can do to offer him my support when he has cut me out of his life like this? I'm already doing everything I know to do to take care of myself but am still having such a hard time. I would greatly appreciate support and any words of wisdom because this really is so difficult for me.", "hash": "01eeb261eab04d02ae5037b764f6c2f3672086af3222f7f71739f57d89c63798"}

For me, when the delusions have gone untreated for a length of time, and aren't treated early, they seem to grow deep roots in the memories and corrupt a lot of good history. Thankfully, he doesn't sound like a threat to himself or you. I'm sorry that you have to go through this. Debonding is hard even when everyone involved is sane and healthy. When there is illness, it just feels so wrong. I wrote a book to come to terms with my illness, and try to find acceptance and move on in life letting go of the pieces of my broken puzzle and putting it on the shelf is hard. I found that through taking medication after my first full psychotic episode, the medication helped me gain insight, along with support from friends and family. For me, work is my best therapy. I think it sounds like you've done everything you can to support a path to healing, unfortunately, without insight mental illness is tough on relationships. Even with insight, my family gets tired of hearing my deeper concerns over time. But I rely on them to help guide me along the path of sanity. Relationships are important. I'm sorry this happened to you. I hope you will find healing through your experience and are able to eventually see this as an informative experience for your work in the mental health field. FYI, there is a friends and family forum where we send most of the threads of family and ex's seeking support. You'll hear a lot of heartbreak there, but thanks for reaching out.

I know what the experience is like to lose your ability to know the real from the unreal as others perceive it. The best advice I have is to focus on things that bring you joy, pleasure, and love. Focus on the light and in time the memories fade. I wish I could have let go of the pain earlier in my journey. I felt so many emotions in response to my perceived experiences. It was challenging to work through the reactions and get back to being the person I want to be. By transforming the negative energy into light, our creative selves can grow and blossom. I used my focus to write about my experience, and that helped when I produced a full length novel to reduce my isolation. Hope that helps.

Recovery, What to Expect? by atina » Mon Jan 02, 2017 3:18 am Dear phindel: My experience with delusions and healing: it is similar to what was depicted in the movie Beautiful Mind. The main character was seeing a group of people throughout his life, talking to them, interacting. At one point he figured: although he was years and decades older, that group of people were still the same age, the girl in the group was always a girl, she never grew up. He had delusions (and hallucinations), believing he was seeing people that were really there.

Our delusions get weaker when we identify them. We can still FEEL like they are real, but we get to know the feeling and delusion and prepared, when we feel that way and believe that way, we know it is not true or real. atina", "hash": "e859cefd835cd6fe756cd8c785274e15b4e5103392b91dbd21916f5d2f19f2b0"}

Recovery, What to Expect? by Sunnyg » Sun Mar 26, 2017 3:17 am Hi, I wanted to share that for me, hope is the most important ingredient in my journey to recovery. Surrounding myself with people who believe in me and can see my strengths goes a long way towards healing, and having work that I enjoy is a wonderful aid in my journey towards healing. I'm in recovery, but still healing from the trauma of my experiences with psychosis. My long standing diagnosis from 2005-2014 was delusional disorder, then I changed providers in 2014 and the diagnosis was reclassified as schizophrenia, but I think the diagnosis is less important than the knowledge that medication (when I take it everyday) is effective for me, and that with time the delusions begin to fade. I wrote a book about my experience because I couldn't find a story other than a beautiful mind to describe my experience, and I have a good ending... Not an ending so much as a beginning of living life surrounded by people I love, who love me too, and healing. My pain over the years from stigma, rejection, and trauma are now a greater challenge than my illness. With medication I find my illness is well controlled. It is an internal struggle to not try to solve the pieces of my delusional thinking that I experienced in 2005, 2006, and 2011 when I was taken off medication or just beginning my journey through mental illness. I hope this helps.

I suffer from both bizarre and non bizarre delusions including believing in telepathy(bizarre) and believing people are out to get me (non-bizarre). I have not been officially diagnosed with delusional disorder but I have been having delusions for about 4-5 years. My delusions include believing people can telepathically read my thoughts which would be classified as bizarre delusions as they are considered impossible and unlikely to happen. My other delusions have been thinking people are out to get me,have ill intent,or have said things behind my back which are considered non bizarre as they have the possibility to happen... I do not know if my symptoms truly mean I have delusional disorder as I may be misinterpreting the information of delusional disorder incorrectly but it appears I have it... Moving along...the reason why I am so self aware despite my psychosis is due to my rational mind and belief in science which assures me that telepathy is not possible since there has been no proof of telepathy being possible.The only \"proof\" that has ever been given on telepathy has come from pseudo scientific studies.Meaning people who claim to be scientists and who claim to have proof which in reality isn't proof at all. So thanks to my highly rational scientific mind I am able to realize I am delusional. However the delusions have made my brain develop a pattern of irrational thinking which causes me to be very psychotic despite this realization.Basically the irrational pattern of thinking caused by my psychosis overpowers my rational personality which is why I'm self aware yet psychotic. Thankfully thanks to my rational mind I am at least capable of realizing I have a problem and despite not being able to cope I have decided to go to therapy to unravel my irrational thinking or at the very least get anti psychotic medication... Which brings me to my next statement...I have to wait a couple of years until I can get therapy and antipsychotic medications...I have a hard time making social connections due to my paranoid persecutory paranoid thoughts and due to my overall psychosis which means I lack a support group... Whilst I wait for the ability to go to therapy and take my antipsychotic medications I want to cope,in a relatively healthy way,with the delusions I have so I can socialize and be a regular happy person. So I have thought about drinking when I am the legal age for drinking in my area. As I plan to self medicate for the social anxiety I have by becoming a social drinker whilst I wait for therapy I am left wondering if healthy,controlled,self medication with alcohol is possible for delusional disorder... I am not stating in any shape way or form that I plan to become a alcoholic or refuse therapy/treatment for my delusional disorder. I fully plan and intend to get therapy and medications for my mental illness so I will not harm myself or others and so I can live a healthy happy life. I also plan to drink responsibly as it is my responsibility to do no harm to myself or others. However I am stating that I am considering self medicating with alcohol in a responsible manner to cope with delusions whilst I wait for therapy.Not now but when I am legally allowed to drink alcohol. I would drink responsibly and have no intent on getting excessively drunk only enough to \"take off the edge\". With my background and intentions in mind now clarified that leads me to my actual question. Can I use alcohol,responsibly of course,to cope with delusions,in a safe controlled environment,whilst I am waiting for the opportunity to gain enough money to get therapy and/or anti-psychotic medications? Meaning... Will alcohol be able to help me cope with delusions? I am not sure if it would help but I would like some opinions from other people...Please and thank you", "hash": "f727b233e81aebaf608bf7f57293b4df20f6cdeba1b18604705850fe2e93c690"}

The groups are free and you could probably find something in your area. Also you could call the suicide hotline and ask for free mental health programs in your area if that is something you would be able to do. As for self medication with alcohol, I dont recomend it. It can make the delusions worse and when your not intoxicated you could become depressed. Also even though you have the intent to not get drunk, when you are out with friends it is hard to stop and know your limits, especially since you will be new to drinking and social drinking. If you start relying on alcohol to control your anxiety then it would be very easy for your drinking to get out of hand. Remember no one has the intent to become an alcoholic the drinking just gets out of hand. I have some similar issues with persicutory delusions and social anxiety and I found that when I drank I would just be more likely to talk to people about my beliefs and be more openly passionate about what I know is true and what everyone else knows is false. That could get you into trouble socially, people will most likely not be kind when rejecting your viewpoint and then when your not drunk or under the influence you will have to address what you said and how you acted and try to back peddle to try and convince that person that you are not crazy if you would like for them to still accept you into their social circle. I commend you for reaching out on this forum and for having such incite into your beliefs as such a young age. I feel that professional help would be the best option. You can always talk to me whenever you need.", "hash": "ce7faf4f6cebb02692485510128c8c1ef617833cec6ff244cd615346d5e23ed3"}

My husband was recently diagnosed with Delusional Disorder (after years of wierd behavior and me and my family knowing something was way off) He never can see how odd his behavior is and thinks it is all me and not him. About 3 years ago he started in on researching a \"plot\" my Dad and I were in on since before my husband and I were even married...he insists we did a \"real estate scam\" on him...and that my Dad is a pedifile (or however you spell it) and has been abusing me since I was 5 up until current ...it is so disgusting the things my husband comes up with. He has outbursts and out of control anger - thinks it is totally justified because of \"all the things we have done to him\". He is up all night long on the internet compiling his \"evidence against me\" - he was up all night Thursday and still on he computer when I got up. Other times he goes to bed at 5am and gets up at 2 in the afternoon. A few mos ago he was having chest pains. I figured it was anziety or depression. After 4 days he felt a bit better. In the middle of the night he left to go to Tucson to visit a friend. On facebook I saw him post that he felt like he was going to die due to sever chest pains. I told him \"well, if you had told me you were going I would have said to wait - not a good idea to make a long drive when you are having chest pains\" and he got all mad at me about it. I told him to go to the hospital (which he did 2 DAYS after getting to Tucson) He had a lot of fluid around his heart which was drained (they said 2 more days he may have died) so I drove out there and arrived at 5 am - his surgery was at 8. He started yelling at me and they had to give him valium before the surgery to calm him down. 5 days later he told me to get the \"F\" out of his room (he was yelling about the real estate scam he thinks i did) and then later that day on the phone he threatened me and the nurse heard it.

My now ex was diagnosed with DDJ back in 2003. It began with the accusation, out of nowhere, that I was having a lesbian affair, then the accusations spread to my co-workers, friends, and ultimately to almost every female I came in contact with. I kept patiently asking for his reasoning saying, \"please help me to understand why you're thinking these things?\"... His response was, \"I can tell by the way you look at them\"... I asked for an example of \"the look\" and what I got was the most rediculous example, it was a look you'd see an actor having in a movie where they come upon a beautiful oasis after spending a week in the middle of an Arabian dessert. Get the picture? The sad part is that this IS WHAT HE SAW IN HIS MIND. He even accused me of possibly having our new born artifically inseminated by the brother of one of my alleged lesbian mates in order to have a child close to her DNA. Yes, I had just given birth to our 4th child 3 months before this craziness was dumped on me. Over time I became somewhat callous, and perhaps a little cynical, it was my only defense mechanism for the emotional pain I was feeling. I was beyond pissed, I was bitter, just plain bitter. Why did my loving husband become a monster? This was the first and only man I had ever been with.... we met when I was 17 and he was 20 back in 1980. I didn't know anyone who had this sort of situation to talk to, I only wish I had come upon this site back then. At the time I felt so ALONE. What hurt most was that HE BELIEVED ALL HIS ACCUSATIONS BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT. I remember telling my counselor how I'd like to trade places with him so that he could feel the pain he was causing me... He quickly interrupted my thoughts and said, \"don't ever say that again, there is no greater pain than what he's feeling as a prisoner of DDJ.\" As for help, good luck in convincing him that he needs it... like you, my then husband was 100% sure that I was the one that needed help. In his mind, the only reason the psychiatrists we saw suggested he needed intense therapy for his delusions and meds for his paranoia and depression, is because I paid them to say that... So unfortunately, if your husband truly does have a delusional disorder, you're probably in the same boat... which is why I am now divorced and raising four children practically on my own. Through the grace of God, I've grown accustomed to my \"new normal\" life. At first I thought I'd never be happy again... don't get me wrong, I still miss the beautiful, loving, man I married and loved with all my heart, but holding on to the past doesn't let me appreciate all the wonderful things I still have. Through faith, I know I'll see his beautiful smile and sweet eyes again.... but not in this lifetime. I hope your situation will be the exception to the rule. If you do find a way to get through to him PLEASE let the rest of us know. God bless and good luck. ~ Beautiful Mind", "hash": "0d1ce2adefde8afbda31969c07390c7bfdd13b23cfe25fabfb59fb8bd3b1eb83"}

He would become paranoid, accuse me of plotting against him, have disillusion of him working for the county doing such top secret work under cover agents had to constantly surveillance him for our protection. These episodes seemed to come and go. He could be totally normal, sometimes for months and then crash into bizarre thinking and behavior lasting anywhere from a couple days to two weeks. For the most part while immersed in the delusion there was no convincing him of reality. His actions and behavior did not seem odd to him. That's when I realized that crazy people, don't know they're crazy. Everything they are doing makes perfect sense to them. They are in a different realm of reality. There were some points, however, at which he seemed to briefly be aware and confused about what he was doing. Almost as though he knew something wasn't right, but couldn't put his finger on it. In hopes of finding a trigger to his episodes I began a journal. From the log I was able to track obvious triggers, such as stress. I noted a pattern of behavior that would lead up to an episode, such as he would change his sleeping pattern. Rather than a full 8-10hr sleep, he would sleep 2-3hrs, if at all. He would spend money frivolously and either become very needy and insecure, or overly confident and condescending to others. Strangely I also noted his voice would change. He would start speaking through his nose as if he had a cold. Based on the reasoning that there was such a fluctuation in personality. He was completely normal for weeks, or months, than lost in delusion for days. It occurred to me that he must be experiencing some sort of chemical imbalance. I started researching online and came across an article about a Doctor that had found miraculous improvement in patients with schizophrenia by administering vitamin B3 (niacin) and vitamin C supplements to their diet. After years of clinical studies and research he even concluded that vitamin B3 could be a possible cure for patients with schizophrenia. Read one of many of the published findings here: http://www.orthomolecularvitamincentre. ... hrenia.php I began my boyfriend on a daily vitamin regime which included a multi vit in the morning and then B3(niacin) 500 mg after meals, vitamin C 1000 mg after meals, folic acid 15 mg daily, vitamin B-12 l mg subliminally daily, l-lysine 1000 mg after each meal, vitamin E 400 iu daily and zinc citrate 50 mg daily. I could see noted improvement in a week. After a month he seemed more clear minded with no episodes. Month 2 he forgot to take the vitamins for just two days and started into having an episode. Once he took the supplements his paranoia diminished within 24hrs. He has now been regularly taking the vitamin supplements for four months. If he forgets a dose he will start showing signs of having an episode in 24-72hrs. As soon as he replenishes his body he returns to a healthy state of mind. I am completely amazed at his improvement. It's like a miracle and offers hope for the future. I am so grateful to Dr. Abram Hoffer and his research. I wanted to share my hope with others suffering. Especially since its such an affordable, readily available treatment with no side effects or risks involved. It can even be taken with existing medication, but of course verify with your current treating physician. I'd be interested to hear if after starting the B3 treatment if anyone else finds it was as miraculously helpful as I did, so please post your results.", "hash": "b00808836b4edda2de3fb2715c21384c7008ddc4941711b7e4b98b2044fe6921"}

I had to recently get a new therapist due to insurance changing and its been hard starting with someone new. You will probably have to agree to disagree about what you know is true and what they know is true. So therapy can not help with delusions. Medications can make them less intense which is helpful for daily life. Therapy can also help you deal with anxiety and coping with stresses.

His behaviour has been odd for years ranging from the the bizarre to the ridiculous. He firmly believed The police, or people connected to the police were following and harassing him for years. The phone , house and car were all bugged . people driving cars with high beam lights were part of the conspiracy. According to my husband we were followed around the supermarket, by the family and friends of police officers , we were even followed on holiday. When I tried to address these beliefs he got angry and accused me of being naive and stupid. It finally came to a head after about three years and I tried to talk to him about DD , he went wild , shouting , aggressive accusing me of wanting to get him sectioned. He flatly refused to get help or talk to anyone about his problems. However Following a visit to Jamaica some months later, he told me he had spoken to a Doctor and he was feeling better. I asked him if he still held his beliefs about being followed and he said no. I wasn't entirely convinced but gave him the benefit of the doubt he refused to discuss the issue again . Now another year later it's started again. This time the paranoia appears to be about me. He says I'm playing a game , trying to trap him but the things / signs that alert him to this attack are just strange and seemingly have no logic whatsoever . Here are three recent examples that show him I'm conspiring against him 1. Me showing him a dog related video on You Tube 2. Me wearing my rucksack on both shoulders 3. Me pretending to have a slight knee injury and limping slightly ( in my defence this last accusation follows a 13 k run I did yesterday as I'm training for a half marathon). He won't or can't explain the significance of these things , but they make him anxious and angry and I'm the lightning rod for all the delusions. I just hope they don't escalate , he has never been violent but I worry that he's getting much worse. I'm at the end of my tether I've had enough. Nothing I say or do seems to help , he either refuses flat out to see the Doctor or screams and shouts at me. He says I have a mental health condition because I cry and I'm down and depressed. Well yes I suppose I am depressed about living with him and his delusions for so many years. I am finally giving up on him , the house is up for sale and I want a divorce after 22 years. My life is not my own and I'm on edge all the time , I now need some respite from all this pain and misery his condition has brought to our family. I do still feel for him and I know living with his condition must be hard and a daily struggle , but I now feel like it's either him or me .. And as Irvine Welsh so profoundly wrote ' I choose life' . This board is lifesaver by the way, I thought for years this was my fault , or something to do with me not being kind or loving enough , but I now realise my experience is not unique and I'm not to blame it's just a horrible , destructive illness. Thanks to everyone brave enough to post your words have helped me immeasurably.", "hash": "aa56797f9825fd187c9f5e48564f1aa7b31548ab3c45f98f018f7f29ca6deeec"}

Some of these therapies were very brief because they didn’t accept that I don’t use medication, which I always explained in the first session... Now out of these 150 people whom I saw over 40 years, probably about 100 of them accepted my non-medication approach. The large majority of these stayed in treatment for at least one year, and many stayed for between three to five years or more...Most of the people I consulted with chose to try working without medication, which was often because they or their parents didn’t like what the medications were doing to them... With somebody who was experiencing symptoms that the profession labels schizophrenic, such as having hallucinations, delusions, or being very paranoid, I would usually see them 3-5 times per week over a period of at least two years. Many of these schizophrenic clients were young people undergoing life transitions — these life transitions, like leaving home and going to college, often cause a stress that brings up earlier trauma and can cause a break with reality in a vulnerable person. But I also saw some older clients whose life stresses had precipitated a break. I worked intensively with them because psychotic conditions are very serious and require intensive help. \" We also discussed his success with the group that stayed over the longer term: Quote: \"The large majority of them get much better. I’d say 85-90% of the schizophrenic men and women who stayed in therapy at least two years got well to the point of being able to go to school, to work, to function in a meaningful, personally satisfying way, and to be involved in relationships. Probably a majority of these got married and had families. Sometimes their functioning was a bit awkward but they still functioned. For example, a young man who had been psychotic might date or marry the quiet, shy girl rather than the girl who was the life of the party. But they could still have a meaningful intimate relationship and become good parents. So yes, for most people diagnosed with schizophrenia, if they get effective help they get better. They go out into the world and function, and most often they don’t become severely psychotic again. In the early part of the work, what happens a lot of times is that as a psychotic person starts to function better, the voices reoccur; but they’re not as disturbing anymore, they’re okay. Later on, if the person more fully works through their issues, these symptoms can completely or mostly go away. Or they still occur but don’t bother the person much at all, because they’re much stronger emotionally.\" And then we discussed many other issues like the biogenetic model, how to understand hallucinations as meaningful phenomena, some trauma in Lloyd's own history, Lloyd's views on NAMI and the business of psychiatry (may be controversial). etc. I hope you will check it out.", "hash": "5773c697ad710879ca302a163027bc123c276728a4b6a85e78cc6a5b98b120c1"}

I thought that they could all be classified under Schizophrenia. What I'd like to know is if there is some way of identifying, some way of testing someone in some casual conversation to find out if they have a major psychotic problem. Like example if I said, what would you do or think or feel about such and such a thing. The idea being, can I find some general loose connection in her circuits. The purpose of which would be to help her cure her problem or prove to her that she has a weakness and should go see someone. Here are the circumstances. My friend seems so absolutely normal in so many ways. She has many problems in her life and seems to be busy solving them, though in a different manner than I would, but she does solve her problems. At the same time, she strongly advocates conspiracy theories, that she is being monitored, that she has devices planted in her and that the government is harboring aliens from another world, that so much of everything is psychic and numerous other types of thoughts of what appear to me to be competely delusional. And she could tell I'm skeptical and asks me why I don't believe her. The thing is that so much of her seems absoutely normal and then there's a part of her that seems completely psychotic. If anyone here met her, the first impression would be that this is a wonderful woman etc. but when she starts going into all this crazy stuff then you'd think different. It's no use getting her to see someone because she is tremendously proud and strongly arrogant in what she believes and even finds it an insult that I question her beliefs in these things. Then to prove that she is right, she goes to Youtube and shows me the lying conspiracy assholes who put up nothing but false information. I constantly tell her that such broadcasters never give true facts but take only circumstantial facts and incorrectly draw them together in wrong conclusions. These Youtubers also have no one to answer to for the truth of their facts. At least the standard media have bosses to answer to and other media organizations to answer to when they are wrong and will be publicly humiliated or fired if so proven. Well, she doesn't really get it and says that she won't believe a word of what the standard media says. In the old days, people used to call this type of normal and abnormal behavior monomania where you could seem so normal and wonderful on one side and totally psychotic on another side. Later on psychologists and psychiatrists realized that if these types of people were further tested you would find out inadequacies across the board and the term monomania was stopped and I guess Schizophrenia or other names were used. So is there some way that by casual conversation I can do a litmus test and get to the root of her disorder to find out what circuits are loose for the purpose of helping her or getting her to see someone.", "hash": "62c9b23ab010a9f96439f95dcf500f6418d9b0181149f9d7d900adfb1020e2a5"}

We were supposed to get married but deep down for me, that is now out of the question. I have been reading some about these problems. During the Gold Rush, a lot of people were coming down with mental illness and there were many reports that it was due to the fact that life just didn't work out for a lot of people - that they became very poor and could barely survive and that's what cause the problem. It could be that these observations were correct but that it was a deeper cause than just financial ruin, it was caused by a tremendous amount of stress and that some people treat stress one way and other people deal with it another way meaning that they go crazy if they are severely stressed out. During the gold rush this seemed to be particularly so for those people who people had accumulated great wealth with gold stocks or otherwise which made them millionaires only then to lose every dime of it when the stocks dropped or their business went down the drain.", "hash": "61b0efb3096be6737c0d4bd3f3859c509d1db52fe9207e31673b9eb05e539a8e"}

It started off with me thinking that someone was going into my office after I left work (could be partially true, people were cleaning the office), and that my emails were hacked and that no Internet connection was secure. I was becoming aggressive because of these thoughts, and was eventually told my contract would not be renewed. After that I strongly believed that I was never laid off, that there was disagreement among management, and to salvage my job and refrain from getting hurt (my family as well), I had to send ideas for articles to a local tabloid. It’s worthwhile to mention that my job had to do with the media, and while on the job I was requested to deal with this tabloid, but I refused to because I did not think they were credible. I also believed there was a secret language associated with those who work in the media. I eventually landed a second job but two months later was told I did not pass my probation period. The delusions made me refuse instructions because I thought my manager then was out to get me as well. My family was able to talk me into seeing a therapist. He initially prescribed 2.5 mg of respirdal, down to 1.5 mg now. He never gave me a definitive diagnosis but said I had paranoid thoughts. I’m seeing another therapist now who says she thinks it is delusional disorder. I’m concerned I might be schizophrenic and that this is just where my woes begin. The first therapist I saw said he \"knew\" I wasn't schizophrenic. This is such a concern with me that my therapist now says I’m slipping into secondary depression. It’s also worthwhile to mention that, as of late, I’ve been having sleep-related hallucinations. I heard a door slam, voices saying various things, a doorbell ringing, and other mainly auditory encounters, all upon waking up or right before falling asleep, which scares me even more. Does anyone have insight as to wether this could be the onset of schizophrenia?

One time I saw it was a postal van driving behind me, and I thought: good, i don't think the postman wants his van damaged if he runs over me because it will be bad for his employment. I kept thinking drivers don't like the way I walk, too slow, too fast and are intent on running over me. If I walked over a hole in the ground, I thought someone dug it especially for me so that I will fall into it. I thought someone didn't like me walking there and dug the hole so I get injured and no longer walk there. These delusions stemmed from growing up with a very punishing mother. She hurt me again and again, so I couldn't trust anyone. Doing better now, following ongoing therapy and post therapy healing.

This is so hard. I am not even sure were to begin. A little over a year ago he started taking about aliens. Eventually they were everywhere. The he beleived that buzzards were following him then turning into spaceships. None of it was dangerous. About 3 weeks ago his demeanor changed. He started focusing on my computer devices. Started asking me a bunch of questions. Started trying to opening up emails from other programs and of course they would not open. I could show him the time stamped email from the correct email servers and he told me tat I was hiding something. All last weekend I tried everything to answer andwak through all of his questions. Then he started getting violent. To the point that sunday we spent our first night apart in over three decadeds. I asked for him to find some help but he insists there is nothing wrong. So I was forced to make the most difficult choice. I followed the proper steps and had him assessed. They agreed that he needed further tests. And OMG he hates me. So. I guess my question here is. When or if he returns home, will he remember all of theses accusations and slip back to that person? Or will he just not remember why I sent him away.

Not many people understand the true depths and insidious darkness, unbelievable reality and details of the condition.

I have some thoughts that always bother me. Maybe they’re delusions…but I can't seem to tell the difference. The thoughts make my 'life' sort of difficult. I feel everything is the same. I feel like I'm the only different one and everyone around me is the same. I feel like I can't tell my own emotions, thoughts, opinions, feelings, because I don't believe they're real. I don't believe I'm a person. I don't believe I exist as a person. I believe I'm just like a ghost. No one understands me.

If someone says “Oh I like books too” I think, no, it’s not the same, it’s different for me. It’s always different. I alienate myself in every possible way. I don't have friends. I've never had friends. I think it's a problem but, again, I can't really tell the difference between what's a problem and what's not. Because I'm not a person. I have no desire for relationships. I think something’s wrong with me to not want to do anything productive in life or form relationships with anyone.

I feel like crying because my mind is a mess, and I feel like I believe in stuff just because I can. I think, \"If ‘I’ believe in it, why can't it be true?\" I believe I can talk to God in my mind and God can talk back...so why can't it be true? I can't even comprehend how it cannot be true.

I have been following this inner knowing for a long while now. It's like a narrative that I create and that I am created by that doesn't feel entirely me. Sometimes it feels like God. Sometimes it feels like it's just my own spinning thoughts. But I have encountered some spooky stuff that coincides with things/places/events in life. It seems so perfectly synchronous to be just me though. I feel like I'm supposed to learn something or realize something. I know that, too, I find myself alienated. I think I do this intentionally because I'm somewhat consumed by this feeling and I'm unable to relate to others. Also, the narrative is not as straightforward as it is when I'm alone. I haven't a clue with what to do about it, whether it will go away, or even if I want it to. I've been on antipsychotics and recently had a terrible episode trying to quit on my own. I don't advise trying to quit, but If you can talk with your doc about finding something that helps you coexist with this and remain at least somewhat content/functional maybe that's good. In any case, I agree with Atina. When you listen to that inner knowing it can begin to feel like an echo and personally I find that when I have been able to speak to someone (therapist), it has helped clear the air like starting a new paragraph. Even speaking on the most basic of terms regarding some of the challenges you encounter (even if it doesn't exactly explicitly address your experience as a whole), it can help to move on.

Considering that my grandfather was schizohrenic, and I have many anxiety problems. I think it may have started when I was 12 going on 13, and I read the whole Twilight series in just a few weeks. I was totally obsessed, and addicted, as I am with so many other romance shows and books. Anyway, I found myself totally believing in vampires. I believed in them so much that I'd go at the end of my dad's ex's garden at night, facing the woods, and start talking to \"them\". I wanted to become one, I made loads of research trying to prove their existence, even had a website aha, and I'd always also feel like there'd be one reading my mind etc. Anyway, that lasted for like 2 years. I also have these sort of \"delusions\"/beliefs, probably started around the same year, in which people are into me. Happens EVERYDAY day, with DOZENS of people (strangers). I'm honestly not narcissistic or anything, it's more like my brain is trying to make me feel more confident, and also trying to ease this sort of \"addiction\" I have. Cause also when someone actually does like me I don't enjoy it all. But I can't stop those thoughts, they make me totally obsessed and anxious and paranoid. I usually KNOW it's not true, but I still believe it 100%. It's kind of hard to explain. Anyway, here's an example of what happens : I'll hop in the bus, already thinking about it as I always do when I'm out, then I'll notice out of the corner of my eye some person that MIGHT be looking at me, and then my brain will straight away tell me \"they like you\". The rational side of me tells me \"this is stupid\", but I still TOTALLY believe it. If I see the person again I will obsess over them. I've even stalked people. Anyway I feel sooo weird and I can't find what's wrong with me. And I HAVE talked to therapists about it, even though it makes me really embarrassed.

In fact, I don't care about her, she have always accused me for being lazy and things like that, because I can't work any more. She had a son which suffered from schizophrenia, and before she met my dad, he committed suicide. But I think her divorcing depends on beginning Alzheimers... I have noticed how oblivious she is. For example, we use to go to theatre, and in the afternoon, she ask when the theatre begins for about 10 times... I've seen people get ill in Alzheimers, my grandma. My poor grandpa wanted to have her home at long that it is was possible. But in the last years she went on a nursing home. She didn't take a note when my grandpa, her husband, died. She didn't recognised my father or me. And the little she talked was on German. They came from Germany. But I care about my dad! He had agreed to the divorcing, but I think my stepmother is becoming very ill... For now, she accuse my dad to take over her money-account. In fact, it is my dad who pays all the bills and other costs. He owns 75% of their flat, and 50% of their company. But I still wonder what is going to happen to her... I guess she is going to move to an apartment and only have contact with her daughter. But I think she can't take care of her self for a longer time.

Everything under control. In an unusual new situation. I'm an adult only-child of elderly parents. My parents had me late. My extended family is pushing me and my parents to appoint a legal guardian for them due to poor/incomplete estate planning and the health of my parents. This is a legal issue not a medical issue but ....I need to stay sane and I don't know whom I can talk to besides my dr. I have a lot on the ball and if I succumb to this .... As an aside I may need to appoint a lawyer to represent ME now. I was always taught not to trust people especially where money is concerned. And therefore I am hampered in talking about it to people and am concerned about beginning a vicious cycle of isolation..And concerned the extended family coming after me after they would try to declare my parents incapacitated, which is how I discovered on my own the guardianship proceedings work. I don't even think I should post but I'm starting to break.. I have a lot of potential and my extended family is selling it to me like I can either try to take care of my parents for the rest of my life or I can make something of myself. I dropped out of med school because my dad got Alzheimer's (this is within the last 5 yrs) and some other of my own issues. I have a very important interview coming up for a new career that is very important to me and now caring for them has come to the fore-- and you better believe I'm looking out for my self-interest. My brilliant father always took care of everything and where finances were concerned for my mother, he made a lot of money but was not a planner. My mom is not the brightest. Admittedly I have persuaded my family to give me lump sums of money many times it's not cute but its reality, so I believe there is some sentiment with my extended family that I am not trustworthy. I got my extended family to get off my back until at least the New Year. I promised for my part I would get an asset inventory and get information from money manager like MS, Vanguard, etc because I believe before a legal representative is even considered parents should manage their money better. (Asset inventory was my idea based on my previous dealings with lawyers for my parents) The extended family wants to convince my parents to get an independent legal guardianship. They came down to visit them on the auspice of taking care of my mother during what should have been a routine cataract surgery but due to her senility and mostly her personality it was a mess. I first stormed out on them. They brought it up again and I was really raw due to caring for my mother so I must have agreed I would consider it. Sister is wealthy and she paid for some in-home care over the weekend until my interview. She was already asking to speak to my doctor and I won't allow. I have not left my parents yet since mother's surgery but I am not proud of this, I blocked my mother's sisters phone number on her phone because what I am reading about legal representative for seniors scares me. >In most cases the process will start with a determination whether the alleged incapacitated person is actually incapacitated. There will often be an evidentiary hearing and determination of whether guardian is necessary and who guardian would be. >in some cases a guardianship dispute could become quite contentious....essentially a pre-probate dispute over parents' wealth. My mother's personality at this point is really also that she wishes someone would run her life. I am currently Executor to parents' estate but as mentioned estate planning is really slim for them. I'm in a catch-22 because rather than keep outplaying money to me my family may only be convinced to set up a trust, for example, if I use extended family as a mediator, but they are also being sneaky about their intentions and I would have to accept their \"help\" of \"get a legal guardian for them\". One relative involved probated a distant cousin's will for their money. So I guess to continue along this line of rational? thought, first they will want to say my parents are incapacitated and next they come after me!? Also why should my parents assets be any of their business, but also since my parents have few contacts and trust few people it's their \"worst best hope\". I rarely belly ache woe is me life's not fair anymore. (I used to runaway a lot as a teen) At some point I believe you quit blaming your parents and live your life. But it seems like every time I try to make a foray at something they are in crisis and I have to help, see lawyers, accountants, estate planners for them and it messes me up. I'm still young. Lately I've taken to buying things to cope. I don't know what to do it's not a medical issue, it's legal but if I can't get a handle on myself and I succumb to this I'm worse off I just kind of want to avoid this and wish it weren't happening.....", "hash": "13b121836aa524dc87070153542ae43e0954ddff140bc3fac3d187ae6db5554b"}

He used to drink a lot of alcohol, maybe that has something to do with it. No, this is seen with many, many disorders, from OCD to schizophrenia and many more. Just from this one thing, there is no way to decide what condition your brother has. We had a young man with schizophrenia in our house for many months who did this - when he got on medication he stopped. But it can be caused by many other conditions, too. If he has been drinking VERY heavily, he may have damaged his brain and that may be permanent, and that can cause symptoms like dementia and also Korsakoff's Syndrome - almost immediately, forgetting what just happened, or making up stories about what happened - the stories ramble and don't make complete sense. Alcohol alone can damage the brain. This can happen due to drinking every day, or even, from 'binge drinking' once a week or once every few weeks. Many people think 'binge drinking' is not harmful - that is wrong. It does incredible harm. Sometimes, if the person is young, vitamin supplements can help reverse some of the damage of alcohol. But this must be started so quickly and the drinking stopped immediately. Alcohol blocks some vitamins from being absorbed. This can actually kill a person. Many people drink alcohol BECAUSE they have a mental illness. so your brother could have mental illness. The alcohol use then, when it happens with mental illness, is called 'Self Medicating'(it is of course, also alcoholism, because they can not stop or control their drinking). Instead of getting proper treatment from a psychiatrist, many, many people do this. About 50% of schizophrenics have an alcohol or drug problem, and generally, it is because they are 'Self Medicating' - trying to deal with the symptoms of mental illness. It makes them feel a little better for a few minutes, kind of numbs a person to the symptoms, so it becomes a habit. And it causes incredible damage. When a person with mental illness drinks alcohol, they do a lot of damage to an already fragile brain tissue. Not a good mix. I would try to guess what is wrong, based on your brother's age (over 65-70, dementia more possible, 17-25 and this is just starting, schizophrenia is possible), years of drinking (many years, alcoholic dementia possible), but many older people have alcohol brain damage AND dementia AND mental illness. It is a matter for a doctor. Unfortunately, many of these people refuse to get any help. In most cases, you have no legal ability to force them to accept help. Contact your local Adult Protective Services and if he is older, county geriatric services. See what can be done. Sometimes you can get them to accept help by kind of 'baby stepping' them towards it and moving gradually.", "hash": "510edbfe773b635aa8e35638a85d0c0db94348e4d937b59813dfdb3945ffda8f"}

Experts believe that biomarkers (short for \"biological markers\") offer one of the most promising paths. Biomarkers are reliable predictors and indicators of a disease process. They include proteins in blood or spinal fluid, genetic variations (mutations) or brain changes detectable by imaging. Sign up for our weekly e-news and stay up-to-date on the latest advances in Alzheimer's diagnosis, treatments, care and research. Neuroimaging is among the most promising areas of research focused on early detection. Today, a standard workup for Alzheimer's disease often includes structural imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). These tests are currently used chiefly to rule out other conditions that may cause symptoms similar to Alzheimer's but require different treatment. Structural imaging can reveal tumors, evidence of small or large strokes, damage from severe head trauma or a buildup of fluid in the brain. Preliminary research suggests that emerging imaging technologies and new applications of current technology may be able to detect hallmark changes associated with Alzheimer's disease in the brains of living individuals. If further research confirms the potential value of brain imaging, its use may one day be expanded to play a more direct role in diagnosing Alzheimer's and in earlier detection of the disease. Imaging technologies used in Alzheimer's research Structural imaging provides information about the shape, position or volume of brain tissue. Structural techniques include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Functional imaging reveals how well cells in various brain regions are working by showing how actively the cells use sugar or oxygen. Functional techniques include positron emission tomography (PET) and functional MRI (fMRI). Molecular imaging uses highly targeted radiotracers to detect cellular or chemical changes linked to specific diseases. Molecular imaging technologies include PET, fMRI and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Structural imaging studies have shown that the brains of people with Alzheimer's shrink significantly as the disease progresses. Research has also shown that shrinkage in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus may be an early sign of Alzheimer's. However, scientists have not yet agreed upon standardized values for brain volume that would establish the significance of a specific amount of shrinkage for any individual person at a single point in time. Functional imaging research with positron emission tomography (PET) and other methods suggests that those with Alzheimer's typically have reduced brain cell activity in certain regions. For example, studies with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET indicate that Alzheimer's disease is often associated with reduced use of glucose (sugar) in brain areas important in memory, learning and problem solving. However, as with the shrinkage detected by structural imaging, there is not yet enough information to translate these general patterns of reduced activity into diagnostic information about individuals. Molecular imaging technologies are among the most active areas of research aimed at finding new approaches to diagnose Alzheimer's in its earliest stages. Molecular strategies may detect biological clues indicating Alzheimer's is under way before the disease changes the brain's structure or function, or takes an irreversible toll on memory, thinking and reasoning. Molecular imaging also may offer a new strategy to monitor disease progression and assess the effectiveness of next-generation, disease-modifying treatments. Molecular imaging compounds currently used in Alzheimer research include: Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) was the first radiotracer capable of highlighting deposits of beta-amyloid—one pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease—in living individuals during a PET scan. The Alzheimer's Association helped fund early PIB development. The Association in 2006 also awarded a $2.1 million grant to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to expand this long-term, nationwide study to include PIB-PET imaging. 18F flutemetamol (flute), another radiotracer that highlights beta-amyloid in a PET scan, is structurally identical to PIB except for one fluorine atom in place of a carbon atom. That small chemical change enables flutemetamol to remain stable significantly longer than does PIB, potentially increasing its usefulness outside research settings. In phase II study results reported in the Annals of Neurology, flutemetamol performed similarly to PIB. Additional testing is under way. Florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45) is also a radiotracer that highlights brain beta-amyloid during a PET scan. At the 2010 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (AAICAD), florbetapir's developer first reported data, later published in the JAMA, showing nearly perfect correlation between brain amyloid levels detected by florbetapir PET scans in study volunteers and levels found in autopsies of the same individuals a few months later. The developer has sought Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market florbetapir under the brand name Amyvid. The FDA has said it will withhold approval until the developer establishes a professional training program to ensure accuracy and consistency in reading and interpreting Amyvid scans. Florbetaben (BAY 94-9172) is another radiotracer designed to detect beta-amyloid during a PET scan. Phase II study results and other florbetaben data were reported at the 2010 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (AAICAD). Phase II data were also later published in Lancet Neurology. Further studies are now under way. I really enjoyed this article, I hope you like it as well.

Generally, if you want to stay close to USA, it is good to go to Costa Rica, where most americans usually retire without many problems. At 1500 a month, you can live off good over there. If you want a cheaper alternative, go to Nicaragua, but it is not as safe. Now regarding alzheimers, people make it sound like they got it and that there is nothing else they can do. To the poster who lives in texas, I am near houston, and we can exchange information if you want to know more about dealing with alzheimers. If you want to know, alzheimers usually occurs after a prolonged period of neglect. Great ways to fight this endemic problem, is through dieting, exercising, supplementing, and mind-body exercises. These alternatives are relatively cheap, and require trivial investment. Oftentimes, people look for the hard way to solve their problems, which is often the \"norm.\" PM if interested", "hash": "9f5d464d6a4c520d220efdac4c24bb3baeed9defad311935bba8d1f3cd8d09eb"}

Best way to know for sure is to have your mom see a Neurologist or Psychiatrist, in order to get a diagnosis. Diagnosing Alzheimer's is done by ruling out all other possible causes and a complete brain scan (MRI or CT scan) is needed for diagnosis. Often times other factors can cause similar symptoms to Alzheimer's (Even vitamin deficiencies!) and early onset Alzheimer's (Which occurs before age 65) is not as common, overall.

Growing up, my mother went through a divorce, and she latched onto me as the older daughter. Then when I got married; she found someone and got married, and suddenly I didn't exist. She became so latched onto her husband that every sentence began with \"Bob and I.\" I couldn't even sit near her without her sitting and holding his hand. She decided to move from Connecticut to Florida with him, because he had 5 kids, and she didn't want to deal with them. When she moved 2000 miles away, I was heartbroken; but she told me I would get over it. She missed all the years of my son (her grandson) growing up, and when she did visit, all she cared about was being with her husband, and going back to Florida. Her husband died at age 79, and the day he died, she latched onto my single sister, Sarah and moved back up to Connecticut to live with Sarah for five years. My mother never went back to her home in Florida She started to use phrases like \"Sarah and I.\" She was extremely despondent and lost lots of weight. Finally, my sister couldn't take it anymore. My mother was losing her mind. Long, story short, we had to finally place her in a dementia unit; this time closer to my house. This place is gorgeous. It is like a 5 star hotel, with excellent food, activities all day, maid service, bus trips. It is bright and clean, and yet all my mother does is keep packing to go home with SARAH. She calls SARAH night and day. They finally had to take the key from my mother, because she tripped over her own things that she packed by the door, and knocked herself out, and landed in the hospital (another day of hysteria). She threatened to put a bullet in her head, and she landed in the hospital psych ward. The psychologists are trying to get her on some type of anti-anxiety andepressant medications. She pegged her whole life on her husband, and when he deceased, she glued herself to my sister, and my sister burnt out. I visit at least twice a week, and every weekend we go out for a ride and ice cream. Now my mother wants me to sleep over with her in a semi-private room in the dementia ward. Sometimes, she forgets it is me and calls me Sarah. She is angry, because she said she came up North to be with her kids, and noone cares, so she threatens to go back to Florida. She can't go anywhere, because she is now 82 and has moderate to severe dementia. They don't know if it is Alzheimers, but it is really bad. The guilt I feel is enormous, because she is so unhappy. don't know how much longer I will have her, and I want to enjoy our time together.", "hash": "2f33ccf1ef8ef837b09ea259132f15f22ce50410694b83482e349e0ab1d4c1f8"}

My grandma had it, and she lived with us. Over the course of about 7-10 years it kept getting worse. At the end, she was mute and bedridden. Before she got so bad she used to argue with me and my parents about everything. She despised me though, since I lived in the room right across from her. She told me I was stealing from her, when later the stuff was found in her closet and she denied it being there. It's very difficult to work with an alzheimer's person, especially when they're not on medication for it. My grandma would throw away her medications. Mum and I found them in the trash. Right before she died she was in a nursing home. Then one night at about 2am they called telling us that her lips were turning blue and a lot of other things - and they asked what to do about it. Mum said \"get her to the ER now!\". We got there soon after. She was in horrible shape. I cried for her. Mum went to work at about 7am while they were still waiting for a \"room\" to put grandma in. Dad and I left too. Then mum gets a call at work saying that grandma died. She died in ER waiting for a room. She had many illnesses, but what I heard about how she died was that her lungs filled up with phlem because she didn't know to cough. When my great aunt died, she went downhill FAST. Once while she was still able to get up, she ran away and her son had to go find her. She would also smoke cigarettes and when she was done she'd throw them in the trashcan, not the ashtray. What got her down was falling down the steps and breaking her hip. From then on, she was bedridden too. When we went to see her, the doctor said she was brain dead and would go anytime. When my cousin got the call that his mum died, he cried, balling! I'm so glad he got it out. I'm glad we were there for him. He almost passed out a few times. I cried with him and hugged him and told him that it will soon pass and be easier on the mind. (I recently lost a dog, so I know how bad it feels to lose something or someone you love). Please know this - when a loved one gets alzheimers, they need the love and support more than ever. I wish there was a cure for alzheimer's. Well I hope I've helped someone by my story. I know it's a sad thing to go through with a loved one, but remember when they die that they're not suffering anymore, especially if they know the Lord. Take care guys, Rock Of Ages \"Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it\" (Luke 18:17)", "hash": "5134c7525c1ca3334f9bd57d4fad48e046dad6d8c480929514bc5552abcb6105"}

Age: The risk of developing Alzheimer’s increases with age. One out of every 10 persons 65 years and older is a victim of Alzheimer's disease, although early-onset victims may be in their 40s and 50s. Approximately 20 percent of Americans between the ages of 75 and 84, and almost half of those 85 years and older suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Genetics: Early-onset Alzheimer's has been clearly shown to be genetic in origin. While mutations on chromosomes 9 and 19 have been linked with late-onset Alzheimer's (the most common form), not everyone with the mutations develops the disease. The relationship between genetics and late-onset Alzheimer's is not fully known. Other: Some studies have implicated prior traumatic head injury, lower education level, and female gender as possible risk factors.

Schedule wisely. Establish a routine to make each day more predictable and less confusing. Schedule the most difficult tasks, such as bathing or medical appointments, for the time of day when your loved one tends to be most calm and agreeable. Take your time. Expect things to take longer than they used to. Schedule more time to complete even simple tasks so that you don't need to hurry your loved one. Involve your loved one. Allow your loved one to do as much as possible with the least amount of assistance. For example, perhaps your loved one can dress alone if you lay out the clothes in the order they go on. Limit choices. The fewer the options, the easier it is to decide. For example, provide two outfits to choose between — not a closet full of clothes. Provide simple instructions. When you ask your loved one to do something, do it one step at a time. Reduce distractions. Turn off the TV and minimize other distractions at mealtime and during conversations so that your loved one can better focus on the task at hand.

Stem cells are cells with the potential to develop different types of cells in the body. They are characterized by the ability to renew themselves through mitotic cell division and differentiating into a diverse range of specialized cell types. Studying stem cells may help explain how serious conditions such as cancer appear. There are types of stem cells determined by their functional capabilities. Totipotent stem cells, meaning their potential is total, have the capacity to give rise to every cell type of the body and to form an entire organism. Pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells, are capable of generating virtually all cell types of the body but are unable to form a functioning organism. Multipotent stem cells can give rise only to a limited number of cell types. For example, adult stem cells, also called organ- or tissue-specific stem cells, are multipotent stem cells found in specialized organs and tissues after birth. Their primary function is to replenish cells lost from normal turnover or disease in the specific organs and tissues in which they are found. Stem cells have amazing promise as a medical treatment, but there are still huge obstacles to overcome. It may fulfill this promise but it always needs lot efforts to gain possible real results.", "hash": "c2354102f6a8d2f4bf9c7c5c3c92758021101e432794388f03e9482f8b5ac189"}

I would not jump on this anti-inflammtory bandwaggon immediately, eventhough the movies there look very much scientific and are convincing. I also made a seach on \"anti-inflammatory theorie Pat McGeer\" and there is lots of information coming up with tons of scientific reports and testing. Also Wikipedia has Pat McGeer listed as the father of anti-inflammatory alzheimer scientist - so I guess these things about the product OCW are true.

So, whilst it might not be an hallucination per se , it is a pseudo-hallucnation in that it's a number of different memories being joined into one, and that makes it seem weird. Think of it as a dream, where many different memories are brought together. Kevin", "hash": "22fbc82a1552a816963073ac4d872ca7d39f30506dca1a503cecbcf04e78f0a1"}

He had a couple of traumatic events in his childhood and has very low emotional/social intelligence. He takes meds for ADD and depression. A year or so ago, he became obsessed with the idea that he had Alzheimer's. He finally went to a mental health professional (whom he had had no previous interaction with) who talked with him for an hour and said \"Yeah, maybe you have the beginnings of Alzheimer's.\" and gave him scrip for a couple of meds, including Aricept. I scheduled a complete physical with another physician who referred my husband to a doctor who specializes in cognitive problems. He gave my husband a battery of tests and, after evalutating the results, said that he had a terrible memory but that the tests did not show Alzheimers. However, the tests are not always conclusive and my husband thought the Aricept might be helping his memory so the doc indicated he could continue to take it. As a result, I cannot get long term care insurance for my husband - but that is another long, sad story. Anyway, my husband continues to believe that he has Alzheimer's. He is obsessed with it - and I fear that it is a self-fulfilling loop. All of the \"symptoms\" he exhibits are of long standing but he now interprets behaviors he has engaged in for 30 years or more as evidence that he is has Alzherimer's. Adding fuel to the fire is the fact that he has long eaten a very unusual diet, which he believes to be healthy and he is addicted to supplements. He reads selectively and believes anything that fits his paradigm. I have always been the bread winner - he has never contributed to our support. I am now working about half time but instead of bringing me stress relief, the reduced hours mean more time with my husband and I am going stark raving mad.

I am only 26 but I believe that older people are much more set in their ways than younger people, and therefore it might be tough to get him out of this way of thinking. If you perhaps present him with an official list of symptoms of Alzhimer's, then maybe he will notice that he doesn't have it.

The owners talked me into getting him his own, saying they would help him with it, maybe he could get emails from grandkids, etc. I gave it to him for his birthday. He got obsessed with it, insisted on trying to carry it around (he uses a walker, so that was dangerous) and refused to be helped, insisting he could learn to use it, lots of cussing & frustration. It turned into a big hassle & eventually I took it home with me, hoping he would forget about it. It has been several months, he's living in a new care home, but every time I see him he asks for his \"typewriter\". He wants to write letters (old friends write him letters occassionally). He does not have the dexterity to use the lap top, or ability to write a coherent letter (last letter he wrote was a couple years ago & it was complete nonsense). I have told him the lap top was too difficult for him & I fear if I brought it to him, he would react in the same obsessive, angry way he did before. But every time I see him he asks, now more like insists, I bring him the lap top, essentially accusing me of stealing it from him. I find myself avoiding visiting him, because it just turns into him begging for the \"typewriter\", and me, again, telling him it is too difficult for him. I've offered to take dictation from him and write any letters myself, but he refuses and just gets angry with me. I am at my wits end about this.

I introduced myself in the 'intro' topic. I am the 34 year old granddaughter of an 89 year old woman with Alzheimer's. She is my Mum's Mum, and she now lives in a nursing home which specialises in Alzheimer's. I'm writing this on behalf of my Mum really, as she would like to know more about other people's experiences, but she doesn't want to be a burden and she's not confident enough with computers to be able to use this forum. Granny was in sheltered housing, with a flat to herself and a warden. This was about 5 years ago. She was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's after she lost the following: Ability to tell the time. Ability to recognise the values of coins and notes. Became forgetful (would leave the stove on, etc), and confused about things. Began to wander around town at night, until she was found by a good-natured member of the public or a police officer. Regualrly insisted that people/neighbours were coming into her house and stealing/moving things around. She would have arguments with the neighbours, accusing them of all sorts of things. Mum and Dad tried to take her on holiday, the journey was taken by car with frequent stops. Dad had a sattelite nav system in the car, which was switched on. At the end of the journey (a few hundred miles) Granny leapt out of the car and ran away accross the road, in a distressed state. She had got the idea into her head that the sattelite nav computer was controlling Dad (because it was telling him which way to go and he was obeying), and that he wasn't Dad any more but some imposter ('bad' Dad) who meant to harm her. She also thought that this 'bad' Dad had done away with 'good' Dad, and had convinced Mum to be with him instead of 'good' Dad. After Mum went after Granny and explained to her the real situation, Granny didn't believe her. She would not let Dad into the holiday cottage, so he had to wait down at the local pub until Mum phoned him to say that Granny was asleep and it was 'safe' to come back. In the morning Granny still believed in the 'bad' Dad, and would not accept food or drink from Mum or Dad, as she believed that they were trying to poison her. They had to cut the holiday short and bring her home again. They contacted the doctor immediately. After that, Granny was put into a residential assessment centre where she stayed for some months until the progression/level of her Alzheimer's was established, then a suitable place was found for her to recieve residential care. The care home is only 10 miles away from Mum and Dad, and Mum goes to see Granny every day. Nowadays Granny talks mostly nonsense, but she does have short periods of lucidity (ie: only a sentence or two at a time, 5 minutes on a good day). I live over the other side of the country to Mum and Dad, so I don't get to see them or Granny very often, but we are in telephone contact regularly. A couple of weeks ago I went to visit her with my Mum and my sister, who brought her baby along to meet Granny. That went well - in amongst the nonsense Granny understood that this was her great-granddaughter. She was very proud and pleased to have her family around her, she was able to hold the baby for 10 minutes with no problems. Baby needed a feed, and my sister and Mum left the room. I said I would catch them up, and stayed talking with Granny for a little longer. She seemed to be more lucid with me than with the other members of the family - we spoke about Grandad (who had died when I was 17), who she has not mentioned for years and years to anyone else - Mum had thought that she had forgotten about him! But then Mum called me to leave - I didn't really want to as Granny seemed to be having a good time with me, but I had to go - Mum can't spend too long with Granny as it upsets her and she finds it very stressful to see her mother deteriorate as time goes by. Mum has manic depression, and has been told by her doctor that she would not be able to look after Granny, which is why she can't spend so much time with her. I wish that I lived nearer so that I could visit Granny more often, but money and time are short (I work in the community support area, which means low wages and long hours). I speak to Granny on the phone, but she is rather deaf, and refuses to wear a hearing aid, so I know that she doesn't hear much of what I say, even when I raise my voice. Sorry about this, I'm rambling - here come my questions soon.... 7 days ago Granny fell over in her room while Mum was visiting. An ambulance was called, and luckily Granny had not broken anything. After Mum and the ambulance left Granny fell again, this time she broke her hip. She was on the floor for 30 mins before staff found her (luckily, as if it had been a different time of day she could have been lying on the floor all night!). She went straight to hospital and her hip was pinned. The doctors' plan is to give her physiotherapy to get her back on her feet, and then she can go back to the nursing home. The trouble is, Granny is not sure where she is in hospital. Since the operation she has had no lucid moments at all, and is increasingly confused. She is very suspicious and thinks that people are trying to poison her again. So, she is refusing all food, drink, and medications. She has another urinary infection (she has always been reluctant to drink for fear of wetting herself, so she gets loads of these infections, which don't do her mind any good) because she will not drink. Doctors did put a drip in her arm, but she kept pulling it out, so they won't put another one in. She also tries to pull out her catheter. She has become violent with doctors and nursing staff, trying to bite and hit them. I'm very glad that she was able to see her great-granddaughter before she broke her hip and took a turn for the worse. I am wondering if there has been anyone else who has had similar experiences of: Being told by doctors that you can't look after your loved one because you have a mental illness. Alzheimer's patients taking a turn for the worse since being under anaesthetic for a major operation. I think that's about it really, thanks for reading. sorry it was so long, but it all sort of flooded out!", "hash": "5bd6c86612961ea6031e139df189c19e45db4f481a2f092bef3e0a73408d5c2f"}

I just wanted to metion a couple of medications that are not yet approved in the US for use, but that seem to help. They can be obtained with the help of a sympathetic doctor. One is called clioquinol. It is an old drug that was banned 30 years ago because of side effects, but it seems to be safe if used in moderation. It seems to redude the amount of plaque in the brain by flushing out some of the copper and zinc that is in the plaques since it is a chealating agent. It is still used in African counties as a traetment for ameobic dissentary. I found a compounding pharnacist who was able to get some from a US company. There is a nerve growth factor called cerebrolysin whcih seemed to help my father also. I had it shipped from Austria. The big problem with it is that it needs to injected intravenously five days a week for a month. It has been used in Germany for years and it known to be a safe medication.", "hash": "939ab1ad45966f2cbc22fce67ca13257b17ece74824118b37f89bac22466ee84"}
