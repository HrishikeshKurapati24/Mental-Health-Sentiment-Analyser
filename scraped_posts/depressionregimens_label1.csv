1,1,"Pramipexole what seemed to be the best option for my treatment reseastant anhedonia was not the answer and trialed it for many months at multiple dosages going as high as 4.5mg. Now that I‚Äôve been off of it for a little while I‚Äôve completely lost any kind of reward related behavior, and I‚Äôm not talking about pleasure because I already didn‚Äôt feel any before but now I don‚Äôt have any kind of motivation or appetite or care for anything. I already lost interest and motivation in mostly everything in life before but the pramipexole has somehow made it worse. My theory is that obviously pramipexole wasn‚Äôt the right med for me in the beginning however I think it‚Äôs affects at the d2 pre synaptic auto receptors has completely eliminated any release of dopamine I had in my brain. What are some way to increase the release of dopamine itself rather than when it binds to like how pramipexole works. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated."

3,1,"Anticonvulsants gave me anhedonia... What does it mean? I kinda know why, but why can't I be happy + calm without wanting to end myself?  

Current stack:

Vortioxetine 20mg
Bupropion 150mg
Concerta 36mg
Brexpiprazole >0.5mg

New: Depakote (sodium divalproate) 500mg

This new med gave me anhedonia... But eased my anxiety... Just replaced one depression by another ü´©

Antipsychotics made me tired but somewhat worked tho... (Abilify made me tired but happy, brexpiprazole didn't do much, tired too, but somewhat worked).

Any implications? This will help me talk with my doctor."
4,1,"For a long time I used to rely on a heavy amount of caffeine and nicotine for my depression, social anxiety, apathy, avolition and anhedonia and it work very well for me until I developed tolerance to using them a lot and in excess. But they actually worked for it and didn't caused fatigue and emotional blunting like antidepressants do for me. No antidepressant has been able to relieve my apathy, avolition and anhedonia the way like caffeine or nicotine. The only antidepressant that has worked somewhat is Bupropion but I found that it raised my norepinephrine levels too much which caused irritability, agitation, edginess, dysphoria, excessive rumination  and other symptoms related to too much norepinephrine. That sheer overwhelming norepinephrine effect that you get from Bupropion compared to caffeine or nicotine is a huge drawback I think. SSRIS never did anything for me either and caused all my symptoms like apathy, avolition and anhedonia to get worse over time. SSRIS made me so numb and tired the whole time I was on them. Since I have failed several conventinal antidepressants, I have realized they're not for me and they don't do shit for my depression and other symptoms. Caffeine and nicotine though which I know are addictive are the only ones that did something. Is there any reason for why they worked better?"
5,1,"i suffer from depression and anxiety for 10 years i use antidepressants for short period of time then stopping it maybe like 3 months .

my biggest problem is the decline of my cognitive abilities i literally don't have a brain and unable to focus on anything even watching a movie or any simple activity.

i discovered that antidepressants decrease this anxiety which is causing me to be confused.

i also read that you can get your brain back if you use antidepressants for a long time at least 6 months or 12 months  so people with chronic depression who suffer from a subjective feeling of cognitive decline is this possible?

can i get my life back??"
6,1,"Like the title says how do you upregulate dopamine receptors after chronic use of a NDRI like Bupropion?  Since being on Bupropion for almost four years have caused it to lose some of its effectivness, I guess it has to do with receptor downregulation? Does receptor downregulation mean that I don't make as many dopamine receptors as I used to in the past? What's the reason for this mechanism to occur after using a NDRI? Is it because your body wants to be in a homeostasis? Is there any way to prevent this from happening or do we just have to accept it and change to a different med instead? If that's the case then I'm not ready to change my med since Bupropion has been the only one that used to work for me. It's quite depressing knowing that there isn't any other antidepressant like Bupropion out there and Bupropion is very unique on its own. Since SSRIS never have been any forwards for me because it probably wasn't a serotonin issue to begin with, it was likely a dopamine instead and Bupropion stopped working over time. I realize I might be doomed right now and my options seems to be very limited at this point. I knew this was going to happen one day with Bupropion since I've had this with other antidepressants in the past. But for some reason I managed to get almost four years from it which I consider to be a long run. It seems like I can't win after all and would need to change my antidepressant once again, which I'm not ready to do yet since I don't like the idea to switch to a SNRI instead."
7,1,"I took .125mg for a month, then .25mg for a month. Wasn‚Äôt feeling benefits unfortunately, except a strange impulse to buy & steal things? (I didnt actually steal anything though, my boyfriend got me through that) But then after 2 weeks on .375mg, I started feeling so motivated and energized, I felt wonderful and actually had the desire to listen to music and do art projects again like I used to. Unfortunately, after 1 week of that, side effects started to kick in and my motivation & energy decreased. I‚Äôve now been having weakness, dizziness, fatigue, and loss of appetite as well. I saw someone comment on another post that since it takes time for doses to kick in, what you‚Äôre feeling at any given time is in response to whatever dose you were taking about 2-3 weeks before. If this is true, then perhaps .25mg was the right dose for me, and I just needed to give it more time? I am wondering if I should just go back to that dose, since I wasn‚Äôt having these side effects and it seemed to be helping more. Does anyone have any thoughts? My psychiatrist doesn‚Äôt have a ton of experience with prescribing pramipexole so he isn‚Äôt any help unfortunately."

10,1,"So I‚Äôve been hacking away month by month with my psych for over a year. Slowly re-starting ADHD treatment after recovering from a Kratom addiction. Started at Vyvanse 30mg and went all the way to a combo of Adderall XR 30mg + Adderall IR 20mg where I started to feel better. But I was still struggling in a lot of ways. I could ‚Äúfocus‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt care to do anything or fix anything. In the beginning (way back in 2016) Adderall had that awesome antidepressant effect and euphoria so I thought I didn‚Äôt need depression treatment. That started the whole addiction process. 

Now when I take it, it‚Äôs immensely helpful for clearing my head and getting me out of bed, but that potent antidepressant effect is gone. I also take Celexa but I didn‚Äôt notice much. Literally less than a week ago I added Wellbutrin back in - a drug I was convinced was redundant and also interfered with my ‚Äúhigh‚Äù from adderall way back when‚Ä¶and it was clearly the missing piece. No amount of adderall gave me energy. Back on my dose of 400mg Wellbutrin SR for just a week and the change is absolutely palpable and works incredibly well. I have my energy and memories back. It‚Äôs crazy.

Just thought I‚Äôd share because a lot of people say not to take Wellbutrin and Adderall together. Just know your mileage may vary. "
11,1,"Has anyone tried a small dose of amisulpride with a dopamine agonist like pramipexole? Theoretically, this seems to be a synergistic combination, as a small dose of amisulpride blocks presynaptic dopamine receptors and increases dopamine transmission, thereby increasing D1 receptor stimulation. The dopamine agonist stimulates D2 and D3 receptors, thereby stimulating all dopamine receptors. Amisulpride is also supposed to block the effects of the dopamine agonist on presynaptic receptors, preventing them from being activated, as activation of presynaptic receptors reduces dopamine and also the dopamine agonist reduces the amisulpride-induced hyperprolactinemia. Has anyone tried this combination?"
12,1,"Its like the ultimate blackpill of mental health. Nothing really works for this condition. People will suggest stimulants and MAOIs but unless one is like a mild-moderate case of this, and the condition can get to pretty extreme depths, likely won‚Äôt respond and 

The worst is many doctors just have never seen this, and they also recommend therapy which is absolutely useless for the actual symptoms. The symptoms completely debilitate someone more than any other mental illness. Typical ‚Äúmebtal wellness‚Äù techniques fail to work, as they require feedbsck from sensory input which is the very thing broken. People often have horrible anxiety due to the symptoms and its impossible to distract since reward needed for distraction, so OCD techniques also fail. 

More and more people are getting this syndrome due to some reaction to a virus like covid, supp, or drug. In some cases just random. 

From extensive research and my own experience, the condition appears to be an issue with ANS communication, mitochondria, neuroinflammation, gut brain axis.

Then there are crashes from very small things, some of which have made people take their lives. 

There are links to things like CFS, POTS, MCAS,  insert nightmare illness acronym here. There is even a condition MCS (multiple chemical sensitivity) where one can crash into severe neuropsychiatric symptoms just from breathing some fragrance. 


**All of these illnesses also tend to be far more refractory and debilitating than the average mental illness**. They get gaslit as ‚Äúfunctional disorders‚Äù and get referred to CBT but CBT fails and some
people are like constant suicidal over their condition and no therapy is going to work in that state. No reward and cognitive deficits make it more hopeless. 

Wtf is going on? Clearly autonomic dysfunction is involved but dysautonomia has no cure. 

Often in these conditions, many meds just create more problems. Surprisingly in MCS the ultimate ECT was used in a severe case study and worked https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20827810/

16,1,"Hello everyone,

I would like to ask You for an opinion on increasing baseline dopamine by supplementary means.

I understand that caffeine itself can allow more of the dopamine to get into the receptor, but unfortunately it is not reliable tool in my own experience.

I would like to ask for opinion in using substances like L-Dopa in minimal amounts, to increase the baseline.

Is it safe if done in low dosage? Is there a risk, that chronic L-Dopa supplementation could potentially diminish the body natural dopamine synthesizing capability?"
17,1,"There are people like me who don't respond to reuptake inhibitors and we can't make our own serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine so well and would benefit from a releasing agent. Some releasing agents that I have used include Caffeine, Nicotine and Kanna etc and they worked for my depression and social anxiety very well and much better than any reuptake inhibitor I have taken before. No antidepressant has been able to improve my depression, social anxiety, apathy, avolition and anhedonia like releasing agents do. Reuptake inhibitors just don't work for me. I have tried both serotonin and norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitors and they gave me very little relief, if anything at all. So why can't we use releasing agents for people who are resistant to reuptake inhibitors? Is it because of addiction and abuse potential? Because I think the pros do outweigh the cons for people like me who don't respond to conventinal antidepressants. Is it really better to be actively suicidal or take something that could relieve depression but potentially have abuse potential? For some people like me only releasing agents provide some relief for our symptoms. I would really like to know why releasing agents aren't used for severe cases of depression?"

20,1,"I am a recovering alcoholic and former benzodiazepine (ab)user.

I wanted to share what has worked for me in terms of a regimen for depression and anxiety... This is not ""advice,"" but anecdotal info to stimulate discussion.  

Medications:

Baclofen and gabapentin:  these are now used in medical practices to curb alcohol cravings by decreasung the general free-floating anxiety that commonly leads to alcohol consumption.  Tolerance is a very real issue with both of these meds, and breaks of abstinence need to be observed. They are both good for mood and depression, but may be habit-forming.

Mirtazapine and duloxetine:  out of everything listed here, these meds do the heavy lifting.  The combination of mirtazapine and an SNRI is colloquially referred to as a ""rocket fuel."" 

Abilify:  this med amplifies the reuptake inhibitor.

Caffeine and theanine (in the form of coffee and black tea):  these help tremendously with the focus required for repetitive deep breathing. 

Nicotine (in the form of smokeless tobacco):  this is simultaneously sedating and stimulating, and has gone a long way in ""replacing"" alcohol. 

Kava tea.

Other practices:

Vagus nerve exercises:  deep ""box"" breathing, ""bearing down,"" etc.  

Smiling:  it's not recommended that one do this in public as it may come with the risk of one appearing mentally disturbed, but a smile for its own sake is known to release endorphins, and it works for me.

The breathing and meditation are the most recent additions to my regimen and I must admit they have changed my life.

21,1,"I‚Äôm desperate.


I was previously on fluoxetine for 8 years. When I initially went on it, at 20mg it was very hard to start. Almost impossible. I experience crazy restlessness, insomnia, depression, suicidal thoughts. Eventually I stayed on it for a total of 8 years and I felt like it stopped working.

I tried to taper off (critical mistake). I got very ill, very fast. I tried to go back on and I experienced all the above at just 5mg this time‚Ä¶ a psychiatrist at the hospital said I was bipolar and prescribed me seroquel.

So my question is, to the depressed people are these normal start up side effects for ssris ? It was pretty intolerable I had to constantly go to the hospital and couldn‚Äôt work had to be watched by family. 

Is this just anxiety ? "

"
23,1,"So I had TRD for years, I tried everything. Short version I tried almost every type of medication, I tried an at home brain stimulation clinical trial, I tried ketamine treatments, I tried mushrooms, I tried TMS, I tried a nerve block shot, I tried microdosing ketamine (medically), I tried NAD, I tried in-patient, then after pregnancy and post partum making it so much worse, I tried a 2 day PPD infusion, and then finally last resort tried ECT. I did 21 rounds (that‚Äôs including maintenance). After the first round, colors were brighter when I walked outside. Yes, headaches were so bad during treatment. Yes, my memory was shit during treatment. But I had my last treatment in 2023. 

It‚Äôs 2025, and my memory is back to normal as far as I can tell, nothing has been notably missing from it, I don‚Äôt have any trouble with recall. I haven‚Äôt noticed any of the side effects I read about or long term issues caused. 

But here I am, pregnant with my second child, and coming up on a due date scared to death PPD is gonna throw me back into that old pit. So I‚Äôve started looking into things to try and be proactive in case I do feel the depression creeping in. And every time I read about ECT, it makes me worry ‚ÄúWhy did I get lucky? Why am I not fucked up from it? Am I brain broken, and just unaware?‚Äù 

In summary, my concern is:  Should I be worried that some long term shit may be wrong with me from all of the ECT, and it just hasn‚Äôt become noticeable yet? Did I mess up my brain? I have praised ECT, bc it only benefited me. But every single time I read about other people‚Äôs experiences, I worry that I just haven‚Äôt waited long enough to find out why I should have been more hesitant of treatment. "

yes, I know  Benzos are addicting as hell, habit-forming and create dependency. I know all the horror stories.

my doc wants to put me on Imipramine after SSRI/SNRI have failed to provide relief. I struggle with inner tension, agoraphobia, and panic attacks. Can anyone with personal experience explain how Imipramine compares to SSRI/SNRI for anxiety?"
26,1,"I underwent 5 bilateral ECT sessions for treatment-resistant anhedonia and emotional blunting caused by stress and serotonergic medications, but I had no depression or anxiety before ECT. My mood was stable and I could do all basic tasks, but I had no pleasure or emotion. After ECT, I felt some improvement in the first 3 sessions. It seems that the rapid, acute effects are related to increased glutamate or a mechanism similar to ketamine. However, after sessions 4 and 5, my condition deteriorated severely. After the last session, I lost all energy and was unable to get out of bed or perform basic tasks due to extreme fatigue, constant drowsiness, and severe sedation. I tried using stimulants such as methylphenidate or caffeine to gain energy, but to no avail. I also developed severe anxiety, panic, depression, apathy, and derealization. I could not take medications to help me get rid of these things because I was very sensitive to medications during this period, and anti-anxiety medications or benzos made me lose consciousness so I had to face anxiety and depression. After 3 months I started to regain my energy to some extent and the ability to work and do basic tasks, but I suffer from anxiety, panic, depression and negative thoughts. I do not want to take serotonin medications, so I started taking gabapentin and found that it helps me get rid of anxiety, panic and negative thoughts and also helps me improve my mood. Now, 4 months after the last session, I suffer from severe apathy and difficulty in perceiving emotions. Before ECT, I did not suffer from apathy, I was emotionally numb but I can feel the color of life. Now I feel that life has become black and white. I can feel some emotions, but they are dull emotions. Also, my mood is not as stable as it was before ECT. and even dopaminergic medications such as methylphenidate do not treat my apathy. I really regret doing ECT. Before ECT, I suffered from some emotional numbness and anhedonia, but I was not depressed and at all My mood has been very stable and I don't suffer from anxiety or panic, Also I forget a lot of things and I have some memory problems but luckily my memory problems are not really disabling, I have taken many medications before ECT, I have never felt such damage from ECT from any medication I have ever taken. ECT is truly a brutal method. i really hope to get back to normal but this does not mean that ECT will be bad for all people. ECT may be a lifesaver, but this is my bad experience."

Since then, I‚Äôve been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), visual and vestibular impairment (including double vision and dizziness), chronic neck pain, and neurological symptoms that drastically changed my life. SPECT imaging later confirmed injury at the stimulation site and in my cerebellum. I had no history of neurological issues before TMS.

31,1,"A few years ago, I was struggling with *very severe* mental health issues. A combination of crisis management, repeated inpatient stays, a change in medication and intensive therapy (I was seeing two therapists a week for a while) helped me recover. I stopped therapy entirely months ago because things were good and smooth; I really didn't have anything to work on. But lately, I've been feeling depressed again.

Not as severe as before, not a crisis but I don't ever want it to get that severe again. So I need to do something about it.

Currently, I am taking 60mg of fluoxetine, 10mg Adderal IR, a small amount of levothyroxine, Vit D, B12 and some OTC allergy meds. I also take creatine almost daily; none of this seems to touch the depression. I've been to the doc and everything looks really good physically (except for the Vit D and B12, which is why I'm supplementing.)

Right now, I can't afford to pay for either of the really helpful therapists I was seeing before. But I can get monthly therapy for free through my insurance. The health system I'm in sees a lot of turnover of therapists and doesn't really 'match' patients with therapists; three times in the course of less than a year, the therapist I had been with would leave and I would get a random new therapist that I may or may not have jived with. But -- it's free!

It seems with therapy you get what you pay (out of pocket) for. Do you think it's worth it for me to get into (subpar) free therapy that hasn't really worked in the past or could it do more harm than good? What else should I try? I have done ketamine infusions, lots of meds, lots of different modalities of therapy."
32,1,"Hey I have been taking desvenlafaxine 50 mg for more than a year, very satisfied with it. Tried a couple of other serotonergic medicines along with it such as Fluvoxamine and vilazodone but they gave me very bad constipation. 

I am satisfied on desvenlafaxine, it is good for my impulse control. I feel it is somewhat of an ADHD medicine to be honest. But it doesn't do anything for my anhedonia. I don't enjoy movies, books, music, or anything. 

I am certain if I try another serotonergic medicine I will get constipation again. Hence I wanna do something different. Either I will try clomipramine or I will try Venlafaxine. Venlafaxine will be a lot more convenient for me. So I think I will do that. 

So how much Venlafaxine prolonged release should I go for, if I want to recreate the effects of 50 mg of prolonged release of desvenlafaxine and more. "

I feel better, but not at the point where I feel enabled to do my best in life.

Evidence-based tips to improve mental health

 -Learn something new every day. This promotes neuroplasticity and the brain enjoys being challenged. 

-Move your body every day, in different ways: yoga, hiking, dancing, weights, etc. 

-Have regular ‚Äúawe‚Äù moments: go into nature regularly, look at the stars, go to museums, listen to complex music 

-Connection: we are wired for it! Do not let relationships die. Find small ways to connect with people daily. Even better if you can integrate activities that are good for your brain into connection time. 

-Community: find meetup groups, support groups, join an exercise studio, join a community garden 

-Nature: earthing, bird-watching, sunlight daily and best if first thing in the morning which will help to regulate your hormones and neurotransmitters. We tend to think of us v. nature but we are nature‚Äî modern lives have simply disconnected us from this reality and it is why we immediately feel calmer when experiencing it. We evolved in nature. 

-Gratitude lists: the brain has a natural negativity bias, and this becomes even more pronounced with depression. Gratitude lists, as cliche as they may seem, are a way to train our brains to actively seek out and internalize the good in our lives that we often overlook. 

-Transcendence: connecting with something outside of yourself whether it be God, the universe, nature. Read about spirituality or learn to meditate. 

-Giving back: get outside of yourself‚Äî volunteering, beach clean ups, helping out loved ones, even just a loving kindness meditation

 -Therapy, of course to challenge cognitive distortions, highlight and correct maladaptive relational patterns, learn to regulate emotions, process trauma, etc. etc. "

It's not some weird shit like CFS/ME, POTS, EDS, I'm just perpetually exhausted and anhedonic. No results in the gym, I still barely bench like 100kg at the gym after 5 years, then my friend comes in and after 3 months he reaches 130kg like it's nothing and starts talking shit and making fun of me, but I hit him with a dumbell and now he's in the hospital so now we're even lol.

Obviously doing shrooms requires me talking to people and finding a dealer, same applies to stimulants because in my country they're all illegal, but I can fake blood tests results for T so there's that. Also darknet is too complicated for my brain like, I feel like I'm running life in 144p quality, it's awful.

Say what you will about me, I don't care, I've been living with this for a decade and my half my 20s are almost gone, I dropped out of uni, I lost all my friends and I have no hobbies. I get disrespected all the time because my brain doesn't work and I have nothing to say in conversations with coworkers, like it's basically over if I don't do something. And I'm tired of beating people up at work, I'm so sick of this shit, I can't connect with anyone and everybody's so fucking shallow and obnoxious.

And I've tried the common approach SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, Antipsychotics, nothing worked except Ketamine for anhedonia but that doesn't solve the energy problem. 

Let me know your thoughts, I pretty much am at a point I don't care about having kids, being healthy and all that crap, I just want to feel like I'm alive and not drag myself like a zombie 24/7...

I just hate how easy life is for most people and how everyone's better than me and I can't improve, I just can't stand this shit and am getting angrier by the day. I'm not ok. I wish therapy worked, I wish meds worked..."
39,1,"Has anyone found that amisulpride in small doses is effective in the long term for mild depression or anxiety? I am not talking about the high that occurs at the beginning of using the drug.

40,1,"Every NRI I have tried, including Wellbutrin seem to cause rumination, obsessive overthinking and give me this inner dialogue that I'm worthless, I'm ugly, I'm disgusting, I don't deserve anything, I don't belong here etc. I tend to dwell more on the present and past. All the mistakes I have made throughout my life. What I could have done better or different instead. All these kinds of rumination, obsessive overthinking and this inner dialogue drives me into anhedonic states and causes me to be more socially withdrawn from other people, which makes my depression symptoms way worse. NRIS do work for my chronic fatigue, hypersomnia, lack of energy and motivation and executive dysfunction, but unfortunately seem to cause all these other inevitable effects that impact my mood more negatively. Without NRIS I can't function properly like a normal human being, but on them my mood tends to get worse because of the rumination, obsessive overthinking and this inner dialogue they tend to give. SSRIS doesn't seem to be any forwards either. They make me extremely tired, sleepy, causes this brain fog and like huge fog over my head that blocks all of my emotions. They also make my apathy, avolition and anhedonia teen times worse. They make me feel like a living zombie.

I realized now that I can't win and there are no antidepressants that seem to be working for me. I have given up on all meds now because they always improve one of my symptoms, but make other symptoms worse. It feels like I have to choose between being anxious, edgy, have constant rumination and inner dialogue vs being a tired, sleepy, apathetic and anhedonic zombie. It's sickening tbh and I'm so tired of this! There doesn't seem to be any choices left for people like me then."
41,1,"Hi,

Does it make sense to take both? I know that researchers used to think that tianeptine acts partially opposite to SSRIs (increases serotonin reuptake) so in theory it might cancel out some of the effects, but actually it‚Äôs MOA is different (is neuroprotective, increases neuroplasticity and helps with stress etc.  via different mechanism).  
Sertraline seems to really work for me currently (but it took like 2 moths to get full effects). Especially I noticed that my cognition (including memory recall) is significantly improved and also Im not that tired / lethargic/ dysphoric / unmotivated in the morning ( which in my case could last to even 4 p. m.). I have a (pretty much ) lifelong delayed sleep syndrome , which I think is one of the major root causes of my mental problems.  
Also I take many supplements alongside like: bacopa , omega-3, d3 with k2 mk7 vitamin, magnesium, creatine, chromium , coluracetam and few others. Also since couple moths I take metformin 1g XR for my increased fasting glucose (not yet diabetic, but I have insuline resistance)."
42,1,"Some people complain of the weak effectiveness of stimulants, even new stimulants users. This problem is largely related to presynaptic receptors (autoreceptors). Some people have overactive presynaptic receptors, which makes stimulants ineffective or even cause the opposite effect where autoreceptors respond to the increase in dopamine from stimulants by strongly suppressing dopamine, causing a decrease in dopamine production and release, which leads to worsing. Some people also experience a very rapid crash, where dopamine initially increases, then the presynaptic receptors become activated and severely suppress dopamine, causing a crash. The insensitivity postsynaptic receptors is also related to the weak response to stimulants, especially after prolonged using or stimulants high dose abuse. However, presynaptic receptors play a major role, especially in new users who do not abuse stimulants at high doses. This problem is more evident with non-amphetamines stimulants, such as methylphenidate. Amphetamines partially overcome this problem through the direct release of dopamine, but the overactivity of autoreceptors remains a problem, as they control the Many things, such as dopamine production and release and dopamine bursts, to overcome this problem, Agents that block or desensitize presynaptic receptors may help."

I‚Äôm on 50mg fluoxetine + 50mg seroquel XR for anxiety and OCD. The fluoxetine helped for sure with the anxiety, but now I‚Äôm really depressed again, and I‚Äôve been in therapy for so so long and not getting anywhere.

I really think something a bit out of the box is gonna be the only thing that helps me, and I‚Äôm wondering if I should try this or try Microdosing psilocybin or what I should do next.

I didn't know what was going on and kids and people in general were judgemental as fuck back then. People weren't aware and sensitive as they are now. And mental illnesses were stigmatized as fuck. 

I had slowly lost faith in myself because of the perpetual negative results despite trying so hard and I just didn't know what was happening.

Now I'm slowly building up my confidence again and learning to not hate myself. "

I have treatment-resistant Depression and social anxiety. I have tried almost every medication under the sun with not much success. For this reason I am always looking for alternatives. 

My question is, have you found a medication/drug beneficial that you didnt even expect to help with depression/anxiety (and which might not even be officially prescribed for psychiatic disorders)?

I am curious about experience reports"
47,1,Do you guys avoid socializing when you are going through med change? 
48,1,"I have (M 57) something that is happening to me that might be ‚ÄúSudden Onset Anhedonia‚Äù but I am not sure. Up until a couple of months ago I was very busy with a personal project that I was doing (a spreadsheet to calculate something). About then I lost interest, but that had happened before. I would get interested in something for some months and then loose interest for an extended period of time, sometimes a year or more, only to have my interest in the subject come back.

Starting last week, I started having trouble getting enough sleep. I noticed that the simplest pleasures in life seemed to wane. Music didn‚Äôt sound as good. My apatite even declined. A couple of days ago things got so much worse. Now I am really having trouble sleeping, and I am overwhelmed by anxiety and grief. I have had other episodes like this in the past couple of years, and they typically subside after a few days. This one seems like it is the worst one I have had.

I have a lot of reasons to be unhappy in life. To me the world in 2025 is a terrible place, and it is so far from what I hoped for in the future. My own life is also far from what I hoped for in my future. I never meant to end up living alone, with no big goals to work towards in my future. Some very difficult and sad things have happened in my life and family. It seems like I have many reasons to be profoundly unhappy in my life, but most of the time the simplest pleasures such as food and music and items of interest on the internet seem to tide me alone, and life is still tolerable despite it all. I do not understand why everything seems so much worse to me now than it did a few days ago.

On a hunch, I searched for reasons for what is happening to me and came across the concept of ‚ÄúRapid Onset Anhedonia‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if this is really what I have, but I do wonder if it is. I know myself well enough to know that I will not be able to survive the state I am in for vary long, and I don‚Äôt know if there is any help. This will have to subside soon to be survivable. If anybody here has had a similar experience or thinks this might indeed by ‚ÄúSudden Onset Anhedonia‚Äù I would like to know. The biggest difference between my situation and some of the ones I have seen described is that I already had plenty of reasons to be depressed, but was managing OK until recently, and there was no obvious cause like a change in medication or a virus or anything else. Losses that were years in the past suddenly seem so much more ‚Äúpresent‚Äù and soul destroying. This combination of sleeplessness, anxiety, depression, hopelessness and crushing grief is simply unbearable. At this point even being able to sleep much more might make this more survivable."
49,1,"I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin XL 300mg for 5 years. On its own, it was never quite enough, but every time I try to taper off, I become severely depressed, so doctors always end up increasing the dose again. I can‚Äôt tolerate 450mg‚Äîit causes tremors.

The best combo I‚Äôve had was:
Wellbutrin XL + Vyvanse 40mg + Vraylar 3mg.
That combo worked well for 4 years, until both Vyvanse and Vraylar suddenly stopped working. They were tapered off, and I was switched to Focalin XR 25mg + 10mg IR (plus Wellbutrin), which helped a little but wasn‚Äôt ideal.

In February, I saw a new doctor who reintroduced Vraylar at 1.5mg (after 18 months off) and added L-methylfolate 15mg. That combo actually worked great for both depression and anxiety‚Äîuntil about a month in, when I started having sleep issues again.

To address the sleep problems, we dropped the Focalin IR and added Intuniv (1mg ‚Üí 2mg). Unfortunately, that seems to have made my insomnia and anxiety worse.

For the past 1.5 weeks, everything has crashed. My depression and anxiety are worse than ever, I‚Äôve almost stopped sleeping, and I cry constantly. My mood is slightly better during the day but gets way worse at night.

I honestly feel like I‚Äôm out of medication options. So many meds either don‚Äôt work or give me awful side effects:

-Any antidepressant other than Wellbutrin gives me tremors

-TCAs at max dose = ineffective

-Other antipsychotics (Seroquel, Caplyta, Abilify, Rexulti) = no benefit

-Trazodone = worsens insomnia
	
-Lamictal and Gabapentin = tremors

-I can‚Äôt do TMS/ECT due to a chronic health condition.

I‚Äôve also done weekly therapy for 5 years‚Äîwhich unfortunately isn‚Äôt helping much anymore either.

I feel lost, defeated, and hopeless, and I don‚Äôt know what else to try.

What do you do when the meds that worked just‚Ä¶ stop working? Is there any way to make them effective again? Are there any treatments or combinations I haven‚Äôt tried that might be worth discussing with my doctor?




TL;DR: Wellbutrin is the only antidepressant I can tolerate, but it‚Äôs not effective alone. My best combo (Wellbutrin + Vyvanse + Vraylar) stopped working after 4 years. Tried new combos, but now back in a very bad depressive/anxious state. Most antidepressants and antipsychotics give me tremors or don‚Äôt help. Therapy hasn‚Äôt helped either. I feel completely out of options. What can you do when meds stop working? Any ideas I might bring up with my doctor?

50,1,"I‚Äôm about 6 months off Invega (paliperidone), which I was given for a period that now feels like a long, numbed-out survival stretch. During that time, I experienced strong apathy, lack of self-care, no motivation, and near-total anhedonia ‚Äî especially from things I used to love, like music. I‚Äôm doing a bit better now, but still feel a core deficit in drive and reward.

I‚Äôm looking to **accelerate recovery** of the dopaminergic system ‚Äî not just wait it out ‚Äî and I‚Äôd love to hear from people who‚Äôve had success with regimens that helped in similar situations.

I've been researching some options and am trying to figure out the best direction. What I‚Äôm currently considering or curious about:

* **Bupropion + Ritalin** as a combo to kickstart dopamine without going overboard
* **Selegiline**, possibly as monotherapy, for its MAO-B inhibition and stimulant-like effects
* **Amantadine** ‚Äî heard it might help with motivation and fatigue
* **Pramipexole** ‚Äî might be hard to get, but has shown promise in treatment-resistant depression
* **Parnate (tranylcypromine)** ‚Äî I‚Äôve seen anecdotal reports of strong benefits for anhedonia

I‚Äôm wondering:

* Which of these options (or combos) do you think holds the most promise?
* Have you come across any **scientific insights or personal experiences** that helped you recover motivation and reward sensitivity post-antipsychotics?
* Is there a risk that using these medications (especially stimulants or MAOIs) might delay natural healing?
* Have you personally healed post antipsychotic usage? What helped you?

I'm open to any regimens, even outside-the-box ones, as long as they‚Äôre aimed at **repairing or enhancing dopaminergic function**, not just masking symptoms.

Any input or experience would be greatly appreciated."

53,1,"Treatment ressistant depression is a severe disease, it targets dopamine pathways, a neuroplasticity deffience, i tried to ask chatgpt to search articles on internet and SUGGEST a NEW MOLECULE to treat ressistant depression and this is what i got.
Based on the analysis of the mechanisms involved in the neurobiology of treatment‚Äëresistant depression‚Äîglutamatergic dysfunction, BDNF deficiency and neuroinflammation‚ÄîI propose the following multimodal agent design:


---

1. Main Pharmacological Targets

1. Glutamatergic Modulation

Allosteric antagonism of the NMDA receptor (NR2B subunit) to restore excitatory/inhibitory balance and activate the mTOR pathway, as (R,S)-ketamine does.

Allosteric potentiation of AMPA receptors to boost BDNF release and promote synaptogenesis in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.



2. Neurotrophin Enhancement

Direct stimulation of TrkB (the BDNF receptor) to enhance neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity and stress resilience.



3. Neuroinflammation Reduction

Reversible inhibition of IDO (indoleamine‚Äë2,3‚Äëdioxygenase) to limit the tryptophan‚Üíquinolinic acid pathway (an NMDA agonist and source of oxidative stress) and restore serotonin levels.

Agonism at the œÉ‚Äë1 receptor to mitigate endoplasmic‚Äëreticulum stress and modulate pro‚Äëinflammatory cytokine production.





---

2. Proposed Molecule: TRD‚Äë101

IUPAC (proposed):

> N‚Äë[2‚Äë(2,3‚Äëdichlorophenyl)ethyl]‚Äë4‚Äë(5‚Äëmethoxy‚Äë3‚Äëoxo‚Äë3,4‚Äëdihydroquinoxalin‚Äë2‚Äëyl)piperazine‚Äë1‚Äëcarboxamide



Conceptual Action Scaffold:

Quinoxaline core: anchors in the NR2B allosteric site of NMDA (partial antagonist).

Methoxy substituent: enhances œÉ‚Äë1 receptor affinity, tuning inflammatory responses.

Piperazine ring: engages AMPA PAM sites and improves CNS penetration.

2,3‚ÄëDichlorophenethyl chain: competes with tryptophan at the IDO active site.



---

3. Detailed Mechanism of Action

1. Selective NR2B Antagonism

Partially blocks NMDA-mediated overactivation of GABAergic interneurons, disinhibits cortical circuits and triggers mTOR‚Äëdriven synaptic protein synthesis.



2. AMPA Potentiation (PAM)

Enhances fast excitatory currents, induces BDNF surges and drives dendritic remodeling in key mood‚Äëregulating regions.



3. œÉ‚Äë1 Receptor Agonism

Binds œÉ‚Äë1 at the endoplasmic reticulum, reducing ER‚Äëstress and release of IL‚Äë6 and TNF‚ÄëŒ±, thereby damping microglial activation.



4. Reversible IDO Inhibition

Competes with tryptophan, lowers quinolinic acid production, prevents excitotoxicity and rebalances serotonin synthesis.





---

Expected Advantages of TRD‚Äë101

Rapid onset (hours to days) via NMDA/AMPA modulation, similar to ketamine but with reduced psychotomimetic effects.

Prolonged duration through TrkB‚ÄëBDNF positive feedback and sustained anti‚Äëinflammatory action.

Favorable safety profile: partial NMDA antagonism and reversible IDO inhibition minimize off‚Äëtarget adverse effects.



---

Conclusion
TRD‚Äë101 exemplifies a truly multimodal strategy, simultaneously targeting the glutamatergic, neurotrophic and immunological axes of treatment‚Äëresistant depression. Preclinical development should focus on brain bioavailability, target selectivity and efficacy in chronic‚Äëstress animal models.

The MOLECULE it's ficticial but the targets are interesting ."
54,1,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been on SSRIs for several years, and while they helped stabilize me at first, I‚Äôve been dealing with a set of long-term side effects that are really starting to affect my quality of life. I‚Äôd like to hear from others who might‚Äôve gone through something similar and how (or if) you were able to manage it.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm experiencing:

* Emotional blunting / apathy: I often feel emotionally flat or indifferent‚Äîlike nothing really moves me.
* Anhedonia: I struggle to enjoy things I used to love, which is really frustrating.
* Sexual dysfunction: Low libido, delayed orgasm, and sometimes no orgasm at all.
* Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS): SSRIs seem to have worsened this over time.

I also have to avoid strong H1-antihistamines (like hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine) because they tend to aggravate my RLS too, which makes finding alternatives even more difficult.

Questions for the community:

* Have you experienced similar long-term side effects from SSRIs?
* Were you able to *resolve or reduce* them? Did you switch medications, taper off, add something (like Wellbutrin or supplements), or make lifestyle changes?

Would really appreciate any input, especially if you've come out the other side with some solutions. Thanks a lot!"

I thought since NRIS are supposed to be more energizing and that they enhance dopamine in the PFC that they should cause less anhedonia and emotional blunting than SSRIS?

I waited for the withdrawal to pass for 45 days, but I never felt better. 

I don't have hallucinations or delusions, but there is something else that it addresses. Probably it is paranoia. In the last few days I was restless as fuck, tired and miserable.

It literally gave me physical energy. I don't know the mechanism, perhaps it helped me get deep restful sleep etc I don't really know.

Since then, I‚Äôve tried dozens of medications, cerebrolysin, and even ECT ‚Äî none of them helped.  


I‚Äôve tried the following antidepressants: sertraline, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, clomipramine, paroxetine, mirtazapine, fluoxetine with olanzapine, amitriptyline, fluvoxamine, bupropion, and tianeptine.  


Among antipsychotics, I‚Äôve taken: aripiprazole, risperidone, amisulpride, quetiapine and lurasidone.  


Other treatments I‚Äôve tried include: cerebrolysin, amantadine, pramipexole, rasagiline and 6 ect sessions  


Now what? Should I try mushrooms?, i finally found them in my country, I‚Äôm losing my life, about to get fired from my dream college, and I can‚Äôt function anymore. There‚Äôs no mental stability. I see no solutions except mushrooms and esketamine, but the nasal spray is much more expensive.

I would appreciate any insight, guidance, or relevant experience you can share."
73,1,"I'm judt wondering what is the realstic long term use of this medication? Is there a tolerance that builds up? I know about prolactin and lower doses being effective but I'm really looking for something that would suit me long term? Any alternatives if this isn't suitable. I have adhd, autism and depression. I've tried all stimulants and they help with focus and motivation but cause me to become extremely depressed in the evenings. I've tried Wellbutrin and that was quite good but it was making my hair thin and fall out :( Currently in therapy but it's hard to make changes because I have no motivation at all to do anything. "
74,1,"I still have no motivation or desire to do anything. I still don't have any drive, goals and purposes for doing anything with my life. I still can't enjoy doing the things that I used to like and that gave me pleasure and happiness. I don't enjoy socializing with people anymore and I don't get anything from social interactions. My mind feels so blank and I still have the feeling of emptiness inside and it's just getting worse by everyday. My apathy, avolition and anhedonia is starting to drive me crazy and I'm so tired of feeling like this everyday. I have this huge motivation paralysis. My apartment is a mess and I can't even do basic tasks like cleaning or cooking for myself anymore because of this. I literally just lie down in my bed all day watching the days go by and it seems like I'm wasting my life because of this.  I really want to change but I can't no matter what I do. I thought Wellbutrin was supposed to help with these issues, but nope I'm still struggling with all of it everyday and it's destroying my life.

My psych doesn't even give a damn. He told me I need to find the motivation for doing things myself and that the only choice I have now is to go to psychotherapy. How on earth is psychotherapy going to help when the med is not even working in the first place. His only suggestion considering meds was to switch to a SNRI instead of Wellbutrin. How would a SNRI work better for my apathy, avolition and anhedonia when not even Wellbutrin could do anything for it. I don't even know why he would think that would be a great idea in the first place. I have tried SSRIS in the past and they did nothing whatsoever for any of these symptoms and they just made it all worse. I'm so tired of not getting listened to by my own psych and it really ticks me off that he would consider me to switch to a SNRI instead when he knows that it would just make all my issues worse. He just doesn't get it and he will never understand how it is suffering like this every damn day! He just thinks it's so easy and if it was I wouldn't still be like this! It's all his fault I'm going to take my own life soon because I just can't do this anymore! I'm tired of living like this everyday and I can't even change it. What's the point of living life when you can't even enjoy doing anything and enjoy things like other people do when you just feel numb and blank all the time? There is no purpose of living life if it's going to be like this all the time. I'm starting to give up at this point and I see no other solution than to take my own life."

Videos like this, where someone was previously completely normal, a medication destroys their mental health and within 1 month they kill themselves over the debilitating anhedonia and cognitive symptoms

Why does psychiatry have no solutions to this sudden onset stuff? Therapy does not cure things like this where some sort of toxic exposure insult to the body be it a drug reaction or virus (like long covid) creates symptoms. And most treatments are too slow to reverse this, and the conditions create extreme anxiety about the anhedonia symptoms themselves

In this sort of scenario, is ECT essentially the best psychiatry has? Where there is extreme sudden onset anhedonic agitated melancholic depression

And why are these sudden onset things not being talked about more extensively in the field?

CBT:

‚ÄúMy life is ruined, I have anhedonia cant feel emotions‚Äù=> change thought ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt ruined‚Äù=> notice the symptom is there => thought repeats again. 

These sudden onset cases can come with extremely high suicide ideation, more than other kinds of anxiety or depression. Someone with no mental health history now has a mental symptom, and a nightmare one at that. They go to the internet, see that this symptom and problem is extremelt difficult to treat, causes more anxiety and SI. 

Why is there absolutely no awareness of this? Why is nobody talking about anhedonia AND how it can come on overnight? 

There are also other instances of people quickly ending their lives after getting anhedonic blank minded due to some sudden post viral or post drug reaction

Even with therapy and psychiatry, I still feel like I can‚Äôt fix the chemical imbalance happening in my brain. 

I have no motivation. I lay in bed all day, doom scroll, etc. I have ideas and goals, but attempting to do them leads to a sort of ‚Äúparalysis‚Äù. Welbutrin helped a tiny bit, but as I‚Äôve upped doses I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs not that impactful. 
That being said, my life could be a reason for the lack of motivation.

I‚Äôve been ok when it comes to cutting and having suicidal ideation, but the lack of doing *anything* makes those thoughts a lot harder to cope with.

One moment I feel energetic and then I feel irritable/angry at people around me.

86,1,"I added this to my stack years ago and sometimes it runs out and I don't refill it right away. I usually think it's just a random supplement and I'll be fine but every time this happens I notice lower energy and mood, only for it to return pretty quickly after I resume taking it. 

I thought maybe it was placebo but it's very noticeable for me after years of going on/off and if I take a lot I notice an uncomfortable overstimulated effect as if I took too much Wellbutrin. So I'm pretty confident it's having an effect.

From my understanding the main mechanism is anti-inflammatory effects which are pretty widely helpful with mental health. I had increased anxiety after contracting covid in 2021 so I wonder if it helps deal with some sort of long-covid type inflammation. Though there is some controversy over whether it crosses the blood-brain barrier (as always with these kind of things). I believe there are some studies showing promise but not enough to conclusively determine its usefulness.

That said, for me I feel like this is one of those things in my stack I'll never drop. Currently take Nortriptyline 50mg, Vitamin D, and Curcumin. 

It's absorbed with black pepper AND fat and the quality of the supplement is supposedly important. Though, I've noticed benefits from pretty much any version. The root/powder are pretty cheap and good if added to eggs/smoothies etc. Eggs with pepper is ideal meal companion because of the fat and pepper."

There's nothing wrong with her tbh, she does her job ig, I just feel like we don't connect. Whenever I try to talk she just looks at her computer and I usually just end up doing coloring pages the whole hour. I constantly dread our appointments and almost always end up hurting myself after,something I've never notice with other therapists.

I recently started on Olanzapine with 10mg. Two weeks back.  
I was experiencing the following a couple of days back.

\- Swelling of both feets consistent with endema.  
\- Shortness of breath.  
\- Significant weight gain, i cant fit into any of my clothes.

I contacted my psychiatrist, who requested me to visit the ER ASAP and he mentioned that wtv i am facing has nothing to do new dosage of Olanzapine.

At the ER, they ran a blood test, chest XRay and ECG, and found nothing concerning.

I then went back to my psy who again mentioned what i faced has nothing to do with Olanzapine, but decided to reduce my Olanzapine dose to 5mg.

With that, i did find that some changes, swelling reduced, now only the right feet swells up randomly.

I do not face any shortness of breath.

I am currently on the following medications:

\- Venlafaxine (ViePax)  
\- Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse)  
\- Olanzapine (Zydis)|  
\- Mirtazpine (Rameron)

i had checked on serveral post, which indicated serveral folks on Olanzapine had experineced Endema as well.

What should i do ?"

106,1,"Hi guys!

My story is a strange one, inasmuch as I have had 10 years worth of depression (ranging from day to day dysthymia to major depressive episodes) but no real understandable cause. I have had no trauma that I can think of, yet for the last two years I have been suffering from DP/DR and dissociation nearly every day. I have tried meds, with varying degrees of success, but I keep relapsing after I come off them. 

Blood tests a few times in the last couple of years show no low testosterone, iron, ferritin or b12. I've had therapy, but without any trauma or real negative thought loops to talk about, it's never felt a worthwhile experience. 

I have ADHD and have Vyvanse prescribed to me, which helps for a few hours, before wearing off and making my moody and slightly angry.

I'm at a bit of a loss guys - does anyone have any signposting or advice? I find it so hard to tackle my depression when I can't even find out what the route cause is"

I‚Äôve been on antidepressants for about 5 years now. Originally started on mirtazapine, which worked for my symptoms, but caused me to gain weight and gave me twitchy legs before sleep. 

I went off mirtazapine and went on pristiq. It messed with my sexual function, but was working great for my depressive symptoms. So I added in wellbutrin. 

I‚Äôve been on that cocktail for about 3 years, and recently upped the wellbutrin from 150 to 300. So far so good. But I‚Äôm still seriously struggling with my sexual function. I went from sex maybe multiple times a day to maybe every 2 weeks. 

I know it‚Äôs not my testosterone levels because I‚Äôm trans and do testosterone shots. I‚Äôm also on 72mg of concerta and 10mg of ritalin. 

Is it worth it to try mirtazapine again? I want to stay on the wellbutrin and get off of the pristiq. Or is there another antidepressant I could try that plays well with wellbutrin and doesn‚Äôt impact sexual function. "

Update 

0504 I am fucked can't get off z my head is just turning against so be it.

0420 cutting z to half 

0417: adding lemon balm extract 500mg and taurine 500mg, on top of everything. Measuring sleep time, sleep quality score and night wakes (recorded by my watch). Still on Zs. Honestly now they are losing effect I believe trazodone is responsible for knocking me out.

I have been taking zolpidum 10mg and zolpiclone alternatively for a over month and the effects are noticeably wearing off.

Also takes l-theanine 200mg, lysinate glycinate magnesium 400mg, trazodone 50mg for sleep. But they are just aiding, the main things are still z sedatives .

Bc I had an overdose history of BZD the tolerance builds up and normal dosage don't work for me, so no to the BZD family.

Used quetiapine too but I couldn't fall sleep with 12 mg and 25mg gave me heavy dizziness the other day. So switched from q to z.

Gonna try the following supplements on top of everything and see if they help
‚Ä¢ passion flower extract
‚Ä¢ taurine
‚Ä¢ lemon balm extract 
‚Ä¢ Mongolia bark extract 

Gonna keep a record here.

Suggestion and discussion welcomed!

112,1,"TLDR: Nurse practitioner says next step is antipsychotics. Is there something else I should suggest first?

I (39F) have diagnoses of ADHD, GAD, and MDD. My biggest struggles are lack of motivation, ruminating thoughts, mood swings/emotional regulation, and executive function problems. I struggle to fall asleep and often wake up in the middle of the night and can‚Äôt fall back asleep because my mind races. I feel like I‚Äôve tried every med without luck. 

I‚Äôve tried:

Buspar

Zoloft 

Prozac

Celexa

Strattera

Effexor

Nortriptyline 

Wellbutrin

Auvelity 

Viibryd

Trintellix

Mirtazapine 

Clonidine

Guanfacine

Variety of stimulants

I‚Äôm currently taking 20 mg methylphenidate ER. I want to try Vyvanse, but the psychiatric nurse practitioner I see doesn‚Äôt want to change that until I get my other meds figured out. I vape THC so I can fall asleep. My NP and I disagree on THC usage. She thinks I‚Äôd be better off with something like Ambien. I rather just stick with the THC because it works well and I wake up feeling fine the next day. 

Overall, SSRIs gave me terrible side effects with no relief of anxiety/depression symptoms. Nortriptyline helped, but I gained a bunch of weight in the few months I was on it. Everything else either didn‚Äôt work or gave me side effects that didn‚Äôt get better over time. Viibryd gave me the worst side effects of anything I tried. Mirtazapine was pretty rough, too. 

I have an appointment on Wednesday to discuss the next med to try. At my last appointment when I was prescribed mirtazapine, the NP said she thinks my next step should be an antipsychotic, but I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about that. Is there something that would be a better choice before going the antipsychotic route? My biggest side effect concerns with any medication are libido and weight gain. I also would like to be able to drink a beer every once in a while without it causing issues. I have a very stressful job, and it can cause a lot of anxiety in times of high stress. "
113,1,"To be quite frank I quite like Lexapro ‚Ä¶ on 10mg.
however there are some issues- I feel it helped my anxiety however not so much for depression. 

I did see some positive signs but the main reason I was taking it is because it helped my insomnia .. and it did for a few months most AD‚Äôs do (weirdly mirtazipine and trazadone don‚Äôt lol) 

But it‚Äôs no longer helping the same. I also am 
on dexamfetamine which I‚Äôm not taking so much atm but that days I do take it I don‚Äôt  feel the lexapro as much at all. 

I don‚Äôt have much other issues other than weight gain and slight anhedonia.. 
 
I was hoping to change to anything that helps depression and doesn‚Äôt give me a weird sleep. I‚Äôve also been experiencing onset sleep paralysis (yikes) but this could be from dodgey weed so I won‚Äôt go into it (although mirtazipine done some weird stuff to me too.) 

I have previously taken sertraline and fluoxetine. 

Fluoxetine was fine but I felt a bit more angry than I was on lexapro. It was about 10 years ago though , sertraline gave me nausea for a day and I called it quits I‚Äôm wondering, maybe if I switch from lex to sertraline it won‚Äôt be so bad this time, or even fluoxetine ‚Ä¶ 
What‚Äôs been ur best switch?

There are plenty of other options though has anybody made any switches that have worked?

114,1,"Hey guys,  
I recently came across a¬†[peer-reviewed study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10932773/#npr212399-sec-0011)

¬†that discusses how the¬†**opioid system**¬†is deeply involved in rejection sensitivity, social pain, and even¬†**atypical**¬†depression‚Äîand how Tramadol might help due to its mixed mechanism:

* Partial Œº-opioid receptor agonist
* SNRI-like action (norepinephrine + serotonin reuptake inhibition)
* Structurally similar to Venlafaxine (an SNRI used for depression/anxiety)

  
I also checked some of the reviews on¬†[Drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/comments/tramadol/for-depression.html)

>[Tramadol](https://www.drugs.com/tramadol.html)¬†has an average rating of¬†**9.2**¬†out of 10 from a total of¬†**238 reviews**¬†for the¬†**off-label**¬†treatment of Depression. 89% of reviewers reported a positive experience, while 4% reported a negative experience.

Anyone here used Tramadol specifically for mood/anxiety-related issues? How long did the effects last for you? Did tolerance build up? Did it help more with social anxiety, emotional numbing, or general depression?"
115,1,"propranolol vs atenolol, whats the diffirence? who works better anyone experiences?"
116,1,"Hello Everyone,

About 2 weeks ago I started the pramipexole protocol outlined by doctor Fawcett.  
**Meaning Pramipexole IR at night titrated up to a dose that is tolerable and one responds to.**

**Initial titration:**

With a maximum dose of 4.5mg iirc. My goal dose is 1.6mg as of now. Which I reached today.

I always had awful sleep disturbances from it, even though it sedated me (like it should), which I initially was able to curb with circadin, but now I switched to daridorexant 50mg as I didn't sleep enough (as well as good, mostly kept on waking up every few hr's) and the sleep deprivation was awful combined with the initial anhedonia and apathy that prami induces when one starts.

Also btw. Ginger was a decent way to ameliorate some of the nausea from prami, although it's not entirely effective.

Now it feels like I've adjusted quite well to it. I don't have much grogginess when I wake up, but the sleep disturbances are still there (even on 50mg of daridorexant), I usually tend to wake up 2-3 times at night. Which is better then the 4-6 times at night that I had before, but yk it's still there.

**I wanted to ask, with other people that followed the same protocol, once you stabalized on a dose for a while, did the sleep disturbances go away with time?**  
I couldn't find any notes on whether they do in doctor Fawcett's notes.

**Positive notes: ""Signs for autoreceptor desensitization""**  
As expected I am right around the dose and time that people usually start to notice benefits. I personally noticed that I need about a 2000pg/ml reduction in my blood pramipexole levels from peak blood concentrations (see image attached) for me to feel good again.

**- Actually looks like this subreddit dosen't allow me to post images.** So I am sorry guys, blame the mods.

**I also noticed that once I reach that 2000pg/ml reduction and it continues to reduce over the day. I end up having a easier time starting tasks and I enjoy myself more doing regular things.**¬†It's nothing crazy, but certainly a good start imo.  
I am sure it will get better with more time as I am also dealing with some side effects from it.

Kind regards, Swiss"
117,1,"I have been on lamotrigine for over a year now and it's definitely been beneficial for me. But not as in it resolved all issues. I am in Canada and from mid-November we've been having quite cold and grey weather, plus of course then sunset is much earlier in winter, so a lot of very dark (literally) days. This really affects me.

I do find that sometimes having a latte with fortified soy milk suddenly gives me energy and motivation on days when there is no sun. I am very sensitive to the absence of sunlight. When there is sunlight, even if it's a cold day, I just come out outside and feel much better.

So the strange pattern that I am noticing is that these lattes work only occasionally. And coffee in general works only occasionally for me. If I have regular coffee or lattes daily, or if I have fortified plant milks daily, it seems that after several days I crash completely. 

I wake up feeling completely anhedonia, I just don‚Äôt want to get up, because I don‚Äôt want to do anything. I don‚Äôt really want to eat. I don‚Äôt feel any joy from listening to music that I like or watching a show that I like.

Wondering if anyone else has these issues with coffee?

I asked ChatGPT about this and I don‚Äôt know how valid this info is, but these were some interesting ideas:

Caffeine blocks adenosine A1 and A2A receptors ‚Üí leads to increased dopamine and glutamate release (especially in prefrontal cortex and striatum). This overstimulates your dopamine system transiently. Lamotrigine modulates glutamate release and voltage-gated sodium channels.

In sensitive brains, this combination of daily coffee plus lamotrigine, when lamotrigine is already suppressing excitability, this causes:

* Dopamine receptor downregulation (particularly D2-like receptors)
* Glutamate rebound instability

After several days, the system enters a refractory state:

* Dopamine release is blunted
* Reward signaling becomes impaired
* You experience anhedonia, dysphoria, sensory hypersensitivity

This is not ""withdrawal"", it‚Äôs a post-overstimulation neurochemical crash, especially common in people with OCD spectrum sensitivity, lamotrigine-induced glutamate modulation, and low dopaminergic resilience.

I don‚Äôt experience this with tea actually, I have been drinking tea daily since around 5 years old. The ideas behind tea not being an issue:

Black and green teas contain l-theanine. L-theanine is an amino acid that increases GABA, modulates glutamate, and promotes alpha brain wave activity (relaxation + attention). Also after a cup of tea the caffeine is slower-releasing. L-theanine buffers caffeine‚Äôs dopaminergic and glutamatergic spike. Result: No overstimulation, no receptor downregulation, no rebound crash."
118,1,i‚Äôve been on 40 mg viibryd for like a month and a half now and the last few days it‚Äôs felt like it has completely lost any and all effectiveness. has anyone gone higher the 40 mg and did it help?

120,1,I am 7 weeks on 150 mg and depression is still there
121,1,"I have adhd, depression, anxiety and ocd tendencies. I have tried all stimulants, wellbutrin, ssris, exercise. Jump rope does make me feel better for an hour but then I'm deppressed again later on in the day. I have the rs1800497 gene which means I'm more prone to Addictions and substance use due to d2 receptors. Every time I take vyvanse, I feel depressed. I'm prone to getting hyper fixated on things and obsessing over them. I'm exhausted with myself. I'm not living at all. I just want the pain to stop. I'm so tired."
122,1,"Did it reduce your depression symptoms?

Did you experience side effects?

Did it help with other conditions (ex: Dysautonomia/POTS, epilepsy, etc.)?

If you are in Florida can you please comment the doctor who put in your implant as well.

IVNS has been recommended to me for my treatment resistant depression and POTS. I've been told I'm a good candidate. 

Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is the only treatment that has ever worked for my depression. People who have had high success rates with ECT for treatment resistant depression have a good chance of IVNS working as well.

An added benefit would hopefully be a reduction in my POTS symptoms.

My doctors think it's a good idea but I'm on the fence and would like to hear some real patient experiences.

Thank you üíô"
123,1,"I have been asking ChatGPT 4o a lot of questions about my OCD and it has been really helpful. Actually more helpful than a lot of doctors have been.

So many years ago, when I initially started seeing psychiatrists, of course I was given SSRIs. My symptoms were all thought related, and still are. It started with thoughts about me worrying that a classmate going to visit her family over Christmas might be in a plane crash. And then I became worried that because I am thinking this, I am making it more likely to happen, so I should stop thinking about it. But I could not stop.  
Then I had a lot of worries that I might continue to keep being alive, while other people will not be at some point. I have a lot of worries that if my friends are not thinking about me, maybe I don't really exist. And I am never sure whether they remember me or not.

So anyways, I was prescribed SSRIs, and they caused something like psychosis for me. I ended up being hospitalized several times. Same with Wellbutrin and Cymbalta.

Only about a year ago I was actually suggested lamotrigine by a psychiatrist, and finally this is the medication that is actually somewhat helping me. Also I notice that taking Tylenol definitely does help me.

So now that we have ChatGPT to ask, I can finally ask why this is the case! The answer is quite interesting, of course it's not definite that the answer is correct.

And also, thanks ChatGPT, for validation :)  
""You‚Äôre not imagining the severity of your reaction. What you experienced is¬†**not rare**¬†in people with OCD-spectrum, especially Pure O,¬†**plus sensory/emotional hypersensitivity**¬†and¬†**glutamate system sensitivity**.""

This pattern likely reflects a specific neurobiological profile characterized by heightened sensitivity to internal stimuli, overactivation of emotional error-monitoring circuits, and glutamatergic dysregulation. In individuals with this profile, often seen in Pure Obsessional OCD with existential and relational themes, serotonergic and noradrenergic medications such as SSRIs, SNRIs, and bupropion (Wellbutrin) can worsen symptoms. These medications tend to increase emotional and cognitive activation, which in this case leads to heightened rumination, panic, derealization, and in extreme cases, symptoms resembling psychosis.

In contrast, medications like lamotrigine, which modulate glutamate transmission and stabilize neural excitability, are better tolerated and can reduce the severity of obsessive thought loops and emotional overdrive. Even acetaminophen (Tylenol), which dampens activity in the anterior cingulate cortex‚Äîa region involved in social and emotional pain‚Äîmay provide subtle relief by reducing the intensity of emotional reactivity. This suggests the underlying issue is not a serotonin deficiency, but rather an overactive cognitive-affective processing system, especially involving glutamate and error-detection pathways, requiring treatments that decrease mental and emotional hyperactivity rather than amplify it."
124,1,I've been on quite a few and none have worked for me so I'm just trying to get some ideas and Lmk how they affected u. Pls I just want to feel normal again.

129,1,"I'm on quite a lot of meds: clomipramine (OCD, anxiety), mianserin (insomnia), pregabalin (anxiety), propranolol (anxiety), diazepam as needed no more than twice a week (anxiety). 

Successfuly tapered off sulpiride couple months ago. Currently tapering off lamotrigine. I don't even know why I was put on it, my family has a history of bipolar but I've never showed any signs of mania just depression.

Lately (even before I started tapering off lamotrigine so it shouldn't be because of that) I'm suffering from anhedonia, lack of motivation and lack of will to live. 

It's just kinda like if I was on an autopilot, just trying to exist rather than actually enjoy life. For sure it's better than feeling suicidal like I used to yhhh it's still not optimal.

I thought about asking my doc for bupropion for an energy boost, motivation and just overall activation you could say. I'm wondering if it could help me. 

Does anyone have some experience with using it as an add on for motivation? I'm very interested in hearing your experiences. Thanks!"
130,1,"Current medications: 30/45mg mirtazapine daily, 40mg vyvanse daily, 40mg propranolol daily, 5mg Valium as needed (usually 2 times a week, usually take 10mg instead of 5mg)

TLDR: Presribed vyvanse 40mg daily for mood/energy/anxiety, I don‚Äôt have ADHD. Side effects relating to sleep (waking up in the morning and staying up past 8pm) are horrible and I want to come off this shit. How bad/manageable will the withdrawals be if I drop down to one pill every other day for 2 weeks or even cold turkey quit?


I don‚Äôt have ADHD I never got a diagnosis for it and I told my psych when we first met that I didn‚Äôt believe I had it and didn‚Äôt really have attention/focus issues. I‚Äôve been seeing this psych for over 3 years now and 3 months ago he gave me 40mg vyvanse for mood, energy levels and to help with anxiety. I have tried a LOT of different meds to help with anxiety and none of them really worked, so he suggested vyvanse and I said sure.

The first month it worked pretty well but I‚Äôm now almost 3 months into using it and the side effects have gotten a lot worse. I can barely get out of bed every morning I sleep in way too much and when I finally feel like I can get out of bed I immediately have to take the vyvanse or I‚Äôll fall back asleep. I also crash out around like 8-9pm every night and can barely stay awake after then, doesn‚Äôt matter when I go to bed either I still struggle to get up in the morning. I do still get more energy during the day but honestly I feel gross getting up at 10am most mornings and would rather get off this shit altogether.

So 3 months of daily 40mg vyvanse, how bad are the withdrawals gonna be if i stop taking it? I know it‚Äôs bad to try and self taper without ur psychs advice but I don‚Äôt have another appointment for 3 months and with how cooked our psych system is in my country I won‚Äôt be able to get an earlier appointment that‚Äôs less than 1-2 months away anyways. I‚Äôll be able to manage a few weeks of fucked sleep and shit energy, I‚Äôd rather go through that right now anyways while I‚Äôm still job searching rather than later when I‚Äôm employed. just wanna know if dropping down to one on one off (taking a pill every other day) for two weeks or even going cold turkey is gonna cause any major health issues?

131,1,"Anyone experienced this? I've been on 450mg for about 3 weeks now. Anything that gave me a dopamine spike is much less pleasurable. That allowed me to eat less and quit porn but also not enjoy anything I used to as much. I've even done coke and it barely hits.

In March 12th, I started taking 300mg, and in the 26th, 225mg, and still it won't go down. Back when I was taking 300mg before going to 450mg, I didn't have blood pressure issues. I'm scared my blood pressure will never return to normal levels, even if I stop taking venlafaxine."

135,1,"3 weeks ago, my doc put me back on the first med that ever helped me, Citalopram. I could definitely feel some improvement almost right away and I was optimistic.

Talking, smiling, and laughing. So charismatic. 

And I can‚Äôt even put my finger on when it where things fell off a Cliff. I have just been absolutely exhausted and I‚Äôm ready to give up. Why is this happening?

With that said I am EXTREMELY sensitive to meds and drugs in general so anyone who is stuck on the ""that's not even a therapeutic dose"" mindset, respectfully I don't need to hear from you.

I've been a depression, misery, irritability rut for several months now and SSRIs barely work for me, can't tolerate SNRIs at all (currently taking baby dose of lexapro). So, doc says let's try Oxcarbazepine. She didn't say to taper lamotrigine, just switch one for the other. It's only been 3 days but I feel like SHIT. Dysphoria, headache, shakey, very fatigued, working memory worse than ever, slight nausea, etc. So, I'm wondering if I'm having Lamotrigine withdraw or if starting Oxcarbazepine is just giving me the typical shitty couple weeks when starting a new med. Can anyone weigh in on this transition? Anyone take both?

Even if I write my doc right now I won't get a response for several days, so looking here for lived experience. Thanks!"
139,1,I have seen this psychiatrist twice for a very short visit. I told her my thoughts ruminate and although that is true my main concern right now is depression.

142,1,"Hi so I was on Wellbutrin before for around 2 years and it helped so much. This year I had trouble with school and just getting out of bed. The days I don‚Äôt take my adderall I straight up can not get out of bed sometimes. But if I take my adderall everyday, it stops working, so I save it for when I need to study. Wellbutrin made me actually do something with my day and I felt really happy when I was taking it. 3 weeks ago, I started taking it again. Mood wise it‚Äôs been great. I already feel more productive and actually enjoy things now. However, I started getting really bad memory loss while on it. I don‚Äôt remember having this last. While I took it to increase my grades, it did the exact opposite. My short term memory was drastically affected. I studied around 30 hours for a test, the most I ever studied. The Wellbutrin even made this possible, but I could not remember anything so matter how many times I redid a problem. I ended up getting a 38 when the average was like an 80. This is not normal for me at all. I usually find school pretty easy and am above the averages. I straight up thought I had a post concussion from a fall months ago or some other neurological issue. Then I read about memory loss on Wellbutrin. And holy shit did I not realize it could do that. I was so confused because I never experienced these side effects before and it‚Äôs for ADHD so I didn‚Äôt even realize. Basically I talked to my psychiatrist and she said to stop taking it. Now I‚Äôm at a loss cause I know I‚Äôm going to go back to having no motivation. I also got blood work done and a CT scan soon to rule out any other issues. I‚Äôve never really tried any other antidepressants and was wondering if there was anything that could work well with my situation. I just want to be motivated to do things without it drastically affecting my memory or cognition. "

145,1,What medications helped your SSRI-induced anhedonia and fatigue?
146,1,"After countless SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, SGAs, mood stabilizers, adjunct therapies, TMS, Ketamine (IV, intranasal, PO) and psychotherapy, I am at the end of what‚Äôs available to me (other than ECT which isn‚Äôt recommended for me) for treatment. I truly am refractory and I fully accept I am of the minority of people who simply do not improve or achieve remission.

My next step is palliative care for a consult or finding a palliative psychiatrist. Anyone have any experience with this? I know Canada is progressing toward MAID in SMI/SPMI but I‚Äôm not sure where they are in the process. Once it‚Äôs picked up some traction, it‚Äôs my plan to move and pursue this as an option.

Edit: The amount of downvotes on this post and/or my responses is bizzare. Is it the discomfort society has with the idea of MAID in psychiaric illness? Is it because I'm not willing to risk getting arrested importing illegal psychadelics from another state and/or country, because why would I care if I went to jail or not since I ""want to die anyway""? Is it because I won't risk my professional license, because why would I care if I lose my license since I ""want to die anyway""? It's worth noting that palliative care, whether in psychiatry or not, is NOT assisted death or dying, and MAID is different. MAID for psychiatric conditions does not yet have a concrete established set of guidelines or routine practice in Canda, as so far as I am aware, so what IS the issue with my wanting to pursue palliative measures until/or such a time MAID becomes appropriate?

There's a ton of judgment in here for a sub surrounded with discussion of MDD and concurrent depressive disorders. It's sad. I'm honestly sorry I brought it up, but I'll leave it here in case helpful information does find its way here and answer someone else's question.

The rest of you? Does being shitty to someone who is so clearly suffering from profound and untreatable depression help YOUR depression? If not, I'd maybe take a minute before bothering to hit the reply/downvote button, unless that's how you're currently deciding to treat your own depression. Yikes."
147,1,"Could this mix be considered a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDR)? AKA triple reuptake inhibitor? Cocaine is a triple inhibitor, and in the early 1900s, it was used as an antidepressant with mixed or not-so great results. Obviously, with due regard for the differences between drugs, because bupropion mildly inhibits dopamine, I think.
I've taken this mix, and it's quite stimulating. Ideal for my depression, which manifests as sleeping and eating all day.

It seems connected to the overall blunting of sensory input too.

I've even tried Ketamine IV treatement, and it was *not* worth it or even all that helpful after the first visit... Actually, it probably made my hoarding *worse* and the biggest takeaway from Ketamine has been the realization that I will probably never be able to enter a happy place until I due, but even then I will most likely be alone.
But dying is not really an option since I'm a coward, afraid of pain, and I am cognizant enough that any failed attempts ever would just make my life 10x worse & probably Actually unbearable, inaddition to crippling debt from being imprisoned from telling the truth but not actually being a threat to myself. (**I'm in the US & have been involuntarily committed before for basically saying a stupid hyperbole that you keep belittling my support system, but without it I'd probably jump off a build.... which was taken as a stupid literal statement & cost me 5 days + a 'discounted' bill of $1800, all awhile I was worried about missing work because that's how serious my threat to myself was--not at all or as serious as my worry of missing work... but Acadia health system has to bilk my insurance & fill beds.)

ANYWAY, super tangent but the point is that I've tried various things... and in the past, I tried Wellbutrin, which seemed to help mentally with the depression in the 24 hours I started taking it,  before I developed rather bad *Hives*... since I'm allergic to it apparently, in the same way I'm allergic to anchovy / sardines in developing hives.

I'm also allergic to Lamotrigine.

Anyway, my doctor prescribed Avelity, which I was desperate enough to try... the thing with Avelity is that it's not the same exact compound, but contains some form of Wellbutrin.
Sooooo I didn't develop hives initially, but it felt like under my skin there was some kind of immune response / warmth or tingle, in a weird way... my immune system just felt activated someway??

Anyway, my first period with it... my breasts were more sensitive & my period was just weird... like more intense & later. My period has always been pretty rough (& requiring 3-4 advil every 3-4 hours awake the first couple days due to pain). It feels like I had more  estrogen or some kind of hormones, I'm not sure. More irritated at work/home/in general.

However, it seemed to help a little with me being less depressed & less anxiety to a degree, albeit I still was depressed... I'd say if my regular degree of depression had me at a 0 and either me being 1/2 depressed or just normal was a 1... I'd be at 1/4 of what I'd need to be to be either normal or only 1/2 depressed.

So Avelity did help, albeit not enough... so my doctor suggested me taking 1 in the morning & 1 in the afternoon.

HOWEVER, I never got to the point where I was able to try that amount, due to adverse reactions I have been increasingly developing with Avelity.

See, before my doctor made that suggestion, I had talked to her about that I've been experiencing Constipation on Avelity.
And it's been a continuous issue at work where at least 1x a week, I'm in & out of the bathroom trying to go & taking prune juice... before praying & making shady offering deals to God in prayer as things I'll add on as stuff to give up during Lent, if I could just get help... passing something probably 3"" √ó 7"" and guaranteed to automatically clog a toliet, unless it is physically broken up. Also, the tail end is a bit bloody each time.

BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE, so the last time I had my period, the day before after taking the bus somewhere I was rather nauseous... and then my period started and later in the day, I was nauseous again and then vomited in the garden at work. Then I threw up several times into a bag while driving on the way home; threw up after sleeping several hours  after I drank a little carbonated water; and after sleeping some more, sipped some water & threw up my empty stomach some more. I didn't take any pills the next day & just slept. Then I was able to barely eat & went into work.

By this time, my period was finishing up, but I'm pretty sure I stopped taking Avelity during the rest my period. 

I started Avelity up again at a regular dose if just 1 a day, and one afternoon, I took the extra dose my doctor recommended. Later on the very next morning after taking  the morning dose, I started to get nauseous and dizzy at work, and couldn't eat much at lunch... but thankfully, I didn't actually throw up and managed to make it through the day.

As a result, I immediately stopped taking the Avelity at 2x dose, but since then, I'll still have bouts of morning nausea after taking Avelity.

I'm also more irritable / annoyed by things & holding in a desire to scream about snall things at times ...
And I'm just pooping more and more constipated.

It feels like my gut is damaged & just not digesting things.

I'm really reminded of issues I've had throughout my childhood/teenage years of being Constipated... which ended up going away after going gluten-free, which I've taken as a sign that I'm at the very least gluten-intolerant as I tend to get constipated after consuming gluten.

Soooo right now, I'm a little less depressed/anxious, but I'm also rather tired tired tired just in general. Basically, I'm not a person who takes Caffeine & Celsius in the morning, but now I feel like I *have* to open a 16oz can in the morning & drink half AM and half early PM just to get going & make it through the day. AND I've just been having a harder time getting going/ out of bed more in the morning, which has always been a general problem, but it has become a worse problem since taking Avelity, so now I'm more late to work.

I also just don't feel any more  motivated to get stuff done just in general that I need to get done for deadlines... so I'm dragging it out.  
And my issues after work--moving my body and doing stuff--have gotten worse. By doing stuff, I mean that I lack the energy to drive home. But I can't just stay in my car until my shift the next day, so I have to drive home... so I will drive 1-2 hours later after being on my phone (**conservative since today I know for certain I sat there 2.5 hours). Usually I actually start driving because my phone us down to 15%, so it's like I have to then...

Aaaand I feel a need for more protein. 
Aaaaaand despite the digestive and other issues, my pants feel tighter, so I also gained weight.

In any case, today during my last session of praying to the heavens to go to the bathroom.... part of my deal was that if I just could get some help üôÉ so I can go back on the floor at work, then in addition to 2 other promises, I will also not take Avelity anymore... because I can't do this/dealing with Avelity's shit anymore.

ADDITIONALLY, recently, I've been itching myself at times and at times just want to peel my skin off.
Little things like my normal necklaces and my ankles&feet in my socks are rather irritating.
It's not quite hives... but it's beginning to become similar after I scratch myself theres, but to a lesser extent... but  it's weird that it's becoming lik3 this in a delayed way 45 days or so after I first started taking it...
But it's almost like after building up my intake of the ingredients to a certain extent, my immune system decided it's a good idea to strike back... or the histamines built up to the extent they are evolving to the next level??

I'm most likely intolerant to the ingredients of Avelity. 

However, in terms of the depression itself, it was a step in the right direction.

As someone with ADHD and COMT genes issues, I definitely have a dopamine regulation issue.

Sooo I'm wondering if there's anything similar in terms of working on dopamine that us like Wellbutrin &/or Avelity, but different enough that I might not have an immune system response to it."
155,1,"I have been on Wellbutrin for almost four years now. In these last few months I have noticed that the med seemed to have lost its effectivness quite a bit. With that I mean that it doesn't energize me or give me the amount of motivation that it used to. So I did some research on different kinds of supplements that could potentially enhance the effects of Wellbutrin and make it work better. And I did actually find a supplement called Avena Sativa and I tried it today with my usual regimen which is Wellbutrin and caffeine pills. I noticed a huge difference today and it was crazy. It made it actually work a lot better. I had a lot more energy and motivation doing things today than yesterday. I could also focus a lot better and doing boring tasks was so much easier today. I also noticed that my mood was a lot better today than it usually is. I have tried L Tyrosine before which Is what people usually recommend to enhance Wellbutrin but it did not help me or make any kind of difference whatsoever. Also L Tyrosine raised my norepinephrine levels too which is not something that I really want because Wellbutrin and caffeine already raises norepinephrine levels and it became just too much norepinephrine adding L Tyrosine to that. Avena Sativa is definitely a lot better than L Tyrosine is for me atleast.

I did some reserach on Avena Sativa and its pharmacology. It seems that Avena Sativa works as a MAO B inhibitor. MAO B inhibitors prevent the breakdown of dopamine. That could be an explanation for why Wellbutrin felt a lot stronger today than it usually does. Avena Sativa really boosted Wellbutrin's effects and I would highly recommend it especially if your struggling with lack of motivation. I'm not planning on using Avena Sativa everyday because I know I would build up tolerance very fast If I did that. I'm planning on using it only once or twice a week. I hope that's not too often to use it once or twice a week. By the way I have also tried Mucuna Pruriens and it did work for me but I found that it raised my dopamine levels too much. I got hallucinations and paranoia from combining it with Wellbutrin. It also gave me involutary movements and dystonia which are symptoms that made me worried about using it again. Would definitely not recommend anyone to use Mucuna Pruriens to raise your dopamine levels!"
156,1,"This has been a remarkably effective combo. Savella is a unique a serotonin, reuptake inhibitor in many ways. 

If feels almost like a stimulant. It arguably has stronger reuptake for norepinephrine than serotonin. And had a short 3-5h 1/2 life. It‚Äôs also a mild NMDA antagonist 

Also I‚Äôll note that though Savella is incredibly expensive in the US even with insurance, it seems to be a common in Europe, Asia, and India for only $20 a month. (in most states you can buy medication‚Äôs for personal use for elsewhere) 

Savella  also has a discount program

Namenda (Memantine) is easy to get from abroad or neurotropic sites

Nortriptyline can be given by basically any doctor or nurse 


I‚Äôll keep you posted but so far it‚Äôs been remarkably effective "
157,1,Does anyone have positive Wellbutrin stories? Did it help unwanted suicidal thoughts images? Did it help your motivation? 
158,1,"31 yr old male, depression, trouble concentrating, never had a good night's sleep, never felt awake, mind always feel foggy. I have felt these as far back as I can remember. I have had five psychiatrists and have gone through 15 meds, ranging from Trintellix, Modafinil, Rexulti, Vyvanse, and many many more. I also got diagnosed with binge eating disorder, and have been taking vyvanse, Prozac, and Wellbutrin but i still can't keep the weight off. I have even tried a full course of rTMS, and still nothing.

Recently started ketamine, had 5 sessions so far and still nothing. My doctor told me if I do not see any improvement by the 4th treatment, I should stop. I am so drained from constantly trying something new and not having anything work. 

I don't know what to do anymore. All my psychiatrists have eventually had to say that they do not know what else to do.

I wish i could end everything. "
159,1,I will start it soon ( 25 mg and later 50 mg )and looking for experiences
160,1,"Hi all,

For anxious depression with OCD thoughts my doc prescribed :

- Clomipramine 150 mg
- Bupropion 150 mg
- lacmital 25 mg first week and 50 mg second week
- clonazepam 0.5 mg once daily"
161,1,"Hi All,

I am hoping to get some advice from this community pertaining my current situation.

First off, i (32/m) am diagnosed with a ""mood disorder"", ADHD, CPSTD, OCD My psychiatrist did not really give what mood disorder do i have, but he mentioned that it is in a spectrum, which i do understand what he meant by that.

I am seeing my psychiatrist in a private hospital instead of a public hospital, as the treatment in the public hospital is very bad. And there are no insurance coverage for any psychiatric conditions in my country, despite my country claiming we have the best healthcare in the world.

So i am playing close to 1200 USD a month just on medications.

# Treatment Resistance

To add on to the mix, i have significant treatment resistance. My country does not offer any other treatment expect for Esketamine and ECT
I am not keen on ECT as the risk is too much, while Esketamine is extremely expensive, i am looking at 45,000 USD every 6 months.
Neighboring countries do offer other treatment for both long term and short term; such as cannabis. But it is a crime to consume cannabis regardless where i am consumed it in my country. 

# Relapse:

My Previous relapse was in Early September 2024 to Late October 2024 And now i am back to relapsing, in less than 5 months.
When i ""relapse"", i experience the following:

## Depressive mood:
Sudden and rapid decline of mood depressive episode.

## Su1cidal thoughts:
Uninitiated SUi thoughts, that rapid fires.
I also experience this where i am subconsciously finding for something to be depressed about, which then trigger more su thoughts

Before i seeked treatment many years ago, i was abusing alot of alcohol
i would sit down and consume alcohol while watching a suicide scene in a movie replayed on loop over and over again.
(I am 2 years sober now, thanks to vyvanse)

But as of recent relapse i have been craving alcohol. Thankfully i have not fallen into the trap.

## Crying spells
It either i feel like crying and i cant cry, or i just randomly start crying
Current Medication stop working
While on stimulant


While i am on my sitmulat, i am still experincing the affects of the relapse but i would be able to get out of bed, and get things done, the moment i stop doing activities even for a minute, everything will come rushing back, this also occurs when the simulant's effect is done for the day

## Current Medication
I am currently on the following medication and dose i am taking which was altered every couple of weeks when my relapse started about 3 weeks back

- Venlafaxine (VIEPAX) - 300MG; taken in the morning
- Vyvanse - 70MG Taken in the morning 
(i am allowed to skip, i was only able to write this post as it took it in the morning.)
- Olanzapine (Zydis) 10MG; taken at night
- Mirtazpine (Rameron) 30MG; taken at night

## Unable to sleep
Even with Olanzapine and Mirtazpine, i find myself unable to sleep. I had tried to take Dayvigo, which sometimes works and sometimes it does not.
I had tried Xanax 1.5MG, which worked initally after the 3rd time taking it,
it stopped working, now it does nothing to me.
I had tried Clonazepam, which had the same issue as xanax. Essentially all benzos do not work for me.

With the current medication cocktail, in the initial days, it seemed to had been working, my mood was somewhat stable.

However, as the days went, it stopped working.
Then i went back to my doc, he altered the dosage And Same behavior, worked for a few days and then BAM! stopped working,

And i honestly at my wits end, i am very lost. I do not know what to do anymore. I have already missed a month of work, in my current situation i cant go back to work, that will definitely take a hit on my career
And yes, i have tried therapy, again i am resistant to it, to make it worst, there is no requirment for theapist to be licenced in my country as such there are many ""scams""


I can't eat, i can't sleep well, i cant do anything.
What should i do. I really do not know what is going on with me, and i am really exhausted and i want to give up

Has anyone been thru this and managaed to fix it?"
162,1,"I have been on desvenlafaxine for more than a year now, I think. 

It reduced impulsive behavior in me and I didn't expect that when I got on it. 

I think that happened because it is also an NRI. 

What do you think? "
163,1,Most similar antidepressant to benzodiazapine? 
164,1,"Clomipramine also has a strong action on norepinephrine and serotonin unlike other TCAs, which are already known to be the class with the highest risk of mania in bipolar patients. It makes sense to say that it is probably the drug with the highest risk of mania. But how is it possible that *25%* of *unipolar* depressed patients developed mania? I found an article on pubmed that says exactly this, but it seems so strange to me. Can someone help me understand?

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/435016/"
165,1,"I‚Äôve been in a bit of a rut lately‚Äîlow motivation, flat mood, everything just feeling ‚Äúoff.‚Äù  
Last night, I didn‚Äôt sleep. Not on purpose at first, but once I realized I was up late, I leaned into it and just stayed awake.

What surprised me was the shift around early morning.

* I started feeling **clearer**, lighter‚Ä¶ even **hopeful**.
* Music sounded better, my thoughts were more focused, and I actually felt‚Ä¶ *alive* for the first time in weeks.
* It faded after some hours, but the contrast was hard to ignore.

I ended up looking it up and found [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3086142/) on how sleep deprivation can **temporarily boost mood**‚Äîeven in people with depression.

Study link: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3086142/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3086142/)

Turns out:

* It activates reward-related areas in the brain (like VTA, striatum, insula)
* At the same time, it reduces connectivity with parts that normally ‚Äúfilter‚Äù emotional reactions
* This leads to stronger emotional responses, especially to positive things
* Basically, it gives you temporary escape from emotional flatness

The paper also mentions how this effect might help explain why some depressed patients feel better after a night of no sleep‚Äîeven though it usually fades once normal sleep resumes.

I‚Äôm not suggesting this as a long-term strategy (I crashed hard later in the day), but I‚Äôm wondering:

* Has anyone here experimented with **wake therapy** or **intentional sleep deprivation** as a short-term reset?
* Any regimens that helped extend the positive effect (like light therapy, morning walks, meds, etc.)?
* And if this works for some, could it be worth building around intentionally‚Äîlike on low days when nothing else is helping?

Would love to hear if anyone else has tried this or has thoughts on how to use it more safely."
166,1,"I‚Äôve been on many medication‚Äôs for depression, I haven‚Äôt tried lithium, but I‚Äôve heard it can help with depression and was thinking of possibly adding it on as an augment, has this helped anyone with low mood feel any better? Thanks in advance!"
167,1,"I'm thinking about talking to my psychiatrist about this medication. I've never taken benzos before, so I'm not sure what to expect. I'm taking paroxetine which helps me with panic symptoms, but I suffer from severe social anxiety and avoidance personality traits, I spent most time at home without social contact or friends"
168,1,"After a TON of experimenting with robust regimens and poly pharmacy, I‚Äôve gone back to the first drug I was ever given for depression. It worked for me but I never really gave it proper due at the time and went off it. Citalopram helped me in 2011 and allowed me to get my shit together and move to NYC for my acting career. 

14yrs later, I‚Äôve finally just gone back to it. Simplicity. And I swear I‚Äôm having a real response of some kind on my 4th day. Part of that may be that I didn‚Äôt wash out from my previous meds and just made a switch, but still‚Ä¶

The most notable thing that happens when I am on the right med is that I start sleeping better and having real dreams again that I can remember. They are often chaotic and dysohoric in the beginning but the more I sleep the more my mind starts to reprocess everything. My dreams are often littered with the most important people and places to me: My deceased mother, my ex girlfriend, HS sweetheart, old best mates, high school, etc. It‚Äôs like I am reconsolidating all my memories and my identity is fully restored. Not all the way yet‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs always a good sign I am headed toward remission: the dreaming. So I am hopeful.

California Rocket Fuel and other 4 headed poly pharmacies didn‚Äôt work, but just Citalopram HBR 20mg does. So interesting. "
169,1,"So currently on 30mg of lexapro and Wellbutrin, been taking it for abt a year and a half now. A while ago lexapro used to work wonders for me, it relieved most of my symptoms and made things actually bareable but some time last year it completely stopped working. The only reason I'm still taking it is cuz I don't wanna withdrawl and no other medication has ever helped me so I don't really want to just give up on it. I've taken at least 5 before and none have had any effect expert lexapro. I'm so confused help. :("

171,1,"I'm taking a combination of Effexor (Venlafaxine) and Ludiomil (Maprotiline), a variation of the venlafaxine + mirtazapine combo known as California Rocket Fuel. I'm also taking 36mg Concerta (Methylphenidate) for motivation and extra energy.

I'm taking it for extreme fatigue and sleepiness, the problem is that the venlafaxine causes my blood pressure to skyrocket, specially the diastolic. So my doctor keeps on wanting to lower my dose.

I'm currently in a loop where he tells me to lower my dose, I start feeling worse, so he ups my dose, and I start to feel better, so he lowers my dose again."
172,1,"Hi everyone,

I have ADHD and Depression that‚Äôs manifested as low energy, low motivation, apathy, and low confidence for the past 5+ years or so.

I‚Äôve been taking ADs or Stimulants since I was 15 and initially diagnosed with ADHD. It started with Adderall and then Vyvanse - it was fantastic at lifting my mood, seemingly fixing all of my ADHD issues, but the crash was always brutal. I‚Äôm still on a low dose of Vyvanse now about 13 years later. It‚Äôs been extremely helpful for my concentration and mental energy, even if it only works only ~6 hours a day even at higher doses.

When I turned 21, I was diagnosed with Depression/Anxiety and I started on my antidepressant journey. I started with Wellbutrin and it seemed like that was the trick - much greater energy, motivation, no apathy, and joy. That was until 3+ years later when it seemed to poop out. 

Since moving off of Wellbutrin I‚Äôve given a solid trial of Parnate, Selegiline, Desipramine, Pristiq and Vortioxetine with limited success. The one drug that made a big impact was Nortriptyline - it felt even stronger than Wellbutrin. But unfortunately I had side effects of anger at high doses and addictive behavior even at the lowest doses so I had to stop. I wasn‚Äôt able to control my eating or masturbation after enough time on it.


Now, I‚Äôm trialing Atomoxetine (3 weeks at 80 mg) while staying on a low dose of Vyvanse and I feel tired, unmotivated, and depleted of energy. 

Given my trials of various meds my psych mentioned low dose Antipsychotics (Vraylar, Ariprazole) or even Lamictal to see if either could put a dent in my low energy depression. I‚Äôm debating these options or to just go back onto Wellbutrin on top of my other meds.

Can anyone with similar experiences or advice chime in? Would love to get some feedback or any additional info here. I‚Äôve been down so many rabbit holes around drugs, I just need some guidance here."
173,1,"I'm getting really impatient because it's been over a year and a half since the last time I felt genuine interest, motivation, or happiness. I've been on my current regimen for 2 weeks and I'm like 90% sure it's not going happening"
174,1,"I have rls at night that due to ssri‚Äôs I‚Äôm pretty sure, my Dr prescribed me this to take after I told him I‚Äôve been experiencing rls. I‚Äôm a bit apprehensive to take as the side effect profile is similar to antipsychotics which I told him I‚Äôd prefer to stay away from. So I‚Äôm curious what your thoughts are as per title. Tia "
175,1,Just wondering  if there is a nootropic or stimulant that only releases norepinephrine and barely interact with dopamine? 
176,1,Hi
177,1,"I‚Äôve been trial-erroring for about a year. I started on 5mg trintellix for a month and noticed cognitive benefits with less negative thoughts. Added 100SR once a day Wellbutrin to target adhd symptoms with persistent boredom and inability to get excited about anything. My main issue is also anxiety. (I‚Äôm also on guanfacine 1mg)

Around 17 days ago, I switched to 150XL and bumped my trintellix to 10mg. The XL helped with inconsistent mood/slow release and jitters, but I was experiencing sleep disturbances (waking up after a few hours), I‚Äôve also been experiencing slightly more ‚Äòflatness‚Äô w/ mood swings. 

Yesterday, 15mg of remeron was added. I was really excited for this bc of deep sleep improvements and anti-anxiety/depression properties. I slept the entire next day though and felt even more flat (prob cause of tiredness)‚Ä¶

Does anybody have experience with this combo or trintellix/Wellbutrin? The trintellix shape is uneven, making it hard to cut in half. I tried one day and felt slightly better, although could‚Äôve been placebo. Will this get better? 

"
178,1,"I have been on most antidepressants available in the UK with some great results especially with trazodone and amitryptyline but always with a side effect of a serious hairloss. I have pcos and my hairloss is severe already. I soooo much want to just take medication, I have accepted now that I will continue relapsing and will not be able to maintain a will to live and enjoy life through lifestyle changes alone regardless of how much I try (will continue trying). It's been a lifelong battle, I feel so regretful that I just cannot get better. I am obsessed with reading about possible new medications and it's release day with the hope it may work for me. Along most medications, I have also tried ketamine, lsd, mushrooms. I would like to ask if there any antidepressant anyone took that helped with their hairloss or at least did not affect their exciting hairloss as much? I am aware these would be a unique experiences as most antidepressants cause hairloss. I would love to hear from people who struggled with hairloss before stating antidepressants."
179,1,"I am taking trazodone 50 mg but I have to stop it due to high price and not helping too much with insomnia due to clomipramine 150 mg.

181,1,Hi
182,1,Hi.
183,1,The goal is to improve sleep maintenance and reduce awakenings. I'm not sure if this switch would be effective. Has anyone here taken doxepin to refine sleep structure?
184,1,"I started to take Amitriptyline 25mg, its incredible activating, i cant sleep and need to dose 20mg of valium with 30mg of midazolam to be able to sleep 5 hours.

But this antidepressive seems to be working and make me get out of bed and do some basic life shores. Doctors do not understand this is a potent antidepressive and dismiss it as old medicine from the 60s that are outdated, they couldnt be more wrong.

If you are on a severe depression please consider this drug, it could be the one. Lets all hope!"
185,1,"I'm planning to switch from Venlafaxine to Tranylcypromine (Parnate) and would appreciate any feedback on my plan. I'm having to self-manage this transition due to access issues in my country, but I've researched using Dr. Gillman's resources and other materials. I'm hoping to do this during a 1-2 month break from work so I can be stable on parnate when returning.

Current meds:
- Effexor ER 225mg
- Pramipexole 2mg (maintain throughout transition)
- As needed propranolol 20mg, clonazepam 0.5mg, zolpidem 10mg

Week 1-3: Start Nortriptyline and Effexor taper
- Start nortriptyline 25mg at bedtime while continuing venlafaxine 225mg and pramipexole 2mg
- Gradually reduce venlafaxine to 150mg to 75mg to 37.5mg over 3 weeks
- Increase nortriptyline to 50mg as venlafaxine reaches 37.5mg

Week 4: Washout period
- Discontinue venlafaxine completely; maintain nortriptyline 50mg
- Allow 7-day washout period for venlafaxine and metabolites (5 half lives = approx 3 days + buffer)

Week 5-6: MAOI titration
- Begin parnate 10mg in morning; continue nortriptyline 50mg
- Increase parnate gradually: 20mg to 30mg to 40mg with 3-4 days at each dose
- Take first parnate dose within 2 hours of waking; second dose 4-6 hours later

Week 7-8: Stabilization
- Consider final parnate increase to 50-60mg based on response and tolerance
- Begin gradual taper of nortriptyline
- Consider gradual taper of pramipexole to simplify

Monitoring plan:
- Check BP twice daily (sitting then standing)
- Increase salt intake to 5-10g daily if needed for orthostatic hypotension
- Use propranolol if needed for physical anxiety or BP fluctuations
- Follow tyramine diet restrictions
- Occasional Clonazepam and Zolpidem use if needed for anxiety/insomnia during withdrawal and titration
- Consider slowing Effexor taper if withdrawal is very bad 

Has anyone done a similar transition with a nortriptyline bridge? The biggest concerns I have are managing the venlafaxine withdrawal and ensuring adequate washout before starting the MAOI but I'm also not exactly sure on the nortriptyline dose/timing. This is my first time using a MAOI,  if anyone has experience with pramipexole and parnate together long term that would be helpful.

I know this isn't ideal without medical supervision, but I'm stuck in this situation. I'd appreciate any experiences or suggestions, especially any overlooked risks."

187,1,"Hello everyone! I am now 30 years old, and since I was 15, I have been experiencing panic attacks.  
Initially, everything felt like a walk in the park, but over the years, it developed into panic disorder.  
Despite being very energetic, having a high libido, going to the gym, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, panic disorder persists and significantly limits my life.

190,1,Currently is my third week on 150 mg and having very bad days
191,1,"I used to suffer from depression, I also suffer from anxiety and OCD.

I'm on a quite of a drug cocktail: clomipramine, lamotrigine, mianserin, propranolol, pregabalin plus diazepam as needed. Used to take a couple antipsychotics but thankfully was able to quit them. 

I wouldn't say that I'm depressed like I used to be. I'm still not fully happy about where I am in life but hey... we'll get there. Overall I'm so much much better than I was a year ago.

However I hate to say it but I genuinely feel so dumb sometimes. My short term memory is basically non existent. I struggle with focus too, emotional numbness, and generally I'm much slower than I used to be. 

I don't know if I'll ever be able to quit all these meds, I attend therapy so hopefully some of them? For now I'd like to get off lamotrigine. But I'm scared that all these meds already ""fried"" my brain and I'll never be as smart as I used to be.

I guess that being dumber is better than being suicidal, living in a constant distress like I used to. 

Has anybody here who quit their meds, gotten back to their previous cognitive level?

I also take piracetam but tbh it's hard to say if it works."
192,1,"Hi there,

I am curious about experience reports from those who regularly take ADHD medication for depression. Which medication do you take, how often (daily or as needed) and which dosage?"
193,1,"For me it tends to depend on the med, but usually the answer is yes. 

Antipsychotics are the most difficult ones that can take upto a month to adjust. But to become nicely functional maybe even 3 months or more.

Although less for other meds. 

I recently got off olanzapine after being on it for 4-5 years. I needed entire month of February to get better. But I have started to feel confident again. 

But still, in order to make progress in my career and work more on my health, I think I would need a couple of months.

I'm no longer feeling the constant body pain and fatigue though, so I am happy. "
194,1,"From 2017-2022 I was a pretty regular user and abuser of Kratom.  After countless attempts to quitting only to restart again, I finally went on suboxone to get off it. But let me back up‚Ä¶

My first year on Kratom definitely turbulent. It was a mess but when it kicked in it worked great. I know it because I did things I haven‚Äôt since or otherwise. Toward the end of 2017 I decided to go on ‚Äúnormal‚Äù meds to treat my depression and was put on Effexor. Effexor had no noticeable impact even after a dose increase to 75mg, so I gave into temptation and bought some Kratom. Same brand, same strain (Plantation WMD) that worked for me all year:
nothing. I tried re-dosing an hour later, nothing days and weeks passed as I tried to get it to ‚Äúkick-in‚Äù and nothing worked. I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it, but it sure like Effexor was blocking or severely weakening the Kratom.

Years later into 2020 after a solid 2+ yr hiatus..again barely working at all. And not just Kratom, any and all stimulant medication. I looked online everywhere for an explanation but have to read anything that would lead to such a profound alteration. This issue is exactly how I ended up ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt have the same effect for me as it once did and that drove me crazy. I kept  taking more doses and trying different kinds to get in to kick in.

Anyway I am STILL stuck on this merry-go-round. Adderall helps me a lot but I swear that it *seems* as Effexor and other antidepressants including Prozac, Welbutrin and Cymbalta have had the same effect. But I really do need depression treatment to have a full response and get my life under control. But it just feels like it has to be one way or the other. And I‚Äôd think if this type of thing was even vaguely common it would be all over this board.

Is there any valid reason this could be happening to me? Maybe I have to let the antidepressant kick in first and THEN start a stimulant? I dunno. I‚Äôm so frustrated. My body just seems too broken. No matter what they throw at me I still can‚Äôt hang. "

199,1,"I was very surprised by the degree of structural similarity between venlafaxine and tramadol. 
In fact a decent amount of its efficacy as an antidepressant goes away with naloxone. 

Anyway both undergo  cytochrome P450‚Äìdriven O‚Äîbasically, a methoxy group (-OCH‚ÇÉ) gets stripped down to a hydroxyl (-OH). 

tramadol to , O‚Äëdesmethyltramadol, a significantly more potent Œº‚Äëopioid receptor agonist. 5x more potent roughly 

With venlafaxine, this ‚Äëdemethylation transforms it into desvenlafaxine,

desvenlafaxine is a less popular drug given 25mg, 50mg or 100mg 

Only up to 50mg for depression, to 100mg for pain. 

I was very surprised to stumble across this 

Can anyone chime in who‚Äôs used odmst, desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine"
200,1,"If I‚Äôm on 300mg of Wellbutrin could I add DXM for augmentation? Since auvelity is 210mg of Wellbutrin and 90mg of DXM per day, I could only take 60mg to get similar levels."
201,1,"Hey all,

I‚Äôve been on sertraline for 3.5 years to deal with OCD symptoms and a restless mind, but a year ago I decided to transition to life without meds. The taper off was fine, but a couple of months off of them, I started feeling like nothing brought me joy anymore. For some context: I don‚Äôt like my job, but it‚Äôs what‚Äôs keeping me in the UK through my work visa (I'm American). So, I decided to get back on meds, but switched to escitalopram (Lexapro), thinking it‚Äôd be more targeted towards my anxiety. While I generally liked sertraline, I found it made me less energetic, but surprise surprise -- so does Lexapro.

I started with 5mg of Lexapro, but after a really rough stretch at work and a three-week holiday back in the US, I ended up increasing to 10mg when I returned to Britain. While in the US, I had spent most of the time panicking about what to do next to no avail -- when I returned to the UK, I felt so miserable I thought 10mg was necessary to avoid quitting my job and figure things out.

It‚Äôs been okay, but now I feel super dissociative and have been relying on cannabis more than ever. I decided to quit smoking a week ago after 5 years of nightly use (with some breaks here and there), planning to stay THC-free until Easter. Notably my consistent cannabis use started about a year before getting on meds, but during that time I took a multi-month break and felt more depressed than ever.

Now that it‚Äôs just the Lexapro, I feel basically no motivation or desire to do anything except sleep or scroll. I‚Äôm not sure if this is from weed withdrawal (getting to smoke every night was a big source of motivation for things like writing, filmmaking, and chores) or if the Lexapro just isn‚Äôt the right fit for me. The problem is, I‚Äôm hesitant to switch back to sertraline or taper right now because I‚Äôm in the middle of a rare sobriety streak and at a major crossroads in my life: I‚Äôve been accepted to an MFA program in film back in the US, and I need to make a huge decision about leaving my job / life in Britain.

I just don‚Äôt have the energy to figure out things like loans for film school, or even make any decisions about my future. All I want to do is scroll and do nothing, which I really hate as someone who prides himself on learning and living an active life.

Has anyone been through something like this and can offer advice as to whether it's worth it to taper again or switch back to sertraline? I‚Äôve found doctors here to be unhelpful with med switches, and my therapist is focused on other issues and hasn‚Äôt been able to offer much guidance on this. Any advice would be really appreciated!"
202,1,"Hi all, first time poster here. I'm curious what everyones medication journey has been like, I'll try and clarify what I mean as best I can...

I have had anxiety, depression all my life. I'm 36 F.  As an adult I have also been diagnosed with ADD. 

I've noticed a lot of people are on high doses of their meds. The highest dose of any med I've been on is 50 mg.  I've been on a lot of meds  and I've had different doctors. I get A LOT of push back when I want to up my meds or if I suggest taking more than one, ex something to treat my depression and ADD.   

Nothing I've been on works. I feel like I'm navigating this incorrectly, I've been on Celexa, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Xanax, and at least 2 others I can't remember. Should I be seeing a psychiatrist instead of a general doctor?  I keep being told throughout the years that a psychiatrist is unnecessary. "
203,1,"Hey guys, I (37M)have an appointment with my doc tomorrow.

I have a long history of recurrent major depressive disorder and comorbid ADHD. I have failed many SSRIs and SNRIs and my genesight test said I have the a short serotonin allele that may make me less responsive to such meds. 

I am currently on Adderall IR 40mg and having a positive response to that. It definitely helps my focus and energy. It somewhat helps my mood, but I feel my depression is still holding me back from a full response. Wellbutrin hasn‚Äôt seemed to pair very well with stimulants for me.

My doc is willing to work with me but not a psych by trade so I can only expect so much. I‚Äôve basically narrowed it down to these 3

Trintellix, Viibryd, or Remeron.

Trintellix is very intriguing to me but my concern there is long term cost. 

Viibryd makes sense to me as it‚Äôs in between. Newer, basically the Buspar + Lexapro combo in one pill from what I‚Äôve read. 

Remeron makes a lot of sense as it‚Äôs outside the SSRI drug class. It also tends to help with sleep which has been a chronic issue for me. I‚Äôve read mixed results about combining it with stimulant medication, but I know my outlook would at least be a bit more optimistic if I knew I was actually trying something NEW, as opposed to the same old same old.

Any opinions would be appreciated!"
204,1,Does your depression progressed over time? I suffer from it for the last 13 years and the last 3 years were the worst. I spend half of that time in psychiatric hospitals. And now I'm in the worst place mentally in my whole life. I'm very treatment resistant. I'm scared how it all will end for me. So how to be hopeful. I fight everyday and each year I suffer more and more.
205,1,"I suffer from depression for the last 13 years. It's very treatment resistant. I've tried every med I've heard of. It is the worst in fall and winter. It sometimes gets better in spring and summer but very rarely. I had over 10 or 15 hospital stays, the longest lasted 8.5 months. I had ECT without any luck. Two months ago I left hospital and my depression didn't improved at all. Now, my new doctor puts me on new cocktail of meds. Then, ketamine. But I'm not sure I will qualify and I don't believe it will help (I've tried snorting street ketamine and there was no result). 
Maybe depression improves in two weeks (new cocktail of meds) maybe in a month (spring) maybe in 3 months( ketamine) maybe in a year or maybe never. My depression is very severe, I've never worked and it gave me PTSD (I have nightmares about the darkests times). The suffering is unbearable. 
I'm just scared to commit suicide, to be alone in this moment or to end up in psychiatric hospital when I fail and there is one very scary psychiatric hospital near the place I live where you are scared someone may murder you and stole everything from you. 
I want to live, be happy. My boyfriend is fantastic,  supports me so much, cares for me. He loves me very much and I love him too. I want to live but not with this crippling depression. All I want in the last 5 months is to finally die.

A few days ago, I tried saffron extract, and it instantly improved my mood and outlook, but it feels somewhat weak. I also wonder about tolerance buildup and long-term safety.  

Since saffron affects serotonin, dopamine, and NMDA receptors, I‚Äôm looking for a prescription AD with similar effects. Would something like Vortioxetine be comparable? Has anyone tried both saffron and other ADs and can share their experience?"

208,1,"It's also called pseudodementia and can make you quite dysfunctional in your day to day life. From what I've read, you can regain cognitive function if your depression is successfully treated. But what about people experiencing treatment-resistant depression for a very long time (years or decades). I want know if someone here managed to restore most of their cognitive function at any point in their life by treating their depression.

I haven't looked at any research but according to some neuroscientists, restoring cognitive function is harder if your depression is chronic and severe enough. I mean it makes sense why it may be so but I just wanna hear stories from actual patients, if any.

I know this sub might not be a good place to ask this because people who got better and treated their depression are less likely to hang out on this sub to answer questions like these. 



"
209,1,"Vortioxetine is supposed to have less side effects than SSRIs,  especially sexual and be pro cognitive with less apathy

Selegiline oral could be less effective than patch but I can get over the counter. Is is supposed to be pro sexual but no serotonin effect at dioses below 10 mg so maybe more simulation but less mood regulation.

Both can be not good for anxiety. 

I could use bupropion but I am afraid of elevating my already high blood pressure. 

Suggestions or experiences?

I'm still struggling everyday with apathy, avolition and anhedonia.

I already have caffeine with Wellbutrin and that used to help somewhat before but now caffeine doesn't seem to do much anymore.

I really believe social media is a huge reason for our anhedonia, constantly digesting very stimulating content has to be affecting our ability to receive pleasure from the real world (hobbies and social interactions)

I think stopping social media in conjunction with medication is a step in the right direction for solving anhedonia. We can‚Äôt expect a medication to work if we‚Äôre not even making changes to our environment. "

230,1,"The only currently available NDRI antidepressant is Wellbutrin and let's be honest now Wellbutrin is not a great drug. At these doses Wellburin is prescribed it is a clinically insignificant NDRI. It would have been a true NDRI though if you went over the max dose. Here comes the dilemma though. The problem with Wellbutrin is that it can cause seizures and the risk is higher the further up you go. The risk for seizures with Wellbutrin becomes more significant when you go over the max dose and because of this it limits the use of this drug of being an effective NDRI. Wellbutrin is also an old drug it was patented by Burroughs Wellcome in 1974 and it was approved for medical use for the first time in 1985. Since then no other NDRI antidepressants have been developed and most us are still stuck using Wellbutrin because there are no other options for us. There were other NDRI antidepressants available before like Survector and Merital but unfortunately they got discontinued due to various reasons.

There are many people like me who don't respond to SSRIS or SNRIS and only respond to NDRI antidepressants. But the lack of choices of this antidepressant class makes treatment for us very limited. I mean for example if a person responds very well to a SSRI but they find that the med they're using has a lot of side effects that are unbearable or the med just stopped working they can just switch to another SSRI and called it a day because there are several SSRIs to choose from. But for us that don't respond to SSRIS and only respond to NDRIS our choices become much more slimmer. We can't change Wellbutrin to something else instead because no other NDRI antidepressant exist.

Just because of this there are many people out there like me going untreated for their depression because of lack of choices. I know that there are stimulants available that can be used instead but the chance of getting them prescribed for depression by a psychiatrist is almost zero. If you would ask for a stimulant for depression they would just think that you're a drug seeker. Also the tolerance issues that comes with stimulants is another problem which makes their use for depression long term not such a great idea.

So the question now is why haven't they come up with new NDRI antidepressants? Is it because of all the SSRIS and SNRIS that are available making the pharmaceutical industry not wanting to create any NDRI antidepressants because they think it's just a waste of time?"
231,1,"Greetings, for the past two years ive been treated for my panic disorder and General anxiety disorder with Escitalopram, then with sertraline, and after realising antidepressants make me feel no better, on top of killing all sex-related sensations in my body, so my psychiatrist moved me to Trazodone, which didn't help, made me feel worse, and also completely destroyed my sleep schedule, preventing me from getting a new job.

Now my psychiatrist has perscribed me both Sulpiride, and Bupropion, and I am... tired, tired and terrified. Tired of feeling like a lab rat, terrified of spending this year jumping from one medication to the other, without really feeling better, has anyone experienced something similar? "

I had a choice to up my Trintellix to 10MG, or add Wellbutrin 100SR (Wellbutrin 100sr changes trintellix to 7-8mg bc of interaction)

I told my psychiatrist both sides and she ultimately gave me the decision. I chose Wellbutrin and kinda regret it now- wish I waited until my anxiety was lower before starting. It helped slightly in the past, but  didn‚Äôt touch my anxiety. I took my first dose today, can anybody give me words of wisdom or just general advice?"
235,1,"I have been taking olanzapine 5 mg since 2021. I think it has been almost a month that I have gotten off it. I was conflicted. I wanted to get off it and also not get off it because it is good for me. But everywhere people say that APs are terrible for you in multiple ways.


I was never really psychotic, nor delusional either. I did get quite agitated in the past for which I was put on olanzapine and also so that I could rest and sleep. 

I think after being on it for long time I developed a dependence on it, such that I couldn't fall asleep without it and was never able to tolerate the withdrawals. Hence I stayed on it for so long.

Over the years my knowledge and understanding of my health and psychopharmacology has increased, such that I managed to get off it and also endured the withdrawals. I might be still going through some withdrawals. But I have no difficulty with resting and sleeping. I am not agitated or aggressive either. 

I think I experience more fatigue now, more lethargy, tiredness. Feel the need for an afternoon nap etc. It was like olanzapine was an antidepressant for me. I know that doesn't make sense because they are supposed to make you tired etc. 

There is also body pain etc. 

I don't really know. Maybe in few months these would go away.

Getting back on it would be the easier route. But anyone with knowledge of these substances would use antipsychotic only if they are absolutely necessary because how bad they are in the long run. 

I'm just really happy that I have managed to get off it. I thought I would have to take them till the day that I die. But I also feel tired and experience body pain.

Edit

I think alone akathesia and hand tremors are enough of reason to never want to get back on that medicine. "

245,1,"I truly believe that all the antidepressants I have taken over the years have done something to my brain. I don't know if it's some kind of brain damage but I truly believe they have caused more harm for me than good. It's like they changed my whole personality and not being able to feel any emotions. I know because I was never like this before I started taking them.

I was 11 years old I think when I was put on my first antidepressant because a psychiatrist I met at the time had been given me many different medical diagnoses. I was diagnosed with autism, selective mutism, social anxiety and OCD. When I was diagnosed she put me immediately on an antidepressant called Sertraline. I took Sertraline for maybe four years. I had to quit taking it though because it made me gain a massive amount of weight over time and it also caused severe sexual dysfunction. I gained 20 pounds on it because it made me so hungry all the time I couldn't stop eating on it. I stopped Sertraline and lost all the weight I gained on it.

My psych then decided to put me on another SSRI instead called Luvox primarily for my selective mutism and OCD. I started taking Luvox when I was 15 years old and I took it for six years but I decided to go off of it because it made tired, sleepy and gave me brain fog. It also made me emotionally numb. I literally couldn't feel anything anymore. I was like a zombie and I had no emotions at all. My mind was totally blank when I was on it.

After that I got a new psychiatrist who put me on Prozac instead because it was supposed to be more activating than any other SSRIS I took before. I didn't take Prozac for a long time though because it caused severe fatigue, sleepiness and brain fog. It also caused severe sexual dysfunction and it made me emotionally numb just like Luvox and Sertraline did.

I started taking Wellbutrin two years ago hoping it would help me with my severe apathy, avolition and anhedonia. Unfortunately Wellbutrin hasn't been able to reverse the apathy, avolition and anhedonia caused by all the SSRIS I have taken in the past.

I'm totally apathetic and anhedonic now. I have absolutely no emotions anymore and my mind is totally blank. It's like I have this huge fog over me that will likely never go away. I can't enjoy anything anymore. I don't enjoy being social anymore and having social interactions with other people makes me feel nothing at all. I can't have any friends or relationships because I know those friendships and relationships wouldn't last for long because of me not being able to feel anything and having no emotions. I wouldn't have anything to contribute with and with my severe sexual dysfunction I wouldn't make a relationship last for long. I don't enjoy doing my hobbies either like I used to before. It's like nothing matters to me anymore and I couldn't care less about anything. It's like i'm just here alive as a person but I'm not living my life at all.

My life was never like this before I started taking SSRIS. I know how I was before and I wasn't like this at all. Every psychiatrist I meet now keeps shutting me off because they don't know how to treat it. They keep blaming me for me being like this and thinking that i'm the problem. I wasn't even depressed when I first started taking my antidepressant. Just because of all my medical diagnoses I was forced to take a SSRI that I was not willing to do and not knowing either that they would cause these issues later on. I hope it's not too late now to reverse the damage but I doubt it. I'm probably going to live like this for the rest of my life."

257,1,"II have depression, fatigue, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, obsessions, and anguish.I take a lot of meds: antidepressants, mood regulators, benzos, and pregabalin.n.
But I love Ritalin, but I am a little addicted to the sensation.

I want to give my regimen some low dose buprenorphine to potentiate all the meds and improve my well-being.

The rest is: Sleep 8 hours every night.
Exercise.
Eat healthy.
Psychotherapy.
Relaxing hobbies.

Some multivitamins, high-dose omega-3, vitamin D because I never get sunlight, and maybe some ginseng to provide extra energy....

Any ideas?.
"
258,1,"I am a poly-addict and used to do all sorts. Stimulants, dissociatives, psychedelics, etc. Monthly Sublocade and meds regime is helping me make a life for myself. I am 23. 

I take: Sertraline 150mg 
Amitriptyline 50mg 
Buprenorphine 

I understand that there is talk of Buprenorphine for depression, for me the cross over is convenient as an opioid user. 

Stay safe everyone "
259,1,I can't really take this anymore.
260,1,"I wonder why caffeine and nicotine helped my apathy, avolition and anhedonia in the short term when I used them? No antidepressant that I have tried has helped me with these things and most of them have made it even worse. Not even Wellbutrin could help me with these things. Before I started taking Wellbutrin two years ago I relied mostly on caffeine and nicotine to help with my apathy, avolition and anhedonia. They worked in the short term until I developed tolerance to using them a lot and in excess. But they actually worked for it and didn't numb me out either. Is there an explanation for why they were so successful for me? "
261,1,"Lately i been struggling with anger and fatigue at the same time, i would sleep all day but really badly and being on edge costantly.

Yesterday psychiatrist told me to lower dosage of bupropion from 300xl to 150xl because he believes that my problem is not depression but actually a mixed state that is going on since my last depressive episode.

So he prescribed valproic acid 250 mg for 5 days and then 500mg, i was in the past on carbamazepine with great results being calm but had to stop it because concentration issue, i honestly slowly went into a bad spiral even tho at work i was really unstable, some days i would be really active and some other days i would be really unable to work and made many mistakes.

I stopped sertraline in november after almost 3 years of use, and this lead me to stay just with bupropion wich caused a spike in anger and violent mood swings.

I got told that bupropion stress monoamine systems and it develop kinda a reverse mechanism wich lead to depletion (kinda what he said, i'm not english i tried to translate for this post), so now he told me to cut down from 300mg xl to 150xl and to add valproic acid as a mood stabilizer.

I'm scared of side effects from valproic acid, i took first half pill yesterday and i feel weird, probably placebo, anyone have experience with this honestly?"
262,1,Pretty much what the title sayss
263,1,"Right now I take 50 mg desvenlafaxine

300 mg (100 am + 200 pm) Fluvoxamine 

My anxiety is still there. 

Since I have yet to attain 6 weeks since I increased dose of fluvoxamine I am waiting. 

The anxiety has reduced but not reduced enough. 

If it doesn't reduce further by 6 weeks then what shall I do?

Either I can further increase the dose of fluvoxamine, because I have read an anecdote of a e taking 400 mg. Or I can add clomipramine. I am afraid if I add clomipramine then there's risk of serotonin syndrome. "
264,1,"I have been experiencing severe constipation out of nowhere. It seems to coincide with my starting and dosing up of fluvoxamine. 

Wdyt? "
265,1,"What are some antidepressants that are not so common but are actually useful?

For example, Opipramol or Agomelatine (though Agomelatine may be well-known)

I have diagnosed ADHD + chronic fatigue syndrome and antidepressants often work very well for both conditions.

I would especially like to know if there are any unusual drugs that act on noradrenaline. (In this case, it doesn't matter if it is not defined as an antidepressant.)

I have treatment-resistant ADHD and unexpected drugs sometimes work. (However, any small amount of drugs that increase dopamine such as methylphenidate makes my ADHD worse. Maybe I am deficient in DBH. Drugs that increase noradrenaline are often the most effective for me. However, it is strange because Prozac worked for my ADHD. I have very little anxiety, but Prozac improves my task processing ability.)

I would like to know if there are any unique psychiatric drugs that are not so common, such as Opipramol or Agomelatine. I have already tried bupropion, but it was a big minus for me because it acts slightly on dopamine.

Most of the SSRIs and SNRIs I tried were not very effective. I sometimes feel that Lamotrigine and Memantine help improve my ADHD, so it is possible that unexpected drugs other than antidepressants can help my ADHD (in that case, I would like to use it even if it is not in the category of ""antidepressants"". If such a drug exists, I would like to know about it. Sorry for the incoherent story.)"
266,1,"I‚Äôve been on / off multiple meds over the years for a combo of ADHD + depression. For whatever reason, one issue I have is a rapid cycling of emotion; I can wake up feeling hopeless, then a few hours later, feel happy/normal. 

I‚Äôve mostly gotten used to this to a degree but my psych wanted to try to treat it with Lamotrigine, which is most commonly prescribed for bipolar. For what it‚Äôs worth, I was diagnosed years ago with BP2 but the bigger, longer shifts have ‚Äúmostly‚Äù subsided. 

That said, I started the regimen of 2x25 a day in November. I know it‚Äôs a low dose, but it actually seemed to smooth out the mood shifts and the early morning sads mostly went away. 

However, over 2 months later, I find myself feeling sad and uneasy almost all the time. I also find myself easily irritated / angry. I just don‚Äôt ever feel ‚Äúgood‚Äù, unless I have a bit of alcohol which is obliviously not a solution. There‚Äôs a constant feeling that the worst thing that can happen, will. 

I‚Äôve avoided looking up side-effects so I don‚Äôt get any psychosomatic symptoms but at this point, I‚Äôm just not feeling well and and thinking it‚Äôs probably that med specifically. (I also take low dose adderall and bupropion but lamictal is the most recent addition.) Any thoughts, ideas? 

Thanks!!

267,1,"Hi there,

has anyone found Quetiapine to be helpful for daytime anxiety or panic attacks? If so, which dosage do you take and when (morning/evening)?"
268,1,"I usually gravitate towards pretty dark, true crime stuff but trying to watch more positive fare, Are there any movies or shows you like when you are feeling down? I don't like romance and I still like something with some substance but comedy or animation is fine. Thanks!"
269,1,"Help me out! I was prescribed Mirtazapine. My directions for this medication were to take one 7.5 pill for a week, then two for 23 days. I am on my second week of the two pills. I have been experiencing: a lot of night sweats, have a swollen tonsil so it hurts to swallow, a fever that continues to be in one hundred or more, chills, and I am very achy.

*NO signs of rash or itching 

I have been tested for flu, strep, & covid.

Could this possibly be an allergic reaction to the medication ?"
270,1,"Hi,

271,1,"I'm currently on nardil 60mg, it's finally let me be outgoing I can now go on planes and can go out to restaurants and eat food ever since I've been on it it's been great for social anxiety

However it's done nothing for my severe depression what would you recommend me add on to nardil that would be a deadly add on for my depression? 

And forget alot of the nonsense that things can't be added on to nardil only ssris can't be added on due to the risk of serotonin syndrome..... "
272,1,"Hi, Someone got elettrochock with parnate?"
273,1,"If you take Wellbutrin and finds that it causes too much stimulation like anxiety, jitteriness, irritability and all the physical symptoms from too much norepinephrine like increased heart rate, heart palpitations and chest discomfort. If you want to lessen the noradrenergic effects from it take curcumin with it that's the only thing you have to do.

The explanation for why this works is because Wellbutrin is metabolized through CYP2B6 and curcumin is its antagonist as well as a weak MAOI A/B inhibitor. Inhibition of CYP2B6 causes Wellbutrin to stop metabolising to hydroxybupropion which means less hydroxybupropion = less norepinephrine. The other metabolites of Wellbutrin are probably responsible for its DRI effects.

For me personally doing this has changed how Wellbutrin affects me now. Ever since I started taking curcumin with Wellbutrin I have noticed less anxiety, jitteriness and irritability. I also feel more calmer now and the physical symptoms of too much norepinephrine have lessened since I started doing this. It feels so much better now not being too hard stimulated by norepinephrine but I can still benefit from the increased dopamine. "
274,1,"I've had persistent depression with prominent anergia and anhedonia/emotional blunting for years, and the only thing that seems to help at all is Vyvanse (40-50mg), which I've been prescribed for ADHD for a while.

Don't get me wrong, it doesn't suddenly make everything better, but it helps more than any SSRI/SNRI I've tried at giving me the strength to cope with the unbearable shittiness of it all. On it, I'm so much more capable of pursuing my hobbies, making jokes, doing even simple tasks around the house and thinking about the future (in addition to all the positive effects it has on my ADHD and cognition‚Äîit's been absolutely life-changing there as well). It's not a ""pleasurable"" experience by any stretch, and I'm definitely not (and don't appear) high, but it really does make a difference.

The problem is, I am basically dependent on it to function, and without it, not only am I capable of anything remotely cognitively demanding, but I have no energy, and my mood can often rapidly spiral. Obviously nothing will replace the stimulant effects of an amphetamine, but it's not those I'm looking for, I think‚Äîit's something else. I don't need to feel energetic or super motivated or anything, just interested enough in things to continue giving a damn.

Interestingly, I've tried methylphenidate before, and it worked pretty well for my ADHD symptoms (and I didn't form a tolerance). It just doesn't have a very positive effect on my mood. (I've never abused my medication.)

I'm currently on duloxetine 60mg (worked well for a few weeks, but since then has only helped my anxiety), guanfacine XR 2mg (ADHD adjunct; it helps a bit), clonidine 100mcg and/or quetiapine 25mg (to sleep at night, infrequently; makes me so tired I can't sit around/spiral), in addition to Vyvanse. I've tried and failed fluoxetine and desvenlafaxine before.

I'm hoping an MAOI like tranylcypromine might hopefully increase my joie de vivre and mood by improving DA availability‚ÄîI'd love to hear any success stories with that. If I went on TCP, I would probably try to switch to methylphenidate for ADHD.

Other drugs/mechanisms that look promising for me include vortioxetine (5-HT7 and 5-HT3 antagonism seem useful for mood and anhedonia, in addition to \[partial\] agonism at various other 5-HT receptors) and nortriptyline (5-HT2C antagonism in addition to other NRI effects). I'd love to hear of any others/personal success stories here."
275,1,And what does it work for it?
276,1,"TLDR: Seroquel XR first med to work for my treatment resistant anxious depression, libido is almost gone, trying to decide on next steps. 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
So I have lifelong ADHD, as well as Anxiety at different times (GAD, Panic disorder ) , I was fine until a few years ago , I got Covid and developed severe anxiety, where I couldn‚Äôt function, also low mood too, it came out of no where and I still think Covid played a role. 

My doctor tried me on Zoloft , gave me extreme activation, agitation, and constant suicidal thoughts, I‚Äôve never had before or since Zoloft. Then we tried a bunch of SSRI‚Äôs, Snri (also caused extreme activation from day one), Lamictal, wellbutrin, Iv Ketamine, nothing seemed to help my anxious depression, until I tried 300 mg seroquel XR. 

It was a godsend and pulled me out of my depression, and helped somewhat with the anxiety. 

However it‚Äôs been a few years, it‚Äôs less reliable for my mood now, AND it tanks my libido which isn‚Äôt good long term. 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
I am considering these options, and would love insight. I‚Äôm gonna add these meds, see if I benefit and then taper of Seroquel XR, does that sound like a good idea? Last time I tried to taper once I got to a low dosage withdrawal was extreme, so this could help me.  

1.NEFAZODONE

3. VIIBRYD OR Trintellix (viibryd first because it has the same additional mechanism as Buspirone which can help anxiety .

3. Mirtazapine , this works for many people anxiety and depression , less risk of sexual sides. 

4. Strattera, I have Adhd my entire life, this helps many with anxiety, maybe the reason many meds didn‚Äôt help me was because it didn‚Äôt target my adhd ?

5. Amitrytpline, it‚Äôs less serotinergic than Clomipramine and Imipramine, so it has the potential for less sexual sides . 

6. Retrying a low dosage of a ssri, maybe the reason they didn‚Äôt work back then was because I was off and on them and in a bad place. They work for many relatives with no sexual dysfunction. Obviously I won‚Äôt try Zoloft again, or Pristiq which caused activation .

7. Anything else ?

Long long term if nothing works I‚Äôll consider Clomipramine, Moai Nardil, etc. but those have high risk of sexual sides , so I‚Äôll try the things with less risk first, and some say trintellix isn‚Äôt great for anxiety ) "
277,1,"Hey friends, Ive been taking Fevarin (Luvox) for a while. Now the manufacturer (Mylan) has said it wont be available in Germany till probably July 2025. Maybe even longer, who knows. At the moment, you still can get some though.

Does anybody know the situation in Europe overall? Can you get it in other countries still?

281,1,"Just a theoretical discussion. 

A lot of depression, anxiety and anhedonia can be fixed by hormones, say Testosterone or cortisone etc. 

I know you wouldn't want to do that if you can get fixed by merely taking something like say escitalopram. 

But if your condition is really resistant to the point you need very powerful treatment, say needing antipsychotic or ECT or have tried 15 - 20 meds, then hormone therapy can be considered.

What do you think?

Edit :

I have read anecdotes of people on TRT etc and they say it fixed their anxiety, depression and mood swings etc.

And you also get physically fit instead of fighting weight gain as a side effect when using an SSRI for example. "

286,1,"I have been on Wellbutrin for almost four years now and it has worked fairly well for my fatigue, hypersomnia, lack of energy and motivation. Overall It has been a great med for me because it hasn't caused any fatigue, hypersomnia, brain fog, apathy and avolition like all the SSRIS did that I have tried in the past. But there are a lot of downsides to it too. Wellbutrin seems to make me ruminate a lot more for some reason and that rumination alone causes my anxiety to get worse. It also causes huge irritability at times that can be very hard to control. It also seems to make my self esteem lower and makes me have no emotional resilience. So i'm wondering if there is an antidepressant similar to Wellbutrin but that doesn't cause the irritability and anxiety that Wellbutrin does?"
287,1,"Hi guys,

Ever since July 2023, I've been living in a somewhat dissociated state - essentially, it feels as though I'm questioning the world around me in a way that I never used to. I understood the world and everyone around me before, and I never questioned anything or got lost in existential ruminations, but now it feels as though things are quite hazy and memories and sensations don't feel as familiar to me anymore. Is this DPDR or dissociation, or something else? I'm just not as engaged in the world as I used to be.

Also, I have no idea why I've begun to feel like this. I've had zero trauma or true pain in my life that would trigger DPDR or dissociation, so why on one random day in July 2023 I've started to feel like this is a mystery to me.

I'm starting to think it's might be a very mild psychotic thing, but I don't have any delusions or hallucinations or anything like that, so I'm at a loss really as to what I'm feeling.

I don't really know how to tackle this - there's no medication I can take, and I don't have any trauma or anything to discuss with a therapist about, so I'm just left here waiting for it to go away. What else can I do?"
288,1,"To be clear, I am not claiming that this applies to everyone.

Looking around me, I see that many angry people have high work and task processing abilities.

On the other hand, I have the impression that many people with ADHD tendencies are very kind.

Is this because norepinephrine is related? If so, is it possible to increase norepinephrine without a simple NRI?

(I am very interested in taking norepinephrine precursors, because atomoxetine didn't work for me at all. On the other hand, agomelatine was very effective, so maybe 5-HT2C antagonists work for me.)

What's even more strange is that there are exceptional people who are the polar opposite of this. They are kind and don't seem to have high norepinephrine at all, but they have very high task processing abilities.

I admit that these opinions are my subjective opinions, but I would like to hear the opinions of those of you who know much more about the brain than I do.

To sum up, what I want to ask are:

‚ë†Are there any methods other than Atomoxetine to increase Norepinephrine?

(Tricyclic antidepressants were very effective for me, but I couldn't continue because of heart problems. So I used a 5-HT2C antagonist to increase Norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, and my task processing ability improved dramatically. Also, probably because I have low DBH ability, dopamine is hardly converted to noradrenaline. All drugs that increase dopamine have the opposite effect on me. So I would like to increase Norepinephrine in the brain in some indirect and original way, like a 5-HT2C antagonist.)

‚ë°Does the fact that there are people who are not angry at all but have high task processing ability mean that there is a brain substance other than Norepinephrine that is greatly involved in task processing ability? If so, what do you think it is?

(I admit that this question contains a lot of subjective speculation. Sorry for the rough speculation.)

Anyway, I want to increase norepinephrine in my brain. However, I am cyp2d6 poor and atomoxetine doesn't work, and although tricyclic antidepressants work dramatically, I can't continue them because of QT prolongation, so I'm interested in increasing norepinephrine in an ""indirect"" way, such as agomelatine's 5-HT2C antagonism. Also, if there are any other substances besides norepinephrine that are heavily involved in task processing, I would like to know more about them (any dopamine drug greatly worsens my ADHD, so I'm interested in substances other than dopamine).

Thank you for reading this far."

SSRI/SNRI: Zoloft, Lexapro, Fluvoxamine, Fluoxetine, Effexor, Duloxetine

Antipsychotics: Abilify, Seroquel, Latuda, Olanzapine, Risperidone, Rexulti

Tricyclics: Clomipramine

Other meds: Lyrica, Propranolol, Nardil, Mirtazapine etc.

These meds didn't work for a lot of my mental issues or gave me minimal relief. 

I'm currently taking 200mg of Clomipramine and am getting barely any relief from it. I've been on it for 3 months. I take Rexulti daily and have found that's helping me a little bit. I'm prescribed Vyvanse which works really well for my ADHD and depression but I get around 5 hours of relief a day from it. The rest of the day is really hard to deal with.

I'm also prescribed Clonazepam twice a week. I find benzos work really well for a lot of my issues but I don't want to build up a tolerance to them.

294,1,"On good days, the TCA nortriptyline provides me (30m, adhd-pi) with a more intelligent level of sustained focus than any of the medications that I've tried, including Strattera and multiple stimulants. 

The problem is that the results are very inconsistent. On bad days the anticholinergic sides (brain fog) override the benefits from the increase in norepinephrine. My mood then tanks as a result. 

While I'm optimistic that switching to desipramine will improve things for me, I'd like to understand why the cognitive impairment from these meds varies so widely from one day to the next.

Has anyone else had a similar experience on nortriptyline, or another TCA? Are there any foods or supplements that can help?

295,1,"*(note, I apologize in advance for my wordiness)*

These past 24 months have presented some of the most difficult challenges in my 40 year old battle with bipolar 2. I remained in the acute stage of depression for basically twenty one to twenty two months‚Äã out of twenty four.¬†Typically the bipolar g-ds loosen their grip slightly and dangle me about dysthymic-ally. ‚ÄãBut that did not happen during the two year episode.

Fast forward backward to ‚ÄãJanuary 10th,¬†the second half of the Notre Dame vs Georgia game. I woke up in the same depressive ‚Äã'Groundhog's day all over¬†again‚Äã' assuming another lost Friday in the books. Next thing I know‚Äã, it's 8:30 pm, early in the third quarter‚Äã and I‚Äã¬†am ‚Äãnow¬†engaged in conversation with friends, I am playing with their dogs, I am staying later to‚Äã eat pizza and to stay and¬†finish‚Äã watching the game.‚Äã¬†¬†

Fast, forward backward again it's January 17th and my friend is stopping me because he cannot understand what I am saying. He expresses his serious concern for my current state and we are on the phone with my psych who instructs me to cut my Marplan from 60 mg to 40 mg and to add 300 mg lithium and to stay in touch about increasing lithium dose (note, I'm now on 900 mg).¬† Further, he asks me not to drive or to leave and stay over at my friends house.

**""SO WHAT?""** you are right to ask.¬† The **""SO WHAT""** is that I had Spravato ketamine pending insurance authorization.¬† In addition, I was able to secure funds to pay for IV Ketamine.¬† As of last week, both ketamine therapies are options for me NOW.¬† I have an appointment this Friday to discuss with my psych.¬† I anticipate he will want me to pause and choose¬†the cautious path.¬† I do not want to wait as I anticipate my current positive state will end in 4 to 6 to eight weeks based on my history.

So let's proceed with¬†'I'm hypomanic,' my questions are:

* What is the protocol for Ketamine therapy when a patient is hypomanic?¬†
* Is there a therapeutic difference of nasal vs. IV ketamine administration, i.e., try nasal first before proceeding to IV?
* Would it not be better for someone who is bipolar to try a treatment during an up cycle regardless of the possibility¬†of triggering more hypomania?
* What am I missing?

Thank you I apologize for my long windedness.¬† I have never had a 'light switch moment' before and it's unsettling."

I have had schizophrenia for 17 years now, I take quetiapine since 16 years and have been on multiple anti depressants including sertraline, (10 years), vortioxetine (1 year) and I just recently started escitalopram.

Which medication can help me the most regarding this.

I was thinking about starting bupropion or agomelatine next to escitalopram, but the one could give me trouble sleeping and be dangerous regarding psychosis and the other one would make me sleep to mich.

299,1,"So I have noticed everytime I have an energy drink or take caffeine pills my depression gets better immediately and the effect from caffeine is better than most antidepressants I have tried. I have tried several SSRIS and none of them work as good as caffeine for me. Unfortunately this feeling doesn't last all day and in the end of the day I crash and then my mood gets bad again. Bupropion is the antidepressant that has worked somewhat before for my atypical depression but it eventually stopped working. Bupropion also caused numbness, anhedonia and a disscociate feeling for me with long term use which I didn't like at all . Caffeine is the only thing so far that hasn't done that but I don't like the idea of using caffeine for depression because tolerance build up so fast and you have to just increase the dose to get the same mood benefits. Also the side effects from high doses of caffeine can be really shitty like heart palpitations, high blood pressure, headaches, dehydration, insomnia, anxiety and irritability. So back to my original question why does caffeine help better for me than most antidepressants?"
300,1,"Hi all,

After a series of depressive episodes in my 20s in which I cycled on and off SSRIs until I experienced some poop out, I (50f) was put on a cocktail of 150 mg Effexor and 300 mg Wellbutrin. I took this for 20 years and remained stable, without a depressive episode during that time.

During the pandemic, I started having more residual symptoms and entered full fledge depression last year (2024). My mood has slowly tanked and gotten worse. A previous psychiatrist boosted my Wellbutrin to 450 mg which did not help. I was also diagnosed with ADHD and was put on  Ritalin, 20mg/d. I also tried TMS but did not have success.

In the past week, I have gone from depressed to despair. I never feel anxious and now I have  continual feelings of dread and doom. I  have been the most suicidal I have ever been and am considering going inpatient or at least taking a leave from work. I literally feel like each minute is difficult to live through.

Some of the despair may be cumulative or due to the inauguration and other events but I made some med changes during this time and I wonder if others have had similar experiences.

Starting late November, my psychiatrist put me on 2 mg Abilify, after a month, we went to 4mg, and about 10 days ago to 5mg. I haven't really seen any positive benefits so far and wonder if it is making me worse. We also went down to 300 mg Wellbutrin.

Also, because I have so much fatigue and there is a possibility I have long COVID, an integrative doctor put me on LDN (low dose naltrexone). We started at 0.5mg in October and have titrated up in 0.5 mg increments. I am now at 2.5 mg and again, have not noticed benefits and wonder if it could be making me worse.

Lastly, my psychiatrist had me change from 20mg Ritalin long release to 10mg 2 x day Adderall. I want to eventually reduce my use of stimulants and because I did not feel the Ritalin was doing much, he switched me to Adderall. Again, I wonder about the timing of my worsening symptoms."

when i was unemployed, i had no schedule, i was extremely depressed and blaming myself for my circumstances a lot. it is really hard for me to feel motivated less i am ""committed"" to something.

even with meaningful jobs i managed to get, i still messed them up due to executive dysfunction and depression (i guess-- i still don't know what happens when dysfunction is severe coupled with no motivation to even manage it effectively).

when my depression is at its worst, i physically cannot do anything. i will think of an intention yet the action itself feels locked. i couldn't figure it out. so i went to therapy (several times) to figure it out. it seemed they wanted to take the approach that it's just laziness. i still get this most of the time but it's not as bad anymore. i'm guessing it's a combo of the right antidepressants, medicating my adhd, and meaningful work.

some ideas i have are:
- setting a routine to ""simulate"" working for job apps and networking
- volunteering
- new (low cost) hobbies
- starting a small side business

as someone who has had only partial success with psychiatric drugs for my depression and anxiety issues I am always interested in potential alternatives that might be helpful one day, be it short-term or long-term.

To be clear, I am neither recommending this approach, nor do I say its a smart idea, nor do I plan to irresponsibly feed myself with whatever drugs, BUT -at least to speak for myself and maybe for some others- I am always glad when I know there might be something that I could look into deeper someday when everything else has failed because the worst feeling for me is when I know I have tried EVERYTHING under the sun and there are no options left.

Non-psychiatric drugs that might possess antidepressant and/or anxiolytic effects:

* Advocating for myself by helping the NUHW strike through sharing my experience with reporters.

304,1,"Hello everyone,

Long story short, I went through some fertility trauma/pregnancy loss late 2021, early 2022. I took a year off from trying to get my ""mind right"". I initially went through a deep wave of anxiety/depression for a month before it spiraled into these constant unwanted suicidal thoughts and images. At first, I thought I was having a near psychotic break because I never felt these feelings before, and they were constant. I tried Zoloft, and clomipramine, and they really didn't do anything for me. Prior to this fertility stuff, I was fortunate enough to never really experience anxiety or depression.    

Long story short, over the years, they are still present, some days worse than others, but always there. I welcomed my double rainbow baby in late 2023, and was hoping they would stop but never really did. I decided to stop taking all meds due to great amount of weight gain and no real mental relief/benefits. 

Over the last few months, I seem to have some struggles fertility wise again as things really aren't going my way with regards to it, however: I have been sleeping better and have had some really mentally calm downs. And now this week, they are really bad again. I love my family, I love my life, and I fear so badly that I will act on it one day out of feelings of hopelessness of never feeling better. I have normal energy, I try to work out and eat healthy every day, I go to work every day, I don't do any recreational drugs, and I rarely ever dink anymore. 

Thoughts? I would love for these thoughts to just stop.

311,1,"Would a low dose MDMA give me some relief from my severe apathy, avolition and anhedonia? I'm just tired of being like this everyday and I need some relief from this. 

The reason why I'm doing this is because my psychiatrist refuses to help me. He doesn't give a damn that I'm severely depressed and that I'm suffering from all this. I wanted to raise the dose of Wellbutrin from 300 mg to 450 mg but he refused to do that because 300 mg is the max dose here in my country so he wouldn't allow me to do it. I even asked him about adding an SNRI to my Wellbutrin but he wouldn't do that either. I wouldn't dare to even ask him about stimulants because he would think i'm a drug seeker even though he knows I have autism and severe excutive dysfunction. So just because he doesn't want to help me I feel extremley suicidal right now. He just doesn't understand how it is living like this everyday. Wellbutrin used to work somewhat until It didn't anymore and now i'm stuck and can't raise the dose anymore. 

So I have thought alot about this and I have decided now that I'm forced to turn to drugs just because i'm not getting any help for this. I just don't want to live like this for the rest of my life. I need to live my life too like everyone else is. I'm just tired of all psychiatrists ignoring my problems and not listening to me. If they are not going to help me I need to do it myself. I don't want to miserable for the rest of my life so I might just do drugs anyway because I can't find any other solution to this. "

316,1,"I was referred to a psychopharmacology department several years ago and one of the recommendations that the psychiatrist made was that I should exercise regularly. He really stressed that this was important and that given my office job and daily commute, I was spending too much time sitting, and that regular exercise was just as important as medication. I started then coming out into the staircase of the office building, during work, and doing some basic stretching and yoga poses. Also walking up and down the stairs. I found that I actually do feel better after I do some exercise that raises my heart rate and also after exercises that require head being below hips, such as downward dog. Maybe this improves the blood flow to the brain in some way.

I think in general people are aware that exercise is good for mental health, but I think it's also useful to see the evidence. I recently read a systematic review, on the topic of effect of exercise on depression, and I just wanted to summarize it here:

[https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-075847](https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-075847)

218 unique studies with a total of 495 arms and 14‚Äâ170 participants were included.¬†495 arms - indicates 495 distinct groups in total. Each of these arms might represent a different treatment, dosage, timing, or control condition. Studies excluded if interventions were shorter than one week, depression was not reported as an outcome, and data were insufficient to calculate an effect size for each arm. Any comparison condition was included, allowing to quantify the effects against established treatments eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs, cognitive behavioural therapy, placebo tablet, stretching, educational control, and social support, or waitlist control conditions.

Exercise showed moderate effects on depression compared with active controls, either alone or in combination with other established treatments such as cognitive behaviour therapy. In isolation, the most effective exercise modalities were walking or jogging, yoga, strength training, and dancing . Yoga was somewhat more effective among older adults, and strength training was more effective for younger people. The benefits from exercise tended to be proportional to the intensity prescribed, with vigorous activity being better . Benefits were equally effective for different weekly doses, for people with different comorbidities, or for different baseline levels of depression. Those who are able may want to choose more intense exercise in a structured environment to further decrease depression symptoms."
317,1,"I had an appointment with him a while ago and we decided I was going to taper off Prozac because it was making me tired, numb and apathetic. We decided I was going to be on Wellbutrin only and see if that would make any difference. I had a new appointment with him today and I told him that I haven't really noticed any difference since removing Prozac. The only difference I have noticed is that i'm less tired and that the brain fog I had before was gone.

I have been on Wellbutrin 300 mg for almost four years now and while it does help a little bit for my depression and fatigue it doesn't do anything for my apathy or anhedonia. This is the third time I'm telling him now about this but he refuses to listen to me. This is the second time I have been beginning him to raise the dose of Wellbutrin but when he talked to a specialist doctor they said that I couldn't raise the dose and that 300 mg is the max dose and that I can't go higher up. He said to me the only choices I have right now is either psychotherapy or counseling.

I asked him if we could add another med to Wellbutrin. He said that he didn't think that would work or that it would make any difference for me. He said that I have already tried three SSRIS and that none of them worked for me so he would't try to prescribe another one. He then said that he can't prescribe me anything besides SSRIS unless I taper off Wellbutrin completely.

Then he told me If he would prescribe an SNRI instead for example he wouldn't be able to do it because I would have too much norephinephrine according to him. He told me that combining SNRI with Wellbutrin can be dangerous and have adverse effects.

So my question right now is this true that you can't take an SNRI with Wellbutrin? Is it true that you can have too much norephinephrine and that it can be dangerous?

There was nothing I could say to him today that would change his mind about it. He still keeps insisting that it's my behavior that's the problem and that I shouldn't be pooping so much pills. When he said that I got really angry and upset. He refuses to help me with my severe depression, apathy and anhedonia. Despite my apathy and anhedonia being so severe and he has all the knowledge about it he refuses to prescribe me anything else. He literally refuses to help me and won't negotiate with anything.

I literally started crying after the appointment and it hasn't been a good day at all today thanks to him. If my own psychiatrist won't help me then I'm just screwed up. I don't know what to do anymore and everything feels so hopeless at this point. It's like there is no med that works for me. He literally gaslighted me today and i'm still very upset about it."

319,1,"I find that when I go to work in the morning, I am really nervous and excited. I have mild tremors and they are quite bad in the morning. On the other hand my colleagues are quite relaxed. 
But often during the closing time I am relaxed as fuck and don't want to work anymore. But my colleagues are rushing, trying to do more and more before they finish the day. 

Maybe they have a lot of adrenaline pumping in their veins by the end of the day, hence they are so panicky. But what's the case with me? Why do I get so relaxed? It most probably has something to do with energy. I am very tired, hence very relaxed. And in the morning I have too much energy to handle/contain. 

If this is the case then how to fix it?

320,1,"I‚Äôm seeking advice on managing depression following brain hemorrhage surgeries. I'm currently about five years post-craniotomies, which were performed primarily on my left temporal lobe to remove a congenital cavernoma.  

Initially, I was prescribed Sertraline, which helped with anxiety but did little for my anhedonia. I later tried Lexapro with similar results. Over the years, I‚Äôve experimented with various treatments, including pharmaceuticals, nootropics, and supplements. Here‚Äôs what has shown some positive effects:  

Ritalin: Occasionally helps but is inconsistent. Its short half-life and tolerance issues make it unsustainable for long-term use.  

Sulbutiamine: This has significantly diminished my anhedonia but tolerance builds quickly.

Opioids: They provide some relief but are far from an ideal solution.  

Is depression as a result of brain hemorrhages, similar to TBI different than normal causes? Because disruptions in neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine caused by the brain injury. If anyone has experienced something similar or knows of effective treatments, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate your insights or recommendations. Thank you!"

324,1,"
I‚Äôve been on Pristiq since early 2024 and went up to 200 mg, but I didn‚Äôt notice a huge improvement. I lowered it to 100 mg on my own because 200 mg left me feeling very drained, but at 100 mg, I find myself becoming very obsessive.

I‚Äôve already mentioned to my psychiatrist that Pristiq doesn‚Äôt feel very antidepressant for me, but they insist on keeping me on it. Every time I‚Äôve complained about the antidepressant, they‚Äôve either wanted to increase the dose or suggested options that haven‚Äôt been helpful for me. They even tried adding:
	‚Ä¢	Abilify (10 mg): It made me very hungry.
	‚Ä¢	Latuda (18.5 mg): It‚Äôs more neutral in that sense. I‚Äôm currently in my third week on Latuda, so I‚Äôm still giving it the benefit of the doubt.

I feel like Pristiq has affected my metabolism. I used to be on fluoxetine, and I felt much better back then. I even went up to 60 mg of fluoxetine for binge eating disorder, and it worked quite well for me. I switched to Pristiq after a major life crisis, but I‚Äôve never felt the same since.

They added Latuda because of my high resistance to antidepressants, as I‚Äôve pretty much tried all the options you can imagine. I‚Äôve had dysthymia for many years, and it‚Äôs been very hard to find something that works.

Right now, I‚Äôm struggling with a lot of rumination, obsessions, etc. I‚Äôm thinking about suggesting to my psychiatrist to go back to a Latuda + fluoxetine combination, even though I know it‚Äôs not a very standard option.

Has anyone switched from Pristiq to fluoxetine with Latuda? What do you think about this combination or any alternatives?
"
325,1,"Yeah, this is a book, but I'm really stuck on why this ""worked"" then didn't work the way it did.  The TL;DR version of what I'm seeking is in bold towards the bottom.  Any constructive insight is appreciated!

I'll begin with:  Since late 2016, I had been taking Zoloft, and I would say that, along with trying just about every other SSRI under the sun before that (we're talkin 2011-2013), it worked to a degree, but I never really felt *truly* happier or ""better"" because of it.  It enabled me to function, but at 50 and 100mg, respectively, I felt kind of, as I always described, ""like I was in the middle of a Jell-O cube,"" -- that is, nothing could get to me, but I couldn't really feel much of anything, either.  We tried adding Wellbutrin to it to mitigate this and the sexual side effects, no go.  Buspar, no go.  So, in mid-2023 I wanna say, I started taking 50mg every two days, more or less just to avoid withdrawal.  My PCP was okay with this, and I thought nothing more of it for the most part.

  
In September 2024, I was prescribed Viibryd (the generic, so, Vilazodone) after seeing an NP Psych at my therapist's office. (Since like, October, I've been lurking on this and the other now-""restricted"" r/Viibryd sub)  She said that since I was only taking what amounted to 25mg a day, that cross-tapering between Zoloft (@ 12.5mg for a week) and 10mg of Viibryd for one week, should suffice.  Now, outside of some itching and being irritable for a few weeks, the cross-taper went just fine.  However, she neglected to tell me that I needed to go up to the 20mg after a week, and I only knew about it because I read the bottle -- after half of week two had elapsed.  No big deal.  I've been wanting to write this post for over a week now, but honestly, I have been trying to remember what all of this time was like, and you'll see why that's important in a second.

  
After the initial period of like two or so weeks, I recall things really ""kickin in"".  It was great, I was energetic, things were super interesting again, and I wanted to live life and wasn't sitting and dwelling on stuff.  And my libido came screaming back for the first time in ages, as well.  But, that didn't really last, and here's where it gets murky.  As I said, I was on this in early September, and it really took effect, I'd say, the first week of October.  By mid-October, I kinda felt like my mood had leveled off, and I started to get weird ruminations. (I have MDD and OCD as well as some anxiety mixed in there)  Weird for me, anyway.  Like, that I felt like a scumbag for owning plastic because that pollutes.  Or feeling horribly guilty for our neighbor locking their kids outside till after dark. (Yeah, you read that right.  Truly nothing to do with me, but I felt like somehow I had caused it or something)  And again, I have oddly little recall of that time, but I do remember neglecting my college coursework and later blaming it on shifting meds.  However, I can't recall if that was actually me being genuine, being eerily prescient, or just using it as an excuse.

By, again I **want** to say, mid-November, things changed, though.  Still on the 20mg, my mood started to change.  And this is where I can't really explain it accurately.  I really want to say, ""emotionally blunted,"" or anhedonic or nihilistic, but I can't even say that for sure.  Before ever taking meds at all, in my mid-20s (I'm 44/M, btw) when my depression first really reared its head, as well as a few times since, I consider my depression to be at its worst when it does this combination of existential dread, feeling of being drained of energy, isolating myself and just basically giving up.  Example: I start watching a TV show, my mind: ""This has already been done, they're either going to live or die, then the show ends, what's the point?""  Playing a game: ""You're either going to win or lose, who cares?""  Even life stuff: Intellectually, I know I gotta keep on that hustle, but my mind is like, ""So what, you sell this, you get more money, big fuckin deal.""  That's what was happening here, for the first time in like, 7 years?  And it kind of went back and forth.

Luckily, I had an appointment right before Thanksgiving, and I was pretty much at my lowest then.  She seemed to think that maybe I should go UP in dosage, but that blah blah blah, emotional blunting doesn't generally go away if it's **caused** by the med, etc etc.  So we agreed that I'd taper on back down until the next appointment right after Xmas.

So, once again, I tinkered; heading back down to 10mg.  Immediately, again, I felt awesome.  For like, I wanna say two weeks, I conquered like a whole semester's worth of work that I neglected, I was at a normal level of arousal, things were interesting, the whole nine.  The only real difference was that my resting pulse was always around 90.  I even went to my PCP and he did an EKG and I was fine.

Then it happened again.  My mood, my ""give-a-shit"" took a nosedive and I was in existential hell again.  At that same time, everyone in my house was incredibly ill like, in rotation almost, and I wound up getting something completely different, myself.  They all had the flu, I had some kind of monster cold or sinus infection, and that's initially what I thought this was.  I went to my therapist on Friday, started feeling like garbage by Saturday, and by the time it resolved on, say, Wednesday, I realized that what I was feeling was **not** part of the physical illness I picked up.

The reason I mention this is because, again, as depressed as I ever have been, I've never been one to just lie in bed and want to continue lying in bed.  I put this on being sick, but it persisted well past the cold or whatever it was.

Anyway, I saw her at the end of December and she wanted to put me on Lamictal, on the spur of the moment.  I know what it is, and while I feel like if I needed it, I'd take it, I don't feel it was worth the risk at this juncture.  This was basically coming from notes she took of me saying that I got ""moody"" a few times; like a teach or counselor telling parents they need to put their kid on Ritalin because they don't want to deal with them.  Then she started get frustrated with me and like chuckling and yelling at me, basically indicating that, ""I don't want to help myself,"" because I wouldn't slavishly defer to her judgement.  She got pissy and wrote another script for the 10mg V again, and our big 20-minutes-every-month-or-two session was over.

  
Now, over these two-weeks-and-change, or so, I was in such a bad way, that I found a bottle of Zoloft from last year, and have tried cross-tapering again, with sort of mixed results.  So when I went from Z to V, I was taking 12.5mg Z pills (which I think I may have poured out because, ""WOO I DON'T NEED EM ANYMORE!""  Famous last words.) and the 10mg V, simultaneously.  The first day I tried doing V to Z, I took a small hunk (basically an 8th) of a 100mg Sertraline and 10mg of V at once, and I don't know if it was coincidence or not, but I wound up with a horrible migraine.  Nothing else that would be emblematic of say, serotonin syndrome, but I've gotten these a few times a year for around 5 years, now, and I try not to, because they're no fun. (And cause my BP to rise so much that I've actually had to go to triage before)  So, from there on out, I spaced dosages around 6-12 hours apart.  I'd take Z, then V later.  My moods were highly variable, and for super brief periods once I reached the 5mg stage.  I remember I was having a crushing downshift in mood, took a 10mg V around 1 am, and by like 3, I was laughing at stuff again, was really into some 80s music videos I would've found mundane and blase only a few hours earlier.

Again, I'm saying this for a reason.  So, you've read all of this -- or at least skimmed it -- but there's a missing piece of the puzzle.  This prescriber left off the eensiest bit of info that was **very** vital, but which I didn't know until I stumbled upon a post on here, in the last week or so.  **I was never told to take this with food**.  Something from the manufacturer's own shtick, and she either didn't know or forgot to say anything about.  And, I'm certain that I did not take it with food **every** time.  Nor did I take it at the same time of day, which, from various posts, I also see is sort of a big deal.

Coming off of this to Zoloft, I basically had no side effects.  I'm still a little itchy, and my BP has taken some time to readjust, and my moods have really sucked on and off, but I can't imagine things are going to snap into place just like that.  However, getting back onto the Z with this new perspective, I do now feel like the Z **was** blunting, or something.  And there **were** periods where I would get that same level of blunting/nihilism/what have you on that, too.

So, all of this has caused me to re-examine the V, too.  (I've even been keeping a journal for about a week now, because I don't want to have to try and remember things that may or may not be incorrect/out of order.)  The main bone of contention being that, who knows if I was ""half-dosing"" myself some of the time by not eating with it, and therefore the lessened bioavailability was making my mood dip, or dip prematurely.  Or, taking it at different times of day (which, again, I'm certain I did) also played a role in making things go crazy.  Or if I was perhaps simply not taking enough.  The other thing that just dawned on me today was that the OCD increase **did** go away, so perhaps the blunting or whatever would fade, too?

**And that's what I'm here to ask.  Anecdotally, has anyone had a similar experience -- especially with the, I'm calling it ""blunting"", stuff, and did it resolve over time, if you stuck it out?**  The up/down moods thing throws me, too, because everyone including my doctor used the word ""activating"", and that's exactly what it felt like.  Getting it in before anyone uses the word ""mania"".  I've been on at least 5 SSRIs over time, one of which I was on for \~8 years at various strengths, 25 sessions of TMS, buspar and wellbutrin and I've never had anything approaching mania or hypomania.

Also, and I didn't really take this into account in October, but my mood suuuuuucks in the winter.  I'm in a state that basically gets no sun in the summer, and my sleep schedule which was already abysmal, has been made even more so by this fucking up my mood.

Lastly, I also take 1.5mg of Ozempic per week.  I know that that can screw with all sorts of medication, as far as absorption and timing, but I couldn't really find anyone complaining about that on here.  I'm wondering if it interfered with the metabolism of it.  Again, anecdotal is the best I'm going to do, because there aren't any studies, and my doctor or a psychiatrist would just be educated guessing.

I really hate to throw out something that might potentially work, just because of ""user error"" on my part and my prescriber's lack of knowledge.  For the first time in a long time, I felt confident and halfway human again.  I sort of want to restart it, but I don't know if I want to go through hell again if it truly is causing blunting that won't be resolved unless I stop it completely.

Seriously, if you read this whole thing, you're a champ, and thanks."

329,1,"OCD+ depression. After discovering I‚Äôm going to be a dad, I went through an intense episode of nonstop panic‚Äîwaking up shaking, with anxiety through the roof. At this point, lorazepam feels like my only real friend. I‚Äôve been on sertraline for the past decade, and while it used to work well for me at a low dose, it recently stopped being effective. Every time I try increasing the dose, I become suicidal.

Now I‚Äôm on 5mg of Trintellix, but increasing the dosage makes me feel worse. On this current dose, I no longer wake up with full-blown panic attacks, but I still feel anxious‚Äîconstantly worrying about everything imaginable. I‚Äôve been trying to reduce my reliance on lorazepam, but it‚Äôs the only thing that truly helps.

I‚Äôm generally very sensitive to medications, and none of the SSRIs I‚Äôve tried have ever fully stopped my panic; they only help manage the repetitive thought patterns in my mind. The panic, however, never truly goes away.

331,1,"The first antidepressant I went on was escitalopram and it caused me to clench my jaw in my sleep so bad that my teeth chipped in multiple places. I stopped taking it within a month to save my teeth. 

I went on sertraline and have had some of the jaw clenching but not as bad. But then I added on Wellbutrin because sertraline was making me sleepy. I haven‚Äôt been able to fully open my mouth in about a month. 

My doctor put me on a muscle relaxant to counter the jaw clenching. So I take pills to help with the side effects of my other pills which are helping the side effects of my other pills.. 

Sertraline = sleepy 

Wellbutrin = counteracts the sleepy 

Muscle relaxant = counteracts the jaw clenching 

To me this says that something isn‚Äôt working. I don‚Äôt think I need 3 prescriptions to work together to counter out each others side effects.

If I wasn‚Äôt on sertraline I would never have been sleepy so I wouldn‚Äôt have needed Wellbutrin and I also wouldn‚Äôt need muscle relaxants.

Years ago I self medication with Kratom ( again, I don't want to go that route again, Kratom has a severe impact on the endocrine system ). 

Are there any medications or combination of medication where people respond well to that are prone to: anxiety, looping, negative internal monologue.  I think this is depression, should I consider Ketamine treatment?  I'm now on Wellbutrin, and I'm high anxiety all the time.  But I feel it helps my depression.

  
TL:DR: Are there any psychiatrics medications that ""slow down"" the brain/ emotions? "

337,1,"To avoid any misunderstanding, I would like to start by saying that I am not claiming that ""CFS is a mental illness.""

Rather, my theory is that when stimulating substances in the brain with psychiatric drugs, physical changes also occur indirectly through the brain.

I am Japanese, and almost all of the people I have seen who have put CFS into remission have used psychiatric drugs (especially clonazepam and pregabalin).

Of course, I think there are various subgroups of CFS, so there are some people for whom it is ineffective, but I was surprised that there are so few discussions about psychiatric drugs that are useful for CFS.

Please tell me your thoughts on psychiatric drugs and if there are any psychiatric drugs that are effective for CFS (I have already tried LDA and methylphenidate, but they were not effective for me).

Tricyclic antidepressants work dramatically for me, but I cannot use them continuously because they have a large effect on my QT and heart (it's really unfortunate).

Also, other than psychiatric drugs, if there are any ""drugs that are actually useful but not talked about much,"" I would like to hear about them.

I see potential in Clonazepam, Pregabalin, and tricyclic antidepressants."

339,1,"I've had a lifelong struggle with double depression that has only lifted for a few brief periods in the 20 years since I started high school. therapy has been largely useless to me, and most medications either haven't worked, or lasted only a few months before I built up a tolerance to them.

At the moment I'm on the max dose of three different antidepressants, augmented by mood-stabilizers to rein in the rapid mood swings and rage issues I experience. While they're clearly doing *something* as evinced by the fact that I become even more depressed without them, they aren't enough to make me believe my life is worth living.

Recently, my psychiatrist has become too busy to address my needs in a timely manner, and because of current circumstances, I don't have enough time or money to look for a better one. I have an appointment scheduled with her in a few weeks to work out the next steps, but I need to figure out an approach ASAP to present to her, knowing it will likely be months before I can get a follow-up appointment.

**Note:** I'm asexual, so I don't care about sexual dysfunction side effects. I don't know if that's super relevant, but I've had doctors refuse to prescribe medications to me before because they thought being slightly less horny was worse than the excruciating conditions I payed them to treat

Got prescribed Wellbutrin instead and I have been on it for almost four years now. Wellbutrin has helped some of the aspects of my atypical depression like hypersomnia, fatigue and increased appetite. But Wellbutrin hasn't helped my apathy, anhedonia or preserved mood reactivity. I still have feelings of low self esteem and worthlessness everyday. I have an appointment with my pshyciatrist in one week and to be honest I don't know what to say to him. The last time I had an appointment with him he told me I need to find the motivation myself for doing things and to socialize with people. He thinks it's my behavior that's the problem and that I need therapy. He thinks it's so easy doing all those things when you suffer from severe depression. He doesn't even think that I have tried doing all those things even though I have. At this point it feels really hopeless and I don't know what to do anymore. Is there any antidepressant that works for atypical depression or am I screwed up. Because if there is nothing else then I might as well end my life at this point."
343,1,"I don't have any cognitive depression symptoms, but taking tricyclic antidepressants greatly reduces my brain fog and chronic fatigue.

However, the problem is that even the smallest dose has too many side effects on my heart and my liver values rise abnormally, so I can't continue taking them (is drug hypersensitivity a common symptom of CFS?)

Imipramine, Nortriptyline, and clomipramine all worked for me, so most tricyclic antidepressants may work for me.

In this case, if I can't use tricyclic antidepressants, what medication would you recommend for me? (Of course, the basic premise is that treatment methods vary from person to person, but if there is something similar to tricyclic antidepressants with fewer side effects, I think it would be effective for me.)

The symptoms I'm suffering from are brain fog (feeling of pressure on the brain), abnormal fatigue, abnormally low cortisol levels, erectile dysfunction, waking up in the middle of the night, dry eyes, and acne.

These all developed almost simultaneously after experiencing chronic stress from the age of 15 to 17.

I have also been diagnosed with mixed ADHD and ASD, but for some reason, taking tricyclic antidepressants improves both. (Even though I have been diagnosed with ADHD, all stimulants have the opposite effect. Drugs that increase dopamine make me manic.)

LDN didn't work for me at first, and neither did Mestinon

Cymbalta, an SNRI, worked for my brain fog at first, but it stopped working after two months.

I would like to try anything I can, even if it's not tricyclic antidepressants.

I don't mind the risks, so if there are any promising treatments (medicines), please let me know.

However, almost all supplements and Chinese medicines have been completely ineffective, so I feel that nutritional therapy and supplements have their limits.

I would like to find a revolutionary drug that will change the situation. I have a hunch that it may be a drug related to JAK inhibitors or autoimmune disease.

346,1,"SSRIs are often said to be emotionally blunting/flattening. Some hypothesize this is due to their inhibition of dopamine release driven by 5-HT2C overactivation in the nucleus accumbens and striatum.

I want to share my personal experience with this:

For most of my life, I've felt flatter than most people. I assume it's due to ADHD. I was less likely to cry during movies, for instance. I didn't have anhedonia, and I was hyperactive, but still I was far less likely to cry than others, specifically.

Then I noticed that dopamine reuptake inhibitors and releasers, like methylphenidate and amphetamine (respectively), make me more likely to cry from things, whether it's from sadness or from happiness. On these drugs, I was more likely to cry from non-issues that are no big deal for most people, but I was also more likely to cry from happiness while listening to exceptionally good music.

I noticed the opposite from the SSRI escitalopram, being less likely to cry from things - happy or sad, which is like myself without ADHD stimulants, but a bit worse. Weirdly however, though, it made me more social, witty, and empathetic with people, which also makes sense because other serotonergics like MDMA have similar effects on sociability (never tried MDMA, just from what I've read about it). 

Combined, these experiences make me wonder about the role of dopamine in emotional reactivity. Do dopaminergics make me cry more because dopamine is involved in reward?

We know the extreme end of dopamine deficiency, Parkinson's disease, is often associated with apathy. Perhaps, then, my lower propensity to cry before being medicated for ADHD is due to the moderate dopaminergic dysfunction normally associated with ADHD.

359,1,"I know there are many professional scales for depression or overall functioning but I created something very simple in my head to better anchor my self view as it lines up with my experience. It is just a single parameter scale so it is not about capturing symptoms or any nuance.

The scale is 0 - 20 where 0 is basically brain dead and 20 is completely healthy. This scale assumes you are putting in significant effort and don't have any significant financial constraints.

0 - 5 = You are not able to take care even of basic things to maintain life and need sustained care to get through days.

5-10 = You are able to do very basic things to keep going - going to shop once a while, doing some housework, maybe some occasional part-time job, rudimentary social & fun. You probably feel terrible but you can keep going if you put big effort.

10-15 = You are stable enough to maintain a full-time job or school that is not very demanding. Most of the time, you can make some plans and maintain a routine in work, social, and other areas. Sometimes, you might even enjoy some fun.

15-20 = You generally feel ok, that life could go like this. You might still have significant symptoms but they are not preventing you from doing most things you would like, even though you might enjoy them less than you would normally.

  
If I look back to my life with depression, most of the time I was probably around 10. Last year and half, I slipped and hover just above 5. And I had some periods when I was reaching 15. I also had a few weeks short dips where I was below 5.

Did some genetic testing, turns out my consistent depressive mood and ADHD are inherited. I got heterozygous MTFHR and slower MAO. Also two long-form 5-HTTLPR alleles (indicating higher serotonin transporter activity) and reduced 5-HT2A receptor density in the prefrontal cortex.

Would atypical antidepressants like Trintellix and Viibryd work better for me due to 5-HT2A antagonism? Genetic tests also show reduced CYP2D6 activity, but it wasnt a problem with effexor.

	‚Ä¢	Topamax 100 mg (to help with impulsivity around food)

Right now, I‚Äôm on 150 mg of Pristiq, but I‚Äôm hoping to eventually lower it to 100 mg if possible. If not, I‚Äôll keep it at 150 mg, as 200 mg felt like too much and left me feeling extremely fatigued.

368,1,"So I have been a patient of OCD and I remember vividly when it started back in 2003. I was just 15 and I kept getting this incessant urge to twitch one or mor of my muscles. Sometimes I twitched my eyes, sometimes I got this urge to look behind my back, but mostly I twitched my muscles in the stomach area. It all felt funny and light at first but then things started getting pretty serious. These incessant twitches started hurting me after sometime. I wanted it to stop so bad but couldn't help it and couldn't understand why I was voluntarily twitching my muscles to hurt myself.But the urge was too strong.I also had severe episodes of misophonia. Further the struggle was not limited to twitching, my brain began f*cking with my thoughts too. Wheneve I tried to read for exams or anything it did something so I couldnt read anything or atleast cannot understand what I read. Sometimes it was the sound of a far away bird, sometimes it was the dripping of water nearby, sometimes it was some other repetitive sound, and when there was no sound my breathing caused drew all my attention to it. It was super hypervigilance for any repetitive sound or thought which could just break my concentration. Finally I was diagnosed with OCD and since then I have been more or less suffering from this twitching sometimes to lesser extent sometimes to greater. Anxiety was already there and I didnt realize while in this hellspace when depression also crept in. I am 35+ now and the battle is ongoing. Meanwhile lifelong metabolic disorders also plagued me. I was diagnosed with hypertension when I was 15 and have been on meds since then. I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes when I was 25. A lot of time and years wasted fighting with my own mind.

So it worked for my apathy and anhedonia in the short term but after taking it long term I'm starting to experience symptoms of apathy and anhedonia. I lack motivation to do things in general and I lack motivation to accomplish goals in life. I lack interest in activities I used to enjoy before and nothing seems enjoyable anymore. I can't feel any pleasure anymore and I have no libido at all. It's weird because Wellbutrin is supposed to increase libido not lowering it which it has done for me. I can't even have an orgasm on this med even though I have tried it doesn't work no matter what I do. I feel so blank now and I'm not even supposed to feel like this.

My pshyciatrist keeps blaming everything on me and saying it's my behavior that's the problem and not the med. I couldn't disagree anymore with him. It's very obvious that this med is not working for me and despite telling him that twice he refuses to listen to me. It's very annoying and frustrating because I keep going back all the time and I always get the same response from him that I need to find the motivation for doing things myself and socialize with people. He thinks it's just so easy doing all those things when you suffer from severe depression, apathy and anhedonia. He thinks that therapy would be a solution to all my problems. I do have a new appointment with him in a few weeks and If he says the same thing again and won't prescribe me something else I will find another pshyciatrist that is willing to listen to me and help me.

I'm just tired of not getting the help that I need and I'm just tired of no one listening to me. I hate being like this everyday and no one understands how hard it is to be like this everyday. It sucks having apathy and anhedonia and no one that has never had it won't understand how it is. The SSRIS that I have taken in the past hasn't helped either. It's obvious that the SSRIS I have taken in the past messed me up really badly. Wellbutrin doesn't seem to be as bad but i'm still experiencing the symptoms of apathy and anhedonia after taking it long term.

So my question is can Wellbutrin cause apathy and anhedonia with long term use? I would really like to have a response to this question because it's very important for me to know If Wellbutrin could possibly also cause this although it maybe more rare for it to cause it than SSRIS? If Wellbutrin can cause it too I will consider tapering it off."

374,1,"So, I took Vraylar 1.5mg for three days as an add-on to my Trintellix for major depressive disorder. It was a very rough 3 days. I could barely stay awake and then I developed unbearable anxiety and agitation. Since I have to work and take care of my kids, my doctor told me to stop taking it because I was barely functioning. 
It‚Äôs been 5 days and although I‚Äôm less sleepy during the day, I‚Äôm still experiencing very high anxiety, nausea, lack of appetite, and aggression/agitation on top of the depression that‚Äôs already there. 

I know the half life of this med is like 3-4 days, so can I expect these side effects to diminish soon? My last dose of 1.5mg was 5 days ago. 
Thanks. "
375,1,"Hi there,

I have noticed that Gabapentin or Pregabalin helps me a great deal with my lifelong anxiety disorder after a lot of other medication has failed. To be honest, I am afraid that longterm usage is not sustainable and will lead to diminished effects due to tolerance development.  So, to those who have taken it for - lets say - years, do you still find it helpful for anxiety? I would love to hear some experience reports."
376,1,"tried all the ssris, snri' venlafaxine and nothing helped my depression.  I tried moclobemide before and tragedy at lower dose 75mg twice per day itnfelt much better than higher doses. High doses made me uninterested in my usual activities. I also have adhd which impacts my depression a lot and I'm on a waiting list so it will take a year or two until I actually get diagnosed. 

Armodafinil and modafinil always improved my depression and anhedonia but I never taken it in while I was on other meds. At the moment I started taking mirtazapine 15 mg and it does feel different than all other antidepressants. It does take the edge off depression but is not enough.

I was thinking to combine moclobemide 75 mg x 2 a day + mirtazapine 15 mg at night amd also armodafinil on the days I need extra boost of concentration. 

How safe amd effective is this combination in your opinion?

I feel like this combination will be slightly balanced in terms of serotonin,  dopamine and noreadrenaline. I did feel that moclobemide is more dopaminergic in lower doses but above 250 a day serotonin overrides the dopamine effect. Also mirtazapine antagonists some serotonin receptors thar moclobemide might agonise so it probably could increase the effectiveness and reduce so,e soe effects ( actually I had no side effects on moclo XD)

Also by antagonising certain serotonin receptors it increases dopamine which will be further potentiated By moclobemide mao inhibition. Also moclo suppresses rem sleep so I think mirta could improve that issue. 

What worries me the most here is the addition of armodafinil to moclobemide as I haven't dome it before and many places says its contradicted.  I only taken modafinil with mirtazapine and it felt good. It actually brought my blood pressure down amd made it more stable (got dysautonomia and blood pressure variations)

Also mirtazapine at 15 mg is quite light but if I was taking with moclo and then increased mirta to 30 would it be risky?.

What do u think about this stack safety wise and effectiveness wise?"
377,1,"Hey everyone, 

I have tried a bunch of SSRIs, and a few other classes of medication for OCD, MDD, and ADHD. All to pretty much no avail. I am wondering what anyone can tell me about how to interpret/what to do about genetic testing results. I got Genesight testing done to see if there could be any hints on how to treat my issues. 

- I have significantly reduced folate conversion due to homozygous C677T. 

- SLC6A4 L/S, which means decreased likelihood of success for SSRIs. 

- HTR2A shows I have an increased sensitivity to SSRIs, which could cause adverse effects. 

Any advice on supplementation and any experience with these genotypes and how to best treat someone with these would be greatly appreciated! I understand that seeking medical advice/questions on Reddit isn‚Äôt the best idea, but interested to hear thoughts. Thank you for reading! "
378,1,"Due to the intransigence of the TGA, as many of you may know, Spravato is not on the MBS (it was approved by the FDA 5 years ago) so if you happen to be wealthy and suffer from TRD (I'm 18 years in) your psychiatrist can prescribe it for you, you attend a clinic for a few hours of monitoring while you have your dose and get handed a bill of approx $3000. The ""Induction"" phase is 2 doses per week for 4 weeks or approx $24000.

I don't have anywhere near $24000.

It was once available from India but the firm over there doesn't get it from the US anymore where you can't get it sent to Australia either.

Anyone know what country might export it to Australia? (and yes I've tried every anti-depressant class, antipsychotics, talk therapy etc etc without any relief). P.S> I'm not overly concerned with legalities - I'll deal with that if/when any issues arise."
379,1,"I'm in an extremely distressful situation in my life at the moment. Think: spending your 20s to get better and elude something that you know will destroy your life amidst your already existing depression, only to fail and get forced to live that thing in your 30s.

So I'm constantly agitated, having panic attacks, feeling like punching the wall or hurting myself. I consider picking up smoking but it's going to be costly. I have used stress balls before but they're not enough. I'm losing my mind and I need something to express this restlessness into."
380,1,"I‚Äôve been busting my head for years trying to now help myself, as I‚Äôve seen that many specialists here in Australia who will just continue to spoon feed me the exercise bullcrap, diet and SSRi‚Äôs / SNRi‚Äôs that all DO NOT work for ME specifically and I‚Äôve known this for years. 

I‚Äôve tried many different cocktails of medications both prescribed and non prescribed over the years, illicit also because I‚Äôve been desperate. From the moment I wake up, to the moment I go to bed, pre taking ANY substance, prescribed, illicit or not, I am anhedonic, apathetic, depressed, anxious and simply CANNOT function in society. 16+ different psychiatric medications have failed, TMS, Ketamine, Therapy, reward reprocessing, countless DNA tests, nothing has worked. Recently one cocktail, and I know this is going to immediately get hate, but I‚Äôve been on a lot, I know the difference between being high, and feeling my normal childhood like self before all this sh*t started mentally for me. 

I‚Äôve experimented with opiates in the past, and gotten addicted, specifically to opiates over other illicit hard drugs because they are the no.1 most relieving substance for my neurochemistry. All social anxiety goes away, I have energy, my anhedonia is almost gone, I‚Äôm content with life, and this is taking therapeutic pain relieving dosages. I‚Äôve used poppy seed tea - this is DANGEROUSLY addictive, do not go near this unless you have incredible self control, oxycodone, codeine and now tramadol. 

Oxycodone and codeine are nice, but for some reason tramadol seems to bring me to feel very much like my pre major depressive self. It feels natural, and I‚Äôm flowing during the day. I have ADHD and the ANKK1 gene mutation with low DRD2 receptor density, and I struggle with dopamine bursts being extremely short. Basically I get excited, but it lasts not long at all, maybe a few minutes if I‚Äôm lucky; even with stimulants. Tramadol has prolonged this effect for me, to basically keeping focused and going for as long as I need. Neither oxycodone, codeine or poppy seed tea did this for me. Why could that be? 

The other substance? Unfortunately, yes, Phenibut. Dosages of 250mg to 500mg, NOT TAKEN DAILY, but Phenibut + 150mg of sustained release tramadol seem to be the ‚Äústubborn‚Äù force that gets me functioning. Neither methamphetamine, benzodiazepines, Gabapentin / Pregabalin, alcohol, harder opiates none of that did this for me. Phenibut and tramadol. 

I know this is not sustainable, a bloody opioid and Phenibut‚Ä¶ bad combination I know, but out of a lot harder substances; even combined, why these two? Specifically? No SNRI has acted like tramadol, even when I was on an SNRI (Cymbalta) AND taking an opiate (oxycodone : poppy seed tea). Is there something unique with Phenibut and tramadol that I‚Äôm missing, that could be the key ? "
381,1,"Hi there,

currently I am switching my Trazodone (for sleep) with Agomelatine since I suspect the Trazodone to be responsible for morning grogginess. I hope to get some sleep-promoting effects from Agomelatine but I also wonder if it may be helpful for depression or anxiety during the day.... So, to those who tried it, what has been your experience?"
382,1,"I am currently suffering from severe brain fog and chronic fatigue. To be specific, I cannot even walk to the supermarket 100 meters away.

This brain fog and chronic fatigue started when I was about 17 years old (long before the corona pandemic).

Until then, I had been diagnosed with ADHD and ASD, so my brain may have been vulnerable, but the brain fog appeared after chronic stress like trauma that I experienced between the ages of 15 and 17 (however, it is unclear whether the brain fog appeared after chronic stress by chance or whether there is a causal relationship).

Other physical symptoms include

insomnia, erectile dysfunction, dry eyes, acne, low libido, low cortisol, and drug hypersensitivity.

Also, I have never had a headache more than five times in my life. I recently started to think that this is strange too. (So, in my case, is the true nature of the brain fog a headache of insensitivity? This may be a difficult expression to understand.)

Furthermore, my brain fog starts at the back of my head and is relieved when I wear a hood or take a certain posture. I've hit my head hard a few times in the past, so I wonder if there's a problem with my cerebrospinal fluid?

I also have PEM and crashes.

And there's something unnatural about my ADHD, stimulants don't work for me at all (they actually make my hyperactivity worse), and GABA-active drugs and antidepressants solve it.

I barely have any mental symptoms now, but at first, taking Cymbalta or tricyclic antidepressants dramatically improved my brain fog. But then it gradually stopped working. (This is also unclear, and rather than it not working, it may be that I was taking antidepressants and the brain fog was gone, and then I was too active outside, and now I'm having a reaction to that.)

I'm 24 years old, and while everyone around me is moving forward in life, I'm bedridden.

How can I get out of this state?

The thing that's bothering me the most is the brain fog and general fatigue (chronic fatigue). LDN only worked for the first few days.

I've tried almost everything I can think of, so I'd like some ideas and analysis to break through the current situation, even if it's a surprising solution (medicine) that isn't widely known or a related disease that may be possible. I'm tired of living."
383,1,There I said it because I have been this med for almost two years now and never ever did it help my apathy or anhedonia. It never helped my lack of motivation or desire for doing things. it never helped me enjoy things I used to like and enjoy social interactions with other people. It never helped me feel any pleasure for things in life. It never helped my low libido either for that matter. Despite taking it for two years i'm still struggling with apathy and anhedonia everyday. My pshyciatrist keeps saying it's my behavior that's the problem and not the med. It's like he almost makes it seem like it's all my fault for not being able to socialize with other people and having the motivation for doing things. I'm so tired of pshyciatrists that keep claiming that Wellbutrin should work for apathy and anhedonia because it's supposed to work on dopamine. First of all it never really felt dopaminergic to me it always felt more noradrenergic. Most of the effects from Wellbutrin are noradrenergic and it barely has any dopaminergic effects at all. Wellbutrin should really be classified as a NRI and not a NDRI. That's why it has helped my fatigue and lack of energy but i'm still struggling with apathy and anhedonia.
384,1,"Chronic fatigue and ongoing depression, along with the silence all around me, cause me to go on autopilot for most of the day. Sometimes, I stay in intrusive fantasy for more than an hour without realizing it."
385,1,"Hi all! 

Just as the title says, my (29f) doctor currently has me cross-tapering from Wellbutrin XL (previously 300mg, now 150mg for seven days) to Zoloft (50mg tablets, split in half to 25mg for the first seven days). Now, as an avid clinical research enthusiast, I want nothing more than to login to my PubMed and read up on this process, but I'm concerned that I'm going to get myself worked into an overanxious puddle of symptom-aware paranoia. 

I've only cross-tapered off one medication before and I was a teenager at the time, so my memory is a bit loose with the details, the stingy thing.

I'm also on Vyvanse (60mg) for my ADHD, which she didn't mention discontinuing, so I'm still taking it. 

Anyway, today is my first day of the cross-tapering process and I took the two meds (a long with my Vyvanse and BC) about an hour to an hour and a half ago. I like to lie down and get a little nap in after getting the kids off to school and taking my meds, because I enjoy the feeling of my body organically waking up, as opposed to forcing myself awake with an alarm. Well, about thirty or so minutes after taking my meds, I felt like this sort of ""wave"" went over me and I started feeling simultaneously relaxed and anxious. It was like a warm and airy sensation that started at the crown of my head and travelled through my body. Now, my heart rate is slightly elevated (thanks, smart watch) but that's not super unusual for me first thing in the mornings. What makes it stand out to me is that it's not that it's just faster, it's that it feels like my heart is pumping *harder*. Like, more Hulk, less Quicksilver. I'm not jittery, rather, I feel somewhat *weighted*. 

I know that adjusting to a new medication, especially antidepressants, can be a process with side effects and experiences that differ person to person. I know that it usually levels out. But I really wanted to check in and see if anyone else has had a similar experience. How long did the feeling last? How did you feel after it went away? Did you stick with the change? What sort of side effects did you have following the initial ""breaking in"" period? How did it differ from the previous medication? 

And details to add: I've been on four other antidepressants (Effexor when I was a teen, Cymbalta, Trintellix, and currently Amitriptyline as needed for trouble sleeping). I have to steer clear of most medications with a sedating effect because they will knock me out for up to two days at the lowest dosages. I'm also on routine doxycycline for rosacea, but I haven't taken that today. 

Seriously, any feedback would be great, and I thank you all in advance for your responses. üòÅ



TLDR; heart started doing a weird thumpy-thump after first dose of Wellbutrin+Zoloft and I'm worried about the sensation lasting.

389,1,"I read a credible sounding article on reddit of someone who said he recovered from 20 years of depression/anhedonia using DMT, the God molecule the most potent psychedelic substance on earth.

390,1,"

Before taking medicines, I put all the medicines in a small plate and take a picture of them. I have also turned on the time stamp in the camera settings.

So if I have forgotten whether I took the medicine or not I can simply check whether I took the pic or not. But obviously you can forget to take the pic too. But for some reason this extra step helps me more than it harms me. 

Also, I don't have to think much about what meds am I supposed to take, because I just check the Pic of last night/morning, and I find out what my current regimen is. I have to do less thinking this way. 

I think it might also help me far into the future when I would wonder what regimen was I taking 4 months ago, as in September of 2024, I can look up the picture in the phone. 

Since I also take picture of the supplements with the medicines, it helps because supplements aren't prescribed.

397,1,"after a year of sertraline, i‚Äôve finally noticed the following changes:

- my thoughts just become positive, at some point. i don‚Äôt have to CBT my way out of anything. it just happens. i can choose to believe it or not! but once my bad feelings subside, i can ‚Äúchoose how i think about the situation‚Äù, just like those positive headed ninnies are always preaching 

- i can sleep (fingers crossed!!!) i get sleepy at night. wow! it‚Äôs not a huge anxiety ridden problem. the anxiety from not sleeping wasn‚Äôt the problem, like therapists and everyone else try to convince you. the problem with not sleeping turns out to just be‚Ä¶ not sleeping. now i can sleep. üëçüèΩ

- i ‚Äúget over‚Äù things. you know how people yell at you to ‚Äújust‚Äù get over it? it is ‚Äújust‚Äù to them, bc their brains *do* just help them get over *most things* in life on their own, with enough time. it is easy for them. you still have to ‚Äúwork‚Äù sometimes to ‚Äúget over‚Äù things and that‚Äôs the little bit of work they‚Äôre talking about‚Äî kind of like how someone with good vision has to squint sometimes to see without glasses, and yes that is technically work, but it‚Äôs not the same as being idk, legally blind.

- i feel content, at baseline. if i work at it, i can feel good. sometimes i feel bad, but then if i work at it, it goes back to baseline‚Äî or on its own, with time.

- i stopped ‚Äúthinking about the past‚Äù, on my own. i tried for years to stop. sertraline just made all those past related thoughts just‚Ä¶ quiet down. they are still there but they‚Äôre not taking over my life? so that‚Äôs nice.

- if i‚Äôm inside and do nothing for a week, i‚Äôll feel myself getting depressed again. this is what non depressed folk think you‚Äôre experiencing when you are severely or clinically depressed. *this* depression feels like a natural consequence of my choices, not surprising, and most of all, something i have control over. this does not feel like the same pre SSRI depression i had, where i was going out every single day and it was like a virus hijacked my brain and there was a weird filter over my eyes and how i perceived the world.

now instead of being depressed about something i can spend my afternoons watching a movie or drawing and maybe even enjoy it. it‚Äôs nice."

In the beginning it helped greatly with my fatigue, and suppressing my binge eating issue. The past two years it stopped working and instead just made me angry. My therapist added Paxil to balance out my anxiety and agitation. That worked great for awhile but I guess my body got used to it. We then added Adderal. Adderal does keep me awake. I still feel tired but am able to stay awake. The only problem is the adderal tends to make me feel depressed, and there's a point in the day where I have to lay in bed and have a crying spell when on the adderal. So the adderal keeps me up but makes me feel depressed. Paxil helps my social anxiety greatly, but makes me sleepy and yawn all day. Wellbutrin now just makes me angry if taken alone honestly. I've been scared to switch to another antidepressant, because I'm used to my regimen. Also the issues I struggle most with like chronic fatigue, low libido, and binge eating.

413,1,"I've had depression and social anxiety for a few years now, also OCD, PTSD and somatic disorder and I'm treatment resistant. Therapy does very little.

417,1,"I need some advice üôè. To treat my TRD doctor recently added 100mg of Fluvoxamine to my 1.1mg Pramipexole ER (I started with 25mg and have been on 100mg for 10 days now). Aside from the side effects of anxiety , fatigue, tinnitus, blurred vision and Bruxism that the Fluvoxamine gave me, my depression has worsened, and the motivation that Pramipexole provided seems to have disappeared

420,1,"Hi! Looking for med advice for things I can ask my GP about.¬†

While I‚Äôve dealt with severe depression in the past, for the past year my anxiety has debilitating and out of control. I‚Äôm struggling to make progress in therapy or work on the deeper stuff because I‚Äôm so dysregulated/constantly in fight or flight. Some of it is pathological and a lot of it is based on crappy/legitimately stressful life circumstances (I'm mostly bedbound due to chronic illness) that are out of my control or things that have happened to me (traumatic to me but more little t trauma probably). I‚Äôm doing mindfulness meditations and it feels like I‚Äôm doing all the right things.¬†



I‚Äôm currently on 15 mg of Escitalopram +¬† clonazepam twice a day for a muscle disorder. I‚Äôve been prescribed extra clonazepam to get me through right now, but I don‚Äôt want to be taking a higher dose of clonazepam long-term for anxiety.¬†



I‚Äôve tried:

\-vortioextine- didn‚Äôt help anxiety

\-Citalopram helped¬†pretty quickly but gave me bad orthostatic hypotension and I had to stop it after five weeks because it wasn‚Äôt getting better

\-I was on SNRIs in the past for years (duloxetine and venlafaxine) and they work well for my anxiety, but they make my insomnia so much worse to the point where the amount and dosage of sleeping medications that I need to be on to counteract the side-effects are unsafe.¬†

\-seroquel seemed to help but my GP doesn‚Äôt want me on it because she‚Äôs worried about drug interactions.¬†



Is it worth putting myself through the awful transition of trying another SSRI and trying to get up to a higher dose (I‚Äôm already chronically ill and very sensitive to side effects) or should I be looking at different classes of meds entirely? At this point I don‚Äôt know if SSRIs are similar enough that there‚Äôs any point trying another one?¬†

¬†The change from 10 to 15 mg of escitalopram didn‚Äôt seem to help.¬†I‚Äôm reluctant to try Prozac because I already have sleep issues (I‚Äôm on trazadone for sleep) and I‚Äôm reluctant to try Zoloft because I have IBS-D and diarrhea seems to be most common with that SSRI. I‚Äôm curious about Luvox because it can be sedating which might help with my sleep, but¬†

Does anyone have any advice for things to ask my GP about?¬† I have too much medical trauma from my other chronic illnesses to handle seeing a psychiatrist right. I feel safe with my GP though.¬†

It looks like pregabalin is one of the next ones in terms of algorithms, but I‚Äôm reluctant to try it because I‚Äôd rather not \*add\* another CNS depressant to my regime (I‚Äôm on a lot of meds because of my chronic illnesses) and when I used gabapentin for sleep, I built up a tolerance fast and getting off a high dose was so so hard. I‚Äôm already on a beta blocker for my POTS! I can‚Äôt handle the risk of weight or appetite changes with mirtazapine as I‚Äôm already in recovery from an ED.¬†"
421,1,"Done therapy taken multiple meds adhd gad mdd cptsd need help with rumination low energy and low cognitive functions.

422,1,Strange combo but wondering if any on it and what the experiences are.
423,1,"I had my daughter 5 years ago. Thens went downhill quickly. I admitted myself to a perinatal psych unit at 10wpp. I was there for 2 weeks and received the Zulresso infusion. It profoundly improved things for me for almost 2 years. Then I was back in hell. No longer ""postpartum"" meant no access to those meds. I tried everything. Every drug class, nwurofeedback, biofeedback, TMS, therapy (over 3 years worth), NAD infusion, ketamine infusion (horrible response), SGBs.... anything I could. And nothing. So I was really hopeful zuranolone would also gain approval for MDD, but it did not. I was devastated and basically decided at that point that this condition will be terminal for me at some point. Anyway, allopregnanolone seems to be the key for me. I never gave Provaz a full try because my providers were happy to move along to something else. But since it increases allopregnanolone and I don't have any adverse effects to SSRIs, I figure it might as well be worth it to give it a try. Plus possible some LDN to address chronic brain inflammation likely secondary to preeclampsia induced brain injury (and thus propagating all of this). Any thoughts?"
424,1,"I have cfs and severe depression, and I can't treat it without tricyclic antidepressants. (I've tried almost every other SSRI, SNRI, and mood stabilizer.)

But when I use tricyclic antidepressants, my symptoms improve dramatically.

But I have heart problems, and even taking 10mg of Nortriptyline once caused a serious arrhythmia. My resting heart rate was over 110.

So I'd like to ask, which tricyclic antidepressants have ""relatively"" no side effects on QT and arrhythmia?

I looked at various statistics, but some people claim it is desipramine and others claim it is clomipramine, and I don't know which one is true.

So, please tell me your subjective opinion if there are any tricyclic antidepressants that are relatively less toxic to the heart.

(You may think, ""In that case, tricyclic antidepressants shouldn't be used,"" but I have tried almost all other methods and they were ineffective.)

I would like to know if there are any tricyclic antidepressants that are less toxic to the heart, or if there are any methods to prevent (reduce) sudden death or cardiac toxicity while using tricyclic antidepressants.

My current hypothesis is that desipramine is relatively easy to use (but I am ignorant, so this guess may be wrong)"
425,1,"I have been on Wellbutrin 300 mg for almost four years now and still sometimes I get a high feeling from it especially when I have caffeine with it. In the morning when I take it I immediately notice that I feel happier, more energetic, music sounds a lot better and I have so much more motivation doing things. Unfortunately this feeling doesn't last the entire day and I notice that I always seem to crash in the afternoon or evening. When I crash from it my mood becomes really bad and I feel depressed, irritable, tired, having no energy or motivation doing anything. If Wellbutrin isn't a stimulant why do I get a high feeling from it in the morning and then crash in the afternoon or evening? I also for some reason get dilated pupils from it? I thought only stimulants did that? I'm wondering why this is still called an (antidepressant) when it doesn't feel like that. For me personally it feels like a mild stimulant.."
426,1,"I was on very low doses like 25-50mg for about a month. I slowly went up to 150mg over the 2nd month and have been on 150mg for a month. I'm not feeling much relief from it. My anhedonia, OCD, anxiety and DP/DR are still crippling. 

My psychiatrist wants to increase my dose to 200mg and see where we go from there. I started taking 200mg today. I also take ADHD meds and Nicotine on certain days which help me a lot. I've read about cardiac side effects from Clomipramine and I'm worried the combination of these medications could long term do damage to my heart. 

I've had my heart checked with an ECG and the test results didn't come back with any issues. I guess I don't want to waste too much time with Clomipramine if it doesn't end up working but I also don't want to give up too early. 

I've also recently started  Rexulti which I've noticed is helping a bit. How much longer should I stay on Clomipramine if I'm still not feeling much relief from it in a few weeks?"
427,1,"i‚Äôve tried countless medications, gene testing, spravato, iv ketamine, all of the things for my depression. what‚Äôs next‚Ä¶?"
428,1,"I'm a male 24 years old and I'm into sports so I need to keep my testosterone in check and also make sure my estrogen and prolactin won't go up since it has undesirable side effects. Which antidepressant would work good for me with the least side effects? I know zoloft is first line and very safe and I always stick to low doses but it can cause weight gain and increase estrogen and prolactin. Also I have anhedonia which comes from dopamine deficiency(waiting for adhd assessment) and things like armodafinil and methylphenidate make me feel just normal and able to enjoy things again. 

Been to my doctor today and been prescribed duloxetime 20 mg extended release and I'm about to pick it up. What is it like comparemto zoloft? Will it affect my ability to exercise and push myself? The things I'm worried about is increased blood pressure due to norepinephrine uptake inhibition amd also withdrawal that can be horrific.( had a very bad experience coming off effexpr 75 mgmafter just one month)

Which one would be the best? My mind tells my duloxetine can destroy my depression but my heart tells me that zoloft will be safer and the addition of armodafinil will counter side effects.

Maybe any other antidepressant that won't affect my performance? 
My main issue is severe depression.  Moderate anxiety . Anhedonia . Extreme fatigue. Slight ocd. 
I also suffer from bpd.

429,1,"Okay so‚Ä¶I am diagnosed with ADHD and refractory major depressive disorder. Over and over again I‚Äôve come here and tried to iron out different med stacks and supplements on top of that. I‚Äôve tried countless variations and I just never seemed to make any real headway. 

I have mostly responded very well to stimulant medication. It always helps and works quickly. I finally got my PCP to put me on Vyvanse. We‚Äôve been tirating up 10mg a month, but I‚Äôve had mixed results. I couldn‚Äôt make up my mind whether I should take my Effexor with it or not. I‚Äôd stop and then convince myself I needed it but then when I‚Äôd start I‚Äôd swear it was greatly diminishing the effect of my Vyvanse. I always had a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù this was a case back when I used to take Adderall with it too‚Ä¶the meds just didn‚Äôt seem to work right‚Ä¶I actually went crazy as far back as December 2017‚Ä¶I had been using White Kratom a lot. But from the day after I started Effexor it NEVER worked like it did before. I kept trying over and over and couldn‚Äôt get it to work. But everyone said that shouldn‚Äôt have any effect. 

I finally kind of realized‚Ä¶the only time Effexor ever worked for me was when I was also on at least 400mg Welbutrin SR. All this time I just assumed my stack required an SNRI and that Wellbutrin was an ‚Äúadd-on.‚Äù But once I was prescribed Vyvanse, I figured I should just take one or the other‚Ä¶as I anectdotally thought maybe Wellbutrin messed with my stimulant medication too. 

I FINALLY just had a revelation‚Ä¶my symptoms are not feelings of worthlessness. They are just total disinterest in anything and everything. I also noted in the past‚Ä¶even quitting Effexor which is notoriously hard, I can do it CT with zero issues. So I said okay‚Ä¶Wellbutrin has worked for me in the past but then ‚Äúpooped out.‚Äù Id have a brief honeymoon on 150mg, then 300mg‚Ä¶and when on Effexor I required 400mg to get any response. 

So my deduction was‚Ä¶okay: Let‚Äôs drop the Effexor since it never has caused me any problem. I‚Äôve trialed countless SSRIs and SNRIs. Enough already. Let‚Äôs make Wellbutrin my primary medication! I‚Äôve never actually tried that. I‚Äôve been dosing 300mg XL for two weeks, quit Effexor 4 days ago, and started 60mg Vyvanse today ‚Ä¶I feel LIKE MYSELF for the first time in SO LONG. I CARE about stuff! I have hope for the future! I can feel sexual feelings for the first time in YEARS. I can focus but also laugh and relax. I‚Äôm hopeful some of this crazy weight gain was tied to the chronic SSRI dosing too. 

For those interested this is my current regimen

My Core Mental Health Meds:

Welllbutrin XL 300mg (MDD/ADHD)

Vyvanse 60mg (ADHD)

*Suboxone 8mg (Chronic Pain/MDD)

Suboxone was actually a desperate attempt to breakthrough. But I am seeing that it‚Äôs not needed. I am already on the sublocade shot so I expect to resume quitting altogether. 


Other Meds that be helping as well

Lyrica 450mg (Chronic Pain/Anxiety)

MetFormin ER 1000mg (Prediabetes)

Diclofenac 150mg (Chronic Pain)

-Lyrica is well known in this sub and can definitely offer a very pleasant mood boost but that does wear off after a few months. Now I like it for it offsetting any overstimulation from the Vyvanse/Wellbutrin combo and supporting my sleep. 

-MetFormin has a lot of proof as being a great add-on to a primary anti-depressant. If you have any insulin resistance that could be your depression right there. 

-Diclofenac is an NSAID but also has shown promise as an adjunct. NSAIDs are gaining. Steam as Depression is more and more found to be tied to inflammation. Ibuprofen and Naproxen help too, but supposedly Celebrex is the best NSAID for depression and gut health, so I may switch to that.

Supplements

Daily Probiotic 

Omega 3 1000mg Daily

Vitamin D 50,000iu Weekly

Vitamin B Complex

L-Tyrosine 2,000mg 

Magnesium Citrate 200mg Daily

I swear by probiotics for staying regular and having healthy bowel movements. I‚Äôve long struggled with constipation and nothing helps more than a good probiotic. I use the NOW Foods brand. 

-Omega 3 has the most support for treating both ADHD and Depression of anything over the counter that I know of. EPA and DHA literally are needed to make the neurotransmitters Serotonin and Dopamine. Following on the NSAIDS, they reduce inflammation as well.

-Vitamin D in my experience is moreso preventative, I don‚Äôt think it helps if you‚Äôre not deficient. But it‚Äôs safe and seems good for your general health.

-Vitamin B Complex and L-Tyrosine are just neurotransmitter food. Haven‚Äôt had much direct benefit for Tyrosine since the first time I tried it years ago. Probably won‚Äôt buy it again. 

-Magnesium has countless functions. Citrate can be a good laxative but hefty doses of 300-500mg at once can increase GABA and relieve some symptoms of anxiety. 

Please don‚Äôt give up everyone. Above all else TRUST yourself. And try to resist the urge to start too many meds together. Take one and see how it affects you. Otherwise you‚Äôll have no idea what‚Äôs doing what! It never occurred to me to take something OUT of my stack. And it appears that dropping the SNRI was the best thing I‚Äôve done. While I‚Äôm sure this no hard and fast rule, this does seem common for those of us with ADHD. SSRIs and SNRIs commonly aggravate symptoms.

I‚Äôll report back in a month to see if this keeps, but I am highly optimistic this is no fluke. ‚ù§Ô∏è

433,1,"It‚Äòs day 2 (!) of taking Panax Ginseng (500mg extract, of which 100mg are ginsenosides). I started with the belief it will be not working just as everything else I tried, just wanted to use it as I paid it and it was laying around too long, expiring soon. But strangely the last 2 days I experienced a big very significant relief in my symptoms of my diagnosed depression and anxiety.

AS it‚Äòs ONLY DAY 2 and very very common for people to placebo after starting some supplement and then be claiming really early that this works wonders and cures diseases after just starting, I just want to ask you guys about 

- your experiences with ginseng (similar?)
- and knowledge about its psycho-pharmacological properties that might be influential and affecting mental health, depression and/or anxiety (to the level or type that I noticed now).

First day, yesterday, hour or so after I took the first Ginseng capsule, I noticed my depression (low unstable mood, anhedonia, lack of drive, negative thought/spirals etc.) and anxiety (generalized,  
social anxiety) was suddenly much much better. Like a lot. 

Mood is stable and good, positive. Anxiety is away. I can get out of bed again, go into public and out of my apartment again, I answer call/ and do calls again, I shower and brush my teeth again, I move, I don‚Äòt lay in bed all day anymore, I make myself something to eat and eat more again, I find pleasure in these things and others and have a better outlook again, my thoughts are way more positive, I have a lot of more energy in comparison (also physical - before I was almost wheelchair level regarding my physical energy and movement a day, not trying to exaggerate, before even moving a finger was like oh man this is kinda exhausting). I also have a better focus again and can think clearer, remember stuff and feel way less brain fog.

Today, second time I took it, is the same.

Of course I would come back after prolonged trial of this and post about my experience if it really works and gets clearer that I really experience this insane symptom reduction of Ginseng.

About 3 years ago I started dealing with a lot of weird symptoms like extreme fatigue, tingling and pain in certain areas of my body, nausea, regular headaches, temperature dysregulation, intense brain fog etc. 

I've been assuming it was intense anxiety, it felt like something very wrong was happening with my mind and body. About a month or two after this I had a terrible experience with weed and soon after I was dealing with Depersonalisation/Derealisation and intense anhedonia. 

I've had lots of tests done by doctors but they haven't been able to find anything wrong in the tests that I've done. I'm currently dealing with constant tingling in my hands and feet and I get weird pains in those areas as well. 

Medications aren't helping much. I'm currently on Clomipramine, Propranolol and I've just started rexulti. The symptoms that I'm dealing with are similar to what people with POTS and Peripheral neuropathy deal with but I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet.

441,1,"Hi redditors!

I was wondering if red light therapy helps with seasonal depression.

I saw a few posts and videos talking about ""SAD lamps"" that are made to emulate sunlight (or something, not sure about the science.) I messaged my mom and asked if she could perhaps gift me one and when I got it in the mail it was not a SAD lamp, but a red light therapy device. 

I've heard good things about red light therapy for aesthetic and pain relief purposes. However, I have also seen information claiming that in order for red light therapy to work It needs to be in a huge sauna filled with red light. So my question is does red light therapy work and does it need to be in a big room?

My mom bought this device for US$300 and a regular SAD lamp is only about US$70. So I was wondering if the results would be worth it or if I should ask her to return it. It's supposedly 400W if that's relevant."
442,1,"I was as normal as you can be my whole life until I was 36 years old. We had our first child and with complications during the birth it triggered my anxiety and depression.

It‚Äôs been 8 years and I‚Äôve been stuck with this illness which has been relentless. You never get used to it but you do learn to accept it and live with it as best you can. 

I‚Äôve spent thousands on private psychiatrists in the hope to find a ‚Äòcure‚Äô, but it has largely been fruitless. Trialing medication after medication for years which only made me feel worse. Then a couple of months ago my psychiatrist suggested I try one of the few antidepressants I haven‚Äôt tried before and I flat out refused due to past experiences. Surely it couldn‚Äôt possibly make me feel better. But I was so worn out and desperate that I finally agreed. To my surprise I had zero side effects, which is all I ever got, and within a couple of weeks I started noticing a difference.

Some background: History of depression, anxiety, epilepsy and drug abuse. Sober for 8 months now. I am currently prescribed 2000mg Keppra, 1000mg Depakote ER, 150mg Armodafinil, 60mg buspar and 7.5mg Mirtazapine. I take Caffeine and Kratom very regularly and I go to the gym 2-4x a week. 

Just like most people on this sub, I too have been on the quest for bettering my mental health and sense of well being. Tried many different medications throughout the years, but could never stick to most of them due to side effects or underwhelming relief of depression/anxiety and/or anhedonia.   
For the past couple of months, I noticed things were starting to feel more off than usual. I've always had or experienced anhedonia to some extent, but I was starting to notice that I was feeling more angry/irritable lately, inability to relate to my peers and gf, loss of interest in socializing, difficulty in enjoying light hearted content (I've been having to watch more serious/dark content lately as that was the only thing that was keeping my attention at home). I couldn't quite figure out what was wrong, but I knew that I wasn't totally myself. A lot of things were running through my head: Is it the weather, stress, unemployment, maybe the kratom was finally turning on me, maybe any of my current meds were having a bad reaction, or maybe even any of the previous meds! I was sort of at a loss, but I will be starting a new job next week, so I was still optimistic that things were going to be okay.  

I used to take a P5P supplement earlier this year. For some reason, while I was trialing out pramipexole, I had ceased most of my vitamin supplementation. I'm not sure why I did this, but I think I experienced brain fog that either made me forget, or I just simply didn't care to do it. Yesterday night, on a whim, I decided to take my P5P for the first time in months. And holy, I felt like I had taken a drug. I was on a low dose of DXM and my regular kratom dose, I felt like the effects were potentiated (I take DXM sometimes at lower doses, so I knew what I experienced was unusual in the context of these last couple of months). I experienced some strong deja vu about how I used to feel and act earlier this year. I was convinced that I am deficient in B6. I've never had a blood test done to confirm this, I can only speculate subjectively. It's only a day later, but I still feel that I no longer have this anhedonic wave on me and I'm able to feel more interpersonal emotions. I can actually pay attention to light hearted content on youtube and enjoy it. I feel much less angry and irritable too.

  
I will update in a week or so and see if the effects persist. "
446,1,I‚Äôve been thinking about getting on anti depressants to numb emotions. Does anyone regret getting use to the feeling of having your emotions numb? If you could go back in time would you prevent yourself from numbing your emotions in order to maintain what they once use to be? I feel like numbing my emotions would be like me getting on cocaine and really liking it and then being to scared to stop using it and then become dependent on it. And id rather just deal with the rawness of emotional pain if that means I get to by pass withdrawal and dependency .
447,1,"

So I‚Äôve been taking bupropion (300 mg) since 2019. 

For the past few years, I‚Äôve been kind of lacking motivation to do basic things, like cooking and cleaning. Like I just don‚Äôt feel like doing those things. I‚Äôm in grad school and work part time on top of that. And I have a TikTok, which I spend hours on daily. 

Idk. I think burnout combined with TikTok/doomscrolling has really affected me. I don‚Äôt have the energy or motivation to work out, cook, clean, etc. I just don‚Äôt feel like doing those things. And sometimes I procrastinate with school because I just don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúdo the thing.‚Äù

But I also have a lot of general anxiety and a fear of things. My biggest fear is that there will be a fire in my apartment when I‚Äôm not there and my pets die. I also fear choking to death because of TikTok üòÖ

Could this have anything to do with bupropion? Idk if it‚Äôs depression, anxiety, or both. 

Anyway, my PCP prescribed me Prozac because she said that bupropion can make anxiety worse ‚úåÔ∏è "
448,1,"**Note**: Don‚Äôt take iron supplements without talking to your doctor and getting blood work done first. Taking iron without a confirmed deficiency can lead to iron overload, which is dangerous.

****

Just sharing something I found interesting for anyone who‚Äôs had success with serotonergic antidepressants but struggles with that awful motor restlessness (akathisia) - the feeling where you can‚Äôt sit still, and it‚Äôs just physically uncomfortable to stop moving.

This can happen with antidepressants that boost serotonin because serotonin can suppress dopamine in the brain, and low dopamine is linked to akathisia. This is well-documented in people taking dopamine-blocking medications (like antipsychotics). So basically, serotonin goes up ‚Üí dopamine goes down ‚Üí akathisia.

This small study from 1992 suggests a link to iron levels. The researchers looked at people on imipramine (a potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor TCA) and found that those who got jitteriness from it had much lower iron levels compared to those who didn‚Äôt. We need iron to make dopamine, so low iron might make akathisia more likely, especially when paired with a serotonin-boosting medication. Iron deficiency can cause akathisia even without dopamine-lowering/blocking drugs. This means that low iron levels might lower the threshold for these drugs to cause akathisia - for example, the effect might appear at lower doses than it would if iron levels were sufficient.

Even though imipramine isn't much in use today, these findings are most likely to also apply to SSRIs, since the most plausible explanation for akathisia from imipramine is its potent serotonin reuptake inhibition property, which is shared with SSRIs - which also are known to cause akathisia in some people.

Study:
[Imipramine-induced jitteriness and decreased serum iron levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1603294/)

Full paper PDF [here](https://sci-hub.se/10.1159/000118801).

Here‚Äôs [Table 1](https://i.imgur.com/h150jP2.jpeg) from the study, showing the difference in serum iron levels between the jitteriness-positive and jitteriness-negative groups: the patients who got jitteriness from imipramine had serum iron levels almost 50% lower than those who haven't. Serum iron isn‚Äôt the best marker of iron status (ferritin is better), but it‚Äôs not useless.

****

**What this means:** If you‚Äôre dealing with akathisia, it might be worth checking your iron levels, especially if you‚Äôve had symptoms of low iron (like fatigue or hair loss). Talk to your doctor about testing ferritin and other markers to get the full picture before trying supplements. And of course, this is just one piece of the puzzle - there are lots of reasons for akathisia, and meds can often be adjusted to help."
449,1,"I (54F) have suffered from major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and anxiety ever since I was a child. I once made myself fall down a flight of stairs in the hopes I would injure myself to avoid dealing with bullies at school the next day. I was 6 years old.

I've been on so many different meds. I couldn't hack the weight gain from perimenopause and atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. I'm now on 3 meds: Bupropion (SNRI), Sertraline (SSRI), and Fetzima (NDRI). I've taken THC gummies on the weekend so I can focus on my painting and art. It really just loosens me up, makes me laugh and I feel like everything is OK.

I don't use while I'm working, but I'm afraid I'm probably messing everything up with the anti-depressants. I know I need to tell my psychiatrist, but I'm miserable and the gummies are the only thing that make me feel OK.

I'm just really lost and am having a hard time trying to see my psychiatrist before my next appointment, but I can't get in. I'm having trouble functioning at work. I've been crying a lot, anxious, self harming. 

How bad have I messed up by using gummies?
I need help and my shrink appointment is on 12/17. Does anyone have some experience with what I'm going through? I just need to feel like I'm not crazy. I also see a therapist 1-2 times per month.

Currently I‚Äôm just on Lamictal and I‚Äôve reached the max dose. It makes me feel a little high and gives me energy but the depression is very much there. 

I gave all of these a proper try, like 3 months on each

- Lexapro worked for like 1-2 weeks and I felt *amazing* and then it made me extremely tired and I still felt depressed
- Prozac same thing as above
- Imipramine same as above although the start wasn‚Äôt as good
- Lyrica makes me feel great. It‚Äôs my favourite meds of all, even better than benzos. But I know I could build a tolerance so I only take it twice a week
- Benzos I don‚Äôt want to build a tolerance so I take it twice a week
- Medical marijuana is fine but doesn‚Äôt remove my depression
- I tried Welbutrin for a week and it made me tired and made my hands shake. I did take it at the morning so that could be the reason for tiredness. I would be willing to try it again but it‚Äôs x6 the cost of other antidepressants in my country 

I know SNRIs are an option but I‚Äôm so scared about the withdrawals if you want to stop. SSRI withdrawals were bad enough. I was having brain zaps for like 6 months 

Does anyone have any suggestions? I feel like I‚Äôve tried so hard and I‚Äôve missed out on so many social events because I just want to stay at home and be sad here. Honestly being social makes me feel better but I get burnt out and I know it‚Äôs a distraction because as soon as I come home I‚Äôm sad. I‚Äôve tried several years of CBT and DBT therapy, somatic therapy. I know how to feel my emotions and I know my depression stems from my trauma and I‚Äôve talked about it 100 times and I don‚Äôt even cry about it anymore because I‚Äôve re-lived it over and over again.

Thankfully I'm on Seroquel to offset risks of inducing mania, and I quit caffeine years ago so the Luvox shouldn't be an issue. 

From what I understand, Luvox is more sedating which should be better for anxiety relief, but I also see that Zoloft is FDA approved for social anxiety (but so is Luvox CR I suppose). I know Luvox has a reputation for OCD, but I see that Zoloft is also approved for OCD as well. 

As for the bipolar depression, I've heard SSRIs aren't all that effective for it but thought I'd mention it in case anybody found them of help for theirs. The Seroquel is supposed to help with the bipolar depression but I sometimes still struggle with motivation."

468,1,"I was taking Cymbalta for brain fog, chronic fatigue, and fibromyalgia.



It was very effective for the first few months, and all my symptoms disappeared at once, but after two months it stopped working completely.



After that, even if I increased the dose, it didn't work, and I don't know why it stopped working.



When I ask a question like this on reddit, I get the impression that it's a ""poop-out phenomenon"" and the answer ends there, but I would like to think about the cause and a concrete solution.



This is just my shallow guess, but is this because some nutrients that are necessary for the antidepressant effect are depleted by continuous use of antidepressants? Or is it because the receptors are downregulated?



I would like to add that I have another strange constitution, and any antidepressant starts working on me from the day I take it. So, I may be more likely to develop tolerance faster than the average person.



Cymbalta was a very useful way to improve my symptoms, so I would like it to be effective again.

469,1,"Hey everyone,  
I‚Äôm feeling a bit stuck and could use some advice. My psychiatrist is suggesting I go back on Abilify, and I‚Äôm honestly really torn about it. My situation is a little complicated, so here‚Äôs a bit of backstory.

I‚Äôve been on **benzodiazepines** for about a year‚Äîfirst Xanax, and now Delorazepam (EN). I‚Äôm tapering slowly (currently at 13 drops three times a day), and while I‚Äôm handling it okay so far, it‚Äôs definitely a long and challenging process.

Earlier this year, I tried **Zoloft**, but it didn‚Äôt go well at all. I only took it for about 2.5 months because I couldn‚Äôt tolerate it‚Äîconstant nausea and vomiting. I stopped it pretty abruptly (not the best idea, I know), and after that, I felt like I was hit hard with withdrawal symptoms. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm still dealing with those or if I‚Äôve just convinced myself I am at this point.

I‚Äôve also taken **Abilify** in the past. At low doses, it actually worked pretty well for me‚ÄîI felt more stable and less anxious. But when my neurologist bumped me up to 10 mg, things got bad. I started feeling emotionally numb (like, full-on anhedonia), and even when we lowered the dose, that feeling stuck around. Then they added Zoloft into the mix, and things got even worse.

Right now, I‚Äôm taking a low dose of **Pregabalin** (50 mg) to help with anxiety and my benzo taper. It‚Äôs not causing me any major issues‚Äîjust a little stomach upset‚Äîbut I also don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs helping all that much. It‚Äôs just kind of‚Ä¶ there.

So now my psychiatrist wants me to try **Abilify again**, starting at 5 mg. I‚Äôm super hesitant. The last time I was on it, I was also taking Xanax, so any potential negative effects (like increased anxiety or restlessness) were probably masked. I‚Äôm nervous about trying it now without that safety net. Plus, I‚Äôve read some pretty scary stories about antipsychotics, and I‚Äôm worried about long-term side effects, especially if it doesn‚Äôt work out and I have to stop it.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wondering:

* Has anyone had good experiences with low-dose Abilify (like 2-5 mg) for anxiety or emotional instability?
* Do you think it could still help without the benzo backup?
* Should I push to start with an even lower dose than 5 mg, just to be safe?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any insights or experiences you can share. I want to make the best decision, but honestly, I‚Äôm feeling super overwhelmed. Thanks so much for taking the time to read this."

While other people say that Wellbutrin is just a NRI antidepressant and that it has barely any effect on dopamine because Wellbutrins major metabolite is Hydroxybupropion which is a norephinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It seems like we don't know so much about this antidepressant after all. Even though Wellbutrin has been around since the 80s we still don't know so much about its main mechanism of action.

Did it help you,"
476,1,"Hello,

I am a recovering opiate addict I've been sober now for 15 months. 

10 months ago I had my final Sublocade shot (injectable suboxone). The shot/medication is known to slowly dissipate out of your body for close to a year or over.

For most of the year while on it I felt pretty dead inside and lifeless, numb, symptoms of low Testosterone.

Then 7 months ago the symptoms/side effects were so bad my doctor prescribed me Vyvanse 20mg time release (version he prescribed to recovering addicts/can help sublocade negative effects).

For the first few months it was very helpful regulating my mood but tolerance builds quickly and we were consistently increasing my dose every couple months.

I can't tell if it's the Sublocade causing a prolonged withdrawal (now 10 months since a shot) or the Vyvanse tolerance but I feel more terrible then I've ever felt in my life .

In the last 10 months I've lost 30 lbs, I'm very socially withdrawn, struggling to exercise (regularly exercise daily my whole life) weak, tired, severely depressed which seems to get worse by the day.

I knew going on opiate replacement therapy would be rough(from past experience) but I've never felt this terrible, depressed, withdrawn. It's gotten to the point I barely want to speak or reach out to anyone which I've never experienced.

I now regret ever taking Vyvanse as it's likely made this much worse, im planning to completely get off but I'm worried about how I might handle that in this state and if will make things worse (if most of what im experiencing is Sublocade withdrawal).

I've dealt with mental health depression/anxiety at times but I haven't ever tolerated medications well overall in the past:

 Lexapro failed /zoloft failed/effexor failed/ Trintellix really helped for 7 months but gave me debilitating brain fog and had to stop.

I can tell this isn't just a mental health issue. I also feel somewhat helpless because you can't just stop taking Sublocade and I've read about some patients having similar negative effects for over a year.

I'm committed to finding myself out of this position, put my brain in a position to recover, and stabilize my mood but I feel really stuck already feeling this horrible.

I was hoping I'd feel better/this be over this far into sobriety.

My doctor hasn't provided a clear direction on what I should do either.

I'm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar? 

Did a mental health medication help or anything in addition to (exercise /meditation) which I've been doing?

Or if anyone has any advice would be really appreciated, this is peak darkness for me.

478,1,"Finally a study that confirms my experience :) I tried many SSRIs and was always told that side effects would get better over time, so I always tried to stick with the meds.

And this insomnia would never get better unless I stopped the SSRI.
So now a study confirms - for a proportion of people, side effects of SSRIs get worse over time. And sleep disturbances are one of the common and most distressing side effects.

My psychiatrist wants me to lower sertraline to taper it off, i went from 50mg to 25mg since a week, this might be the cause but i don't know, i still take 300mg wellbutrin, but again it only helped the first 2 weeks in 2022, then i felt down again, not like i am right now, but still the honeymoon was the best i've felt in my life since i was a kid...

I thought i could be bipolar, but never went really manic so i don't know, my doctors suspect spectrum bipolar, but they are cautious with stabilizers because i tend to be really unfocused with them, like valproate was making me a zombie, and carbamazepine was making me stupid.

Next time i go to the psychiatrist i want to ask for something else, maybe will change antidepressant, i really don't know, i feel worse than ever, i don't know who i am, i feel so scared inside.

Need advices please, i know this the only subreddit with people who really know what is this illness and not kids that search attention..."
485,1,"Hi all, 

I've recently been prescribed Mirtazapine for insomnia at 15mg. It works great for knocking me out and getting over 8 hours of sleep. I'm still not completely sold on it, as I don't particularly like the after effects (brain fog, drowsiness and dizziness). and it might have some mild libido lowering effects on me (but still nowhere near the levels of SSRIs libido dysfunction, it's even better than Vilazodone in this department) I think it might work best for me if I only keep it as an as needed basis, but I have yet to trial it everyday for a while to see if the negative after effects disappear. 

My question is, has anyone taken Buspar and Mirtazapine together? I've been noticing some weird effects whenever I dose my Buspar on the days after I take Mirtazapine. I would get a spike in anxiety and maybe even some paranoia, but this would dissipate in hour or so. I'm prescribed 60mg Buspar daily, but I am now a bit hesitant to take a 30mg tab at once as I don't wanna feel these negative effects. Has anyone experienced something like this before with Buspar while on Mirtazapine? FYI I am also currently prescribed Depakote ER, Keppra and Armodafinil. "
486,1,"So I suffer from treatment resistant Major Depression and Borderline Personality along with Substance Abuse Disorder, GAD, Panic disorder, and other neurological issues like restless leg syndrome that relate to anxiety. 3 total attempts and 1 revival that was almost successful. I‚Äôve tried everything and I know a lot of ppl on here have tried a lot but the only medication I haven‚Äôt tried is MAOIs. SSRIs, TCAs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers even off label drugs like antipsychotics, Lithium and Auvelty. Nothing ever works. I‚Äôve also done some newer non drug treatments like TMS, rTMS, and ECT at psych hospital. I‚Äôve done EMDR therapy along with CBT, DBT, Mindfulness, breath work. I go to therapy regularly and meditate regularly but it ends up only making me mad bcuz I have no clue what I was doing wrong. I‚Äôve been to so many psych wards that I knew them on a first name basis. I‚Äôve had long term stays up to 4 months once. I‚Äôve tried ketamine as well and nothing helps. I was so desperate for relief that I‚Äôd dress up all nice and walk in bad neighborhoods hoping someone would try to rob me so I‚Äôd refuse and then get killed and not have my death labeled as suicide so my family wouldn‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs their fault. 

I started s/h at 11 cutting deep and I was hooked. At 12 I was put into my first 72 hr hold, the first of very many. My balls hadn‚Äôt even dropped yet. I couldn‚Äôt stop cutting that when at psych wards I‚Äôd scratch until my skin was falling off and do other forms of s/h like hitting and pulling hair. I went to every session in the hospital with an open mind prepared to take notes but at one point I accepted that I was never not going to be at the ward. I was sick forever, permanently dead but alive. Waking up every morning angry bcuz I lived another day. I got stitches so much that my insurance stopped paying and my mom said it‚Äôs coming out of my pocket. So what‚Äôd I do? I just would not get stitches. I ran out of psych wards in my state to go to so I went out of state a couple of times. 

About a week ago I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. There had to be something that I could do, there‚Äôs no way I could be alive for a second more. I had two choices in my head: suicide or drugs. I chose drugs and pumped my body full of meth, heroin, alcohol, benzos hell I even tried PCP. Sure it felt great but when it was out of my system I was back to square one. I begged God for a miracle but I never heard anything back. I did some research about the drugs that I was putting into my body and found that meth upregulated dopamine levels 2,000% and realized that when I wasn‚Äôt using my dopamine would be even more down-regulated than it was in the beginning. 

I began looking down the path of nootropics and came across neuropeptides. I did more research and found that two peptides: Selank and Semax are used in Soviet countries for depression, anxiety and head injuries. In the 90s it was used to treat head injuries because it induces neurons to repair and make new connections. But they found out that when the patients woke up after their injury the ones with depression felt better so they started testing. Study after study showed long term use with a favorable safety profile was actually sometimes better than Prozac along with less side effects. I read about 20 clinical trials and versed myself in medical knowledge, even reading Russian papers in a translator but preferred English ones. I thought to myself: this might actually work. Non addictive, non habit forming and is a peptide that works completely differently than any drug on the market worldwide. Its not an inhibitor, it doesn‚Äôt work like anything else. It actually works by increasing serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine along with endorphins, which is different than inhibitors. People with depression have statistically lower levels of the protein BDNF in the brain and this increases that. It‚Äôs actually OTC in Latvia or Russia I can‚Äôt remember. It‚Äôs also instant acting and gets broken down into amino acids. 

So I asked my psychiatrist and told him I‚Äôm going to try it and he said go for it. I chose Selank over Semax bcuz Semax is more for depression and Selank is more for anxiety and I didn‚Äôt want to be more stimulated I just needed to relax. 

It just came in last week. I started off with 250ug intranasal and five minutes later I was feeling better and strangely I felt smarter. An hour later I was crying tears of joy bcuz I have felt so numb for so long that I didn‚Äôt know who I was anymore. I felt confident, at ease. Relaxed yet slightly stimulated. I was shocked, it truly through me for a loop. I felt like the guy from limitless, breaking free from those chains that depression put on me in the past. I could actually talk to people. I could actually sit down without fidgeting my legs. I think I can finally start living life! I‚Äôm not jealous of people smiling anymore, I‚Äôm not homicidal or suicidal. I don‚Äôt crave drugs or anything!! I‚Äôm on full disability benefits just bcuz of mental issues. I talked to my disability provider about finally maybe trying work. 

I just wanted to share my success with this peptide and want everyone else to know that if nothing works for you and you‚Äôre at the end of your ropes, give it a shot. My psychiatrist could prescribe it but it doesn‚Äôt even have a generic here and would be compounded and not covered so I went the Amazon route. God damn I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt give up. 

TL;DR I tried a peptide called Selank and I finally feel alive. I‚Äôm able to look at things differently and I‚Äôm so fuckin thankful for this peptide. It works by inducing homeostasis in the neurotransmitters, not inhibiting serotonin like Prozac. Thanks for reading. "
487,1,"I posted a couple months ago on this sub about my history and the treatments that I‚Äôve tried. Feel free to go read that post if you want more insight into my experience. 
But to summarize: A little over a year ago I fell into a deep state of anhedonia that required me to drop out of college and live at home with my parents after nearly killing myself. I tried therapy, IOP, fluoxetine, aripriprizole, bupropion, bupropion + dxm, and vilazadone before trying TMS. TMS produced no effects (positive or negative), so I was able to convince my psychiatrist to try out stimulants.

# Modafinil
I started with modafinil, trying doses between 50-200mg. This was the first treatment that had positive effects lasting longer than a couple weeks.
Doses below 150mg made it somewhat difficult for me to form full thoughts, as well as negatively impacting my sleep, but it increased my energy, engagement, and motivation. 
150-200mg was the sweet spot. It acted as a lubricant for my life, making tasks easier to start, things more interesting, and conversations easier to have. It was still difficult for me to form full thoughts in my head, as it felt like my focus was constantly split between multiple things. This also impacted my ability to read and engage in tasks, as I would begin to feel fidgety and constantly want to do something else. My sleep was also pretty badly impacted, which was reason enough to try a different stimulant. Overall, modafinil left me feeling scattered and ‚Äútired but wired,‚Äù but if it was the only option available then it is still one million times better than anhedonia. 

# Adderall XR 
After modafinil I switched to Adderall XR (or rather the generic version). I started at 5mg/day and worked up to 25mg/day over a couple weeks. I felt almost no effect on lower doses, but once I increased to 25mg I felt amazing. When I say amazing, I don‚Äôt mean euphoric, or high, or wired, but NORMAL! 
I‚Äôm naturally a pretty motivated and engaged person, so my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is probably a little more intense than a lot of people‚Äôs (especially those with a naturally low hedonic tone). However, it really does feel like adderall gave me my life back. I was able to make myself clean my room even if I didn‚Äôt want to, able to self learn subjects like I used to, and laugh and talk with my parents again. The only downside was pretty bad insomnia that resulted in me feeling pretty fried by the end of the week. Because of this, I asked to try the instant release formulation. 

# Adderall IR
Again, this is technically the generic version of Adderall IR, for those who care. This is the medication that I‚Äôm on now, and frankly I have somewhat mixed feelings about it compared to XR. I take 25mg daily in the form of two 12.5mg tablets administered upon waking, then 6 hours after the first dose. I am still playing around with the timing, as most days I‚Äôve still had pretty bad insomnia. I‚Äôm getting probably two more hours of sleep on average than with the XR, but that‚Äôs still only about 6 hours of sleep per night. 
I‚Äôve also had a couple days where I take my second dose a bit too late, and experience anhedonia and emotional dysregation for about an hour until my second dose kicks in. This is odd, as emotional dysregulation has never really been a symptom of my anhedonia before. It feels similar to if I forget to take my HRT for a day. Regardless, I will continue trying to find the right dosing schedule, but as of now I‚Äôd say I slightly prefer XR over IR, and there‚Äôs a solid chance I‚Äôll switch back at my next psych appointment. 

# Important Notes
With any dopaminergic drug, the likelihood of forming a tolerance is something to be aware of. Because of this, I take every Saturday and Sunday off, which basically throws me back into the pit that stimulants have helped me escape. It‚Äôs not fun, but it‚Äôs manageable and very worth it for the ability to (hopefully) use this drug as a long term treatment, rather than something that works, but only for a couple months. My psychiatrist has said that it‚Äôs fine for me to take them on the weekend and do less frequent brakes, but in my opinion I‚Äôd rather only violate my rule of taking weekends off if something really important comes up and I need the ability to engage in it. 
I should also say that the effectiveness seems to build over the week, meaning that on Mondays I feel considerably less stimulated. It‚Äôs rough to only be back to my full self 4/7 days of the week, but I also think that it‚Äôs a good sign that I‚Äôve found the lowest effective dose, rather than relying on a high dose to keep me going throughout the week. 
For the sake of completeness, I‚Äôll mention that there are a couple other side effects that I‚Äôve experienced such as substantially decreased appetite, increased heart rate, and a desire to fidget or do something with my hands throughout the day, so keep this in mind if you‚Äôre thinking of starting stimulants. 

# Conclusion 
Sorry for the length, but I always found more detailed posts to be more useful when looking for experience reports on this and other subreddits. 
I‚Äôve been on stimulants in general for just about two months now, and adderall for about a month. Thanks to these meds I‚Äôve been able to start the process of re-enrolling in college for next semester, form more meaningful relationships with those around me, and find interest in the things I love to do.

Tl;dr: Stimulants have been an effective treatment for my year long anhedonic episode. Adderall has allowed me to function and feel like a normal person again, and although it has some downsides like insomnia and having to take regular tolerance breaks, it‚Äôs helped me get my life back!"
488,1,"i made a checklist of things i need to go through when im depressed. this list has things such as aerobic exercise, meditation, etc, etc. what do you guys have on this list (if you use something like this) "
489,1,"
Just wondering if anyone here has had experiences with both Mirtazapine and Mianserin? (Mianserin is related to Mirtazapine in some way)

How would you compare the two? And have you tried in combination with an ssri? 

I found Mirtazapine to be slightly dysphoric as well as a bit numbing. Tried all the doses too. 
Mianserin is meant to be less heavy on the serotonin side of things and potentially have a more dopaminergic blueprint. I also believe pharma companies like to push Mirtazapine more heavily than Mianserin because I‚Äôve barely ever seen it mentioned anywhere and doctors I‚Äôve seen have never heard of it. 

Thoughts on the matter? "
490,1,"I‚Äôve had utter hell this year. After suffering with depression and anxiety / anhedonia most of my adolescence and adult life, opioids nailed the coffin shut last year. I used heavily for 12 months, daily, eventually going on to
Buorenorphine to get off it, within three months, I was completely off. Once the buprenorphine left my system fully however, I haven‚Äôt been the same, 13 months later. I‚Äôve tried over 16 different medications, TMS, Ketamine, behaviour therapy, therapy for rewiring rewards pathways after abusing opiates, exercise, nothing. I noticed I lost all ‚Äúrunners high‚Äù from working out, I was a gym junkie before using opiates. 

I finally had a gut full of it, yesterday was the first proper warm day of the year, and I was sick and tired of being a vegetable. I took 2.5mg of oxycodone I had left in a safe, and within an hour, I was back to my pre-opiate state. Smells became clearer, my taste improved, I deliberately exercised and felt the runners high, I could experience pleasure in music and it had completely eliminated my anhedonia and brain fog, from 2.5mg‚Ä¶. 

After 13 months of no opioids in my system, including buprenorphine, surely there would be progress by now? Is it even possible to get ‚Äúhigh‚Äù off half a 5mg tablet of oxycodone? I certainly didn‚Äôt feel high‚Ä¶. No euphoria, just normal! 

Is it possible I have severely damaged my opioid system? I was in total shock, I couldn‚Äôt believe after 13 months, that 2.5mg oxycodone brought me back to my baseline. 

I‚Äôm definitely not going to use them to self medicate, never going through that ever, ever again. The hell that was opioid withdrawal I don‚Äôt wish on anybody, I have never felt more horrific and vulnerable in my entire life, it was worse than when I lost my dad. Anybody thinking about it, please don‚Äôt. I just wanted to share and ask if anybody has experienced this, and if there are ways of potentially repairing the opioid system? "
491,1,"The following study claims that Methylphenidate and an experimental DRI reduced the serotonin levels by 63% relative to the increased level that was achieved by citalopram alone when combined with it while also increasing dopamine by 149% of that achieved with Methylphenidate alone or the DRI alone. This effect was prevented by the administration of a 5HT1A antagonist and therefore no reduction in serotonin occured and no increase in dopamine over the normal amount achieved with Methylphenidate alone. Now since this huge reduction in extracellular serotonin was blocked by a 5HT1A antagonist, this means that the 5HT1A autoreceptor got activated once Methylphenidate has been administered and therefore immediately reduced serotonin by 63%. Antagonizing the 5HT1A autoreceptor prevented this reduction in serotonin indicating that it‚Äôs indeed the receptor responsible for all these issues. Now since SSRIs downregulate the 5HT1A autoreceptor after 2 weeks at which the serotonin levels return to normal this might explain why initially taking any stimulant greatly increases my OCD and anxiety to the point where I would not tolerate it and eventually stop it after 4 or 5 days and therefore not giving it enough time for the autoreceptor to downregulate. Does anyone have the same experience as in stimulants initially worsen your OCD, anxiety or depression? If so does everything really balance out after 2 weeks when the 5HT1A autoreceptor downregulates? I‚Äôm right now on Vilazodone which should already prevent these issues from occurring since it partially agonizes the 5HT1A receptor but I‚Äôm yet to test this hypothesis. What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs experience?

492,1,"For anhedonic-fatigued type depression‚Ä¶ Did it do anything good for you? I hear ppl take it at night (does it cause lethargy or sedation?)

I do not want anything with potential metabolic side effects. I hear it can really increase appetite & people gain weight on it. "
493,1,"Since having to leave my job (company I co founded) several months ago, I've been in a bit of a slump motivation wise. It comes in bursts, but has typically been ""meh"" with bigger slumps where I do nothing for a while but lay around scrolling on my phone. I should emphasize that I do not feel depressed the majority of the time, just like no drive to be productive when I really do need to be.

My Dr and I recently tried Wellbutrin (been on Aplenzin before, but no longer in the US), and it hasn't worked well at all. Within 2 days of stopping, my life rebounded back.

She said if that doesn't help, given meds I've tried in the past, and while keeping risk low (not antipsychotics, dopamine agonists, or some trifecta of meds), we could try stimulants.

I spent 2 years of my life on Adderall, and it was life changing. I was reckless, yet made some positive changes that still impact me. I spent so much money, cut classes to work on a startup with friends, barked back at professors, and changes majors.

I really don't think stimulants are a good one to go back to, but I'm slightly tempted. I also worry I'd lose my creative edge that's necessary for starting another business. It's too bad they really can't be taken as needed (without paying a penalty on off days) or that could be a great fit. Fwiw, my body formed a seemingly permanent tolerance to modafinil years ago, so that's off the table sadly. It's too bad that kratom is not really sustainable long term, because that's always helped me when I need a boost in productivity for a few days.

Thoughts? Is it worth the risk to try? I am bipolar but I'm also on lamotrigine these days, and a lot more mature and able to manage impulsivity."
494,1,"What do you all think about this med with hx of depression (severe but no SI, low motivation) and also frequent panic attacks? DXM seems to be more anxiolytic but bupropion bad wrap for panic attacks. Try this med or keep looking for alternative? Tried so many."

What do you think? "
496,1,"I'll try and keep this brief.

My two biggest concerns right now are working out how to move forward in my life, and also fix my medication.

I'm currently off work, and I wanted to use this time to try and understand what I need to do to get better. My job makes me incredibly unhappy and stresses me out. I need to re-start my life because my current lifestyle is just an existence. I'm not living at all. I barely register on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

On the other hand my medication (Zoloft) which I've been on for years is no longer working, and I believe it's caused a significant numbing of my emotions, and has created, if not contributed to my Anhedonia.

I could stay in a psyche ward for weeks trying to find a better medication, or at least have them monitor my tapering. While this is going on, my life will come to a standstill and I won't have the mindset to work on myself (I predict insane side effects).

What would you prioritise?

I don't want to waste this time off work curled up in a psyche bed for weeks, when I could be looking at  moving my life forward, but at the same time I intuitively feel my medication is messing me up."
497,1,"So hi.  I've had some kind of depression since I was like maybe 11, maybe younger. There was a trauma in my childhood. But I didn't accept help until I was 19. Since then, I've tried a ton of meds, as you'll see below. I also have anxiety, PTSD and maybe ADHD, but I dont have a diagnosis for that one. So all I know is depression and some comorbidities. I'm at a point where I'm desperate for something to help - I haven't felt this hopeless since I was a suicidal teenager. I'm in my 30s now, and I feel like I've run out of options, and I'm just falling falling falling into the abyss. I need something to cling to. I usually have some kind of program or new medication to try but everything is just weighing me down.

So this is me begging for help. See my details below, if you get through it all, you're a star. 



 I've done ketamine infusions 12x, ECT (8 sessions I think, maybe up to 12? I can't remember), and rTMS twice, on two different places on my head, one at the front, the other at the back. I've also done mushrooms 4 or 5 times. None of them helped. Nothing. Nada. Zip.



I've had a number of psychiatrists, including some that just straight up said there was nothing they can do for me, but for the past 7 years or so I've had a psychiatrist I trust. So I'm 33 now, and 19 when I started meds - so 14 years of drug treatments (give or take as I did do a few 6 months stints clearing all meds out of my system). 



So below is a list of the medications I've tried. Literally the only one that has helped my depression is 6mg rexulti. And I still feel depressed, but not suicidal anymore. I'm still on amitriptyline for migraines, and prazosin for nightmares and hymnopomic hallucinations (I don't have schizophrenia or other disorders that cause hallucinations). Also side note, I find all the other medications do literally nothing, not even side effects, so maybe I have a squiggly brain. Who knows  - not me.

Medications I've tried:

cipralex, wellbutrin, mylan-mirtazpine, lorazepam, pristiq, sertraline, venlafaxine, cymbalta, prozac, abilify, gabapentin, trintellix, seroquel, trazadone, zopiclone, effexor, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, ketamine infusions (x12), ondansetron, anafranil clomipramine, phenelzine, lithium, zolpidem, citalopram, parnate, viibryd, moclobemide, modafinil, vyvanze, minocycline, cytomel, lithium, amitriptyline, rexulti, concerta, lyrica (pregabalin), adderall (amphetamine XR), luvox (Fluvoxamine), propranolol, clonidine, acetylcysteine, prazosin (for PTSD nightmares and hallucinations), buspar, lamotrigine, paroxetine.



I'm also in therapy. I've done intensive CBT - wasn't for me. Acceptance and Commitment therapy made more sense, and I'm still working with that. DBT i know little about but I'm waiting for a program to start where I live (hopefully in the next 6 months). 



So basically, I feel like I'm at the end of my rope, and that I've exhausted my options - I feel incredibly hopeless and just completely desperate to find something that makes a difference for the better. 



My mood has been etremely low, I've been sleeping a lot as an escape (and yes I know that doesn't help), I have panic attacks about being alive and having to live feeling as depressed as I do. In the periods where my mood is extremely low I get strong urges to self-harm (I have a good support system set up so I haven't in almost a year.  (let me know if I need to edit out the next sentence but:>! I phantasize about doing long, deep cuts down my forearms and legs so that I can see all the different tissues and layers and stuff and I feel like maybe if I did that doctors would take me more seriously and be more inclined to actually help me in some way, I don't think about it in a it'll kill me way, more like a maybe it will visualize how I'm feeling way. !<

 Then my mood flips and I feel completely apathetic. I should mention during both of these moods I stop taking care of myself. I don't eat unless someone hands me food, I don't brush my teeth or my hair as much as one should, don't shower as often, I sit and do nothing for long periods of time. I disengage with everything around me and stare off into nothing a lot. 

  
A VNS implant is the only other thing I can think of, and I have yet to find anyone in Canada who does it for depression. I'm in Canada, looking to go down to the US to do it if it comes to that.

  
Please, does anyone have an other suggestions on what to try? I'm hanging on by a thread and I don't know what to do.

The Trazodone is brand new and honestly, not sure it's doing the job to keep me asleep - No problem getting tired but I wake up after four hours and I go to bed at like 8, so, no bueno. I just went back to a specific brand of Magnesium Glyconate for bedtime so hopefully this gets me back on track.

BUT, on to the subject at hand.

Lexapro and Celexa both work for my MDD/Anxiety and combined with an antipsychotic (used to do citalopram/ability now on escitalopram/Rexulti) the results have me as close to remission as I've ever been!!

But y'all. I'm 36/f It's been over a year since I've slept with anyone and I have absolutely no physical desire to do so. Honestly, I'm not great at relationships/ I am changing careers right now and I actually prefer to be essentially asexual (identify as demi and gray ace, anyway). 

BUT for about a month now --- might coincide exactly with Rexulti, lol, y'all see my regimen - between memory and time blindness who knows --- I can't orgasm AT ALL when masturbating. 

I've never had a particularly high sex drive but I've always heard at my age I should be approaching some sort of sexual peak. lol, right now, it's giving valley.

 I know some people take higher doses of Rexulti and experience unmanageably high sex drives, but like I said the Rexulti basically killed what little sexual pleasure I had left. It brought color back to the world so I'm not willing to give it up unless there are some other options. Any chance 1mg is just my dud dose and at 1.5 I get happiness AND horniness? 

Anyone experienced any solutions?
Any regimen alternatives that helped?
How did your convo with your psych about sex drive go? 
Toy or technique game changer?
Any answers to questions I didn't think to ask?

512,1,"Hi again,

I've been TRD for about 15 years, and I want to emphasize what a game changer folate supplements have been. For some people methylfolate works, but for me (and others with similar ct mutations) only folinic acid works. Do NOT take regular folic acid- it can wreck your health in too high amounts.

Anyways, after a half a year or so on the folinic acid, it alone does help a bit. But more interestingly, suddenly all the ADs that had no effect before, have a completely different and stronger effect. Even side effects that I never got before. I used to be at 20mg Trintellix + 350mg bupropion years ago and felt nothing but fatigue. Now 10mg of Trintellix alone is basically too stimulating.

So just another reminder, especially if you have any MTHFR mutations, take the right folate supplement and ADs might actually start working for you!"
513,1,"I've been ""officially"" diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD since I was 31 (2019). Been on Sertraline 150mg and Bupropion XL 300mg, and then of course Adderall (both XR and immediate together). Oh and Trazodone 50mg for sleep (if needed, which I only took it a handful of times because it makes me feel like shit the next day).

I feel like none of my medications work. It's weird. I still have no drive/motivation to do anything, and my boyfriend keeps telling me he feels like I have no emotion or seem to care about things (which I'm starting to notice too). Are there any supplements that could maybe help? I saw someone mentioned folate supps helped their meds work better. I'd rather try that before I go to my NP to ask for a switch in dosage/meds. 

It was tough in the beginning of my diagnosis because the Sertraline zapped my libido to zero until they added the Bupropion. 

Also, anyone else feel like Adderall does nothing for them? I take the 20mg XR 1x/day and 10mg 2x/day and I feel nothing. My brother takes the 20mg XR and it super works for him. Frustrating. "
514,1,"25F I'm diagnosed with MDD and GAD and have been on 20mg of Lexapro for about 10 months now. I told my doctor I think I might have OCD and she didn't even hesitate to prescribe Abilify. I've only ever taken Lexapro and Mirtazapine so I don't know what to expect. 

She had me taking only Mirtazapine for a week because I mentioned I was been having trouble gaining weight and sleeping through the night even on the Lexapro. But it gave me horrible side effects and I think I was experiencing withdrawal from the Lexapro so I stopped taking it and switched back. Now I told her I feel as though my depression and OCD tendencies have come back in full swing (only been back on the Lexapro for a week) so she prescribed the Abilify. I was told they can't increase my Lexapro dose and this is why she prescribed the antipsychotic.

525,1,"I came across the following study stating that at least 65%-70% D2 occupancy is required to produce any antipsychotic effects. Now as far as I can tell antipsychotics start by only blocking the presynaptic receptors at very low doses and as the dose increases they begin to occupy the postsynaptic receptors. That‚Äôs why low doses are used as an augmentation to antidepressants for depression (such as Amisulpride 50mg which only blocks the presynaptic receptors at this dose). Now here comes the question. Does that mean that before 65%-70% it‚Äôs just blocking the presynaptic receptors (therefore increasing dopamine) and only starts blocking the postsynaptic receptors above this point? Or is there still some postsynaptic blocking at an occupancy lower than 65%? The reason I‚Äôm asking is because I want to take Risperidone 0.5mg (which has about 30% occupancy at this dose) so I can get nearly complete 5HT2A inverse agonism without having any D2/D3 postsynaptic blockage and dopamine reduction. Is this possible? Bear in mind that Risperidone at 0.5mg-2mg is used as an augmentation to antidepressants for depression and is pretty effective. It was even used as an augmentation to partial MAOI responders who achieved full remission after its addition.

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3198174/

‚ÄúFor typical antipsychotic drugs, it has been suggested that D2 receptor occupancy of at least 65‚Äì70% is required for an antipsychotic effect, and that the risk of extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) is high when D2 receptor occupancy exceeds 80% (Farde et al. 1992; Kapur et al. 2000a). A therapeutic window of 65‚Äì80% D2 receptor occupancy has therefore been suggested. In PET studies with recommended doses of the second-generation antipsychotic drugs, risperidone and olanzapine, D2 receptor occupancy has been within this window (Kapur et al. 1999; Nordstr√∂m et al. 1998; Nyberg et al. 1999; Tauscher et al. 2002).‚Äù

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002130000643

‚ÄúThe average occupancy ranged from 38% to 80% on doses of 1‚Äì6 mg/day. The saturation curve plotted against the drug level fit the data well. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the D2 receptor occupancy with risperidone in the limbic-cortical regions seems to be similar to that of previous reports regarding the striatum, and it would be comparable to that of typical antipsychotics.‚Äù"
526,1,"I have been diagnosed with depression since end of 2015 and I have gone through multiple meds - SSRIs, Wellbutrin, mirtazapine, Seroquel, Latuda, as well as rTMS. I have not heard about lamotrigine until this year, I was prescribed it in March. Lamotrigine so far actually has been the only medication that has been sort of helping me with depression and even anxiety as well. I am really wondering why I was never offered it previously, what's the risk in trying, if a person is already clinically depressed? And from what I know, lamotrigine is not even that risky of a medication.

My current psychiatrist believes that there is evidence that lamotrigine can help not only those with bipolar illness, but also patients with unipolar depression. I think more doctors should consider lamotrigine. I have read several articles and found some positive evidence.

[2006 study - unipolar depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16845646/)

This study had a sample of 14 patients with treatment resistand depression. All were treated with lamotrigine as an adjunct to other antidepressants for at least 6 months. In bipolar depression, the drug may be more effective against depression than lithium, which has been shown to be more active against mania. It is also known for is its ability to improve social and occupational functioning of patients.  
In this study, all patients with psychotic disorders, alcohol or drug abuse, and eating disorders were excluded. Tolerability is generally comparable with that of placebo when it is used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. Twelve patients of the total completed the trial, and two discontinued treatment. There was significant, rapid, and robust resolution in symptoms in all effectiveness measures, including the core symptoms of depression, as shown by the changes from baseline in CGI-S, and MADRS at 8 weeks.

Side effects - one patient discontinued treatment after 8 weeks due to the development of a scalp rash. Other patients reported mild drowsiness, somnolence, decrease in sexual desire. Also reported were mild transient headaches and dizziness; another complained of dry mouth and nervousness.

  
[Lamotrigine for persistent depressive diosrder - case report](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8919124/)

Up to two-thirds of adult patients do not achieve remission with SSRI treatment and there is limited evidence identifying reliable predictors eg , demographic , clinical , or genetic characteristics of individual response. Lamotrigine may be effective for treating patients with antidepressant resistant persistant depressive disorder.

Case presentation: We describe a woman who was diagnosed with PDD. At the age of 38, the patient presented with anxiety, reduced energy, marked tiredness, and sleep disturbances. She was prescribed with three antidepressants (paroxetine, duloxetine, and mirtazapine), which were not effective in relieving her symptoms. She was also prescribed bromazepam, which was also not effective. Subsequently, she was switched to lamotrigine, which resulted in a marked improvement in symptoms. Lamotrigine improved unipolar depression resistant to antidepressants. It also improved anxiety symptoms being free from benzodiazepines.

  
I'm very happy that my psychiatrist did inform me about lamotrigine and suggested it, so if you have treatment resistant depression and you haven't tried lamotrigine yet, it's something to consider!"

539,1,"Hi all, 

History of depression, anxiety, substance abuse and Epilepsy. I'm currently on Depakote, Keppra, Armodafinil, Vilazodone, Buspar and Gabapentin. I've had some interest for a while for Pramipexole. I've heard about the studies and other people's experience. I never got along well with the conventional antidepressants (SSRIs), I didn't even like Parnate (MAOI). So, I got pramipexole and I gave it a shot. 

At first I tried to follow along per Fawcett's dosing protocol, but I couldn't titrate fast enough as it would give me really bad nausea, I ended up purging on some days. Tropisetron helped mitigate this in. In the beginning, I was liking it. I noticed an increase in motivation and libido, as well as a reduction in anxiety. However, low doses never sustained these positve effects, so I needed to increase the dose. After 2 months of titrating up til 1mg, I've had enough. At 1mg, it was not doing anything for my sense of wellbeing, and my personality had become flat, plus still a lot of brain fog. Maybe 2mg would have worked better, but as of now, I don't have a psychiatrist that is willing to work with me on pramipexole. I am 1 week off pramipexole and I don't seem to be experiencing any signs of DAWS. I quit cold turkey. "
540,1,"As soon as I do something like going for some beers with my friends, doing sports or see a girl I'm happy. , I suggest activities myself, I'm just often a bit tired.

As soon as I'm active I feel pretty good... But it only takes one day at home for me to become depressed: I stay in bed for 12 hours listening to music, I procrastinate to the point of missing meals, I don't take care of my hygiene, I'm crying everyday (Whereas before 2024 I had never cried)... But with Parnate (80mg) I feel fine, even when I'm crying.

The problem is that it's then hard to get out of this situation (well, I need hiking for a day or clubbing all night but I usually say no to my friends because I have no energy).

At the moment I should be revising and I've turned down a vacation because of it, but I'm doing NOTHING. I could have seen my family and that saddens me enormously.

**Here's what I'm taking :**

* **80mg of Parnate**, I feel so tired 2 hours after dosing... And all the day
* **Modafinil : 400mg,** I can sometimes feel it if I take 2 pills at the same times. Today I took Guaranna, coffee et 400mg of Modafinil then I slept all the day
* **Valium, 20mg**
* (don't take anymore) Concerta 36mg : that is great but no stock and no prescription since I went to another city, it gived me energy and I was really happy but I wasn't more productive...
* (don't take anymore) Bupropion : really good for remediation cognitive, focus and maybe et bit more productive. Effects are coming after like 5 weeks and I bought it again, I will try 450mg
* (don't take anymore) Strattera : maybe the best for cognitive and procrastination but it can knock me out, it was a bad experience, even after 4 weeks)

**What I tried :**

* (A hated SSRIs : Anhedonia was the worst part, duloxetine, venlafaxine, prozac, brintellix...)
* (Amitryptiline : wow day 1 I had no more anxiety ! Problem is fatigue (they said I had mononucleosis so I didn't change my treatment). For 1 year I was flat, not good (my sister said I was more fun before lol) but I did not suffuring anymore.
* I took Kratom for studying : only thing that worked against procrastination, wtf
* At the begining of 2024 my prescription was : Brintellix, Amitryptiline, Quetiapine and Valium. I was so tired... After all that shit I've decided to self-medicate.

**Self medication (since feb 2024) :**

* I started with Parnate. It was really good at the begining but it fade out so I upped the dosage to 100mg. For the first time since 2021 I could really feel happy at some moment... And sad sometimes. Best med for anhedonia (but no improvement in motivation to do thing, I could just feel the moment).
* At the summer I did not received my indian order... And it was juste the worst week of my life. Horrible, I can't describe it. After 3 horrible days I took some Tryptophan (they also gived me Valium) and... OMG the effect were so powerful it alleviate like 50% of my withdrawal (obviously it wasn't enough but a guys from reddit sold me parnate and with 40mg/day and, I was crying when I received it, I know it was the end of this hell.
* I started Concerta, 18 mg on august and 36 mg in september. I felt good but people said I was weird, in fact it was the Tryptophan, I took to much. If we forget a difficult breakup (even with my sister and my best friend...), it felt good lol.
* September : 36 mg concerta + 60mg Parnate + 10mg Valium + Bupropion SR 150mg I felt wonderful but I slept like 3 to 4 hours every days.
* October : 400mg modafinil, 80mg Parnate, 20mg Valium... It was a bad month. Hypersomia and dificult to go out of bed. I tried Atomoxetine : just no.

My english is so bad but I really need help, I don't know what to do because here I can't see a a psychiatrist before months. however I could use video to have prescription.

**IMPORTANT : I also took SARMs for 5 month because of on accident** and I did not want to lose my muscles. From april to august. It was S23, when I stoped it I felt so bad with so much physical anxiety. I bought Enclomiphene and take it every 3 days (10mg). I have so much mood swing and I thing that the reason I could cry every day. "
541,1,I hear hydroxyzine can have a dementia risk but I‚Äôm also not sure if that‚Äôs true.  I know depression and anxiety in themselves can have a risk 
542,1,"I've been on Wellbutrin before, but was drinking a lot at the time so wasn't really able to give it a fair shot in hindsight.

Long story short, since leaving my job months ago after it got super toxic and high risk for my future (they were getting into bank fraud and other totally unethical things), I've just been struggling with slumping motivation. I'm not feeling depressed, I just don't have a lot of hope and find myself quick to give up. I've made progress in fixing this via therapy and positive activities like volunteering to bring my self worth back up, but I keep thinking I could use a bandaid to help while I do the hard work. Wellbutrin is especially appealing as I've been struggling with quitting vaping nicotine.

I do struggle with anxiety, but it's normally not crippling. I know Wellbutrin normally doesn't help in that department. But usually when I feel confident, energetic, and productive, my anxiety drops. Like modafinil used to help with my anxiety somewhat.

Have you found Wellbutrin to be effective for lack of motivation? I have so much I want to do, but I just keep avoiding it for a myriad of reasons.

Or, what else have you found helpful?

I am diagnosed bipolar II and take lamotrigine for it, but I have learned I have to be careful with antidepressants. I was extremely motivated on Nardil, but after I stopped, I realized it was pushing me to the edge of mania. Nefazodone worked great for me, but my psych took me off it as he thought it was destabilizing me. I was going through a rough period several months into treatment then started drinking a lot, and I think it was more that. But also I am mostly outside of the US now, and Nefazodone isn't available in other countries."

I‚Äôm currently on escitalopram. This med has provided very little help for me (unless I don‚Äôt take it and end up crying for hours on end).

549,1,For a long time now I‚Äôve wanted to try Pramipexole (D2/D3 agonist) after hearing alot of success stories related to it (especially for anhedonia and motivation issues). What‚Äôs stopping me sadly is the possibility of DAWS after stopping or the emergence of impulsive behavior (especially since I‚Äôm already impulsive). Now I‚Äôve had an idea which might give me a better and safer result. What if I combine Aripiprazole (which is a D2/D3 partial agonist) with low dose Amisulpride (which will act as a selective presynaptic D2/D3 antagonist)? Since Aripiprazole will also give me unwanted partial agonism at the D2/D3 presynaptic receptor (which will reduce dopamine) I can easily counter it with low dose Amisulpride‚Äôs selective D2/D3 full antagonism at the presynaptic receptors. This will hopefully give me partial agonism at the D2/D3 postsynaptic receptors and therefore boost dopamine without causing the same issues that come with full D2/D3 agonism such as impulsivity during treatment and DAWS after cessation. This will also hopefully prevent akathisa and tardive dyskinesia from occurring. Is my logic right and is my idea worth a shot? Did anyone try this before and have success with it?

554,1,"SSRIs improve depression in as many as 50-60% of patients, but their side effects often limit the therapeutic response. The main side effects - fatigue, sexual dysfunction, reduced motivation, akathisia, motor coordination deficits - seem to be related to a decrease in dopamine signaling, which is mediated by excessive activation of 5-HT2C receptors by the increased serotonin levels.^[[1]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0227-x)[[2]](https://www.jpn.ca/content/jpn/34/3/223.full.pdf)

Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressant that doesn't affect monoamine reuptake, but acts at several receptors. It is especially known for its potent antagonism or inverse agonism of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C serotonin receptors. 

If Mirtazapine blocks 5-HT2C receptors, and 5-HT2C receptors are responsible for dopamine blunting by SSRIs, it sounds like Mirtazapine should help attenuate the dopamine blunting caused by SSRIs.

Notably, Mirtazapine may induce fatigue through Histamine H1 antagonism, but this is not a concern, since tolerance builds rapidly to the sedative effects of H1 antagonism (7-10 days at most) - so its sedative effects fade quickly with daily use.

Unlike H1 receptors, however, 5-HT2C receptors don't seem to get desensitized with chronic SSRI use, which is seemingly why SSRIs cause motivation and fatigue issues even after years of use (no tolerance to that effect of theirs), so antagonism of 5-HT2C by Mirtazapine shouldn't necessarily cause upregulation of them, either.

Mirtazapine has effects at some other receptors, like 5-HT2A, 5-HT3 and alpha receptors, but I'm not sure about the significance of those.^[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine#Pharmacology)

What does everyone here think? Can Mirtazapine be taken together with a SSRI to attenuate the anti-dopaminergic effect of the SSRI?"

557,1,"I've seen and printed several studies and articles that shows how Pramipexole can be very effective for TRD, the stats has a adjunct seems to be better then anything else.
I'm on a combo of meds, probably too much but just want to mention i'm on PARNATE for about the last year.
I precise that because often people will say did you tried PARNATE because of it's effect on Dopamine.
I tried for dopamine Nardil, Wellbutrin, low dose of Abilify, they didn't work, and about 40 different meds over the years
I'm also on 175mgs of SEROQUEL( maybe my base meds), i hate that meds because of it's side effects especially the exhaustion in the morning that can stay for a good 3 hours after i wake up even if i slept a good 8-10 hours. I known it also blocks dopamine at higher dosage.
So i wake up completly not functionnal, i just go and make myself a coffee and return to my room because i just can't speack to nobody, i'm so short temper,  basically i'm so tired i just lay in bed, not able to sleep just waiting for it to get better after about 3 hours.
So i'm still dealing with important residual symptoms of depression.
The main ones are fatigue, very low motivation and without any motivation it affects all the aspect of your life and create anxiety and depression.
So lately we tried stimulants, VYVANCE doest a great job, i wake up, take 1 and after half an hour i'm up, very social, in a good mood and ready to be productive.
It basically takes my depression away.
Only big problem, tolerance builds very fast for me, in about 10-15 days it doesn't work anymore and i'm getting probably even worse depression after and i have to take a breack or tried to reset my tolerance( probably 5-7 days) or swiching to CONCERTA but it's not that good for me.
So i feel stimulants are a double 
edged-sword and i think it potentially make more harm then good in the long run when use for depression. You get that big spike of dopamine and probably when the effects goes, my already low dopamine baseline even drops lower so i'm really not sure the trade off is worth it,
10 good days vs 7 bad days.
So i'm thinking if i respond that good to stimulants that a dopaminergic agent like Pramipexole could possibly work great for me.
My psy even precibed me PRAMIPEXOLE a few days ago without knowning anything about it for TRD, she has about 10 patients on it for RLS but the protocol for TRD is very different.
I even printed all the studies, highlighted all the important points of doctor Fawcett article. So i done the hardest part, research, print and then identified the major points and she didn't even take 5 minutes to check it out and just gave me a prescription and said i will print it and take a look at it later.
So i have the prescription but didn't go get it because of the major possible side effects like addictions and DAWS syndrome, so i still didn't make my mind on it yet."

Searching Prami experience on Reddit I have found  a lot of positive in r/sexondrugs where many people say that even a tiny dose of less than 0.2mg taken once make them crave for sex all the day.

I had been taking proviron, tried Cabergoline, lots of food supplements, and while I see the effects they do (confirmed with bloodwork, testicles enlarging etc) libido boost (or any other sexual performance changes) is not among them. Even PDE5i (Viagra Cialis) stopped working for me  (not gradually, but in a short period of time). I tried marijuana several times in my life and it also almost did nothing for my brain. 

Question 2: considering my symptoms and my goals, what may be a good regimen and results with Prami? Looks like I'm gonna take it in the evening and slowly increasing the dose. But definitely not up to 1-2mg? Is there a chance libido will be higher in the long run?

563,1,"Hi everyone,

I am just wondering if a protocol like this:

* Sertraline 150 mg/day
* Nortriptyline 75 mg/day
* Bupropion 300 mg/day

Would have a similar effect to an MAOI like tranylcypromine? 

I know that some people experience quite severe side effects from MAOIs, whilst I get basically none from sertraline and nortriptyline. I'm thinking of adding bupropion to act as a DRI, plus sertraline's mild DRI effects, would result in an effective and adjustable SNDRI? I'm wondering if this would be a viable long term strategy, or if it would even work at all.

Of course this is just a generic example, and I know that everyone responds differently. I am just trying to create a hypothetical protocol that would have relatively equal inhibition of each neurotransmitter, replicating the antidepressant effects of an MAOI, perhaps having a better side effect profile for some people.

What are your thoughts? Has anyone used a similar combination or can share info on its potential efficacy and safety compared to MAOIs?

566,1,"I dont mean anticipatory and consummatory. I mean besides that. 

To me it seems like the stress and depression related anhedonia is a lot easier to treat. I rarely see crashes at least from that subgroup. They often can cycle through a bunch of meds iterate and eventually find something that helps often MAOI. That itself is a godsend if one could try things with no penalty and just iterate through treatments like in a for-loop. 

On the other hand, those who get this stuff from a virus like covid or a drug like PSSD, PFS, insert drug/supp X it seems like ANYTHING any minute can crash them. And no its not nocebo. People legitimately have crashes

I responded well to ALL GABA drugs and just recently out of nowhere switching to Valium crashes me when I expected it was like nbd and would feel like Kpin or Xanax but maybe without as much feel good, but it was actually literally anti-euphoria

It seems like the latter is an extremely resistant condition because of the sensitivities. 

The former can be resistant in terms of actually getting remission, but not as much in terms of the risk involved with things. 

Very few doctors out there can even help with the latter things. It seems like it‚Äôs basically a CFS-like condition. CFS besides overexertion can also have overnight crashes from drugs, supps, in their case they can become bedbound on a feeding tube even. 

Depression anhedonia treatments actually seem dangerous for the induced types. And yet at the same time some risk somewhere has to be taken to get better unless time heals. 

I think the drug/viral cases have some other complex pathology going on like autoimmunity, infections, mineral issues, gut issues, list goes on. It almost seems like its better to look at the CFS literature and treatments for this subtype than anhedonia treatments.

568,1,"Bupropion, an antidepressant considered equally effective to SSRIs, is said to exert its antidepressant effects through dual reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine and dopamine. This is unlikely to be true:

1. Bupropion's DRI effect is extremely weak: Clinical doses of bupropion only bind DAT to a maximum of 22%, with an average of 14% (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12185406/). This is unlikely to provide any significant reuptake inhibition of dopamine. Data about its NET binding in humans is not available.

2. Methylphenidate, a potent NDRI (with little to no known activity at other sites), is devoid of antidepressant effects. If norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibition was truly responsible for the antidepressant effects of bupropion, then methylphenidate should have been an antidepressant, too - but it is not.

Instead, the antidepressant effect of bupropion likely stems from Serotonin 3A (5-HT3A) receptor negative allosteric modulation (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5148637/). Multiple labs have found antidepressant-like effects with 5-HT3 antagonism / negative allosteric modulation (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8762176/). Unfortunately, however, this is also likely the same mechanism behind the epileptogenic (seizure-promoting) effect of bupropion, as 5-HT3 activation inhibits seizures, while 5-HT3 antagonism promotes seizures (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5771379)."

# Can benzos mask other disorders?

I‚Äôve been on benzos since I was 20 (53 years old now). I can wean myself down to the smallest dose when somewhat stable and have even managed to get off here and there but wind up needing again to function (always reluctantly as I do not want to be on these but anything we‚Äôve tried solo never seems to get me functional). What‚Äôs in the past is in the past but I wish I had never been prescribed them for severe panic attacks with no warnings of dependence or anything. I cyclically struggle immensely with my recurrent depression, anxiety, ocd and cptsd and adhd. In retrospect I am starting to think that my issues when young could very well be rooted in bipolar 2 and adhd and this could be why they have never seemed to be controlled very well on any of the many meds I‚Äôve tried. Is it at all possible that the benzos have masked hypomania symptoms over the years? When young I was aggressive, oppositional, explosive, beyond impulsive and anxious to the point of agitation at times. SSRIs seem to help some but completely blunt me. Trintellix made me euphoric for a few weeks and then threw me into DP/DR and agitated anxiety. Risperdone did help after a bout of PPD which presented as agitated anxious depression with obsessive thoughts. Weaned off due to weight gain. I‚Äôm just wondering after much reading and research if the chronic benzo usage is masking symptoms or keeping them at bay so that I can be properly diagnosed and treated. Would this make any sense at all? (Benzo being low dose klonopin. Raised at times of distress and then brought back down at times of stability). I can‚Äôt help but feel that something is missing with my diagnosis/treatment.

This is what ChatGTP comes up with when asked what the effects of Tramadol on the adrenals are, this is an excerpt of the report.

Source: ChatGTP

>Here are some potential effects of tramadol on the adrenals:

>1. HPA Axis Suppression

>Like other opioids, tramadol can influence the HPA axis. Chronic use or high doses of opioids, including tramadol, may suppress the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus. This can lead to reduced secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary, which in turn affects cortisol production by the adrenal glands.

>Suppression of cortisol production can lead to adrenal insufficiency, a condition where the body does not produce enough cortisol. This is more commonly associated with stronger opioids, but tramadol may still contribute to this effect in susceptible individuals.

>2. Cortisol Levels

>Tramadol's influence on serotonin and norepinephrine pathways (due to its dual mechanism of action) might also impact cortisol secretion indirectly. Changes in stress hormones, such as cortisol, may occur, especially during chronic use.

>In some cases, tramadol has been reported to decrease cortisol levels, potentially affecting stress response and energy metabolism.

>

I believe that people who claim Tramadol works for their depression have high Cortisol.  Cortisol is a stress hormone that activates the body for stress.  One practical example is to wake the body up from sleep.  This level is typically high in the morning and breaks down during the night, with a lowpoint just before sleep, ( to allow the body to fall asleep ).  I believe people who report diurnal variation in their depression, and with high anxiety, have to high of levels of Cortisol.  Tramadol appears to lower this instantly, so that's why it reported to have an immediate effect.

This is not a post for advocating to all try tramadol, rather the opposite.  Because I believe Tramadol is not prescribed for depression for a plethora of reasons, one of the main being: its not sustainable.  it works great to medicate anxious depression once in a blue moon.  But if taken chronically and or in high amounts, patients get to much suppression of the adrenals with very dangerous results ( low blood pressure, fatigue etc ) . I believe that is the mechanism why people say  ""it stops working after a few weeks""

Its better to look for the root cause rather then only treating the symptoms.   High Cortisol is a stress response so you would be looking for: psychosomatic stress, drugs, alcohol (ab)use, withdrawal,  to intensive physical sports or labor, worst case Could be Cushing's disease.

I went to 2 different psychiatrists and they said Im dealing with depression and i was put on zoloft.I started on 25mg and kept increasing following on my dr's orders because i was not feeling any better. I am now on 100mg and i have been on zoloft for 11 weeks. I feel slight improvement in my interaction with people but when i am alone i still feel very weird. I dont feel any adrenaline or anxiety, i dont feel like myself at all, I feel very apathetic and dont have any motivation to do anything. I used to be an A+ student now i am barely getting by.
I dont believe i have major depression and i feel like this is all from the meds i took but the doctors dont believe so.

I don't want to be on meds but in the same time i feel very lost i dont know what to do. I ordered a bunch of supplements like rhodiola lions mane saffron 5http and Ityrosine but i never used them because I panicked and felt like i should leave it to the professionals. I just want to feel like myself again. I want my old brain back the one that used to care, please help me i am desperate "
579,1,"I'm on Clomipramine 150mg and Venlafaxine 75mg for GAD, OCD, MDD and these TBH helped immensely for ocd and anxiety except morning fatigue, motivation and energy. 
Last week my psychiatrist added modafinil 100mg in the morning and after the second dose everything changed,
I'm no longer exhausted, tired and slightly helped with motivation!!! 

WTH happened? 
I tried tons of meds through 6 damn years and gone through many trials and errors but non worked like this (Modafinil)‚Ä¶?!!!

Im not saying that clomipramine and venlafaxine are useless btw 

after many trials and errors these two took me out from a very dark place. 
But that modafinil is like the cherry on the top. 

I searched everywhere for explanation and found non except it just helps with sleeping issues! 

And if it really helps like this, why doctors doesn't prescribe it from the beginning, at least with the first antidepressant they prescribe?

582,1,"Hey.

By using amphetamines (for about 6 month) I gradually fell into a psychosis (after quitting the drug), which lasted about 4-6 months.
Since then I have been depressed, less self-confident, feel stupider, can't think properly, have anxiety, etc.; the positive symptoms of the psychosis have gone away on their own.

The drug made me mentally ill.

The worst thing for me is that my ability to think is very limited and I can no longer feel any positive emotions since the psychosis.....

I have been taking 150mg buporion for 4 weeks (it has improved my anxiety) and now I am supposed to take 50-75mg amisulpride for about half a year.

This is supposed to help my brain heal better and I will be able to think more clearly again - can you confirm this?

584,1,"Recently I went into a psychosis and my life would never be the same .

2 months ago, I wanted to try smoking weed with a "" friend "" to see what effects it had. I was at a point where I tried a lot of thing but failed and was looking for something new , maybe a new perspective to move forward.

He told me that he would never have guessed that I would tell him that but if I wanted he could help me smoke some. So he made all the arrangements and we started to try smoking.

My first experience was peculiar, it felt like I was sinking into the coach and my thoughts, it was not enjoyable for me and it made me quite paranoid to be honest, the second, third and fourth was similar but the paranoia got stronger.

It took me the fifth times for something out of this world to happen, my paranoia went crazy, my thoughts was racing, my head was spinning and my body trembling, my thoughts was spiralling so fast that my consciousness couldn't catch it , so much so that my mind broke and I lost sense of reality for a second. Then I quickly got it back.

After the schock, I felt so vulnerable as if I was naked and anything could have hurt my psyche and made irreversible damage. I was so mentally fragile that I would believe anything that would have reassured me that I wasn't going crazy.

When I came back I was in schock but I knew what happened, I told my friend that I had a psychosis and that I needed to lay down in my bed. It took me some time to come back to my sense and I thought I was going crazy.

I told him what happened and that I thought I was going crazy, he reassured me and told me that it was nothing and that it also happened to him and his friends and then he started to tell me about how he viewed what I went through as the second awakening of my consciousness.

he was psychotic but intelligent and reasonable. He could make sense of anything that we were going through and it reassured me knowing that at least somebody knew what was going on

The more we went down that road the further we strayed from reality and the more we became delusional and I started to see some inconsistencies in his otherwise impeccable logic , so I started to doubt. The more I doubt the more I saw that most of his truths was more personal than anything else. But he was still I would say 80% right most of the time. But the state , we were in was not stable.

I went through different symptoms on my way back going from : racing thoughts, obsessive compulsivedisorder,derealization/d√©personnalisation,high anxiety and lately anhedonia , all in the spam of 2 months.

I managed each one of these symptoms and each time I resolve some others appeared.I learned a lot about mental health and how a lot of people live their life through these differents disorders.

Now I feel like I managed to come back or at least 60% of me, but one thing have now changed. I have become aware of the reality of mental health and the severity of these conditions for others peoples live.

It's something that I can not unsee because I lived it and some are worse than the others . I went through a life shattering event that opened my eyes to one reality of life that I was closing my eyes and there surely are more out there whether it is positive nor negative.

Soon I will come back to my life and started my first year of University and I severed my ties that "" friend "", I think now I need time to process what happened like people that are grieving and soon I will be able to continue my life ."

586,1,Which medications work instantly for someone going through a mental breakdown and being in severe emotional pain? I'm having a crisis and need something to calm me down. Something that would numb the pain would be great.
587,1,"I've been dealing with Depression, Anxiety, OCD, ADHD  and Aspergers for about 15 years-my whole life. Around 2 and a half years ago I started dealing with Depersonalisation and Derealisation and Anhedonia came with it.

I struggle to work, I failed a course, I fail to get into most of my hobbies. I feel like this is all a dream and nothing is real. I get barely any enjoyment out of anything. 

I'm constantly exhausted and never feel like doing anything except sleeping or scrolling in bed. The worst part is I don't feel any connection when I talk to friends or family.

Life feels meaningless and everyday feels like one long chore. I always feel uncomfortable. I've tried lots of different things like exercising more often, eating healthy, meditation and being kind to myself etc.  with barely any success.

I've tried different meds like SSRIs, SNRIs, Tricyclics, Antipsychotics, Beta blockers,  Gabapentinoids, Mirtazapine, Benzos and stimulants etc. The majority of these meds didn't do much to help me.

Benzos work extremely well for my anxiety and motivation and help with DP/DR but I obviously can't take benzos very often. Stimulants like Vyvanse help with nearly everything but I only get about 4 hours of relief each day when I take it. It wears off too fast and when it wears off the Anhedonia is brutal.

This is easily the worst thing I've ever dealt with and I've been thinking about suicide regularly for a while now. Do you have any recommendations or advice? I'm desperate for things to improve. I forgot to mention I'm currently on 100mg of Clomipramine. I'm seeing a Psychologist and a Psychiatrist at the moment "
588,1,"I was just checking Fluoxetine‚Äôs Wikipedia page and found out that it has a Ki value of 14nM for the 5HT1A receptor. Wikipedia doesn‚Äôt state its mode of action but I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs partial 5HT1A agonism just like Vilazodone and therefore, theoretically, it could be labeled as a serotonin modulator rather than a SSRI (especially at 60-80mg) due to its 5HT1A agonism and 5HT2C antagonism. I‚Äôd also assume that‚Äôs why it increases norepinephrine and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex at high doses due to the combined effects of these 2 receptors and not just the 5HT2C as previously thought. Is there any evidence for this mode of action at the 5HT1A receptor? And if so how come it still causes sexual dysfunction like other SSRIs even at high doses where it should cause significant 5HT1A and 5HT2C occupancy?"
589,1,"Has anybody suspected or know if the HPA Axis being dysfunctional or over stimulated constantly, causing high cortisol incessantly has been a major cause of their persistent, treatment resistant depression, fatigue, anhedonia, zombie like state, more awake at certain hours late at night etc, and an inability to get their circadian rhythm back in order - light therapy not working, medications etc? 

I have done a 24hr saliva cortisol test and my cortisol is elevated consistently, even at 11pm at night‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs hard to cut all stress out of my life currently‚Ä¶.

592,1,"Hi guys, in your experience, what has been the best antidepressant for depression caused by grief? I really need some help."
593,1,"I had an appointment to get back on something for anxiety. I was on Lexapro in the past without knowing how SSRI really work. After a couple years, I ran out of refills w/ no doctor so went cold turkey. A few months later I tried Lexapro again when I had a new psychiatrist and it was awful after 6 weeks. I tried Zoloft after, for 6 weeks and added Wellbutrin for another 6, then buspar for 5-6 weeks but if anything, it all made me worse. This is because I felt better off everything, which I did 6+ weeks ago. 

Going into the appointment, I did not want to try another SSRI and SNRI because my main concerns for 6+ months were apathy and anhedonia caused by kratom withdrawal and meds. 

My psychiatrist started the appointment mentioning I should‚Äôve waited longer to see her (I saw her 2 weeks ago and got prescribed guanfacine to try as an alternative).  I don‚Äôt get why she said this because she told me to come back sooner since I said that I wanted to try 6 weeks unmediated. She was also referring to a propranolol script she wrote even tho I‚Äôve been on it for months. (Also mentioned waiting for meds to work several times even though I have).

I think it‚Äôs helped but I still felt like I needed a med. I mentioned that I wanted to try an atypical (she said that‚Äôs for anti psychotics) like mirtzapine (sleep issues too) or a SSRI (works differently tho) trintellix, because they‚Äôre more likely not to cause the symptoms that I‚Äôve gone through hell with for so long. She insisted all meds can cause this and further insisted on Prozac until I mentioned that my parents didn‚Äôt do well on it, then she prescribed me Effexor despite me explaining that the sideffects were too scary for me. Overall she never explained why these meds couldn‚Äôt be prescribed. (I also mentioned nefazodone but briefly) 

She also seemed like she didn‚Äôt care. My last psychiatry I had since march (first one) would explain to me everything and even taken my recommendations or explaining that other alternatives may be better. This one didn‚Äôt even bother. My last one listened, actually cared, and gave good advice. In fact, our plan was to continue avoiding SSRI/SNRI meds. 

I was never demanding, just mentioned that I didn‚Äôt want to try SSRI‚Äôs or SNRI‚Äôs (bad experience + family had bad reactions) and asked about the meds I previously mentioned. 

I left worrying if she thought I was a know it all and distraught that she gave me Effexor despite saying withdrawal and apathy/anhedonia were big concerns. "
594,1,"After trying countless different antidepressants (10+ ssris, snris, atypical antidepressants, antipsychotics, etc), being mistakingly diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and going through multiple round of TMS treatment, for the first time in years, i'm. happy. It started by little things after a few weeks. I felt urges to self harm decrease, i felt a little more energized than i used to be, i didn't feel suicidal all the time. Don't get me wrong, I was still depressed on 15mg and still am, but little things have started becoming easier. 

I upped my dosage to 30mg around about a week or two ago, and i'm not sure if it's because of the dose increase or the remeron slowly kicking in, but suddenly everything set in. I was in the shower today, and realized that i'm actually not sad all the time. I feel in a weird way, happy. A feeling that I haven't felt in years. I want to live. I want to explore things and be productive. I don't want to die anymore, or punish myself, or spiral into self hatred.

Of course, I know that remeron isn't for everyone. Hell, i've tried almost every single antidepressant in the book. From the common ones (Zoloft Lexapro) to the more hardcore ones (Effexor, Prozac) to TRD specific ones (Lithium), to even doing multiple rounds of TMS treatment, and many more, none of them really did much. Overall, I've been depressed for years, i've been very actively suicidal, and i was even 5150ed a few months ago. I know that i'm extremely lucky to have found a medication that seems to be working. Sure, some days i still feel really tired, and my appetite has increased drastically. But, I'll take any side effects for the place that I'm in right now. Besides, I was struggling a lot with insomnia right before starting this medication, so I'm happy at the place that it's at now.

All this being said, I'm actually going down to 15mg starting tonight, so i'll keep this updated. I was experiencing lightheadedness on the higher dosage, and was told that it could possibly be a side effect of remeron. I also feel like my anxiety has slightly increased, so my psychiatrist and I thought we could try experimenting with the dosages to see what worked.

Let this be a little success story, a little win :,) Always remember that everyone has different experiences with different medications, and some meds work for some people, but don't for others. And don't be afraid to give new meds a try. I was pretty put off by remeron at first, since I've tried so many meds in the past, and all of them have ended in disappointment. This just happened to actually work and provide relief in many of my symptoms I was experiencing prior.

You never know if a new medication or treatment plan can change your life.

Also a side note: I'm diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (treatment resistant), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and (C)PTSD! Remeron was mainly prescribed as an attempt to tackle MDD since I need to wait 6 months to try TMS treatment again :,)"
595,1,I've been taking 1mg for 10 days and I'm sleeping 12 hours a day. What's going on?
596,1,"Ps. For augmentation, not argumentation. I dont know how to change post title

My new doctor prescribed thyroxine to me first by asking what my TSH readings were. I had 3.9, he said that then we will start. But I didn't notice that these were my tests from a year ago. And 2 years ago, the indicator was 2.0. 
Please tell me, I don't want to bother the doctor again, tomorrow I will take tests, find out the current tsh level. At what levels can 50 mcg of thyroxine be taken?"
597,1,"I have always wondered if antidepressants can cause violent behavior? The reason i'm asking this is because I have been taking Prozac for approximately two years and Wellbutrin for one and a half years now and ever since I started taking them I have noticed that sometimes I can get very irritable and lash out to people for no reason. 

Well I did something very stupid a few months ago. I was at the bus and a ticket inspector came to me and asked me to show my bus ticket. I didn't want to show her my bus ticket because I had bought the wrong one, It was a mistake that I had bought the wrong ticket. But I knew I had to show her so I did it and I thought she wouldn't notice anything. Unfortunately she did notice and started asking me for my id card to show my real age but I told her I didn't have one and then she started asking me for my personal identity number. I didn't want to tell her my personal identity number because she have actually no right to do that. Well she kept bugging me and I got very irritable because she wouldn't stop bothering me so I got very angry and lashed out at her. The next thing that happened was that I attacked her. 

I know it was very stupid and unneccesary to do that but I was so angry and I couldn't control it. So now I have to take the consequenses because of my stupid behavior and i'm going to get interrogated for this. 

This is not the first time something like this happens. A few years ago I took Luvox and for some reason that med made me shoplift all the time. I couldn't stop stealing things from the stores because I had this urge all the time to do it. It was very hard to control it and I didn't think about the consequenses about what could happen If someone noticed that I was shoplifting. Well they caught me stealing things and some security guards came over to me and started grabbing me and put handcuffs on me. I remember that I attacked those security guards too and that I started lashing out at them.

 Almost the same scenario happened a few years ago but with Luvox. Now it's like it repeated itself again but with Prozac and Wellbutrin. So this goes back to my question and i'm wondering if these meds can cause violent thoughts and actions? Can these meds be the reason i'm different today then what I was before I started taking them in the first place? I do have autism actually so I think it also has something to do with it? "

606,1,"I am currently unemployed after a layoff in June of this year. I am lucky to have family I can stay with in this time while I seek other work, but I feel my condition has hit its deepest point in my life and treatment is nearly non-effective at treating several symptoms I have. Currently I have complete anhedonia. I am diagnosed with TRD/MDD, GAD and ADHD Inattentive type (prior I was also diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, but this has since been rescinded). They are all very comorbid. My ADHD kicks me into hyperfocus phases that make me neglect other areas of my life and cause many issues, while my depression recognizes the amount of things I fall behind on due to my ADHD, which worsens my mood, repeat ad nauseum infinitely. Every time I dip, I dip lower because of how much each condition ruins my ability to do anything.

I have no hyperfocus phase to even preoccupy myself with at this time, so most of the day I float around doing nothing but existing and checking job listings, which all sound so exhausting and draining that I can't figure out how to get back into the workforce. I'm actually worried at this point that I've forgotten how to function as a human being in most areas, because I've spent so much time cocooned up in my room doing literally nothing these past several months. All of my friends have been moving to better jobs, getting married, moving to new houses, and I'm here slowly rotting from the inside out. I feel like my brain is literally being turned into a hole-filled sponge day to day because of how much cognitive decline I'm experiencing due to not doing anything at all. Basically brain atrophy.

I live a very simple but depressing existence at this point. I have my dog and live with my mom who also suffers from some of my same conditions, so I try to keep a happy demeanor around her to not bring her down too much, but once I am alone I completely collapse. I can't cry, I'm just sitting there, breathing and existing. No point, no drive, no motivation, no joy, no anger, no wonder, just being.

Below is a list of all of the treatments I've sought over the years to manage my condition. I've had phases that worked wonders, and others that had me looking down the barrel of a gun. But at this point, I'm tired and I've fought as much as I can, and nothing seems to be working. No medication even has the weird little side effects you normally get when starting something new. I'm just taking pills that go through my system nearly unnoticed. It is taking so much of my time and effort to manage my condition, that I can't progress anywhere in life outside of this damn sickness. I can't even do laundry or plan things out most days now, because I'm just so non-functional. Some days I will get out of bed 1-2 times to use the restroom or get something to eat, but that's it.

I am currently 28, but have been formally diagnosed with depressive disorder since I was 9 years old. My parents divorced around when I was 6 and I'm sure that did some damage, but a lot of my conditions run blood deep in my family line. I'm just the unlucky roll of the dice with pretty much all of the bad genes. 20/100 vision in both eyes with major astigmatism, arrhythmia, showing signs currently of arthritis, and all of the other bullshit I have to deal with.

This isn't a sympathy seeking attempt though, don't get me wrong. I am approaching this as clinically as I can, because I have no other way to really look into it anymore. If any of you know someone in a similar situation, and they found something that worked, I am happy to hear your input. At this time, I'll try anything to work through this. I just want to feel normal again, in any way shape or form.

I also lost 80 lbs in 2018/2019 and was doing great in terms of my lifestyle, but my condition came back and hit twice as hard which drove me into a breakdown that cleared my progress and set me back, driving me deeper.



Here is my history:



Depression:

Zoloft (Sertraline) - Apathy, no regard for safety or care for anything. 1 month of medication

Effexor XR (Venlafaxine) - Brain zaps, nausea when yawning, no noted improvements on mood or symptoms. 1 month of medication

Celexa (Citalopram) - Remission for 1 1/2-2 yrs 2019-2021, suddenly stopped working mid-2021, doubled dosage worsened depression symptoms after trial. 2 years of medication 2019-2021, 6 months in 2023 (no noted changes to mood)

Wellbutrin (Bupropion) - Noted lack of improvements of energy or mood, possible irritability increase, anger/low mood (more likely due to noticing no change on medication), 2 months of medication

Abilify (Aripiprazole) - Complete dissociation, time continuity unrecognizable, fatigue and fugue state after sleeping. 2 months of medication

Trintellix (Vortioxetine) - No noted improvements in any capacity to mood or energy. 3 months of medication

TMS Therapy - 5 weeks of continuous daily treatment on weekdays. Some healthy lifestyle choices learned, slight improvement to mood and outlook for 1-2 months, followed by sharp decline in symptoms.

Ketamine - 6 treatments during duration of TMS therapy. See notes above for effects. Dizziness and nausea day of treatment, but slight boost in mood 2-3 days after treatment concluded.

GeneSight test performed, only medication in the Red category was Paxil. All others yellow or green.

Prozac (Fluoxetine) - 1 month of 20mg, 1 month of 40mg. No noted improvements to mood or energy. No side effects experienced as well.



Anxiety:

Hydroxyzine - Increased heart rate, sweating and feelings of medical anxiety. 3 doses taken.

Trazodone - Successful remission in most anxiety symptoms. Taking since 2019.



Bipolar Disorder:

Lamictal (Lamotrigine) - Dizziness and drowsiness, no noted increase to mood or mood swings. Bipolar diagnosis later rescinded, as mood swings slowed as I aged.



ADHD:

Adderall - 10mg dose led to noted increase in crying spells (sometimes at no indicated trigger). 20mg dosage increase led to noted improvement in mood and concentration for 2-3 hours after ingestion. Sharp decline in depressive mood after ""crashes"" occurred (medications effects wearing off).

Vyvanse - 30mg noted improvement to mood and concentration for around 1 hour after ingestion, followed by sharp decline in depressive mood. 60mg current dosage, noted improvement in mood and concentration for 2-3 hours after ingestion, followed by sharp decline after ""crash"" occurs. At this point, I am mostly chasing the high from this medication because it's the only time of day I feel really any push or motivation at all to do anything, and even that's short lived. Concentration is not nearly strong enough to do anything of value or productive, as I am still being pulled to many directions by my brain. However, some activities I do can bring joy for a short time during this period, which is why I still take this medication.



Other medications:

Pantoprazole - Acid reducer medication for GERD/acid reflux.



Therapy:

CBT - Worked with a therapist for 2-3 months on behavioral exercises that didn't help a lot of my symptoms, but did reveal some helpful breathing exercises for my anxiety when I didn't have a medication that worked.

Generalized Therapy - 4 different practitioners, all of whom were seen at different periods of my life. It helped to have someone to talk to, but my condition seems to chew quite deeper than having conversations and verbally working through problems could solve.



Currently, I am going to be calling a therapists office on Monday to get into an appointment at a center that accepts Medicaid. Not sure how much this will help, but I am trying to be optimistic if possible."
607,1,"So I'm not 100% sure I have depression or just am very unmotivated, but I thought this subreddit would be the best place to ask this question. 

How do all maintain a clean room throughout your depression?

I have summer depression, I know that, but once school starts again I continue to stay in my habit of my depression room. I've tried to do lists, big and small, timers, music, reward systems, smalls tasks, etc.

So any tips to first clean it and keep it clean?
Any methods are welcome."
608,1,"*Disclaimer: talk to your doctor before any exercise/diet change.*

Hi Reddit - I wanted to share with you my depression protocol. I think of it as manufacturing my own antidepressants at home. It's short (15 minutes) and is relatively low effort (only really have to do \~2 minutes of effort).¬†

This might seem simple, but there is a lot of scientific backing to this and a lot of personal experimentation to come up with this exact protocol. The goal is to:

1. Immediate release of neurotransmitters (dopamine, seretonin, endocannabinoids, BNDF, GABA) for acute depression relief
2. Increase baseline long after the exercise

**Requirements**

* Enough energy to do some (\~15 minutes) of exercise. Only about 2 minutes is intense though in total
* Around 15 minutes
* Heart rate monitor (I recommend a chest strap one like the Polar H10 over a wristband because they update faster and are more accurate)
* Exercise machine: I prefer an indoor bike, but a treadmill, elliptical, or rower could work
* Determine your ""Max Heart Rate"" using the simple formula: 220 - age. For example, if you're 30, you're Max HR is 190. Calculate your 75% and 90% of your heart rate. For example, if you're 30, it would be 142 and 171.

**Optional**

* Eat high protein. Many amino acids in protein are precursors to neurotransmitters - eg tryptophan for serotonin and tyrosine for dopamine. Recommend 100g or 70% of your body weight in lbs
* Have some good pump-up songs you can do for an all-out exertion

**Workout**¬†

1. Warm up for \~1 to 2 minutes by going slow. Your HR should be low, well under 75%. You're just trying to get your body used to movement so you don't injure yourself.
2. Repeat 4x: Go all out until you hit 90% of your Max HR (takes me \~30 seconds). Then go low-intensity until you hit 75% of your Max HR (takes me \~2 minutes). To go all out, I increase the resistance on my bike and go all out. When I'm ramping down, I bring the resistance way down. Be safe when you're going all-out. You can do a slow ramp-up if needed, but you really just want to get your HR to 90% as soon as possible.

**Key points**

* I generally find that by the 3rd cycle I feel pretty elated. You might want to keep going after the 4th cycle. I highly recommend stopping at 4 for the following reasons:
   * You want this tool to available to you even when you don't have much time or energy. If you lengthen your workouts, you subconsciously tell yourself you need more time and energy than you really do for the benefit
   * There is a short half life for the immediate release of the neurotransmitters. If you workout too hard, you'll get a very high peak and feel a bigger crash in a few hours. It's wiser to do this protocol 2x a day rather than 8 cycles at once.
   * Prolonged exercise could lead you to feel exhausted during the rest of your day. Extremely prolonged exercise could elevate cortisol, which could cause issues with anxiety
* Why does it work? Even though you're really only going all out for \~2 minutes, spaced out, you fool your body into thinking you're working a lot harder than you actually are. Your avg. HR ends up being high, even though the amount of effort isn't that high. The repeat intervals further make your body believe it's under stress for longer and release neurotransmitters to cope:
   * **Dopamine**: during intense exercise, the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) is activated and demands more adrenaline and noradrenaline, which it creates from dopamine. This upregulates dopamine pathways, to create more dopamine to fuel the need for adrenaline and noradrenaline. This effect persists well after the exercise.
   * **Serotonin**: intense exercise increases the availability of tryptophan (a precursor to serotonin) in the brain. I feel an increased desire for sociability afterwards.
   * **BDNF**: HIIT significantly elevates BDNF, highly involved in the hippocampus , specifically for mood regulation
   * **GABA**: HIIT increases GABA levels, promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety
   * **endocannabinoids**: each interval triggers release of endocannabinoids (responsible for the ""runner's high""). Helps reduce stress and improve overall mood \[3\]
* The more frequently you do this (eg. daily), the better because it helps you increase your baseline
* What about low intensity exercise? Or going for a walk for an hour? Do it if you enjoy it, but they won't give you the scientifically-backed chemical release as the HIIT protocol above
* It's wise to cut-down on dopamine depleting activities (doom scrolling, porn, sugar, etc), but when you don't, this protocol can help temporarily create more chemicals

609,1,"On another thread I made a list of options for treatment resistant depression, are there other options?

* Deep brain stimulation
* Electroconvulsive therapy
* psilocybin¬†
* Transcranial magnetic stimulation
* Ketamine therapy
* Vagus nerve stimulation

I know some antipsychotics are used for TRD (treatment resistant depression) in combination with serotonin medications, but I don't know how effective they are.

What about combination therapy? Like combining an SSRI with an amphetamine or modafinil for example? Is that effective for TRD

Opioids may be helpful for TRD, but good luck getting them.

FWIW, the opioid tramadol is great for depression. But its an opioid and schedule IV, so its hard to get.

Are there other options?"
610,1,"Hi everyone, so I  had two craniotomies about four years ago to remove a 2 cm cavernoma (a vascular malformation, likely congenital) after a major bleeding episode. The lesion was located in my left temporal lobe, near the occipital lobe. Before this major hemorrhage, I experienced I think a few minor bleeding episodes prior to this and during that time (span of 1.5 years) I was having anxiety symptoms, including increasing panic attacks especially upon waking up and it kept getting worse and worse and later I was having these disorientation and confusion fits which would sometimes last for 10 minutes.

So fast-forward four years post-surgery enduring so much! I‚Äôve made significant progress but continue to struggle with two major issues:

1. **Severe Neuro Fatigue**: My brain's ""battery"" drains quickly, requiring frequent breaks, and naps are the most effective remedy. I get these hypnic jerks along where you feel like you fall asleep.

2. **Anhedonia**: Self explanatory, near-total lack of pleasure, even alcohol doesn't do anything only makes me dizzy and sleepy.

I've found some short-term relief with Ritalin, but I‚Äôm cautious about building tolerance. I also take Piracetam, which helps a bit with speech issues caused by the surgery, the cavernoma was in my speech center, left temporal lobe (I stutter alot and have difficulty with word formation), and plan to reintroduce Aniracetam, which was previously helpful.

My psychiatrist prescribed first Sertraline and then Escitalopram after the surgeries, they helped somewhat with anxiety but these only numbed me further. I believe my anhedonia might be more related to dopamine dysfunction.

I‚Äôm exploring possible treatments for anhedonia post-brain surgery, and I‚Äôm considering the following options:
- Ketamine nasal spray
- Microdosing psilocybin or LSD
- Pramipexol 

Given my history, what do you think would be the most effective nootropic or treatment stack to address anhedonia and neuro fatigue specifically related to brain surgeries and hemorrhages?

I also take supplements like creatine, NAC, magnesium, D3/K2, Pycnogenol, B-Complex and fish oil. I tried for a short while Mr Happy stack and that actually did helped somewhat.

Thanks"
611,1,"I have pretty severe treatment-resistant depression. I've tried a lot of drugs. My current psychiatric meds are:

TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy), Abilify 10mg, Auvelity, Adderall, VNS Therapy (Vagus Nerve Stimulation implant). 

So far I've tried:

Spravato (6 months), Pristiq, Trintellix, Lexapro, Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor, Buspar, Fetzima, Viibryd, Cymbalta, Trazadone, Remeron, Elavil, and Depakote. 

There's probably more but I forget. Been trialing meds for years. I have bipolar depression, ADHD, and generalized anxiety. I can't do MAOI's because of the interaction with stimulants. 

Anyone have any ideas where to go from here? It is impossible to find a TMS center that's covered by my insurance where I live (Philadelphia) and it costs over ~$8000 out of pocket. I also looked into brain surgery (anterior cingulotomy, anterior capsulotomy) but unsure how I could get that done."
612,1,"A new 2024 study examined the short- and long-term effectiveness of pramipexole (up to 2.1 mg) compared to aripiprazole in treating treatment-resistant depression. The results showed that pramipexole was significantly more effective:

Pramipexole: After 12 weeks, 64.1% of patients responded, rising to 76.2% after 24 weeks. Remission was achieved by 49.7% at 12 weeks and 72.7% at 24 weeks.

Aripiprazole: Only 32.2% of patients responded by 12 weeks, and this increased to 38.0% at 24 weeks. Remission rates were lower at 18.9% and 28.1% respectively.


Pramipexole also improved psychosocial functioning faster and proved more effective for long-term maintenance over 12 months.

613,1,"For the past year, my desire to want to socialise has got considerably worse. I used to look forward to hanging out with people, but since my depression got worse, it's the last thing I want to do, even though intuitively I know I need to do it.

I have good social skills, it's just that I've no desire to want to spend time with people.

For those like me who were so averse to socialising, were you able to reverse it? What did it look like for you? "
614,1,"I f20 was on Clomipramine 25mgs for around 8-10 days. Unfortunately, that was enough time to make me feel completely numb, it has never been worse with any other medication the way it was on Clomipramine, not even the SSRI zombie feeling was as bad as it. It's also the only anti-depressant that has gave me sexual dysfunction as a side effect. It might be my OCD or paranoia but I'm terrified this will last forever if it's been three days and I still feel anhedonic. It might just be how my depression appears now instead of constant sadness, I'm now more annoyed when I do feel emotions, just nothing positive. If you've experienced something similar on a short time on clomipramine, did it go away? "
615,1,"I‚Äôm feeling myself in between cycles of depression and anxiety, with depression more strongly creeping now. 

I‚Äôve started to feel myself slipping back into depression. It‚Äôs so frustrating to have my mental health yo yo outside of my control. 

I‚Äôve been sleeping an obscene amount during the day, have trouble sleeping at night (nightmares), and have lost a lot of physical sensations (ie love for dance, hunger).

How do I at least stop the exhaustion to be able to do the bare minimum - functioning at work without falling asleep at work?

I finally got a job after months of searching. The job is a mess - my boss is a repeat felon (her last biz ended because she was caught committing almost $400k in fraud and she has about 12 felonies and 24 misdemeanors), her son is a repeat violent felon (who comes into office), and overall she‚Äôs a habitual liar, unpleasant to work with, and I‚Äôm fairly certain she‚Äôs still committing fraud/forgery. 

Every interaction I have with my family stresses me out, even unintentionally. I grew up in a cult and every convo (I rarely engage - it‚Äôs them messaging me) is about them damning me to hell."
616,1,"So when i take stimulants like Concerta or Vyvance i feel great.
I can be depress in bed and take vyvance and 1/2 hour after i'm ready for the day, good mood, social and productive and not even feeling depress.
Only thing, tolerance devellop really rapidly and after 1 month i was on the highest dose with not much benefits.
So stimulant create a spike in dopamine and i'm looking at pramipexole, a dopaminergic agent and the stats for treatment resistant depression are very good.
So i'm wondering if i could have a good chance of responding to Pramipexole because of the good results stimulants gives me?"
617,1,"I know it‚Äôs a very common combination and safe. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm asking.

Did anyone else find that stimulants work better in their own than when paired with antidepressants? I‚Äôm trying to determine if it‚Äôs my imagine but I swear my adderall and Vyvanse don‚Äôt work nearly as well paired with any SSRI/SNRIs. Even Wellbutrin seems to dull it. Is this a real thing or my imagination?"

619,1,"Hi there,

i suffer from debilitating (social) anxiety and have tried dozens of medication and psychotherapie with no real success. However I noticed that Gabapentin or Pregabalin gives me a good amount of relief from anxiety. I wonder if anyone has taken them long-term without losing effectiveness?"
620,1,"hello everybody; i f20 have been struggling with a horrible mental health episode the past 6 months, and everything just taking a turn for the worse with every coming day. i started off with severe anxiety out of nowhere in may of this year, i was in a stressful situation where i had to move out of my safe space with my partner and whilst living with my partner the past year and a half prior to that my mental illness had gone fully in remission except for the occasional intrusive thought. though, it‚Äôs come back full force since then. the anxiety then has switched to depression and rumination / ocd. i feel little to no joy at all in life, and feel frustrated and angry at every aspect of my life. i feel like ive lost all purpose in the world. i immediately went to a psychiatrist and started therapy upon feeling this again. i was started on wellbutrin and stopped after 3 weeks since even at a low dose it had me wired and made my intrusive thoughts run laps 24/7. We switched to prozac and it made me feel like a zombie and I switched providers after trying it for 5-6 weeks. We tried Pristiq with my new provider and that only made me even more depressed, crying all day and grieving. My relationship has only gotten worse while this has all happened cause I miss living with my partner so much and I hate my situation, which I know I can‚Äôt fix through medication but I can‚Äôt do anything about my situation and it‚Äôs making my depression worse.

After pristiq we tried Vilazodone, which actually wasn‚Äôt horrible but it made me feel numb, like nothing, and made me disassociate / derealization pretty hard it was uncomfortable. Now we‚Äôre onto clomipramine which was our last resort for the rumination and anxiety, which it has helped the smallest bit but my depression is so bad. I feel so awful, no joy or happiness no matter what I do or just blunted. nothing is satisfying anymore, not even video games. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I feel like I‚Äôve hit a complete wall. 

I suggested to my doctor possibly going back to Wellbutrin alongside something for anxiety like staying on the clomipramine with it or adding Buspar to it, or a mood stabilizer because when I‚Äôm not on medication I‚Äôm up and down. I know this is apart of the journey to finding what works and getting my situation handled but it‚Äôs been 6 months of this mess alongside therapy I‚Äôm making little to no progress. I feel so mentally exhausted I just want to be okay and happy again. Did anyone go through this many medications before finding something that worked? And how did it affect relationships with people? I feel so disconnected from others and I‚Äôm pushing everyone away, I feel so bitter and upset that this is happening to me. Every medication I try I feel hopeful that I‚Äôve possibly found something that‚Äôll help but then weeks later bam, nothing. 

How do I power through this? Some positivity please I need it "
621,1,"I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depression 10 years back .I tried  escitalopram ,duloxtine ,paroxetine ,venlafaxime ,sertraline ,flivoxaminr ,fluoxetime( gave me hypomania symptoms thought it worked for my depression but no ), clomipramine and recently doxepine ( on fourth day my depression was ok remission but no I had hypomnia symtoms ).currently taking nothing just sodium valporaate and I feel it's better than antidepressants.do u guys think I could be bipolar .I still have depression tho .how to fix this depression without being hypomania "
622,1,"Does it helps just as mood stabilizer for depresion or also for anxiety

What is its mechanism of action"
623,1,"Ketamine is well known as a treatment for depression, however the anti-nausea drug scopolamine also works for depression for the same reason. Like ketamine, it increases BDNF (Brain derived neurotrophic factor) levels in the brain and causes downstream effects that treat depression.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8338784/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8338784/)

>The rapidly acting antidepressants ketamine and scopolamine exert behavioral effects that can last several days to weeks in some patients. The molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of these antidepressant effects are unknown. Here, we show that methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) phosphorylation at Ser421 (pMeCP2) is essential for the sustained, but not the rapid, antidepressant effects of ketamine and scopolamine in mice. Our results reveal that pMeCP2 is downstream of BDNF, a critical factor in ketamine and scopolamine antidepressant action. In addition, we show that pMeCP2 is required for the long-term regulation of synaptic strength following ketamine or scopolamine administration. These results demonstrate that pMeCP2 and associated synaptic plasticity are essential determinants of sustained antidepressant effects.

>Major depressive disorder is one of the most severe mental disorders. It strongly impairs daily functioning, and, in extreme cases, it can lead to suicide. Although different treatment options are available for patients with depression, there is an ongoing search for novel therapeutic agents, such as scopolamine (also known as hyoscine), that would offer higher efficacy, a more rapid onset of action, and a more favorable safety profile. The aim of our study was to review the current clinical evidence regarding the use of scopolamine, a promising therapeutic option in the treatment of depression. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases up to 5 June 2023. We included randomized placebo-controlled or head-to-head clinical trials that compared the clinical efficacy and safety of scopolamine in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Two reviewers independently conducted the search and study selection and rated the risk of bias for each study. Four randomized controlled trials were identified in the systematic review. The included studies investigated the use of scopolamine administered as an oral, intramuscular, or intravenous drug, alone or in combination with other antidepressants. The results indicated that scopolamine exerts antidepressant effects of varying intensity. We show that not all studies confirmed a statistically and clinically significant reduction of depressive symptoms vs. placebo. A broader perspective on scopolamine use in antidepressant treatment should be confirmed in subsequent large randomized controlled trials assessing both effectiveness and safety. Therefore, studies directly comparing the effectiveness of scopolamine depending on the route of administration are required.

Scopolamine has several advantages over ketamine

* Its not a scheduled narcotic
* It can be taken orally or transdermally (instead of as an IV like ketamine)
* It is cheap
* It doesn't have the hallucinogenic effects of ketamine
* You can do it at home
* Doctors would probably be more willing to prescribe it

has anyone looked into scopolamine as an alternative for ketamine for rapid treatment of depression?"
624,1,"I just need to get this out of my mind.
Yes, I have tried looking for a second opinion. 
Yes, I am still confused. 

I started off with a depression diagnosis from an online psychiatrist and he prescribed me Mirtazapine. Still, he recommended me to go in-person. So I did, and the other psychiatrist continued Mirt, adjusting the dosage. But when I mentioned the probability of ADHD, she brushed it off, saying it should have started from childhood. That time I had not tried to recall anything yet, so I just accepted the diagnosis. 

Later on I realized that as a child I was not even trying to be tidy, I misplaced things, but I performed well at school, so I really am not sure if anything started back then. I had rolandic epilepsy when I was 9, and completed treatment when I was 11. Don't know if it matters.

I tried many things including going to a psychologist, who thought I might have ADHD but after making me do a qEEG test she scraped the idea completely because I do not have the ""typical ADHD brain scan"". I also did another screening by doing a TOVA test, but I didn't make enough commission error and zero omission BUT my response time was awful, so I got -8 score. Based on that the psychiatrist that assessed me told me I have anxiety problems. 

So I went back to my original psychiatrist and diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder (F41.2). BUT she also prescribed me Methylphenidate for my focus problems. While my mood improves, my forgetfulness and distractibility do not go away. I went to yet another psychiatrist a few weeks later. I told him I needed a second opinion and I have problems focusing. He didn't even try to convince me, he just showed a list of symptoms and asked, ""Do you answer mostly yes?"" and I was like ""yeah..?"" He told me I might have ADHD! But he told me to work on my depression and anxiety first. 

I went back to my original psychiatrist a few days after that encounter, and the first thing she asked was ""Did your focus improve after taking methylphenidate?"" I answered yes. She was like ""you do have the inclination to ADHD!"" But it confused me even further, since she did not change my diagnosis.

Should I just wait for things to work out? Am I crazy looking for second opinions?"
625,1,Maybe after this shock 100 mg will start work or should decrease to 75 mg on which I had first good days? Total:¬†11 weeks on zoloft (50 mg first month)

I don‚Äôt want disassociation to get worse, or have emotional blunting which would make anhedonia terrible. Been off meds for about a month. Decided to take a 150sr yesterday (old script) and felt better but had chest pain (hard heart beats and maybe anxiety?). My doc said all tests look good, waiting to see cardiologist. Any advice? "
627,1,Titrated up to 200mg. Itching didn‚Äôt start until 200 (went in increments of 25mg). It is helping tremendously with depression but does anyone know when the itching subsides?
628,1,"Titrated off Effexor 7 months ago. (Not experiencing any worsened depression or anxiety). 

Constant chest pressure, tightness & difficulty breathing. Like chest is being squeezed, a suffocating feeling that slow deep breathing does not resolve. 

Somatic symptoms (like dysregulated stress response). Fatigue mainly. Hypoarousal, then Hyperarousal. No heart palps or racing thoughts either.

Note: Cardio scans & breathing tests do NOT indicate anything abnormal (no asthma, heart issue). They gave me a steroid inhaler anyway :-(

Would reinstating a low-dose antidepressant (SSRI or SNRI) *maybe* alleviate this?? 

I don‚Äôt want to reinstate antidepressant,  but the chest symptoms only started 3 months ago.. and steroids are not a healthy solution (causes more fatigue/depression). maybe related?"
629,1,"I am just curious how a low carb diet affects other people.  
I have tried it multiple times, and personally, for me, it was always a negative experience. Actually, I found that high-carb starchy foods help my mood and anxiety. I am not talking even about the keto diet, but just about low carb. I don't mean processed high-carb foods, but complex carbs such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, and plantains. I love plantains!

I've read some evidence that a lot of doctors actually don't recommend low-carb diets. They say that complex carbs are important for gut health. Also, complex carbs lead to more tryptophan circulating in the bloodstream, and that in turn leads to more serotonin in the brain. Personally, I do find foods such as plantain pancakes or baked potatoes very calming. A low-carb diet could also lead to more cortisol and therefore increase depression and anxiety.

I find that high glycemic and processed carbs definitely don't help my mood, so a pop drink would not be beneficial, but oatmeal in the morning helps.

Recently I made some sourdough pancakes with oat and brown rice flour and milk, and they made me feel pretty calm and good. I do feel better during the day if in the morning I eat such whole grain pancakes or oatmeal instead of just low-carb eggs with spinach and tomatoes (even though a lot of sources recommend the second option to be a healthier breakfast)."

631,1,I have been on Wellbutrin for over four years right now and i'm currently on 300 mg. I'm wondering if there are any other antidepressants similar to Wellbutrin? The reason i'm asking this is because Wellbutrin has stopped working for me. It doesn't do anything for my fatigue and lack of motivation anymore. I probably have developed tolerance to it maybe that's why it stopped working. That's why i'm asking if there any antidepressant that works for fatigue and lack of motivation like Wellbutrin?

636,1,Hi everyone firstly thanks for commenting on my last post. Has any of you used microdoses of buprenorphine for depression? What was your experience and dosage and is it safe?
637,1,"My doctor refuses to prescribe me more than 1mg for multiple reasons. I'm not entirely sure if 1mg is enough for anhedonia considering the fact that it preferentially activates the pre-synaptic D2 and D3 autoreceptors which are **inhibitory**, so a lot of people report sedation and worse mood on lower doses that goes away with higher doses. I have only seen anecdotes of pramipexole working for anhedonia above 2mg. I would like to see positive reports for sub 2mg doses please if anyone has a good experience with it. I'm not entirely sure if the presynaptic receptors are bound to desensitise eventually over time even on a low dose, or if a high dose is necessary for that to happen. "
638,1,"Hi guys what do you suggest to mix with abilify especially between clomipramine, lamotrigine and escitalopram. For depression and ocd."
639,1,"For 1 year I was on 10mg escitalopram. It worked great, so great that I forgot to take care of myself and burnt out. 

Started getting panic attacks, massive anxiety, barely could eat and sleep. 

First, my psych upped escitalopram to 15mg. I waited for 5 weeks, but situation got worse and I was put in hospital. 

Here dr. lowered escitalopram to 10mg and added agomelatine. First days were great, I thought I was getting better. But two weeks in I started to get very intensive suicidal thoughts. They didn‚Äôt disappeared, so dr stopped agomelatine and added mirtazapine. 

So now I‚Äôm taking 10mg of escitalopram and 1/4 of 15mg mirtazapine. Planning to slowly up mirtazapine to 15mg. 

Maybe someone tried this med combo? Or similar? How fast should it work? I‚Äôm feeling so tired and discouraged. 

Just want to get better and get back to my normal life. 

P.S. I‚Äôm doing CBT, talking with therapists, painting, doing meditation, eating healthy and staying active. "
640,1,"Hello Everybody!

I've gone through so many meds for depression, anxiety, OCD, ADHD. I've tried Lexapro first (went up to 20) and it was absolutely horrible. I felt like it dialed my ADHD symptoms to 100. After adding Wellbutrin and not seeing much change with that combo, I replaced the Lexapro with prozac (beginning of July). I also started taking Adderall end of July.

I'm currently on 40mg of Prozac, 300mg of Wellbutrin XL, and 30mg of Adderall.

Some days I feel like I'm \*slightly\* better than I was before and others feel like absolute hell. I still have social anxiety, brain fog (really bad- had it for years but got worse after starting lexapro I think), anhedonia, and many other symptoms.

I've got a psych appointment tomorrow, and I'd highly appreciate some ideas on what I should ask her. My psych will be switching me from adderall to vyvanse as it barely works for me, and we will also be discussing the possibility of changing up my other meds.

I've heard that guanfacine is good for the anxiety symptoms caused by stimulants and for tics (that I think were caused or worsened by Wellbutrin). Should I ask her about it? Any other med recommendations? I go to a really stressful school and the thought of having to go through that while going through withdrawals or side effects from new medications sounds horrible.

Thanks! "
644,1,"Definitely new to taking this (150 mg XL for depression, in second week). I noticed today that my emotions seem to have disappeared. I just feel kinda‚Ä¶ empty. 

Is that expected when first starting out? Does it get better? When?"
645,1,"This should not be considered Medical Advice. This is a personal experience that I hope people can glean from and talk to their own physicians about.

For over 10 years, I‚Äôve struggled with a complex set of symptoms that have significantly impacted my daily life. Chronic brain fog, emotional numbness, and slowed cognition became constants, making it difficult to feel joy (or any other emotion), focus, communicate, and connect with others. The root cause was elusive, and during this time I cycled through SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, benzodiazepines and ADHD meds‚Äînone providing long-term relief. I faced intense anxiety AND a dull persistent anxiety that would calcify into ""neural roadblocks"" that would throttle my cognitive dexterity: word retrieval, memory, and creativity.

My brain fog followed a peculiar pattern for a long time: it would lift, though not entirely, 16 hours after waking. This reliable rhythm led me to believe that my particular disorder was biological, not psychological. I also noticed the nights that I had vivid dreams (which were very very few and far between) I would have a higher chance of feeling functional and myself the next day. This led me down an exhaustive journey of self-evaluation and medication trials but each medication hit a dead end. All symptoms persisted.

I eventually discovered the critical role of the¬† 5-HT1A receptor (regulating mood, anxiety, memory, and most importantly in my case:¬†**REM sleep.**

Buspirone, a¬†5-HT1A partial agonist, taken before bed, has significantly improved my ability to stage into¬†REM sleep. The change was profound: my brain fog lifted entirely, my mood became stable, my mind felt clear and navigable. I began to experience emotions again: joy, curiosity, wonder, beautiful sadness... Even with just¬†5-6 hours of sleep, I feel rested. (Everyone's different). Worth noting that I did not experience these effects if I took Busiprone too early.

This was a breakthrough for me and it pointed to¬†REM sleep dysregulation¬†and the vital and often unheeded role of¬†circadian rhythms¬†in mental health.

Medications affecting¬†GABA¬†pathways, such as¬†Gabapentin and Nardil had previously offered temporary relief, suggesting my condition might involve¬†GABAergic dysfunction but also likely rooted in sleep regulation issues and neurotransmitter dysfunction.

Current Pharmaceutical Regimen: Wellbutrin 300mg XL in the Morning, and Busiprone 30-45mg before bed.

Like the disclaimer reads: This is not medical advice. Other people may and likely will react differently to these meds and this combination of meds but I wanted to submit this in the hope this helps others recognize the importance of¬†sleep quality, especially¬†REM sleep, and helps them find relief if their experience with depression and anxiety has been anything as debilitating as mine."

647,1,"Does anyone known any doctors, or if there is a list of doctors who will prescribe and KNOW how to prescribe pramipexole for depression. 

I've been on every class of depression medication with no success. My doctor prescribed me pramipexole about a week ago at .123 3x/Day which I tolerate and he refuses to increase the dose, instead putting me on serequel as well which antagonize dopamine receptors (all off them). I'm not taking it. 

I'm looking for a Dr. Who knows what they hell they are doing when it comes to prescribing and treating with pramipexole. This is one of the last drugs I've yet to try and because of the characteristics of my depression I believe it could help. 

Any advice or a poit in the right direction would be great thanks!

648,1,"I love the smell of coffee and its bitter taste but each time I realize that it seems to be destabilizing for me.

I am on lamotrigine, which is a mood stabilizer, and it seems to help me. I am not bipolar, my diagnosis is depression and OCD.

I haven't had coffee for some time, but recently I had a baby. I start to go for walks with a stroller and in order to have a goal for the walks, I started walking to Starbucks or Tim Hortons, so I started having coffee daily.
At first it actually made me feel better - I started to get excited about my mat leave, planning how I would soon go camping with the baby and do some serious hiking with with an infant carrier. My intrusive thoughts also reduced.

After about several weeks though I started to get anhedonia and it became very difficult for me to get out of the house with the stroller, and I didn't feel like it. Also I started to have more intrusive thoughts again, especially existential OCD type of thoughts.

I became quite concerned that lamotrigine stopped working but then I remembered that this has happened to me with coffee previously. When I start to drink it daily, the first days or weeks are pretty good, but then it's like I get a dopamine burn-out. Everything just starts to feel pointless, nothing to look forward to. Not sure what to do with my day as I just don't have a desire to do anything.

I'm glad I remembered this and stopped having coffee a few days ago. I've had just some green and black tea in the past few days, and felt better. Not sure what it is about coffee, but tea does not cause such a burn-out for me. 

A lot of research evidence shows that actually coffee is beneficial for women and women who consume multiple cups a day are less likely to experience depression. Seems that for me it's the opposite?

The coffee burn-out for me is even quite physical. It's as if I really lack dopamine - my speech slows down, I find it more difficult to even open my mouth and say something. It feel like typing a message is very energy consuming. Just moving my body feels to difficult.

Then my brain also starts lying to me. It kept saying that it's not the coffee, it's the postpartum hormones. But I forced myself to not drink coffee for several days now - and yep, it was the coffee. "
649,1,"I‚Äôve been having terrible stomach issues since starting xl at 150 mg, diarrhea, irritable stomach, headaches and nausea too.

650,1,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post, I‚Äôm not well-versed in this side of Reddit. 

Basically my primary care physician prescribed me Zoloft several months ago which has had no real effect for me except sexual dysfunction. She changed it to Wellbutrin XL which I will be taking for the first time tomorrow. 

My fear comes from the fact that my depression presents with insomnia and weight loss (I‚Äôve lost 60 pounds over the last 4 months), making an antidepressant with sedating and appetite-stimulating effects seem like the best bet in my non-professional opinion. But after researching Wellbutrin online I‚Äôm a bit apprehensive because it seems that insomnia is a common side effect and that it‚Äôs one of the only antidepressants associated with weight LOSS, which I don‚Äôt need to lose any more of. 

Do I stick it out and see what happens? Or is there another course of action I should be taking?"

654,1,"This is a bit of a rant (to put it mildly) but I've seen some posts on here of a similar caliber and was wondering if anyone had any advice/wisdom/suggestions whatnot for me or anyone in a similar situation.

I'm 18F, almost 19, and I've been on and off different antidepressants since I was 12. I wish I was kidding. I absolutely don't think I should've been prescribed them at such a young age, but here we are. The antidepressants I've been on thus far are Zoloft, Prozac, and Cymbalta, which I am on currently (as well as a few other meds for my ADHD which I've actually had more positive experiences with). All of the aforementioned meds have had pretty similar effects for me. By that I mean my anxiety is greatly reduced, but I also feel like a zombie. My emotions operate at 25% capacity, for better or for worse. I.e. I basically never feel extremely sad or happy about just about anything.

However, by far the worst side effect for me with all of these meds has been the EXTREME fatigue. I can sleep 10-12 hours a night and still easily want to (and be able to, if I don't stop myself) take a 4 hour nap. Caffeine does barely anything for me. I wake up and have energy for maybe 4 hours but by noon I feel like I'm just dragging myself around for the rest of the day and fall asleep at 8. I recently fell asleep for a few moments while driving on the highway, which was a major wake-up call (literally!) for me. On the flip side, if I forget to take my Cymbalta, I get this crazy insomnia. Like I have right now. I would absolutely not have the energy to stay up past 9 otherwise.

In the interest of journalistic integrity, I will give credit where credit is due. Around 2 years ago now, I was in probably one of the worst OCD spirals of my life. I lost like 30 pounds in a couple months, basically failed out of school, quit my job, and had a life ending plan that I probably would've gone through with were it not for Zoloft. I was obviously at pretty rock bottom then, so it didn't take a lot to improve things. That being said, I don't want to mess with the progress I've made since.

In addition, part of the reason why I think I had this spiral, honestly, was because of withdrawal effects from getting off of Zoloft to begin with a few months prior. I had a similar spiral after getting off of Prozac for the first time when I was 13. So I don't want to cause anything that might screw up my life, especially given that I've finally been able to hold down a job and school for the first time in my life. That being said, I'm not particularly happy right now... just zombielike. I want to finally be done with these meds, and relying on them as a crutch to fix problems that I need to learn to deal with myself, for good.

**TLDR**; I've been on antidepressants for a third of my life and am getting pretty dejected by the negative side effects I've had on all of them (emotional numbness, never getting cold, EXTREME fatigue), but have also had negative experiences with withdrawal effects from these meds in the past and don't want to inadvertently make things worse for myself. Has anyone else managed to successfully get off the meds long term?"
655,1,"They are often not even aware that RLS appears to be a dopamine-related problem. In addition, they do not know about potential triggers (antihistamines, SRIs, melatonin, anti-dopaminergics) and do not know which compatible medications they can prescribe to patients. My psychiatrists looked at me with big surprised eyes when I mentioned that the SSRI was making my RLS worse. As if this was an impossibility or as if I was imagining it. When I ask if there are other friendly RLS medications, I am looked at as if I am a weirdo and get the answer: *‚ÄúSSRIs are the best meds for your condition. All those older and other meds are bad!‚Äù*

The problem I have is that doctors don't like to be told anything by other doctors.

659,1,"I have been on Wellbutrin 300 mg for almost four years now. The reason I got this med prescribed in the first place was because I have always struggled with fatigue, lack of motivation and anhedonia. My pshyciatrist told me this med would suit me very well because I was struggling with these issues.

So it's been over a year and I have come to a conclusion right now and it seems like this med is just not  effective enough. I'm still struggling with lack of motivation and anhedonia despite being on a very high dose on this med. I still can't bring myself to do anything and I just have this feeling that I don't want to do anything with my life. It's like I have this horrible motivational paralysis still and I can't overcome it. My excutive dysfunction is also just getting worse by everyday. I can't focus on important tasks at work and I can't even bring myself to do even simple tasks at work or at home. At this point it's really bad and I just don't know what to do anymore.

I went back to my pshyciatrist a few weeks ago and I told him everything that I'm still struggling with lack of motivation and anhedonia. I told him that this med is not working and that it seems like this med is not effective enough for me. He just told me that there was nothing he could do anymore because i'm already on the highest dose of Wellbutrin which is 300 mg here in my country so he said he couldn't do anything about it. He told me I should see a therapist instead. But I doubt that it will make any difference because I have tried that before and It didn't make any difference.

My pshyciatrist thinks it's my behavior that's causing this. I don't believe it's because of my behavior because I have never been like this before. I have struggled with depression, OCD and social anxiety in the past but never did I have this horrible apathy and social anhedonia before. Something else must have caused this horrible apathy and anhedonia. I'm suspecting it's the SSRIS that I have taken in the past that have messed me up. Not even Wellbutrin could help this so I don't know what will.

My question right now what's my next option? I can't raise the dose of Wellbutrin because 300 mg is the highest prescribed dose here. I would've tried 450 mg if I had the option but unfortunately that's not possible. Is there any med that is more effective than Wellbutrin for apathy and anhedonia? I really want to know because i'm really tired of feeling like I can't bring myself to do anything."
660,1,"So I was supposed to do Spravato but the place I applied to (like the only one in RI) said they couldn‚Äôt accept me as a patient ‚Äúat this time‚Äù, I had my doctors appointment yesterday and I brought up TCA‚Äôs, Topamax, Trintellix Rexulti and ketamine troches. He told me the online ketamine troches is what‚Äôs causing the DEA to crack down more, that TCA‚Äôs have a lot of interactions, that he hasn‚Äôt really found Topamax to be helpful for anything and called it ‚ÄúDopamax‚Äù, and Rexulti he said was very similar to abilify but wouldn‚Äôt want to prescribe another antipsychotic given I‚Äôm on 300mg Seroquel already‚Ä¶ so he put me on Trintellix and said it‚Äôs an antidepressant unlike any other and that insurance would probably be annoying in getting pre authorization coverage and it appears to have gone through to my CVS‚Ä¶ 

But so he put me on Lithium for a month or two earlier in the year and it kinda felt like it was starting to help at the end but the partial program psych I had wanted me on less meds and that was the only one I was willing to stop.

663,1,"After a fair bit of thinking and research ([Pastebin link for summary](https://pastebin.com/j271jS5x)), I decided to try \[**possibly unsafe**\] combining 150mg moclobemide - itself a fast-acting RIMA class antidepressant - with 200mg slow-release 5-HTP. The observed effect was a *very rapid* and subjectively very noticeable mood boost, alongside some subjective hints that serotonin levels were significantly elevated... but, and this is key, seemingly not enough to raise the spectre of serotonin toxicity (formerly known as serotonin syndrome). Heart rate and BP remained well within the safe range, no muscle rigidity was observed, pupil dilation was comparable to or perhaps even less than SSRIs (haven't taken any SSRI in many years; **never combine 5-HTP or moclobemide with SSRIs)**, no abnormal tremors were observed, anxiety did not appear to be elevated, psychiatric state appeared stable, no headache... as far as I could tell, everything checked out OK. At no point did it feel like it was going in a bad direction, although I could definitely feel the effects. I've repeated the experiment several times and it went equally well each time. *Full disclosure, I've been taking moclobemide regularly for a while, which does alter its kinetics - however, when I first started taking moclobemide the effect was immediate \[a couple hours, or at most within a day or two; it's hard to pinpoint EXACTLY when any antidepressant kicks in\], and the effect of adding 5-HTP was also immediate \[ie a bit over half an hour, since it takes time to absorb\], and so I think it's a pretty good bet combining the two would also have an immediate effect in someone who's just starting both (or at bare minimum, immediate relative to other antidepressant regimens).*

I'm curious if anyone else has tried this combination, because the speed at which it seems to work is phenomenal and the effect feels robust. **I** ***cannot and do not*** **recommend anyone try it because of this post, it could be much more dangerous than my experience has indicated - everyone's different, and there is the potential that this combination might cause life-threatening serotonin syndrome in some cases.** That said, I haven't found any reports of fatalities or hospitalizations associated with it - but that may just mean no one's tried it, or that the fatalities/hospitalizations weren't written about / reported; it does *not* mean it's safe.

To anyone else who's tried this: Can you describe your experience, did you encounter any dangerous side effects or experience any consequences, and/or did it cause any symptoms of serotonin toxicity?"
664,1,"Hi there

I am a long term sufferer of depression and social anxiety. I have tried countless medications (SSRI, SNRI, Stimulants, Anxiolytics, Ketamine, Psilocybin, etc), psychotherapy and lifestyle interventions.

665,1,"Hey all,

I just had a quick question to pose. I'm a gal who's hella OCD and have been on high doses of Abilify/Prozac to target these symptoms for about the past year. So far, this regimen has been very successful for me, effectively cutting my OCD symptoms down to nearly nothing, which I'm incredibly grateful for. However, I've been struggling with depressive symptoms for quite a while (~6 months) and I really need a change of pace to get things back on track in my life. 

My depressive symptoms are mainly a lack of energy/motivation to do anything. It's exhausting to even get out of bed in the morning, and I can't get joy out of doing things I used to love, which is so so frustrating. 

At the start of my medication journey, I didn't realize I had OCD - so, my psychiatrist and I were mainly focused on controlling depression/anxiety symptoms. To that end, I was titrated to a high dose of Zoloft, and eventually moved to a relatively high dose of Lexapro. I felt as though Lexapro was very successful for controlling depressive symptoms, and I'd be very open to trying this medication again, however, I don't want to have a regression of OCD symptoms. 

I was curious whether anyone has had any success with medications for both depression and OCD? If so, what are they and what is your experience with them? I'd be open to adding an SSRI such as Lexapro into my routine, and will be bringing this up to my psych at our next meeting, but wanted some community feedback first. Thanks so much for your input! 

Kindly, 
Tess"

671,1,"I am currently on lamotrigine, which helps me, I take it in the morning. By the evening I do have more rumination, especially when I lie down in bed and try to fall asleep. I assume this is because I am tired and at this point the brain function is worse, so repetitive thoughts occur. Also I have a newborn, so my daily sleep is very poor.
I have to go to sleep daily quite early, around 9pm or 10pm, otherwise I will barely get any sleep because of my kids. The problem is that even when I feel tired, it's difficult to fall asleep.

I've recently found a trick that seems to help me. In order to get out of rumination, I watch in the evening a video of some algorithm. For example I am currently trying to better understand how XGBoost works, so I watched a few videos, and also read all of the steps. Then when I am lying down in bed, I start going over all of the steps in my mind, and really trying to write out the formulas in my head.

So I really go into the details and if I start ruminating again, I go back a step. So I start this way - initialize all initial predictions to the average value. I view the formula in my mind. Step 2 - compute the residuals (write out the formula). Step 3 - fit a decision tree to the residuals. Etc.

I've tried it for a few nights now, and after several steps I wake up and suddenly it turns out that I already slept three hours. So for me it has been working quite quickly. I think it's important to pick an algorithm that you don't understand well and that makes your mind tired. "

Also on August,  7th drugs.com listed It as discontinued. I have been unable to find any press releases. I tried emailing the manufacturer, Fabre-Kramer and the message was bounced back as undeliverable. If anyone has any further information please comment. "
685,1,"So, do we think Ansofaxine is going to actually be approved this year? Seems we are short on time, but I have this theory that this medication might help with both my depression and ADHD. "
686,1,"I have been seeing psychiatrists and on various meds since 2015, so I just want to throw some ideas out there.
I have been on and off meds for 9 years and only half a year ago I was offered to try lamotrigine by my psychiatrist. I assume there are quite a few people who have never tried it.
I am a female, 30+ years old. I have been diagnosed with depression and OCD. I experience a lot of rumination and intrusive thoughts.

I have been on lamotrigine 50mg since March and so far it has been a positive experience for me. It has helped me with energy, I take it when I wake up. Also has helped me to have fewer ruminating thoughts about the universe being pointless, me not bringing value to humanity, fear of the future, all the very depressing stuff like that!
I tried going up to 75mg, but it actually made my intrusive thoughts worse, so I am back at 50mg.

Lamotrigine is not an SSRI, nor an SNRI. Lamotrigine is an anti-seizure med and a mood stabilizer.

What does it do? I was told it affects the way sodium ions flow into neurons. Why does that help me? My psychiatrist has no idea :D Potentially lamotrigine reduces neuronal activity, so it reduces the amount of rumination and anxious thoughts.
Also it maybe blocks calcium channels and by that reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. It may also have antioxidant properties.

Anyways, this is the only med that I am currently on. I haven't really had any side-effects and I find that I feel better when I take it in the morning on an empty stomach.
I also sometimes make saffron tea and use full spectrum CBD oil, but those are not meds, those are supplements."
687,1,"Anyone using this combo? Is it good?

I‚Äôm in the psych ward and dr suggested lexapro and agomelatine combo as lexapro alone is not working enough for this depression episode. "
688,1,"I  purposefully said sleepiness not tiredness. I know tiredness, we all do. The effect of symbalta is more like the pleasant feeling that you could take a nap now but amplified and all day long. The first time I took it I selpt for 3 days nonstop.  
  
I tried changing the time I take the meds but it doesn't seem to change anything.   
  
There seems to be an interaction with pregabalin, when I stop taking it it gets better.   
  
Please share your experience or research on the topic. Cymbalta should be a stimulant normally so I wonder why I get this reaction.  
  
  
 "
689,1,"I've tried basically everything but typical antipsychotics which alongside atypicals I will not take. I'm supposedly bp2 but I've only been made hypomanic or manic due to primarily antipsychotics and in one case after years of taking it, pregabalin. Which caused an event that probably caused my hypogonadism. I'm not going to talk about the details. So anyway, I'm basically considering subtheraputic doses of lithium since I'm so hypersensitive to psychotropic drugs it's ridiculous. 10mg of amitriptyline makes me suffer from derealization and depakote was 750mg 1xday, depleted my immune system, caused a minor uti to turn into a septic kidney infection, withdrawal after only 8 days of taking it and then gave me tardive akathisia after as a final fuck you. 

So, options? I'd like to not be miserable since it's hell wanting to suckstart a shotgun every day."
690,1,"Currently on 25mg Zoloft, 100SR Wellbutrin.    Edit: I meant assess*

I was prescribed buspar a month+ ago to get off Zoloft but it didn‚Äôt help and I kept my Zoloft at 25mg from 50mg instead of getting off.

I got off buspar and felt slightly better, this has me thinking that these meds might be making my derealization, anhedonia and anxiety worse‚Ä¶ I ran out of my script so I‚Äôll be attempting to get off everything to assess what‚Äôs helping, what‚Äôs hurting, or if I even need to be on them. I have a list of meds to try which is anything but SSRI/SNRI since the risk of anhedonia is too strong. The SR Wellbutrin could‚Äôve contributed to anxiety/chest pain, XL could‚Äôve been smoother.

Symptoms: DR/DP, anhedonia, anxiety, lack of will to live, chest pain, no sociability, etc.

How it triggered: kratom abuse and potentially weed‚Ä¶ I use to be social and optimistic despite having anxiety/depression to a manageable extent. It was nothing compared to these past few months. 

My med journey: lexapro for a few years (dumb doc gave it to me when I was 17). I cut cold turkey a couple years later for kratom since I ran out of meds, this was a mistake since I suffered from a previous devastating kratom addiction. A few months after relapse, I felt like death after quitting, worse then last withdrawal. Severe anhedonia, ER level chest pains, and my most traumatic life experience. I reinstated 10mg lexapro but felt worse, it might‚Äôve been too soon. I switched to Zoloft, felt better than lexapro but still anhedonic and anxious so added Wellbutrin which helped at first. I didn‚Äôt get improve so they tried switching Zoloft for buspar to help anhedonia. That didn‚Äôt help, might‚Äôve made me worse. Note that everybody in my family is on several psych meds. 

Solution: If I feel better, I can stay off all meds. If I need help, trying XL of Wellbutrin, Mirtazapine, or a low dose antipsychotic like abilify(helps anhedonia+dopamine) or lamotrigine(effects gaba receptors) should be my only options, maybe sprinkle in a low dose of SSRI like 5mg lexapro or 25mg Zoloft. I can mix and match the meds above or trial and error them. 

Questions: any recommendations or support to help me through this journey would be appreciated. DMs are open, nobody in my life really understands the med journey. I‚Äôve "

693,1,"Four weeks ago, my doctor added 0.5mg Risperidone to my 20mg Trintellix for depression. I had a decent initial but incomplete response. Then, she upped the Risperidone to 1.0mg. That same night, I took 2.5mg melatonin because I was having sleep issues of waking way too early. 
The next day, I felt pretty awful. Tired of course but also very depressed and hopeless. 
I‚Äôm sure the increase in Risperidone and the Melatonin had something to do with this but has anyone else experienced an increase in depression symptoms after taking melatonin along with their other depression meds? 
Thanks!  "
694,1,"I have been on Wellbutrin 300 mg for almost four years now and the reason I got this med prescribed in the first place was because I have always struggled with fatigue, lack of motivation and anhedonia. My pshyciatrist told me that this med would help me with these issues. Well now it has been over a year now and I haven't really noticed a difference to be honest. I'm still struggling with lack of motivation and anhedonia. It does the complete opposite actually it sometimes makes me really numb and it also causes extreme sexual dysfunction for me even though is not supposed to do that, it's supposed to give you a higher libido but no that hasn't happened to me unfortunately. I have absolutley no libido anymore and I can't even have an orgasm on Wellbutrin. I thought this med was supposed to give me motivation to do things and to help with my anhedonia. I suffer from extreme social anhedonia and Wellbutrin hasn't made any difference to that. I still have this feeling everyday that I don't want to anything and I don't want to accomplish anything because I just don't have the motivation and desire to do it. A few weeks ago I went back to my pshyciatrist and told him that Wellbutrin hasn't helped with these issues. He told me that I'm on the highest dose of Wellbutrin prescribed in my country and that's 300 mg and he said he couldn't do anything about it anymore. He then told me I need to find the motivation to do things myself and they way he said it was really harsh sounding and that made me really angry and disappointed because it just seems that he just doesn't know how hard it is for me to do it. He told me I would need to go and see a therapist instead because he said that the med i'm taking doesn't seem to be the issue. He told me everytime I have gone back to them I have told them I was suffering from apathy and anhedonia and that's why he thinks the meds aren't the issue here it's more my behavior. But I absolutely disagree with him on this because I have always suffered from this problem. I have only taken SSRIS before which did nothing for it and just made it worse. All SSRIS I have taken in the past made me extremley tired and numb. I know that I need to find the motivation to do things myself and socialize with other people but right now it's just not possible for me. How on earth am I supposed to find the motivation doing things when I can't even take a simple walk outside or even do simple tasks. I'm just so tired of having this and feeling like this everyday. I think I won't be able to go to my job anymore because of this. I think I would just stay at home and insolate myself becase it's really bad. It's like no one ever understands it not even my mother or brother shows me any sympathy for this and just say go out and make friends and stop lying down in bed all the time doing nothing with your life. Well they just don't understand it that's the problem. I do have autism and I think it has a lot to do with me not being able to get new friends or socialize with other but it's also because of my apathy and anhedonia  that destroys my social life. I don't think I can take living like this anymore. It's awful feeling like this everyday and I would commit suicide soon just because of this."

My job was dangerous, I was bullied by managers and coworkers for almost 8 months, and I finally said enough is enough (at my doctor's reoccurring instance). However, now I'm out of that toxic environment, I'm feeling overwhelmed because I can't see any of my bullies held accountable for what they did to me, I don't have another job or income lined up, my sleep and diet are all screwed up and my motivation to do much of anything is dangerously low. I know it's the wrong time to address the concept, but maybe it's actually the best time? I'm not sure... 


I'm 34, I've been on psych meds since I was 18, and I'm officially back on Lithium (XR 450mg), Trintellix (20mg), and Vyvanse (70mg) and I only sleep at all if it's with the help of sleep aids and Valerian Root. 

But- the lithium isn't working, I feel deep, dark, twisting thoughts that I can't shake off with any amount of positive, constructive belief. I have a great support system but they're all tired of hearing my complaints. 

My doctor suggested 3 options, which I only considered the first of: 
TMS, ECT, Ketamine.

I made a post here about a year or so ago when I discovered and I had reactive hypoglycemia after almost 8 years and how I treated it , recently my low mood has gotten worse among other symptoms , I went to the Dr to see what was going on with my gut and immediately noticed my inflamed neck so he ordered an ultrasound , antibody test etc and all came back negative .

My TSH on the other hand was at 6 , more tests would show a 11 even though my T3 T4 was at range .

These tests were similar to what I had in 2015 .

I decided to do an iodine blood test and turns out it was severely low , unbeknownst to me I had been consuming uniodinized salt for a long time , I had no idea that it didn't have any iodine in it . 

Further more free t3 t4 "" ranges "" are pointless if you have symptoms since everyone's actual range can be unique and some are very sensitive to it .

Taking iodine daily has made a huge improvement in almost every facet of my life , I'm taking 5mg a day and my swollen neck has reduced in size .

722,1,"i'm suspecting bipolar depression but i'm very frustrated that i'm suddenly quite useless and down. nothing is bringing me happiness. again. it's very frustrating.

when i got on sertraline, the depression finally lifted a bit and i was feeling ""positive"" thoughts naturally. like oh, no wonder people treat me like i'm stupid when i'm ""being negative"". and i personally, over time, started to feel they were stupid, too. why are you pretending it's all okay? why are you pretending that the one good thing or the one silver lining has any value at all?

now i understand. oh. it's just a mood thing. their mood is inflated. so they're more ""capable"" of ignoring every soul sucking negative thing, because their mood keeps them afloat enough to shrug it off and point out a positive thing. aka, they're capable of dismissing themselves *and* being happy about it!

but now it's back. i don't know if the meds are wearing off, but it feels like reality is hitting again. i think it's because i genuinely cannot do things about my situation. non-depressed people usually were capable of ""just seeing a way out"" because when they embarked on that path to try and change their situations? well, it happened. they succeeded. they made changes.

because of my undiagnosed adhd and possibly autism (maybe especially!), i tried so fucking hard and no path lead anywhere and i'm in the same fucking spot as per usual. every job i manage to get, career path, major, has been a dead end because eventually my brain and body betray me and i suddenly stop functioning no matter how much i want to, no matter how much i push myself. it's like a chronic illness.

no, i cannot just stand up for myself or just set boundaries. people won't have it from me, because it's, well, *me*. im just such a fucking weirdo, why can't i beat her down? i should be able to control her, of all people. thanks autism!

but see, another person when their boundaries are crossed, wouldn't get depressed. because they'd set the boundary and people would generally respect it even if they disagree! because ""we can't change other people"". nope. that rule just... doesn't fucking apply if you're a weirdo.

i still can't get my work done, even with treating my adhd getting work done is hell, i haven't finished much of anything.

another person would not get depressed because they might ""just get it done"". if they're falling behind, urgency will kick in. but my urgency, adrenaline, is all burned out. i'm wrung dry. i'll probably lose my job for this (again). depression.

find other people you get along with! i can't. i'm a weirdo. people immediately, viscerally dislike me. they only like me when i'm a side friend. that's so soul sucking and unfulfilling. i hate people and they hate me, too. just reality. a depressing one. "
723,1,"The last two psychiatrists I've seen (only ones covered by kaiser insurance) did not take my issues seriously and it felt like they were just trying to get the appointment over quickly so they can prescribe me whatever first-line treatment (SSRIs) that they give everyone. It did not feel holistic in the sense that they actually listened to my experiences to try and form an accurate diagnosis. I suspect I have some complex mix of depression, ADHD, and possibly anxiety.

I hear about psychiatrists who are willing to try more experimental treatments, such as MAOIs, TMS, and other non-SSRIs. So far I've tried prozac, wellbutrin, lexapro, and zoloft, all to no avail.

Anything less than 90-120mg per day has no appreciable effect. Anything >210mg/day results in serious water retention as well as cognitive impairment.

Then I try to end my speech as soon as I can. 

I have done some crazy experiments and fixed this problem using some substances, but they are highly discouraged and not a long term solution.

752,1,"I forgot to include Nefazdone and possibly other psychiatric meds. Does anybody have knowledge or input they can share about this and the possibility of using it to treat disassociation/brainfog with anhedonia and anxiety?

To summarize:
My other post was recommending non serotonin meds to try, that have similar or better efficiency then SSRI/SNRI such as Mirtazapine, agomelatine, and controversially low dose of abilify (could be other antipsychotics too but haven‚Äôt looked into it).

Apparently low dose of abilify has tons of evidence for anhedonia including dopamine support (nobody knows what neurotransmitter cause this tbh). I listed several studies and sources to back up every med I listed. I also didn‚Äôt mention TCA or MAOI since I haven‚Äôt reached that part in treatment. Buspar + melatonin was also mentioned, early studies have found it to be a possible effective med with low risk. 

SSRI/SNRI can be very effective for some, but doesn‚Äôt treat anhedonia specifically and can worsen it with emotional blunting, not to mention sexual side effects that occur too. 

Each med affects everybody differently, psychiatry is a guessing game so it‚Äôs best to know which has the better risk for reward and better odds for remission. "

-Gepirone (available soon might actually increase libido, which is a plus )

-Vortioxetine and Villazodone (My understanding is Vortioxetine or name brand Trintellix has less sexual sides than Villazodone, but both have less than SSRI‚Äôs

-Lamictal (caused anxiety and agitation for me at 200 but might retry at 50 mg, it is a great option for depression off label, has helped A LOT of people) 

-Nefazodone (lesser know depression drug, subreddit and facebook group dedicated to it, has worked for a lot of people when nothing else has )

-Mirtazapine ( Also known as remeron, helps both anxiety and depression in many people, when other drugs don‚Äôt work) "
754,1,"Spent months trying several nootropics from Rhodiola, Ashwaghanda and St John‚Äôs Wort to help my anxiety (dread, high heart rate and intrusive thoughts/OCD). Nothing really helped except maybe Rhodiola but it was mild. Eventually went to see a doctor who prescribed Mirtazapine. In the space of a week it obliterated my intrusive thoughts and reduced my OCD by around half but it‚Äôs made me incredibly irritated and anti social when I was always outgoing. I used to put effort into socialising and now I couldn‚Äôt really care less to even try. Some days I feel okay after missing a couple of doses (anxiety free still) and when I consistently take it I‚Äôm sluggish, agitated and just can‚Äôt really get in the zone to socialise.

758,1,"Criteria: no SSRI/SNRI, they have the highest chance of emotional blunting and sexual side effects, therefore the risk outweighs the benefits but everybody is different. 

Mirtazapine, agomelatine, low dose of abilify, buspar mixed with melatonin SR and Wellbutrin. Skip to the bottom for studies and evidence. Trying different combinations can yield different interactions, therefore improving symptoms. 
(IV ketamine would be my first option if I could afford it)

These seem to be the only medications that treat both anxiety/depression without the possibility of worsening symptoms (few have reported abilify). There was a study finding abilify to help anhedonia, and mirtazapine being the most effective anti depressant. Wellbutrin is widely known in this subreddit to help.

My anhedonia:  I believe mostly derives from anxiety, as well as ‚Äúlow dopamine‚Äù(I understand it‚Äôs more complex). It was caused by kratom abuse or SSRI meds. I was on lexapro 2 years, quit CT due to no prescription. I relapsed on kratom for 4 months to help; quit 03/08/24. I reinstated lexapro soon after, it made anhedonia/withdrawl worse so I switched to Zoloft. 

I‚Äôm currently on 10mg buspar 2x, 100mg WellbutrinSR 1x, 25mg Zoloft (tapering), and propranolol. 

Wellbutrin has helped I believe, as well as tapering down 50mg Zoloft. It‚Äôs widely accepted that Wellbutrin helps, but increasing my dose causes heart palpitations. If anybody has information that could help me or others, please share.

Basically the above study states that cocaine‚Äôs addictive nature and euphoric effects don‚Äôt stem from its SNDRI properties but from its DAT inverse agonism or negative allosteric modification of the DAT by reversing the direction of the dopamine efflux by the DAT. The same goes for Methylphenidate at high abusive doses. I always thought monoamine reuptake inhibition alone wouldn‚Äôt cause euphoria and therefore lead to addiction or else MAOIs (which are actually considered SNDRIs) would‚Äôve had high potential of abuse and become scheduled. Now if this is true and they‚Äôre generally considered safe why aren‚Äôt there more SNDRIs available for clinical use despite their effectiveness and wide range of applications? It seems it would solve the MAOIs stigma such as dietary restrictions and interactions and replace them with safer options. Also most of them seem to have unexpectedly failed clinical trials (except for Nefazodone and Ansofaxine which are both very weak). Why is that?"

I‚Äôve improved but still have lingering symptoms, which we‚Äôre still working on resolving. I‚Äôm also in therapy. 
My Dad was just diagnosed with cancer and I‚Äôm grieving this now. I lost my mom to cancer 5 years ago but at that time I was not clinically depressed, just grieving normally and I was then able to regain my joy fairly quickly. 

I‚Äôm scared that since I‚Äôm already going through a depressive episode and now grieving, the meds and therapy will not be effective at all. 
I accept that pills won‚Äôt take away the grief and I won‚Äôt want them to, so I can grieve naturally. I‚Äôm just wondering if my treatments will be derailed or not work since I‚Äôm still dealing with the underlying depressive episode. 

Any thoughts or opinions on this? Can my clinical depression still improve even though I‚Äôm grieving? 

Thanks for reading. "
779,1,So I've been thinking about this combination for severe depression would this be okay? Thoughts?
780,1,"These are my Genesight results. I've been on Lexapro for probably a month now for anxiety as I don't have depression. I've always heard that Lexapro is the best medicine for anxiety as far as antidepressants go which is why my PCP prescribed it for me. I was on it when I was little bit younger but I don't remember if it helped that much.

I was on 10 mg for 2 weeks and now I've been on 20 mg for probably 2 to 3 weeks and I can't really tell if it's helping. I'm so confused with these results as it's saying that my genotype may impact drug mechanism of action and result in reduced efficiency. I have no idea what that means and I've tried to figure it out to no avail. Does this mean the medicine will not work at all? Does this mean I need to take 30 to 40 mg for it to work? Hopefully someone else has been through the same experience with Lexapro and these results and can offer some insight because I do not know how to interpret the results of this. I'm a little stressed out because I don't know what else I'll be able to take that will help my anxiety when Lexapro supposed to be the best. But is this saying it won't work? I don't want to take a medicine that I don't need to be taking. It's just heartening that The best medication for anxiety is the one that apparently I can't take, or can I? Any insight will be helpful and If someone can help me interpret the results I would be really appreciative. Thank you in advance!"

782,1,"I have treatment resistant depression. I‚Äôve tried over 20 meds and treatments including ECT and ketamine infusions. I finally decided to try lithium. I felt somewhat okay at 300mg, even noticed myself genuinely laughing one day. Increased to 600mg and the fatigue and crushing depression is exhausting. I keep fucking up small things that I should know better. Struggling to focus and can barely stand in the shower because I‚Äôm so drained. My psychiatrist told me to increase again to 900mg so I did. 

I don‚Äôt know why I allowed myself to feel hopeful that this would help. Has anyone else had this same experience, and did it end up helping you? Before starting lithium, I was just very numb and on autopilot, but semi functioning. I‚Äôm now back to sleeping 16 hours a day, not eating, not showering. I read *so* many positive experiences and I was genuinely excited about the possibility of feeling better.

789,1,"I started dating my girlfriend back in March. We got along extremely well and were sure nothing could break us apart. We met each other's families and it really seemed like nothing would break us apart. At the end of May, she left her SSRI medication (Cipralex) at my place and didn't seem to continue. I noticed a slight change in her mood the following week but after that she went back to her home city for her summer break. With the passage of time, she kept getting more and more distant and within a month, she was a completely different person. I met her yesterday (18 August) where she said that she wants to break up since she doesn't feel like talking to anyone, which is true as her friends have been calling me to see what she's up to. She isn't talking to anyone. She says she wants me in her life and thinks we will end up together but right now she just needs to be left alone. After seeing posts on reddit, i've told her multiple times what a SSRI withdrawal does to someone but she simply responds that she's fine and refuses to go back to her psychiatrist. What do I do in this situation? The last thing I want is to lose her. I know we dated only for 3 months but trust me, it was different. I've been with girls before and I am someone who has been through deep shit so I know when a girl is playing me. This is not it. I was her entire world and now she wants to push me away because all of a sudden, she wants to be alone at home and not talk to anyone or do anything all day. This just doesn't make sense. I don't know how big of a role SSRI withdrawal is playing entire scene. I just need advice. I don't talk to anyone about my stuff so this is the only place I could actually get advice. "
790,1,"Hi all; many years of reading posts on here but never posted before. Wanted to reach out to see if anybody with superior knowledge can help me.

Resisting the urge to babble I'll try to be brief. I have tried many antidepressants out, sometimes with augmenting medications too. Of these I've settled onto two favourites that solve different aspects of my mental health. SSRIs have a ton of side effects that affect me badly (I seem usually quite sensitive to them) but they have all helped my social anxiety well, with venlafaxine (the only SNRI I have tried) being the best one for completely eradicating my anxiety and pure O symptoms. I take an incredibly low dose of 25mg with minimal side effects other than weight gain (not ideal with body dysmorphia unfortunately).  However, it flattens out my mood significantly, which is a win in that it stops me oversharing and crying so easily, but also means I don't get the enjoyment in life much either. I'm functional enough on it, but functional isn't really living, and I end up more tired and demotivated. Some slight anorgasmia and sweating but nowhere near as bad as other SSRIs like escitalopram or sertraline.

On the other side of the fence. Moclobemide has been incredible for bringing the joy back to life. It intensifies libido and orgasms, my love of music returns, it doesn't cause weight gain and I feel motivated. But it isn't great for my anxiety, and my pure O symptoms worsen, and my girlfiend has to deal with a lot of my anxious insecure overthinking and surprisingly excessive crying whenever I get lost in my head. I think the beneficial effects come from norepinephrine, as I had similar with bupropion (although that made me feel very anxious and angry so I quit it). 300mg is the sweet spot so far with that; 450mg and above causes bad IBS issues, and 600mg (starting dose for anxiety relief supposedly) makes me fall asleep constantly so I'm useless on that dose.

 I've yet to try augmenting medications with venlafaxine, I've tried many with moclobemide but I am limited due to interaction risks. I live in the UK so I'm limited to what I can either source online or get through the NHS. Both of those meds don't seem to mess with my insomnia much but I'm sensitive to that. I think I can source Parnate possibly but it is bad for insomnia. Nardil sounds ideal for a lot of my issues but is bad for sexual sides and weight gain which will make me quit.

Ideally, I think I need to lean in to venlafaxine or moclobemide and balance their negatives out with an augmenting medication I suspect. Moclobemide mostly makes me love life at home but venlafaxine helps me live life functionally. 

No official diagnosis but seems based on many years of self study that I have social anxiety, pure O (relating to relationships and rejection sensitivity primarily), insomnia, binge eating disorder, body dysmorphia, and atypical depression.

In an ideal world I'd just combine moclobemide and low dose venlafaxine but that is dangerous for serotonin syndrome unfortunately. 

Sorry for the babble but wanted to cover this in detail. Suspect most advice will cover areas I've been looking into for years but I welcome any advice people can offer. Thank you for your time.

792,1,"

I've been on antidepressants since 2017. I've been on Lexapro, Zoloft, Effexor, Viibryd, Abilify, mirtazapine, lamotrigine, lithium, Trintellix, and most recently Wellbutrin. Either the side effects were unbearable, or I've still experienced really horrible depressive episodes while taking a med. I've kind of started to think that meds aren't that helpful for me - their relief is always temporary, and then the depressive episode recurs. My psych has been suggesting Seroquel or Depakote as next possible meds to try. But I am a bit fed up of trying meds and still getting crazy depressed. 

 Has anyone had experience taking time off from meds? Is that crazy? I just feel like if the meds aren't stopping my depressive periods, maybe it's not that different than just being off meds? Curious what people's thoughts are. 

"
793,1,"I've been dealing with depression my entire life (40M) and on various medications for most of my adult life. I think I am finally on medications that work and my depression is in remission. 

I feel normal to good most days, pretty much zero suicidal ideation. I'm more productive at work, more motivated to improve my life and health, more outgoing and seeking social connections (including romantic for the first time in like 10 years). I'm also drinking a lot less and avoiding junk food. Still struggling with being more active though.

I am taking Trintellix, bupropion, ziprasidone, and getting ketamine infusions (r/TherapeuticKetamine) every 4 weeks. I think what made the difference was switching from olanzapine to ziprasidone. Original reason was to stop gaining weight, which I have and am now losing, but I have felt so much better since I started taking it, about 3 months.

I'm not saying this stack will work for everyone, but just wanted to share to let people know that it is possible to find medications that work, even if it takes years of trial and error. I've tried more meds than I can remember. 

I've been seeing the same psychiatrist for 14 years. Therapy is also helpful, I would recommend finding a good psychiatrist if you can. I've learned a lot about challenging negative thinking and building self esteem.

Anyway, good luck and don't give up!"
794,1,"Is a D2 receptor antagonist the same as a Dopamine reuptake inhibitor? I‚Äôm no expert in psychopharmacology, but if you block the D2 receptor, doesn‚Äôt that mean there will be more dopamine in the synapse? 

I‚Äôve read that Risperidone decreases dopamine in the brain. But I also read that it increases it by blocking the 5HT2a receptor. 

I just started taking it to augment my Trintellix, which helped but I still have troublesome depression, anxiety, and OCD symptoms.

795,1,"Hey! 

I've consolidated a post and comments I made on /MAOIs in hopes of reaching more people and having a bigger discussion! Please also suggest other subs that might be interested in joining the discussion.

I haven't seen much on the reversible MAO-B inhibitor (and anticonvulsant) safinamide here. Why is that?

In this letter to the editor (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10983021/) they mention the following:

""Despite the promise of MAO‚ÄêB inhibitors in treating brain diseases, a limitation of drugs like selegiline (L‚Äêdeprenyl) is their effects are not long‚Äêlasting. In APP/PS1 mice, selegiline showed a therapeutic effect lasting approximately one week, but this effect diminished with long‚Äêterm administration of about four weeks. Notably, prolonged use of selegiline triggered a compensatory mechanism involving diamine oxidase (DAO)‚Äêdependent GABA synthesis, a pathway alternative to MAO‚ÄêB that degrades putrescine into GABA. As an irreversible MAO‚ÄêB inhibitor, selegiline forms a covalent bond with MAO‚ÄêB, eventually destroying it and subsequently activating the compensatory mechanism (i.e. DAO‚Äêdependent GABA synthesis). On the other hand, reversible MAO‚ÄêB inhibitors such as safinamide (Xadago) and the newly developed KDS2010 (Tisolagiline) have less compensatory effects because they compete with the substrate and consequently leave MAO‚ÄêB intact. This contrast strongly suggests the use of reversible, but not irreversible, MAO‚ÄêB inhibitors as a long‚Äêterm treatment to reduce MAO‚ÄêB‚Äêdependent GABA synthesis in pathological conditions.""

I had found this info in a proper paper as well, but I can't seem to find it anymore - PubMed really has a bad search function imho.

While not fully elucidated in humans, I believe, tonic GABA increase (through astrocytes) seems to be related with MDD as well (in mice afaik):

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7408154/

https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/13/4/318

So there might be merit to avoiding compensatory DAO activation in MDD?

From what I could see ""Safinamide is vastly more selective for MAO-B than MAO-A (1,000 times more selective in humans), when compared with rasagiline (203 times) or selegiline (127 times)."" (https://www.dovepress.com/safinamide-in-the-management-of-patients-with-parkinsonrsquos-disease--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-TCRM).

And ""Single oral administration of safinamide at 600 Œºg/kg (36 mg for a 60-kg subject) inhibited 91% of platelet MAO-B activity in a few hours, and a steady-state plasma concentration of safinamide could be achieved with only five days of repeated daily administration""
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X2030349X).


From what I could see, safinamide has low to mid nanomolar affinity to MAO-B and sigma 1, while having mid micromolar affinities to voltage gated calcium and sodium channels (like lamotrigine/lamictal) and tendentially NDRI properties. At 100 mg/day it seems to affect the ion channels, while at 50 mg/day it does not, though inhibiting MAO-B to a similar extent. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10479837/)

This sounds to me like a very interesting combination of properties and I'm wondering why it's not discussed more - as augmentation of existing AD drugs or as a standalone therapy.

I believe I read it on here somewhere, but there's data suggesting high doses of moclobemide (900-1200 mg) being more efficacious than common doses (300-600 mg). This could be explained by that one PET trial (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772270/) showing only around 75% occupancy at common doses and 85% at high doses (comparable to occupancy of irreversibles) or maybe even of moclobemide losing its selectivity at those doses and also partially inhibiting MAO-B (analogous to selegiline losing its selectivity at high doses used for MDD)?

Wouldn't a common dose of moclobemide + 50 mg (or lower even?) of safinamide then have a similar effect? Has anybody looked into this? To me this sounds like a safer (regarding dietary restrictions) alternative to common unselective irreversible MAOIs.

Looking forward to your thoughts! Please suggest other subs for more engagement as well :)

TLDR: Safinamide seems interesting, why is it not discussed?

After I started the 16-hour fasts and stopped eating high-glycemic foods, I've been getting memories popping up from 10-15 years ago. Not good or bad memories, but random ones, in a lot of detail. It's as if something in my brain reconnected and brings up a memory that was stored on some forgotten hard drive. I can't know whether these memories are accurate or not, but they have a lot of details, such as what the temperature was at that moment.

The memories can be something like‚Äîbeing at a gas station, it's very hot, I clearly remember the temperature of that day, I am buying ice cream and waiting for a bus to go back home from university. Or‚ÄîI am walking downtown, it's warm, there is a man selling used books on a sidewalk. I buy a book from him for a few dollars.

These memories are not specifically meaningful, they are quite random, but I found it an interesting experience to observe them. They happen spontaneously, I have not been trying to remember anything in particular, they just pop up in my head.

In general, from my past experience, I do find that a low-glycemic diet with intermittent fasting makes me more stable, decreases rumination, and makes activities feel more interesting."

807,1,"Hi there,

 I just found out there is a new medication called ""Aviandr"" that has been released in Russia last year for the treatment of anxiety disorders. It has a quite interesting pharmacological profile as it is an antagonist of the 5HT6 receptor. As far as I know there is no such thing in the ""western world"" for the treatment of mental disorders. So if there is anyone who has actually tried it, could you please share your experience with it?"
808,1,"Hi! I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for 2.5 years at the 300mg XL dose. I haven‚Äôt had any depressive symptoms in over a year, but I‚Äôve been uncertain about going off the medication. I‚Äôve taken the 150mg XL for the last few days and I‚Äôm curious about any benefits to quitting bupropion for those who‚Äôve been on it for years.

My only negative side effects from bupropion are occasional heart palpitations and some memory issues. I also think it helps with maintaining my weight, but I can‚Äôt say for sure. Overall, in comparison to depression those occasional symptoms are no big deal. I do worry about the memory issues from time to time though.

Any thoughts on the benefits of quitting? Or is it better to keep taking it for years as ‚Äúdepression insurance‚Äù?"

Evaluated for adhd by my therapists advice but given ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù as a diagnosis because my issues could be rooted in trauma and depression instead. 

All these changes I‚Äôve made and there are still many days I think about taking my own life. 

I‚Äôve tried meditation and journaling but really struggle to stick with them longer than a few weeks. I have some bad executive function issues and struggle immensely forming any sort of habit or keeping structure for myself. Does any one have habit forming advice? Or other lifestyle changes that have helped them? 

I used to eat pretty healthy but I‚Äôm struggling to meal prep and feed myself anything other than pbjs and protein smoothies for most meals. I tried seeing an RD but my insurance switched and I can‚Äôt afford it now. So any healthy depression meals appreciated as well. I had low vitamin D but have been treated for it. I also have pcos which could play into it. "
811,1,"I tried 150mg wellbutrin for a few weeks and absolutely love the way it makes me feel. It's honestly amazing, I can't believe a single pill can do what it does for me and my mental state. Reminds me of a stimulant like adderall but also addresses depression: way fewer negative thoughts and self talk, more energy and motivation as well.

However, I get negative sexual side effects that I know are from the Wellbutrin and other people have noted this as well. Even with Cialis, I struggle to maintain an erection and orgasm, there seems to be less sensitivity too. As a result, I'm not willing to continue using this medication.

Since wellbutrin works in a very unique way, I'm hoping there might be a supplement/medication that works the same way but without the negative side effects.

SSRIs: Had worse sexual side effects than wellbutrin and won't ever go back.

Adderall: This does work pretty well but when I go off of it I have extreme fatigue and I'd rather not take this every day forever.

Selgin: Didn't really notice much of a difference but I didn't take these super regularly,  I think I tried it for a couple weeks before stopping. Tried sublingual and on empty stomach.


Things that might work:

Caffeine: I'm very sensitive to caffeine so I'd need to find low dose supplements (25mg or less).

St John's Wort: never taken this before, I've read it may work.

MAOI: I've read this works similarlyto SNRIs, but selgin is an MAOI and it didnt work. 


Please reddit, I'm really hoping there is good news and there is something that I can find that works similarly to Wellbutrin. 

Has anyone ever had this medication work effectively for them and then switched to something else that also works well?

Are there any supplements/medications that work like an SNRI?

Thank you

812,1,"FYI, I'm 61 M, very severe treatment resistant depression plus Idiopathic Hypersomnia. My depression is very intense: just excruciating. Depression started in high school (1970s) and I've tried decades of talk therapy (including CBT & DBT, continuing today), 70+ meds from many categories (SSRI, SNRI, Tricyclics, MAOI, off label anti-convulsants, anti-psychotics, stimulants, mood stabilizers and more.) TMS, ECT, and ketamine infusions had zero effect. Auvelity had no effect.Exercise, diet changes, many different supplements, a full spectrum light, group therapy, multiple hospitalizations all had zero effect. The only things that ever helped were meds: I currently take 40 mgs of Viibryd (helps 10-15%). In the past, Dr. Donald Klein from Columbia gave me 160 mgs of Parnate combined with 60 mgs of Adderall! Those numbers are correct, and even this risky combo helped maybe 60% and eventually wore off. I'm currently taking small doses of Adderall - which sometimes helps a lot, but at least 60% of the time makes my depression and anxiety worse. I cannot find a way to get Adderall to work predictably. I have a v good psychiatrist, but nevertheless I'm desperate for anything new. The depression makes me feel that there is no hope. So...I'm asking all you brilliant brains out there for anything new, different, even extreme, to fight this. Has anyone heard of anything happening with Helen Mayburg and DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation)? At this point I would consent to having people drill holes in my skull, but I can't find any current trials going on. It seems that DBS has fallen off the map. Apologies for this very long post, and thank you in advance for any and all responses. And for all of those suffering from this terrible illness- I Get It, I'm sorry for your pain. My heart goes out and you're Not Alone."
813,1,"
after 6 years of trials and errors, suffering terrible depression and anxiety finally found some relief.. 
But there's only one major problem i couldn't fix
My brain still not working or unavailable... 
Finally I can go out, i can talk to people, i got a job but i literally can't think or remember anything.. 
My brain just seems unavailable. 
When i try to think or remember anything i feel like there's nothing in my head just can't. 

Last time I i told the doctor and he replied that you had 6 years of major mental issues, and you just started to be normal, give brain some time to recover, but after about 1 year i still the same.. 

Just scattered brain thinking about trillion thing at the same time, with unavailable short or long memory. 

I can't focus, concentrate and having terrible motivation and fatigue.. 

Can't still stable on my chair at work for 10 minutes until i stand up again to move to do anything else. 

Im even not able to focus on something, my mind is scattered in many things. 

When i posted these a while ago on other sub i was advised to try caffeine and Tyrosine pills even dopa mucuna but surprisingly all these made me feel so tired and sleepy. 

Which turned back to me in the replies that i definitely have ADHD.. 

Saw different posts here on reddit and many forums which others had these terrible focus and concentration issues for years and tried so many medications and when they tried adhd test and tried medications they got cured from these issues.. 

The antidepressants i tried, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, Cymbalta, Bupropion. 

And now im on Clomipramine 150mg and Venlafaxine 75mg, those helped me to get out of the house and got a job but never helped me with my focus, fatigue and concentration issues.. 

I'm starting to really give up that my brain can work again. 

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist the next month but sadly he's not convinced that I have ADHD, just all these issues are because those 6 years of mental health problems.. 

He told me that i must give my brain some time to heal, but i completed 1 year atm and nothing changed til now.. 

I'm asking here as a last resort so please help me out, what shall I do, is this really ADHD I'm suffering from all these years and i was just taking the wrong medications? 

Tried to post this at ADHD sub but my post always get refused. 

I have an appointment next month with my psychiatrist, what shall I say to him and what shall I do if he refused that adhd issues

814,1,"I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one.

Like thanks that‚Äôs helpful, I would be so much happier if we did an hour of extreme anxiety inducing activity to get 2 minutes of endorphins to feel a ‚Äúmini high‚Äù, sounds like an effective treatment‚Ä¶ I remember having one doctor who actually sided with me when we started talking about it saying ‚Äúwell if he really doesn‚Äôt like exercising or any type of sports, it probably isn‚Äôt actually gonna help all that much to just force him to do it‚Äù EXACTLY!

Hello 

First of all, I‚Äôm sorry for my very french english ! 

I‚Äôm on paroxetine 20 mg and mirtazapine for 6 years, and has been quite stable since then. 
For one months, due to stress, and live things, and as I am on holidays, my mood began to decrease and I am now in a full depression episode, quite severe. 

My psychiatrist told me to increase my mirtazapine to sleep well (wich worked) and 9 days ago, I began to take 30 mg paroxetine, and  4 days ago, I up it to 40 mg. 
The fact is, I‚Äôm very upset because 1/ my anxiety has increased 2/ my depression is worst than a week ago. 
I wonder if this is just linked with the increase dosage (I had an awull exp√©rience when I began with paroxetine, anxiety have reached a level where I was unable to sit, and the only way I found to manage it was benzo), or if it is just no more working, cause I suppose i should feel a little better after 9 days. 
Offently I have xanax and take it some days when it‚Äôs unbearable, but I know it‚Äôs addictive ‚Ä¶ 

If you have any advice or experience, I am eagger to read !

816,1,"I know I just posted about this in sort of a different way but I‚Äôm asking for anyone to share their success stories of recovering from a recurrent depressive episode. 

I‚Äôve recovered from 2, so in a way, I‚Äôm my own success story. But now, I‚Äôve been stuck in my 3rd and going through changing meds (slowly) and starting therapy. Feeling hopeless and missing the days when I felt good. I know it‚Äôs just the depression, anxiety, and OCD making me feel this way but damn, it‚Äôs hard to be hopeful.

I have dysthymia, anhedonia, lack of motivation, energy, interest and pleasure.

Lifestyle changes to try:

1. Get blood tests done (please tell me all blood tests i need that might be causing depression).
2. Eating healthy
3. Sleeping well
4. Practicing gratitude
5. Exercising
6. Yoga
7. Meditation

818,1,"So, my grandmother has become a fairly explosive and reactive person throughout the years, she always worries about everything and explodes if something doesn't go right or someone upsets her. Also, she gets high blood pressure and/or arythmia because of these outbursts occasionally. I could be talking much longer about this, but long story short - i noticed a lot of anxiety in her. 

Today she went to her physician with complaints that i stated above, and the doctor prescribed mianserin to her. 

My question is would it work for her taking her cardiovascular problems into account and can physician even prescribe that stuff to her? Thank you very much."
819,1,"Really struggling with that right now. Idk how much it's being caused by depression vs other factors (ADHD and undiagnosed neurologic problem).

I've had depression (and anxiety) for over a decade. The depression has gone through multiple stages and kinda ebbs and flows. I started off being waaaay too emotional and crying at everything, to feeling incredibly neurotic and almost psychotic for brief periods, to now:  feeling emotionally numb and blunted. Even my anxiety is less intense (which I'm not complaining about...its just weird) It's like everything is numb and I'm looking through a veil. My hobbies don't interest me which before they kinda did. I find myself feeling bored a lot but at the same time not feeling like there's anything to do that would make me feel better. I don't feel happy or sad. Even on a nice day like today, normally that would put me in a good mood but nope. Nothing.

What meds worked for you guys?

I've tried Lexapro, Celexa and Cymbalta (generic versions). The first two did nothing. Maybe made me feel less neurotic but I wouldn't say I felt happy. 
Cymbalta gave me euphoria for the first two days taking it then nothing afterwards. I know it's not reasonable to expect that type of ""high"" all the time but Id at least like to feel somewhat happy. "

Now that I‚Äôm on my 3rd episode, I‚Äôm very fearful that my brain has or will become so tolerant to medication that eventually nothing will work and I‚Äôll just be doomed to live with this for the rest of my life.

822,1,"Hey guys! I have been taking a generic for Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine 100mg ER) for about ten years, and it has recently become ineffective at treating my depression symptoms. I know it‚Äôs normal for drug efficacy to wane over time like that. I‚Äôve tried one new medication, a generic for Viibryd (vilazodone 20mg) and it has been completely ineffective in treating my depression while exacerbating anxiety, causing severe and frequent panic attacks along with dramatic mood swings and sustained, uncontrollable crying. I toughed it out for about three weeks and the anxiety symptoms dissipated, but it still isn‚Äôt putting a dent in my depression. I know transitioning can be difficult, I just am wondering: if Pristiq has worked well for managing your depression, have other medications also worked well, and if so, which ones? I‚Äôm trying to do some recon in case the next medication on the docket (trintillex 10mg) is also a bust. Thanks!!"

827,1,"Found this study and immediately wanted to share it as it may just be a lifesaver for someone.. Highly recommend checking it out if you‚Äôre treatment resistant and/or you‚Äôre thinking of trying Abilify but are worried about side effects!

***TL DR basically they found that Remeron 45 mg alone vs Remeron 45 mg combined with Abilify 15 mg were both effective, but for the Remeron+Abilify group their symptoms improved faster, Abilify reduced the weight gain side effect of Remeron (!!!), and Remeron seemed to improve the possible akathisia side effect of Abilify and there were no other extrapyramidal side effects found in the Remeron+Abilify group (for example tardive dyskinesia is commonly associated with antipsychotics and many people fear taking meds like Abilify for that reason).

I find it really interesting that these two meds seem to counteract/cancel out some of the other‚Äôs worst side effects‚Ä¶ Im treatment resistant and one of my meds currently is Remeron 30 mg and the weight gain is REAL. I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of adding Abilify for so long bcuz so many people have found relief from their treatment resistant depression/anxiety by adding Abilify but ofc my frkn anxiety keeps stopping me..and one of the biggest reasons is my fear of akathisia and the restlessness potential side effects of Abilify‚Ä¶ so damn if remeron can help with that and the abilify can reduce my weight gain from remeron, and if it acc helps my depression, then it would literally be a magic combo. 
It gives me hope, so I hope it also gives any of y‚Äôall hope as wellüôèüèª

832,1,"Nothing we have tried comes close to how amazing wellbutrin was for me in giving me so much energy and feeling emotionally stable. the only thing I may have needed to add was a bit of adderall or conserta for focus.

 those meds I have tried adderall by itself, and conserta with venlafaxine and it sucks. conserta does nothing for me and adderall holds me hostage and drains the living shit out of me. venlafaxine is absolutely useless for me, I'm still on it. though I've just been on 37.5 for almost two month now. 

auvelity and fluoxitine were not helpful. I want to trust my psych but I HAVE NO ENERGY (TT . TT) it's taking way to long imo, it's been a year of working on whatever this is, I just want the energy and happiness I had on Wellbutrin.

Has anyone had any luck with adding a supplement on?"
834,1,"I've been using nicotine on and off, and lots of coffee, to self-medicate and get through a normal day (as in, not stay in bed all day and be productive). It really exacerbates my anxiety though so then I am less likley to want to go out into the world because I'm already socially anxious as it is. Oh yeah, and caffeine makes me crash pretty hard as well, so I get pretty sad in the evenings.

I'm against mind-altering prescription drugs so that's not something I wanted to consider before trying everything else. I've already tried heaps of different drugs, I was just so sick of the side effects and most of them made me feel worse anyway. I've introduced vitamin d and magnesium which I haven't felt much of a difference from (maybe just more energy and better sleep) but the rhodiola has been pretty noticeable. I've been taking it for a week on and off. When I remember to take it in the morning before coffee and breakfast, the next few hours I feel pretty productive. I think it synergises well with caffeine and it takes the anxious edge off. But not only that I genuinely feel better mood-wise after taking it. 

It's subtle. I am so used to being punched in the face by effects from psych meds that it's a totally different experience, but it's ""there"" if that makes sense. There's also no side effects. 

I take Caruso's Rhodiola. I honestly might even work out today. Which is pretty crazy since I was thinking about offing myself a week ago."

839,1,"For some background, I‚Äôm 18 years old, trans mtf, and I had begun my first semester of college when this began. I‚Äôve had depressive episodes in the past, but I could always point to causal factors, and recognize why I was depressed. In most cases it was a combination of low self esteem, feeling unfulfilled at school, and rumination. I‚Äôve worked hard to address these challenges, and when my latest episode occurred I can say that it felt like a wildly different affliction.

Last year I began my first semester of college, and it was everything I‚Äôd dreamt of. I found the material highly engaging, I was beginning to build a social circle filled with people that I enjoyed being with, I spent far less time online and began picking up hobbies, and got really engaged in rock climbing. I had never felt better or healthier.

However, in early November it felt as if the floor had completely dropped out from beneath me. I can pinpoint this down to a day or two, and it felt as if a switch flipped. There was nothing notable about this period, and no stressors that I can think of. Regardless, I felt almost completely disinterested and unengaged with everything that I had previously loved. everything was suddenly bland and gray. I continued pushing myself through the motions of each day, but I continued to feel overwhelmed by my lack of interest, motivation, or sense of reward. 

About two weeks after the onset, I began seeing a therapist in the hopes that there was something that i could work through. After many sessions of digging into my past, monitoring my emotions and thoughts throughout the day, and journaling, there was nothing to point at as a cause, and nothing that seemed to help.

Around the holidays i began taking fluoxetine/prozac, which i found to be horribly sedating and to cause intense brain fog and emotional blunting. 

I went back to school the next semester, however a combination of my depression and fluoxetine led to me being completely incapable of performing normally at school, and very nearly led to me killing myself. So around February I moved back in with my parents. 

After this, I tried attending intensive outpatient therapy, but it felt as if I had a qualitatively different type of depression than anyone else there, and I wasn‚Äôt getting much out of the program, so I left after about a month. 

I was taken off fluoxetine and put on aripriprizole/abilify, which caused insufferable night terrors. I was then put on bupropion/wellbutrin, which might have a slightly helpful effect, but could easily be placebo. I then added dextromethorphan as an adjunct to bupropion which was life changing for a week or two, but after a while was far less noticeable. I was then prescribed vilazadone/viibryd, which affected me almost exactly the same as prozac. 

Most recently I have gone off all of these medications and have begun TMS treatments, although i‚Äôve only had a few sessions so it‚Äôs too early to say if this has an effect. 

Has anyone gone through anything similar? If so, what helped you? 

Tl;dr: sudden onset depressive episode characterized by anhedonia, lack of motivation and reward processing. has been unresponsive to all drugs so far. "

Long story short.. I‚Äôve battled depression for half my life, I‚Äôm 32 now. But I‚Äôve been in a major depressive episode due to injuries/chronic pain/grief/trauma for about 2 years. The longest episode of my life.

The main ‚Äúcause‚Äù or trigger this time that brought it back was a rare urological (male reproductive part) issue/injury that had no dagnosis or treatment‚Ä¶ saw 5 urologists‚Ä¶ until recently and I am getting surgery for it in two weeks.

In the past 6 months I have had 3 attempts/hospitalizations. I feel like the pain and depression has slowly eaten away at me, just destroyed me. Feels like I lost my mind, my intelligence, memory, my personality, interests, how to socialize, relationships etc.

Tried everything and then again and then again. When pain is managed I‚Äôm okay, but they‚Äôre so deeply connected.

TMS, ECT, Ketamine, IOP treatment and every med.

I would do residential treatment but need this surgical operation. After the surgery I think I will.

Side note: also been in the process of getting off some meds bc unfortunately they have never helped long term. 
"
843,1,"I‚Äòm suffering depression and social anxiety (main course of my depression) since I was 15 (diagnosed), but tbh the symptoms were present since I was born. 

I tried over 15 meds prescribed by professionals (SSRI, SNRI, tetracyclic, tricyclic, wellbutrin and other atypicals, even 2 antipsychotics, 2 benzos etc.). I also tried 3 talk therapies (2 analytical + 1 CBT) as well as hypnosis. I tried so damn many supplements or nootropics. Nothing has helped. I really have to get back alive and a life again. I don‚Äòt want it to end. But like this I slowly die, my mental health gets worse, my physical due to it, too (not eating, drinking, moving, going out, seeing people).

In times when I don‚Äòt have no obligations like a job or seminars at university for some time that drag me out of my house I really vegetate in my bed and socially isolate myself - depression & anxiety is so extreme then, it‚Äôs no joke when I say it feels as if I would be chained to the bed and physically restricted. I don‚Äòt eat, drink enough, get no movement, don‚Äôt get outside, fresh air or see people in those times. I really just vegetate from one day into another, lonely in my bed. Right now it is one of those times - bound to bed like a wrack for almost 2 weeks again.

Even if I‚Äòve been pretty treatment-resistant so far my doc is sure my issues definitely have a biochemical source and we must find something (a missing chemical) that will finally reduce my symptoms and make life livable. I mean there‚Äòs just not a lot still to try anymore.

Maybe MAOIs (but many restrictions as diet, BP‚Ä¶) Maybe ADHD meds (I know Ritalin helped me tons when my cousin gave it to me to try but docs never wanted to test me on ADD before they didn‚Äòt treat my depression & anxiety, quite some nonsense). Maybe other benzos (I only tried diazepam & lorazepam, maybe these just were the wrong pick?). Maybe psychedelics (but I can‚Äôt tell I‚Äôm ever in the right state of mind to be sure to get a safe good and no bad trip - I mean, I already get bad anxiety and panic from weed/THC). Maybe Ketamine therapy or rTMS etc?

What substance (may it be a prescription drug, illicit, supplement, nootropic, herb, RC or whatever) decreased your anxiety and shyness and improved your mood, energy and drive to get out and socialize, your sociability and talkativeness? 

I finally want a normal life! I finally have to be able to live and have a normal life because soon my Master‚Äòs degree ends and then I have to get back to work again, also finally want to find a love, create new friendships and family.

I would really be so thankful for any help or suggestions!"
844,1,"I do my best everyday. I try to stick to a healthy sleeping schedule, somedays my schedule get disrupted when I can't sleep, or get sick. I drink water to keep myself hydrated.

I do little exercises every now and then (this is the most I can muster at this point).

Then COVID happened, and I had to retreat back to my homeplace called Sarawak in Malaysia. I never recovered. I had jobs where I suffered performance punishment, I was starving to save money, toxic workplace, yet I managed to get by everyday. Now I'm currently unemployed with no career prospect in the only field I knew I have a chance in.

It's difficult. I almost put myself on a level playing field. Get a career, live a normal life. But I don't have enough strength, and always get pushed back to the hole I tried to crawl out of, figuratively and literally."
845,1,"Im switching from 30mg olanzapine to 15mg Fluanxol because I‚Äôm tired of the weight gain, sedation and low libido. It‚Äôs classified as a partial atypical so I‚Äôm wondering if my anxiety and depression will still be under control."
846,1,"Since many mood stabilisers and anti-seizure drugs have rather unique mechanism and properties that can modulate neurotransmitters that are associated with depression that includes medications such as low dose lithium, lamotrigine, gabapetin, low dose valproate acid and riluzole. I am therefore wondering what has been your experience with them when treating major unipolar depression."

So, as I did remission of depression by TMS treatment with 30days I started living normally and happy again. At the same time I was on 200mg of sertraline and 150mg of sulpiride.  That happened in february.

In april girl broke our relationship and that kiled me, i was broken, but I didnt want to go for more antidepressants just becuase someone left me. Even its a harsh thing I found my way how to handle it.  In mean time doktor prescribed me quetiapine 50mg morning 50mg evening. 

After all, in may/june/july started everything while I was sleeping, I had scary scenes, vivid dreams, dreams where i m going to kill myself, where I put so much pressure on myself.

Therapist said, it will pass. and it mostly did.
But therapist said, you re looking good, you re wotking, you are studying, you re playing guitar, you are funkcional and organized so ehy should not put you on smaller dose, and I was like: lets go. Why should I stay on higher does for long time or forever. 

So wr did we cut 150mg sulpiride to 0mg
we cut from 200mg sertraline to 150mg
we cut daily dose of quetiapine (100mg)

So all these three changes are good, but big changer, but still I embieve it will not be big withdrawal. 

BUT, idea came to my mind, wait wait, why should not do another rTMS treatment 30 aplications.
And so, today were to hospital and created consultations. We have deal, that I will have inauguration talk with doctor, and I will show him fom my last treatments how they afects me - they afects me better than many antidepressants. And of course I will show him whole documentation, and said about dreams, OKP on rasing actually, no depression, but ptsd-anxiety,

So i will show them statistics of last session, and they will through that see that I had good answer on TMS, and everything will go on.

Any questions, just ask."

Hi, so my new psychiatrist refuses to find the correct medication for me and stocked with the old ones that‚Äôs not fully working. He said I don‚Äôt have bipolar so meds will never fix me. I kept asking and he said what would I recommend I said latuda and he said that‚Äôs for bipolar. I told him I took this for a year before and he said I don‚Äôt know why they gave it to you. Anyways I asked him to go back on my chart history and find a med that worked for my current symptoms. He told me to do research and come with some med suggestions. Can someone help me?

I also been successful with a antidepressant +anxiety med+mood stabilizer 

I already take bupropion and gabapentin but I don‚Äôt know which mood stabilizer would work with these meds to help my depression, impulsivity, and intense emotions where I feel like I‚Äôm going to die.

Any help? Thank you "
850,1,"Tricyclics such as clomipramine and imipramine have greater therapeutic effect sizes than SSRIs. Combination therapy with tricyclics can be very effective, as is impressively demonstrated by the well-known combination of SSRI + nortriptyline. There is a risk of overdose, but this can be mitigated by only partially dispensing the tablets.

Irreversible non-selective MAOIs (Parnate, Nardil, Marplan) are probably the antidepressants with the highest response rate and the largest effect sizes, but psychiatrists are very reluctant to prescribe them.

Problems such as tyramine are no longer as big a problem in our modern eating world as they were 50 years ago. The tyramine pressor response can be significantly minimized with the addition of an NRI. Dangerous interactions are indeed a problem, but with the princely salaries of psychiatrists, one can expect them to thoroughly educate and instruct their patients in this regard.

Side effects are relative and different for all groups of antidepressants. With SSRIs it is mainly libido problems, dopamine deficiency problems and gastrointestinal problems, with tricyclics it is dry mouth, constipation and weight gain, with MAOIs the side effects are often more diversified.

In any case, the aim cannot be to torture patients permanently with SSRIs and turn them into soulless drones."
851,1,"Current meds:
Propranolol 20mg (one in the morning and one at night)
Lamictal 50mg (in the morning)
Clonazepam 1mg (one in the afternoon one at night)
Effexor 150mg (afternoon)

I take propranolol for high blood pressure, Lamictal for suicidal thoughts, clonazepam for anxiety, and Effexor for depression.

I‚Äôve been on this combo since September (just upped my Effexor to 150 from 75)

Ever since I‚Äôve been exhausted. I could sleep all day. I fall asleep the second I hit the pillow, I take multiple naps in a day sometimes. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the timing of the meds because I‚Äôm tired at all times of day. I took Effexor years ago and wasn‚Äôt this tired. I don‚Äôt feel anything from the clonazepam at this point, just avoiding withdrawal. Can a low dose of Lamictal be the cause?

Is there a better timing for these to make me less tired?

I should also mention that I started Lamictal and Effexor at the same time and was very ill for weeks and it ruined my appetite. I eat very little now, though I have been eating more lately after I started smoking weed again. I drink about a quart or more of coffee a day, no effect but caffeine has never made me feel awake. I have ADHD but I can‚Äôt take medication for it (it‚Äôll cause urinary retention for me on my current regimen). I used to go to bed by 11 and wake up at 8 but was still exhausted and napping so now I stay up later because I figure I‚Äôm tired either way, might as well get extra time. "

853,1,"Hi everyone,I‚Äôm looking for some advice and shared experiences. I was prescribed Zoloft (sertraline) two months ago and have been taking it at varying dosages. Unfortunately, I had to stop taking it abruptly due to severe gastrointestinal side effects, including persistent vomiting and what seems to be gastritis.Here‚Äôs a bit more context:Duration and Dosage: I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for about 2 months, with the dosage varying over this period.Side Effects: The main issue has been severe gastrointestinal problems. Despite trying to manage these side effects, they‚Äôve persisted and significantly impacted my daily life.Decision to Stop: Based on advice from my doctors, I stopped taking Zoloft abruptly because the side effects were unbearable.I‚Äôm particularly concerned about potential withdrawal symptoms and whether I might experience any long-term effects from stopping the medication so suddenly. Has anyone else had to stop Zoloft abruptly? What was your experience like? How did you manage any withdrawal symptoms?Additionally, has anyone else experienced severe GI side effects from Zoloft, and if so, how did you handle it? Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.Thank you!"
854,1,I have to work. I go to work everyday I shower I do house chores but I still do not find joy or motivation. I wish I just find a way to find more motivation and joy in things I do. For example when I draw or color. Sometimes music helps to feel more energetic but most of the days its just hard to just get out of bed dress and go to work. 
855,1,"Was on 150mg effexor which was brilliant, but not quite enough. Upped it to 225mg and felt much better, but my heart rate and blood pressure skyrocketed. So after 4 weeks my doctor reversed course. 

Went up to 45mg Mirtazapine but the same thing happened, so they made me quit after 4 weeks. 

Tried 150mg Zoloft for 3 weeks before they made me quit. 

Now they said I can either go back to effexor or try cymbalta. 

I wasn't even on a beta blocker or statins when my symptoms were happening. I had a little dizziness and nihilism/lack of motivation, but that was just autistic burnout and realising that I'll probably never be able to work at a major tech company in my condition. (My family all have high blood pressure and cholesterol, so that's just a genetic thing. Diet and exercise doesn't affect it at all)

Also have suspected ADHD, so I think getting those meds next year (long waiting list) would help. Effexor completely eliminated my anxiety and depression to the point where I was basically normal. 

Is there anything I can say to my doctors or medicine I can take so that I can be on higher doses of effexor etc? Or should I try cymbalta? Or should I just stick to 150mg effexor and accept my limitations?"
856,1,"I've been struggling with depression since I was 16. I'm (31/f) and have constant thoughts of suicide. I work , I am social, I have a good support system but cannot shake my brain from looping thinking. I'm active with social events and take time for nature and myself. I've done research and so many have terrible side effects getting on and off and then don't help anyways. I have anxiety which then leads me to these thoughts. Seeking advice. SSRIs have not worked for me in the past. Thank you for your input.

857,1,"So I've been struggling with mental health issues since I was a teenager and have never been able to to adequately treat them. I've been through multiple courses of CBT, several SSRIs or other antidepressants, an antipsychotic, and eventually lamotrigine which did ""help"" but in hindsight not in a very productive way, then it pooped out on me.

I did my own research on my options for further medication and became interested in MAOIs, especially moclobemide as it has so few side effects and is considered quite gentle (drug induced hypomania has been a problem for me in the past).

I should make clear that I really think moclobemide is doing the heavy lifting here, but when I ran out of the supplements I was already taking, I noticed my response to it decreased. I was taking some of these supplements before moclobemide, and I'd say out of them, ALCAR and lithium aspartate had the most obvious beneficial effect, but it wasn't enough.

I added the supplements back in and began to feel the synergy effect again, so I thought I'd post here for anyone interested. I judge the success of this protocol by it being the only time in 10 years I've been motivated to improve my life, start going to the gym, producing music again, reading again, quitting alcohol and drugs, and all without any sign of the kind of hypomania I was worried about (so far). Currently coming up to 10 weeks in.

AM:

- 600mg moclobemide 

- High quality multivitamin (Vegetology)

- Omega-3 DHA & EPA (Vegetology)

- Vitamin D3 2500iu

- Methylated B-complex

- ALCAR 500mg

- 5g creatine in a breakfast smoothie with total 100g protein, with fruits and leafy greens

PM:

- Lithium aspartate (5mg elemental Li+)

- Zinc 25mg + Selenium 200ug

- NAC 600mg

- Magnesium glycinate 1500mg

Thrice weekly AM:

- 1.25mg selegiline sublingually

Now some of these (omega-3, D3, creatine, zinc) are mostly for weight lifting and testosterone purposes. The magnesium is mostly for sleep, but doesn't help a whole lot anymore. Some things I may remove, possibly the methylated B-complex as I notice the least help from it, even some anxiety if I take the suggested two tablets. Mostly for lifting purposes I'm also gonna add a bone health supplement with K2 and calcium. I'm also wondering if I need to add copper and/or iodine, both because I'm gonna have a gap with no multivitamin for a month (which contains both), to help avoid copper depletion from the zinc or thyroid issues from the lithium. The low dose selegiline is for improving lethargy which can be caused by the high moclobemide dose but I'm probably gonna ditch it and see how I feel without it. I've also used ubiquinol and ALA in the past but not sure whether to bother adding them back.

Any thoughts / feedback on this and my ideas regarding adding / removing things? I try to stick to non-herbal supplements which have at least some degree of evidence behind them, and as I say I really think the moclobemide with a synergy effect from the lithium and ALCAR is really doing most of the work here."
858,1,"I've been using it for two weeks now. All sadness, dumb self-defeating thoughts and apathy have been substituted for a total state of peace, productivity and willingness to socialize with people around me.

859,1,"Hello there, I am an 18 years old Italian student suffering from treatment-resistant depression. I've had prescribed to me citalopram, bupropion, vortioxetine and more recently amisulpride. To my surprise since I had lost almost all of my hope to find a solution, the Amisulpride worked perfectly. It completely erased my depression on every aspect. For now I take 50 mg daily with also 10 mg of vortioxetine which, after talking to my Psychiatric, we decided to remove the latter and just leave it Amisulpride
While I'm extremely happy with the situation I'm in right now, I was also pretty curious of this substance' interaction with other chemicals. My Psychiatric told me that the Amisulpride reduces dopamine levels only at higher doses, while at lower dosages like the one I'm taking, it acts as a dopamine ""booster"".
That left me quite surprise because I had the idea that antipsychotics tend to block the D2 receptor and that's why you shouldn't drink alcohol while on them, or that they deminish or completely remove the effects of many drugs, like some psychedelics or stimulants.
So that's where my question stands: would the Amisulpride im taking at this dosage 50mg block the effects of various substances? Would it potentiate them instead? If so could that lead to negative outcomes like for example serotonin syndrome or other unpleasant or even dangerous situations?

Thanks for the patience, I hope this is the right sub to ask this lol"
