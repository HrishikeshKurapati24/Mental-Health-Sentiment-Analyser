1,3,"Hello all,

I am really struggling recently. I have outbursts of anger recently so bad that I yell at my own family at the slightest mistakes and inconveniences. It really affects them and affects me.

I get tension headaches and I can't manage it well without feeling the need to yell. It gets to the point where I can't even stand noise or anyone near me without getting unreasonably mad. When my mum cries or goes through depressive episodes, I get angry. When my brother makes the tiniest mistake or doesn't understand me, I get angry.

What can I do to stop this, I try breathing exercises and trying to calm down but it only stops the next day and then gets back up throughout. "
2,3,"I’m angry at everything in my life, and if someone says that everything happens for a reason, I’m about to throw hands to whoever says those things because that shit ain’t that helpful to be honest, I have such intrusive thoughts that I could k1ll everyone because again, humans are ruthless insensitive fucks of the society. There’s no good in the world and all they do is be psychopaths or be blinded by a psychopath.

I truly think they deserve to disappear with no remorse and no regrets. I truly think that whatever I say is true and humans are pieces of nuisance fucks  with no brains whatsoever. I hope the world gets to live better without these living apes in the society. "
3,3,"So sadly due to how my life went (structural bullying, abuse, gaslighting... you name it) I've always had a lot of reasons to be angry. Thing is, being the 2M tall tree that I am, just raising my voice makes people label me as an aggressor. Even if all I try to do is stand up to myself. 

Due to my dad (the stable parent after the divorce) going out of his way to deny any emotion other than joy, and the entirety of my teens having been coping, mostly; I've not really been given the best 101 in dealing with emotions like anger or sadness. And now, at 34, I have a military arms depot worth of anger stored up somewhere deep inside, that wants to go off like a Texan on the 4th of Juli. Meanwhile I'm just trying to live a peaceful pacifist life, which is getting increasingly difficult. 

I'd really like to make work of my anger issues, not just by containing it (which I've been managing pretty solidly so far, if I say so myself), but by actually shoveling as much shit as I can. Thing is, I don't really know how. And let's say for the sake of conversation that my access to therapy is next to nonexistent. I did already have decent success with self help material in other fields, so I really hope I can too with anger. 

So; Do you lot know any good resources that can help me clear out my anger issues and deal with my past so I can be clear headed in the present? I'd love to hear about books/casettes/podcasts, especially the self help kind. I'm also curious about adequate subreddits or other places where to best ask questions. Anecdotes and insights are also welcome. 

Thanks in advance\~!"
4,3,"I'm not much
I'm not broken
I just exist..
Family token

They make me so angry
Make me want to disappear 
Hiding in a pantry
Where no one comes near

Already alone
No support to report
My heart's like a stone
Only open to ""anger-import""

But one day I'll crack
The monster won't be held
Yell or k¡ll over a snack
It's the storm I've been compelled"
5,3,"As a teenager. I’ve barely lived. And to know that there is a chance MY life can be taken from me so quickly all because of some fall out between leaders who can’t get over themselves and talk it out like ADULTS. 

War is dreadful. And we know it.
They know it.
You and I know it.
Everyone knows it.

So to see , to look around at life , to look around my room and think what to pick first before I run to survive. To know all this could disappear and become ruins of my home which held MY LIFE. To be nothing anymore. Because what? We haven’t learnt our lesson? We haven’t learnt to co-exist. 

I thought school would teach these snobs that civility is what saves you from this cr-p. 

Just a word from a teenager. Living in the U.K. FUCK YOU. FUCK THE GOVERNMENT. Let me live."
6,3,"I get angry very quickly, especially when I have an anxiety attack, and the consequences are always faced by my family – the only people in my life who truly care for me. I try my best to stay happy around them, but whenever my anxiety is triggered, I break down in tears, and it eventually turns into anger.

I don’t want to hurt them, but I feel helpless. I can’t even afford therapy because I’m currently unemployed. My father, mother and sister are the only ones i have. I don't want to loose them. I really need help i don't know what to do..."
7,3,"I constantly have this mindset when people tell me what to do, I get so angry, I just think “I don’t HAVE to do anything” or “I’ll do it when I’m ready” it just pisses me off getting orders, it makes me just want to leave and do things on my own, I like doing things my way, like seriously, if I wanna eat some food I’ll eat food, if I wanna do this I’ll do it, it especially winds me up when people say stop doing this stop doing that, like eating when I wanna eat ffs, people just piss me off. "
8,3,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I need help.

Long story short I had a rough day and was on call with my partner, he sends me a game pigeon game (little iMessage games like cup pong, battleship, Pool/8-ball, etc.) and I lost, then I lost again. We played a different game, I lost again and again.  We played one final game, I lost again and again. 

I got so angry, I told I’m fucking deleting it and never playing it with him again, we sat in silence for a solid 5 minutes before he hung up and just texted me goodnight. He responded to some of my reels I sent him like 20 minutes afterwards and commented on them. I apologized but he hasn’t  responded so we will see how that goes. 

But the issue still remains that I’m a SUPER COMPETITIVE PERSON with BAD ANGER ISSUES. Not to the point of breaking objecting but I will punch myself hard in the face or scream into a pillow if I go on a bad enough losing streak. My parents were both angry and emotional people so that definitely doesn’t help. I’m so easily rage baited by my friends it’s getting to a point where I just want to cry.  

But I’ve had such a bad history with game pigeon in specific as I can never win in most of the games except one or two sometimes. It genuinely infuriates me beyond belief as I’ve beaten WAY harder games than stuff like 8-ball on my iPhone (one of the games I lost twice in a row at in a span on 5 mins) but yet I CAN NEVER WIN and it drives my crazy.

I feel like I’m going insane. "
9,3,"25M. I feel like I'm constantly taken advantage of. Recently I got into a fender bender -my fault- it was a weird intersection where you have to crane your neck almost all the way around to see oncoming traffic. The car in front of me started moving, so I idled forward while looking at oncoming traffic and found out the hard way that the car that was in front of me didn't get very far. There was no visible damage to either car, and nobody was hurt, but after she was done screaming at me, the older lady who was driving called the police, filed a claim with her insurance, and now I found out she's suing. I know my insurance can handle the whole thing but it just makes me so angry I want to hurt someone. She wasn't hurt and her property wasn't damaged, why does she have to try to gouge me like this?

And this isn't the only example. I have a home warranty company that screwed us over last year and bailed on a claim they should have fulfilled, but unless I want to take legal action which would have been extremely costly, there's nothing I can do.
I've had bosses who treat me like an actual slave they can walk all over. 

It even extends to little things, I have a friend who constantly disagrees and argues with everything I say but never gets too far out of line to where I really feel justified in getting openly pissed off at him. It's always just little arguments that build up over time. We're in the same friend group and he's not a bad guy, I'm just always on edge around him. 

On paper my life isn't really that bad. But I just have this constant boiling anger that derives from feeling helpless in all of the above scenarios. Everyone just seems so uncaring and selfish. It's at the point where I think about hurting people who cut me off in traffic. I have no good outlet for these feelings and it just makes me want to hurt someone. If someone ever got violent with me I would probably either lose the fight or kill them. I don't like feeling this way and I know it's not healthy."
10,3,"For context: I [M23] have always been an introverted person at heart. I don't find it difficult to start conversations with others, but it usually never developes into anything more than an aquaintance at best. I didn't have many close friends growing up, but I used to have two friends I always considered my best friends until I cut them out of my life almost two years ago, because I felt like our friendship only hurt me as I felt like I put a lot more energy into maintaining our friendship than they did.

Friendships in Germany work a little different, because people are more secluded and most people make new friends or find partners through their own friend circle. But I don't have that kind of friend circle, because the closest people I would consider my friends are either just as introverted as I am or don't want to hang out, despite me suggesting to do something together.

I go to university, but I'm in a pretty high semester and most people already have formed cliques so I also lost out on that opportunity. I have a clique that I'm in, but sometimes it feels more like they tolerate me in their group instead of wanting me to be there, because I never write with anyone of them privately outside our clique WhatsApp, except for one with whom I exchange memes on Instagram every few days. It doesn't help that my university is a 90 minute drive with public transports and tram systems, so I couldn't really participate in many uni activities. I also work 8 hours a week, but because my scedule is pretty full this semester and with the amount of time I spend on transport I'm forced to work on Saturdays, which impedes my ability to socialize further. I'm working at the cash register at a supermarket, which means I also don't really communicate with my co-workers a lot and even if I could, most of them are also way older than I am.

I do have hobbies, I work out and play in a band. But I don't feel comfortable talking to people at the gym, because I might become an inconveniance to them if I try to socialize with them. I've been at the same gym for 3 years, because it's the closest branch to me that I can ride a bike to without having to rely on public transport, but I just never happened to befriend anyone there. As for my band, the people are nice, but I run into the same age problem that I run into at work, where everyone is at least 10 years older than me.

And lately it just started to affect me a lot more than usual. I feel so alienated and alone, especially when I see others outside talking with their friends in person or when I'm at work and other people are socializing with their friends or partners. And whenever I see people having more fun than me, I just start to fume inside, because I don't have any friends to socialize with like that. And the thought of my current situation and how I'm just unable to change anything about it or even talk about it with anyone just makes me boil inside even harder!

I have considered seeking therapy, but I've heard from someone who just wanted to do a general check up that the wait can already take more than a year, because our healthcare system is just that strained. It just feels like a lot of pressure to hold onto and I'm just exhausted at that point. I want things to change, but I don't know how. Please help."
11,3,"My partner gets really upset whenever I raise my voice. He says I get angry and am raising my voice, but I don't even realize it nor do I think I am angry. I do it whenever I'm annoyed or frustrated. 

For example, if I ask a question, he will answer with confidence. However, he will answer with such confidence but with a different interpretation of the question, and I get frustrated because it will take me explaining like 3 or 4 times before he understands the question. I never have this problem of miscommunicating with anyone else, but he just never understands me. Or I will get annoyed at messes around the house and will berate him in an irritated tone. And afterwards, I just bounce back to being happy, but he gets deeply affected and stays sad for a couple hours.   
  
My family all have similar problems with voice control, so when he goes to my house he gets upset. I think he is more sensitive to this than my family who are pretty used to it (parents would fight a lot and my siblings all have similar irritated voices, but we would all just ignore whoever is annoyed until they stop). I'm not really sure how to start reducing it without having to pay for therapy. I'm starting meditating in the mornings, but its really difficult in the heat of the moment because I don't even identify that my voice/feeling is getting heated until I see that he is quiet. And I know I need to make effort to fix this because this happens multiple times a week, and I want to stop making him upset."
12,3,"There's this anger I've had my whole life. I think it's  genetic, from my dad (who I never really knew before he passed away), as my mom tells me he had the exact same intense anger (no violence, as a clarification). I get so stuck and rigid in my thinking. I can get so upset I literally freeze up. At the same time I've felt that I could control it in public. It would only show up at home, like when I got mad at a particularly hard part of a video game. I would try over and over and over until I got it, because I just couldn't calm down until I beat the challenge that pissed me off. For a long time, the anger wasn't a particular problem in my life, just something that showed up from time to time.

Now, for a litany of reasons, I'm very depressed. I can neither feel nor see any particular reason to be alive, short of the fact that something in my brain always stops just short of actually wanting to kill myself. I just want to regress into nothing. For a long time, I've had no particular passion, goals, or anything substantial I want out of life. I feel no fear over being homeless even if I understand I would be unbearably miserable if I was, maybe because I've been too privileged to ever truly know that kind of pain. I live at home, despite me resisting the idea because I felt I'd regress more, and I literally want to be punished and forcibly kicked out.

Getting back to the anger, it feels like it consumes me now. In the past, I knew I shouldn't take my anger out on others, and I also shouldn't break or damage things either, so I think it transformed in my teen years into taking it out on myself. I can still be angry at other people, but I don't usually let it all out. All the violent impulses I get I repress, and when they do come out they manifest as hurting myself in some way. Hitting my head, arm, leg, or gut seems to redirect the overwhelming emotions. It feels like it calms me down for a split second as I feel the physical pain instead. I don't always even register it as anger, it's just anytime something upsets me or bothers me in some way.  I physically tense up and now I just can't move. I yell and scream and feel actual pain from how overwhelming it is, as I contort myself in bed as if I'm possessed until I break down crying. I feel like I'm going insane. Yet it basically never happens around other people. Instead I avoid everyone. It feels like I'm faking it, the way I socially monitor myself. The underlying anger just comes out as irritation and rudeness which isn't always deserved. I notice it and how it's changed my personality.

I know that I'm stubborn. I know that when something upsets me, it feels too ""wrong"" to let it go. I've been like that since I was a preschooler. I need to have it my way or I will actively harm myself or my own interests out of spite. It's this part of me that doesn't want to change. I know that for all the problems in my life, and all the solutions such as therapy or medication or new habits, the first and most important step is actively wanting to change. But there is an overwhelming part of myself that wants to be miserable. That would rather be miserable and hold true to my beliefs than do anything. It could be because of a lack of passion or goals, pure apathy, stubbornness, laziness, or any number of armchair-psychologist reasons, but the fact is I take some self-pitying pleasure from being in pain and its more comfortable than change.

On the bright side, maybe that stubbornness shows I do have some desire in life. Even if it's for arbitrary, stupid things, I still want my agency to make the world around me how I see fit, and I won't stop until it's achieved. At times, that anger was what drove me to do rather substantial goals in my life. Now, its over things I acknowledge are petty. I ruin a nice cut of meat, that's money and food wasted, it should have never been ruined in the first place. I get a scratch or dent on my electronics, I can't take my focus off it, it eats at me, just being a bit more careful would've avoided this. Even worse if its someone else's fault, so I don't want anybody touching my stuff. I would get like this in the past, but it's only gotten more extreme and anal.

It all ties up with my anxiety and body-dysmorphia/OCD, but I won't get into all that here. The point being I feel like I can't handle life. Everything upsets me. Everything is a potential trigger. It makes it difficult to perform daily life functions. As my previous therapist told me, my stress tolerance has been worn down so low that I can't handle anything. The only solution is to build it back up, but then I have to deal with more stress. I have to deal with getting upset more times and somehow finding willpower in myself to approach it differently. I dunno if I can do that or for what reason to do it besides avoiding pain. I'm tired of how I feel. I want to shut out the world and stop caring. I ""care"" too much. It's what gets me angry, and it's too painful to keep facing. I'm upset right now over a banal thing when I've far more pressing issues I should think about. With that comes all the irritation, anger, pain, and crying, and I just want it to stop.

I guess I'll end with the question: How do you let go of anger? How do you let go of the nagging feeling something wrong needs to be made right?"
13,3,"I suppose its because of my deteriorated mental state that happened in the last few months  
but i've really become indifferent and irritated at the presence of my online friends

Whenever i get a dreaded dm, i scream, mock their text or bash my keyboard  
as if my tolerance at their common behaviors that i would usually not mind or laugh off suddenly become the top 10 things i hate  
I feel incredibly disgusted and entitled even though the reality is... Nothing is happening  
The person on the other side just wants to hangout, just wants to talk, speaks their mind  
Yet for some reason i dont even wanna bother with them, i explode towards them behind the screen.

Because really, these people i know are actually fun and nice people to hang around with, they were friends who i have bonded with in the past, and still find enjoyment with from time to time. the exception being when i am bothered.

I can't pick at what's wrong with me and what other things i can do. Its making me insane and insecure.

Dont even get me onto therapy, its really not something i can do.  
and about being able to choose my actions, i havent really swore at anyone and said mean things (yet?)  
i still remain respectful but its destroying my sanity,  
even when i try to express things like my ""boundaries"" and needed ""space""  


"
14,3,"hey so this is my first time posting anything, its a throwaway account too, i just felt very helpless with my thoughts and thought i might as well hear some other people's thoughts on this as well cuz im so clueless. i wrote the text below when i was quite mad so its gonna sound very aggressive and all over the place; it is quite the rant so idk if anyone will read it all but oh well here goes nothing:

< why the ever-living fuck does everything about my mom piss me off to an unreasonable point?! Like holy fucking shit every interaction we have I snap and say and do horrible things and she's right in saying that I have no right to do all that but it's just when she does literally anything I wanna yell and just like ugh please shut the fuck up! I don't fucking know why I'm like this! FUCK I'm not even like this with my dad who I openly hate! Why the fuck can my mom piss me off so fucking well recently? Like in the past year and a half? Bro what the actual fuck is this. Literally everytime I'm with her I wanna rip my hair out; every single thing she does gets on my nerve I fucking can't anymore. I've been trying to type ""but I love her"" like 5 times now when writing this but I can't cuz idk if I do right now. That's fucked up cause she's the one person who has never done me any wrong. Fuck me. All my life she's been perfect - her words have been my way of life, and I've never done anything she hasn't told me to do. I've always believed that she is my deity, and that every word she says is the only truth about life and literally everything. But over the past couple years, like around one and a half years ago, I've been starting to notice that the things she says are not things I hold as dearly and value as much, as if her words have lost value. Things that I would before  say are ""how the world is because she says so"" now approach me off of the other end, as in ""your view and word is so fucking wrong that it pisses me off to even look at you anymore."" I have no clue where this shift suddenly took place, maybe because I got older and got into my elder teenage years (16 and 17) and went through severe emotional turmoils and hardships (such as the ib diploma program and many relationship issues with friends that brought me to the lowest of my points in life at times); I believe that in a way, having experienced these hardships kind of made me arrogant?? So now I think that MY way and MY word is the only word, and if I feel that hers is even the slightest bit incorrect, I get SUPER fucking pissed off and call her off instantly. So she hasn't changed as a person, but I have come to know that I also have the ability to make decisions and have correct views about the world since I felt strong and validated after having endured through those hardships. But all that resulted in me now hating every bit of her for some odd fucking reason and I don't know what the fuck to do, I don't wanna hate her, she's my mom and is doing her best, I just feel fucking horrible every time and it's not just been once or twice that I've lashed out at her but SO MANY TIMES, she's confronted me about it and I've agreed that I need to stop, but I didn't feel like my rage and irritation went away after having agreed that my behaviour was unacceptable. Pair all that with my constant avoidant behaviour due to the fear of never being enough, and I think we've got quite the issue here. It might even be the sense of me having followed her exact words and footsteps for so long that I low-key consider myself to be perfectly in tune with her, but having gone through life and puberty has caused me to develop a novel sense of self that is, in fact, NOT in tune with her because we are simply different people, and us not being in tune is throwing me off so much that whenever she does or says anything that I personally wouldn't do or say myself, I get SUPER irritated and pissed off, almost as if this whole relationship depends on us being the exact same all the freaking time. I think that I don't see her as a person, I see myself as an extension of her, but we are not the same person or have the same personality, and the more time I spend with her the more it becomes obvious that we are not the same, and I don't think I know how to live with that yet, because it means that I need to start being my own person completely and ditch everything I've been for, quite literally, my whole life, and that's really terrifying. Maybe that's it?? Honestly, now that I think about it, for the entirety of my younger teenage years I have been an exact replica of my mother, personality wise (except obviously not to the point where it was obvious, I clearly had distinguishable traits), but I have changed a lot since then and the timing of that change is perfectly synchronized with how our relationship started spiraling downwards. >

yup so thoughts and even prayers lol are appreciated! im so lost"
15,3,"I'm short. I'm physically not intimidating. I'm apparently funny, but I think it's people refusing to register that I'm serious about the supposedly absurd things that I say. 

I could yell about being frustrated. I could swear a thousand times over. I can get mad at someone who isn't my ""friend"" and my ""friend"" would support me, root for me, and egg me on. Sometimes they'll even get me to attack someone they don't like and I'll do it because I'm protective like that. 

Until I get angry at said ""friend"" for not recognizing all of what I think are obvious signs of anger and frustration (saying ""this is frustrating, why don't we leave"" is obvious isn't it) and pushing too much. 

And then there's yelling. And then said ""friend"" feels betrayed. What did they think would happen? 

And then I'm alone again.

I'm so tired of this cycle. How do I communicate that I'm mad and make it blatantly obvious before it's too late. "
16,3,"I dont hate myself and i dont want to die, but my violence is turning inward at me because i cant release it on someone else. all the things i want to do to someone i suddenly want to do to myself, it balances it out so that i dont hurt them. i want to jump from space and mangle my body and tear my skin off, i jumped out of a car recently cus of this. like its literally the exact same thing as wanting to mangle someone else but just at me, no self hatred, no suicidal thoughts, i just want to get beat and beat and beat and beat and beat and beat and beat until i have 80 joints in every part of my body. nothing works, nothing will calm me down, i have never calmed down once i get really mad, i usually pass out after a few hours of rampaging (been a while since that happened). im just a bunch of cogs that eat everything you try to throw in them so you cant stop it. when i had those really bad ones i had to hurt someone to snap out of it or either pass out, there was no other way out. there are no warning signs inside me, literally none. people always say to catch anger before it can get to that level but there are not any signs. and its impossible for people to understand how much anger there is, no matter how many times i try and explain it they just say deep breathing or ground yourself. it wont work, its like there are metaphysical hands reaching out with strings attached to my real arms just telling me to do something. it is past the statue of limitations now but when i was ten i spent 2 hours, headbutting, biting, scratching kicking, just anything i could do, i was in handcuffs (it was a cop, i dont think im tough, the reasonable thing to do in his position was tase me or shoot me) and the ambulance took forever to get there. Feels like the only way i can solve this is being away from everyone. No matter how much i stress how bad it is people just cant feel or understand what I'm saying, including therapists and i have been to 20, i dont know how much more i can express it, its like speaking to a wall."
17,3,"I'm 19 and am living with my parents for the summer, before I move back to college. Friends describe me as upbeat but quiet, and my parents see me as kind but anxious. 

For most of my teenage life I had intense crying spells that were intense and had no seeming buildup, but they were paired with extremely negative and disturbing thoughts. Since late in my senior year of highschool (I'm now approaching my 2nd year in college), these crying spells are most often paired with outbursts of rage. 

During these outbursts it's hard to think coherently, and I usually end up screaming into a pillow, hitting myself, and biting my arms. I'm fully aware it sounds like I'm describing a child's tantrum, but in the moment it's all very impulsive. afterwards I have the crying spells I'm used to, but with more shame. For the past few months they've gotten particularly worse, and take up hours of my day with each outburst when they're in full. It also becomes difficult for me to remember what happened earlier in the day and how the time passed.

I make a point not to bother anyone else with this, my friends and family have never seen my outbursts, but my parents have commented on my agitation beforehand and the quietness I get after. I'm not sure who to confide in this about, if anyone, but I'm concerned that this won't go away considering how long it's been an issue."
18,3,"Does anyone else struggle with PTSD related nightmares? I’ve had a plethora of different traumatic events happen so I’ll have a bad dream or wake up with “what if” feelings, like how could I have changed the trauma and the only conclusions I can come to are there was absolutely nothing I could have done to change it, and that’s the honest truth. Choosing another path would have only led to a different more complex set of traumas at the time. My issue is this is a really crappy way to start my day and leads to be being in fight or flight mode all day. When I see a normal human I think they are out to get me which makes anger outbursts more likely to happen. I think if I could reroute my scared thoughts in the morning it would set my days up to be much more peaceful. "
19,3,"For as long as I can remember I’ve always felt anger. There is almost always a trigger but sometimes I struggle with feeling just irritable in general. 
I am on medication for my anxiety and depression. I have also been to therapy ( many different types of therapy too) 
I have learnt that anger is a secondary emotion- as in, you only feel anger as a result of another emotion e.g sadness, jealousy, resentment ect ect..
I have been through a lot of ,what I would call, emotional distress in my life. What happened to make me feel the distress in question is irrelevant as I still felt/feel how I felt/feel.

No matter what treatment I go through, how much I sit and try and work through things on my own, or even talk about things openly I always feel angry. Weather that be at myself or others. However, I hate hurting people , I can’t stand hurting peoples feelings. So I don’t lash out at people if they have done me wrong , which would be expected considering the amount of anger I feel, I just end up letting the anger consume me. Sometimes it makes me hold grudges against people and other times it turns inwards and I end up hurting my own mental and emotional health. 
In the rare case I do release my anger out on someone who has hurt me , I almost black out. I say horrible & terrible things. I’m not physically violent but I am verbally abusive. And I cannot even remember what I’ve said after I’ve had one of these “blackouts”

This is no excuse for my behaviour. Trust me, I hate myself for it and I’ve hurt people I love because of how I reacted. I’m extremely self aware which is hard for me because I know exactly what will happen but my emotions take over every thing in my mind and I’m so tired of being the problem and the one people have to watch. 
I’ve always felt like a burden, and not being able to control my emotions inside is killing me, I just want to be normal.
I don’t want to hurt anyone.

I have felt like this since I was around 8 years old, I am 25 now.

I don’t know what to do anymore. 


"
20,3,"I don’t know why but all my life, I secretly get so angry when I lose or I’m not good at something. This probably comes from childhood trauma of always losing at everything to my siblings and cousins. This has caused me to want to be the absolute best at any hobby I pursue, which is a lot, and I get so frustrated when I’m not as good as I feel I should be. 
Am I a sore loser, too competitive or something else? It surely can’t be a bad thing to wanna be great at things. Thoughts? "
21,3,"Looking for advice in how calming yourself down worked.

Tonight a drunk man lost his shit on me because I was making a right turn and blocking the crosswalk (not purposely). No one was in the crosswalk at the time and I was inching out to try and see cars to turn (its a big city street so cars were parked illegally and i had to inch out to see). He then walked up while I was still stopped and punched my car and then came up to my passenger window and called me a dumb bitch, c*nt, etc. I get really pissed easily and I hate it. I couldn't help myself and i said calm the fuck down and leave me alone. He didnt like that i responded so he punched my car window (it didnt break and he pulled his hand back and held it because it obviously hurt)...i laughed because he looked so stupid and tried to act like a tough guy. I inching out more to just leave because I felt my chest getting hot which means my rage was boiling. There was nothing I could do bc im a petite female and im not fighting a grown man let alone anyone as I dont want to be arrested. Since I laughed at his fragile masculinity, he then punched my car mirror and broke it off and said ""see if I wanted to break your window the first time I would have done it like I did this"" (sure, buddy) i wanted to run him over. I called the cops to try and scare him and  file a police report for my insurance which he noticed and started running away like a little bitch. I was so mad I followed him in my car and debated again thinking about running him over. I had the cops on the phone now and then he said ""are you new here? Cops wont come they dont care"" i am in Philly, hes right, they have more important things to chase down and they are usually no shows for these or take hours. It pissed me off more so I pretended like I was recording him (my phone was dying so it wouldn't record) and once he thought i was recording he ran away again. Hopefully he shit his pants running home in fear he'd end up all over social media.

Now im here with my mirror hanigng off my car and everytime i see it, i am raging inside. I cant stop thinking about how I want to hunt this guy down and beat him badly (I wouldn't and couldn't but it be nice). The audacity he had to vandalize my car and try and intimidate me bc he was a drunk idiot infuriates me.

I dont know how to calm down and not let things like this get to me. I get so filled with rage that it makes me so emotional bc I can never just deal with it. It makes me shake and stress. I feel crazy and I can't get over this even though I have no choice or control. I want him to face karma. How do you calm down hours after being so angry??? I took a Xanax and that hasn't even helped. "
22,3,"Initially in any relationship (professional or personal) I tend to be civil, laid back and easy going. I would never raise my voice, would never be a part of conflict, people will never feel any kind of resistance from me. And I don't pretend, all these things happen naturally. But after a certain point in relationship, when I get comfortable and I know that the other person would take my tamper,  I become kinda mean and rude. I would then start snapping frequently in small disagreements and discomforts. I would snap at my bf for no major reasons, and would feel so guilty afterwards. I need to change my behaviour before it's too late."
23,3,"I'm sad that no one wants to be my friend. I'm sad that people isolate me, that they don't realize I exist most of the time. I'm sad that they seen to judge me for every little thing. I'm sad that they're all so judgemental, or at least I view them so. And then I get mad. I blow up at the smallest things, like my room being messy, losing a game, teasing. Im pretty sure anger is my go to defense mechanism"
24,3,I have a fairly vivid imagination so I can do this with no problem. But basically I'm just punching thin air and looking crazy while in my mind I'm dismembering them. I have no idea where this anger reaction came from
25,3,"Today since morning i have been told to stop making an issue out of nothing at least ten to eleven times just half an hour ago i just began slapping myself for being such an attention seeker and why do i always want attention why do i speak the way i speak just why 

But deep down i feel i deserve someone who understands me and listens to so i won't have to shout hit myself or even raise my voice 

But then again i get angry when things don't go my way i start getting irritated and then it gets converted to rage. I think it will ruin every relation i will form be it friends family or partner. 

When i see people getting their things done their way and get away with things which i don't it makes me really angry that i scream but can't find words to explain my emotions. Its just complicated but these are human emotions 
Also some memories of mine are pure rage or extreme emotional pain, i can't remember what it was that led to the situation but i only remember the emotion. 

I need to get a grip and control my anger so atleast i can think rationslly and don't abuse myself.

Pls leave some tips to improve myself overall and get it under control"
26,3,"I remember when I was little, that my mother spanked her friend's dog because it peed on her carpet. I also remember feeling so bad for it. Do you think it was justified?

Also want to mention that she had owned a couple of dogs before."
27,3,If you hold on to that which is anger you will be destroyed by it.
28,3,"Literally every single time I argue or get mad I start shaking and sometimes crying. My heart beats really fast etc etc. 

If it's an ""in the moment"" thing it won't work cause I'm already too mad. How can I practice (like at any time) practicing so I'm desensitized? If it's possible idk I just need some form of practice that's not WHILE I'm arguing or angry cause I never know when I'll be like that next."
29,3,"When I say victim, I don't mean like I'm at the receiving end of a gunshot. 

Recently at school I was assaulted, put in a chokehold and shoved over by this fat autistic kid in my form group. 
He made AI images on texts of me saying stiff about Denmark, where his dad is allegedly from, and saying its racist. This was 2 days ago 

But even so, at the same time, I was bourn in Melbourne, Australia, and moved to the UK, my dad being also Australian, which this fatso has said, and to quote;

""I think all iigrnsrs should be deported""
""Go back to where you came from, mate"" 
""Go f*ck a kangaroo"" 
""You're not meant to be here"" . 

Because he has severe autism, he's bean more or less let off the hook.  

This has happened before. He's given me a concussion and broken my wrist.
Not one of those were provoked. All of them surrounded by him saying racist things to me. 
Not one of those did he get a punishment more than a warning for either. 

Meanwhile, I've been victimised, spent 3 days out of normal classes, been put on 2 detentions, lost 3 lunch hours for allegations that aren't true. 
Heck, the only reason I wasn't suspended was because my dad threatened to go to the newspapers and my mum threatened to press charges. 

But even so, my dad is disappointed at me for something I didn't do, and now is shocked I'm angry at anything and utterly stunned that I don't want to be in a room with anyone. 

This is normal by the way.

-14M. "
30,3,"Today I (M17) and my partner (19) got into a stupid misunderstanding wich ended in tears (for me atleast).
I won't go into detail but what happened was that I got super mad at my partner for no reason at all. 
Normally i can control myself but today I just snapped for no reason I can think of.
I know they feel bad and I also feel super bad about it.
I already apologized and they said they needed time, i get that. But i still feel so bad that I got angry for absolutely no reason at all.
This isn't the first and probably not the last time this will happen, I'm just a terrible person in my eyes; i threatened to do stuff that are just pure attention seeking, i told them to fuck off, I made them believe for a second that I would break up though I don't want to.
My partner keeps on trying and only thing I do is get angry at them or myself for no reason at all.
I want to work on myself for them but idk how.
"
31,3,"To give you some context, I was neglected as a child and saw, especially my father, physically abuse some of the women in my family. And while I hate him, and would beat the crap out of him, I can't say I'm much different.

I'm scared because I have an amazing girlfriend, and I would do anything for her. And I want to have a family with her. But what if I end up like my father? The logical part of my brain says that I would never do anything bad to my girlfriend that I love so much, but what if something happens?

Ever since I was a child, I have been disgusted by certain people in my family. And I would, if I could, beat them to death if I didn't get caught, hire people to rape them, anything to see them suffer and take my anger out on them. This includes a few other people, a guy at my work who always picks on me, for example. I could kill people, torture them, and do anything else just to save the one I truly love, and I wouldn't feel bad about it. And while that particular part of me I don't hate, the other part haunts me.

I just don't want to hurt my girlfriend. I don't want to be a bad person. And i'm scared."
32,3,"I was sexually abused my freshman year of college. I'm going into my sophomore year now. I am, thankfully, in a better relationship, and I'm trying to get my life together. After the breakup with my abuser, I spiraled. Even though the event was/is over, I have found myself in a state that can only be described as deranged. I want blood. I don't like seeing a wolf in sheep's clothing parade around other potential victims. The only thing that seems to calm my rage is the thought of treating my abuser to the goriest death I can cook up. I want brain on concrete. I miss the person I was before all of this. When I was first going into college, I was genuinely happy. I felt like I was getting better. The world was ahead of me. I don't know how to calm my rage. I feel like it has turned me into a more hateful person in general. I see people vaguely similar to my ex, and I am sickened. I hate them too. I hate myself, I hate my school work, I even find myself hating my friends from time to time. My current partner told me to forgive myself and let it go, but I hate. What do I do? My soul is decomposing. "
33,3,This stuff happened 
34,3,"I am a zen and calm person up until I am triggered, then it's blind rage where I am saying nasty things and can't seem to stop until I regain composure, which might be an hour later. This has recently cost me my marriage and forced me to really dig into why I am the way that I am.

First I do want to add here that the first thing I did that truly helped was to get sober. I was smoking a LOT of weed, a daily user, and you might ask, ""doesn't weed chill you out?"" Yes but... The next morning I would be in a foul mood. Read up on weed a bit and you might see research on how it impacts dopamine, a lot of my anger came from an irritability that permeated my personality. I'm 6 months sober now and my mood has completely changed, I'm back to being calm and actually able to enjoy all of life's moments.

Another aspect of substance abuse is the lack of awareness and mindfulness that it creates. A lot of feeling emotions but not acting from them comes from mindfulness and mindfulness is a practice. If you are using substances you are decreasing your mindfulness, full stop. Point is: just get sober, I know you probably think what you are using is helping the anger but I assure you it is not.

Next is to find a really great therapist. This will be costly but it is a must. You cannot do this yourself and if you want to make peace with anger you must find the best resource money can get you. For anger specifically I really like the IFS/parts work approach, it's basically a mindfulness practice to show you how to become friends with your emotions/parts. It has been extremely valuable to me. I have also begun to dive into the childhood trauma that is the source of my angry outbursts and that experience has been difficult but so beautiful.

Since I keep bringing up mindfulness, incorporating meditation into your day can also help you really sit with anger and let it know you are here. A piece of IFS is that your parts may have been neglected your whole life, since anger is something you are probably ashamed of. By facing it head on and allowing it to be seen you might be able to evolve it so that it knows it doesn't have to always take over your whole being. The self can have more agency with the parts, in other words.

Medication is also helpful. I got on Wellbutrin and I think it being an NDRI with an effect on dopamine levels (remember I was a pothead for a decade plus) it has really helped me stay more even. You might want to also see a psychiatrist as well, you also don't need to be medicated forever. It might just help you break the patterns that you have gotten yourself into.

I know that I can heal and recover and become a person who can control his anger. It cost me the most important relationship but being on the path to healing is worth the pain. I only wish that I had taken these steps years ago, if you want to change them start the process today is all I can say. Don't wait for catastrophe to find the support and tools that you need."
35,3,"Last night my cat really made me so angry and frustrated. I arrived late from work but still I played with him with his toys, we ran through the house chasing him. I rewarded him with treats everything was great. He started to fall asleep in the couch while I was drawing when he randomly went to the kitchen, he always does that to get my attention. So I ignored him, to not encourage that behavior. When I realized he somehow opened the fridge and was trying to steal the ham. I stopped him and grabbed a little to harsh.

Not even 10 mins late he went into my homeoffice just to knock down a diorama a dear friend made for me. I had hidden this diorama from my cat so he wouldn’t break it even more (my mom broke the glass it had a while ago, which made me so mad as well). This made so fucking angry. I had never been so angry, I felt dizzy and saw stars even on how angry I was. I wanted to cry.

I struck my cat (felt bad after) and locked him outside for an hour. After I calmed him down I went to fetch him and we slept together again.

I wanted to share it since this had never happened before. I have always been easy to anger (dad has anger issues and used to beat me as a child) But now, in my adulthood I’m usually better at not letting it control me. Yesterday at midnight I lost my composure. Thanks for reading, english is not my first language so sorry for any errors."
36,3,"My parents voice, my corny brother, the sim light after turning off my led, the way my mom consistently scolds me for staying up when they’re constantly overstimulating me before bed by turning on the light when I’m about to fall asleep and beingloud. At this point I’m gonna stay my height forever and I’m Terrified of that. Everyday it gets worse"
37,3,ever felt that deep hate toward a person you just want to die because u might kill them if you don’t
38,3,"We are both teenagers but have been going out for 3 years and I know him through and through, and we are both really mature with good communication. We love each other to bits, but he has told me about his memories surrounding his sister who was extremely mentally ill in her adolescence and gave him a lot of terrible trauma as a child. I'm the only person he has told most of it to, and I think it is all unhealed. 

He has a lot of triggers that give him flashbacks, and today I pulled on his hood in a playful manner, not thinking about one of his triggers being neck constriction. He kind of signalled to me that it wasn't okay but he was smiling and we were being silly. I was laughing while apologising because I realised I shouldn't have done it, but he thought that I didn't understand and just snapped. He sat over me and leaned in, pointing and jerking his finger with each word, ""NO. Don't DO that."" and it was so aggressive and threatening. This set off a bit of a trauma response from my end because I have had to grow up around my mother's abusive partners, and I saw him as that in that moment, really upsetting me. He also the sweetest, kindest person ever, so I don't really see this side of him much.

We spoke about it after work today and I told him how I felt and vice versa and we apologised and listened to each other and then he started asking me about if he had anger issues and what I thought his triggers were and how to deal with them. I said that I thought he did have anger issues, but they weren't severe and answered the rest. I want to give him some methods to cool down in those moments like breathing or counting relaxation methods, but I feel like that won't work when he is in that stage of pure anger and not seeing anything else. If anyone has any recommendations that would be super appreciated! Thank you 

  
ALSO! Just some points because some redditors hate healthy relationships (from past experiences) and I don't want to individually fight them in the comments. If you disagree with my opinions that's okay! However I have been abused in my comments and DMs on past relationship posts, which will not be tolerated.

1. We are not breaking up because we are young. I have been in love with him since I was 14 and we have been together longer than my mum's entire relationship, marriage, birth of my brother, and divorce. We have had many issues because we are two people, and we work them out every time. Stemming from that, I am not stupid because I am young. I have been called stupid and inexperienced SO MUCH because of my age?? How can people just assume that from a number?? I also have communication skills and empathy and common sense, needed for a relationship.

2. I am aware I am not his therapist. However, I want to help him heal and become better. I think I have the emotional intelligence and skills to help him through his issues, and I am aware it isn't my responsibility. I have strongly encouraged him to try get a therapist, but while he doesn't have one, I love to listen to his issues and be there for him. "
39,3,"I think only those close to me ever saw me angry before. No one would usually expect me to be angry. I'm always angry when I'm home with my parents. I treat my mom badly when she annoys me - it's usually when she forces me to do/believe in things, just old wounds. You know how parents hit the wrong nerve. They were always very strict. I felt like they did my very wrong as a child. But I have outbursts now. I'm sure my mom still thinks she hasn't done anything wrong or just denies it. I feel very guilty all the time. It's getting worse.
I'm still very scared of my father, he himself has anger issues and will ruin my life if try to do things my way. I don't even want to deal with him, I just stay away.
 How do I deal with my anger? I just want to let go of it and be better and more mature, but it's like a reflex. I'm too uncomfortable and there's so much rage. "
40,3,"Well it just I suddenly angry for internet connection lost for few hours,and I tried to called customer service,and I feel stupid for not answering the caller requirements and I get angry for that,what should I do"
41,3,I cant control my rage and my outbursts and my breakdowns. I also engage in self harm.and self destruction eapecially if i force myself.to work. If i manage to surpress one rage attack the following ones will be worse  how do i stop? I was. Literally told i am not allowed to yell but i only yell at myself
42,3,"This isn’t just a rant. I’m trying to hold myself accountable and figure out how to change.

I work in the service industry—bars, restaurants, and a private club—and I have a really bad habit I need to own: When people come in close to closing time, I get straight-up rude. Not just cold, not just short—I make it very obvious that I don’t want them there.

I don’t fake-smile. I don’t hide it. I’ll be short, avoid eye contact, act annoyed when they ask questions, and sometimes even say things like, “Yeah, we’re closed but you can do what you want”. I wear the anger on my face.  It’s not subtle. I want them to know I’m irritated—and I can see the way they look at me when I act that way.

And then after the shift? I feel disgusting. Guilty. Embarrassed. Because the truth is—they didn’t do anything wrong. I’m the one being unprofessional. And this isn’t a one-time thing. It’s part of a bigger problem. I am the problem. 

I’ve been angry for years. I snap easily. I shut down. I let my emotions run the show and then sit in shame afterward. It’s not just at work—it affects how I carry myself in general. And even though I’m not cruel to my husband, he sees it. He’s told me he’s worried about how I’ll handle bigger responsibilities down the road if I lose control over something like a late table. And honestly? I don’t blame him for questioning that.

I think this kind of anger has been with me since I was a kid. I learned to protect myself by going cold or defensive. But now I’m an adult, and it’s not protection anymore—it’s damage. It hurts others, and it’s making me someone I don’t want to be.

I don’t want to resent my job. I don’t want to act like customers are enemies just for showing up late. I want to be grounded. I want to feel in control of my reactions not owned by them.

So I’m asking anyone who’s been there:

How do you actually retrain your mind and body to not react with anger the second you’re triggered?

What helped you stop being rude in the moment, even when your brain is screaming that you’re justified?

Is this fixable without therapy, or is that the best route?


I’m not looking to be told I’m valid. I know I’ve been acting like an asshole. I just finally care enough to want to change it."
43,3,"I've always been a people pleaser, especially in relationships.  However, I have hit a point where of course it isn't working for me.  Because of this I have been starting to feel.anger instead of disappointment and sadness.  I have tried working on.myself, but it hasn't helped.  Since I have started feeling feeling anger it has helped me and I want to sit in this for a long while.  I just need it in my life.  Any suggestions on how to keep it?"
44,3,"I get bouts of overwhelming anger, but the things I am angry at are genuinely traumatic and something needs to be done about it and they need to be acknowledged. I don't have any issues getting mad at traffic, people taking too long or the like. I have issues of unrelenting hatred towards truly hate worthy situations. Whenever I search for coping mechanisms all I get is 'mindfulness' and 'let go', a focus on that my anger is the problem. My anger is not the problem, my anger is an appropriate reaction to genuine problems that need to be addressed and processed. So I stay in this eternal spiral of loathing because there genuinely is something to loathe that is getting ignored (and that I am asked to just brush aside to get over my anger) and I do not know where to find other help. 

Does anyone have any resources they can recommend for this?"
45,3,"I am engaged for 2 years with my partner. Kaya hindi matuloy tuloy na gusto ko syang pakasalan bec. of so many reasons. She is invalidating everything listed below:

1. Siniraan na nya ko sa lahat ng kawork at friends nya. Lahat ng tao sa paligid nya, alam na alam yung away at issues namin. May instance pa na sinabi nya sa kawork nya ""putangina nya"" pertaining to me. 


2. She has a history ng pagdedelete ng messages sa phone. Whether mapa-friends or kung sinong kawork, pag pinapasend ko yung screenshot, laging putol yung usap. Until sa nahuli ko sya. 

3. She installed a dating app while pinupursue nya ko, at during kami. Twist: di nya daw ginamit. She just created a profile, pero nasa 80% yung complete profile na. Wow diba? 


4. There was an instance na nagsend sya ng message saakin saying ""tangina mo"" and deleted it. Reason? It was all a mistake daw. Wrong sent kumbaga.

46,3,"Hi all...

Long story short, I work in an environment that is just a f**king circus. It's just objectively pathetic

Leaving isnt an option for various reasons but mainly, leaving isnt going to help anything. Ive thought a lot about it and it never solves anything.

This monday morning I walked in after working 28hrs overtime during the weekend. I was mentally exhausted and already pissed off then I stepped into work and just got triggered. I felt like I could start busting heads

I felt a surge of energy but that energy desperately wanted to come out in bad ways

I want to channel that raw energy into something more positive. Being a better human. I dont want to react and give anyone at work the satisfaction 

Any advice?"
47,3,"Have you guys tried any exercise that is not lower body exercise that has actually HELPED your anger?

I think the closest would be kayaking, aerobics or swimming but want to see what actually works for you guys to relieve stress. 

Every fucking person says ""Go FOr A ruN"" and I am not allowed to do that for medical reasons. Or drive. "
48,3,"I feel like I've been super irritable and negative all day.  I'm trying to stay positive, but I'm still sliding back into being grumpy.  I know what some of the problem is but I'm starting to wonder if something else is bothering me.

I had to work super early this morning and I've felt like I haven't gotten enough sleep all day.  I tried taking a nap at a couple points but I only slept for like 20 minutes each time which didn't really do the trick.

Also earlier I went out with my wife and daughter to a nature trail thing which I thought would be peaceful and fun but I just felt pissy the whole time.  I was still feeling mentally worn out and all I could think about the whole time was how I would rather be home going back to bed.  I don't think I was too terrible to be around but my wife could tell I wasn't in a great mood and I hope I didn't ruin the trip for her and my daughter.  They seemed OK, though.

I think part of it is I'm getting annoyed about my job.  They give us these fucked up schedules to work and it often ends up messing with my sleep schedule.  Sometimes I feel like I spend my entire days trying to balance taking care of obligations at home and catching up on sleep.

I don't know, I think maybe I've been resentful ever since my wife took a vacation to Italy and I should just talk to her about it.

She met up with some of her cousins for like 9 days in Italy.  In the meantime I worked, did stuff with my kids and I had this plumbing project come up which ended up taking a lot of my time and thought while she was gone.

Then the other day she asked me to help her make our truck payment (we split our bills and that's one of the things she normally takes care of) because ""the trip to Italy set her back"" and she's trying to catch up.  So now it's like I'm paying for her vacation.

Well, I guess that's what's on my mind.  These days I'm pretty good at expressing my thoughts with people in a calm manner and not having it turn into a confrontation or whatever.  I don't think it's going to lead to any sort of fight.  I think I hold back sometimes just because I don't realize how much something is bothering me.  Or maybe sometimes I wonder if I'm just losing sight of things that I should be appreciating or maybe I'm just making a big deal out of nothing.

I'll bring it up later.  Thanks for reading."
49,3,"Whenever I have a negative emotion, have the need to lash out at someone, or feel slightly angry, I always have this surge of lightheadedness/dizziness, see stars, and almost black out for a little while. Is this normal?"
50,3,"Sometimes i'll react pissed off at something just because it felt right to react that way, not because i'm actually angry – but I can't stop myself from reacting that way. Is that something anyone else experiences?"
51,3,"I consider myself as a person who rarely lash out.people often see me as someone that does not get mad easily.there used to be a time where i was straightforward and blunt to people without caring about other peoples opinion being passionate and ambitious. I am 30 years old currently, and i just felt like a shell of my former self letting life goes by. Instead of having anger issues i feel like i suppress far too long of my anger. Is there anyway to bring out the anger to fuel my ambition? "
52,3,"I have this problem where i get randomly really pissed off over pretty much nothing. Sometimes someone might make a small mistake or just do something that annoys me and it'll start the ""episode"" but most of the time it just comes on randomly. I know there is no reason to be that angry but it feels like i can't get out of the mood. I try to push it away but of course it really just makes it worse. I cant have anyone talk around me, matter of fact i dont want anyone around me, i dont want to hear any other noises or bright lights or anything touch me. I dont actually get this, but its what i want to happen when i get in that mood. And when i dont (which is most of the time) so i go off at the people around me. I hate it a lot. It's been happening for a while now but its only started to happen a more often. 

I also have a similar problem that doesn't happen as often but isn't any better. I dont know if these are related in a way but its triggered by a similar thing. Noise in general i dont like much but sometimes its like i genuinely cant stand it. I dont want any judgment here cause i know im going to sound like a child. Sometimes out of nowhere, i start getting really upset and crying over noises. I dont get pissed of just really upset over sounds. For example voices, diswasher, rain, trees russling, laughing, etc. i have to block my ears with my hands to calm myself down or maybe, if i can stand it, put my earbuds in and blast music. I dont know if im overwelmbed or not because it just feels too random to be that.

I just dont know what to do about either of them. I havent told anyone else about this because it just seems to complicated to explain, i probably havent done a good job here but whatever. I'm mainly looking for an answer to the first one but i put both in here cause, like i said, they feel kinda related to each other. If anyone knows what is going on, if its just hormones (cause i am still ""maturing"") or how to deal with this, i'd be thankful."
53,3,"Hey Reddit, I just destroyed someone else's property out of rage for being laughed at, having things thrown (not literally) in my face, being denied (IMO) a reasonable request (told to fuck off) and accused of saying horrible things to someone (which I 100% did NOT do, I actually was very civil in the actual words I used before I completely lost it).

I don't want to post the whole story on reddit. But I apologised for it and I realise it is not healthy and vastly out of proportion, I also know people have the right to reject requests and be upset but I just got so pissed off at being wrongly accused of stuff that I saw red. (And yes. I forgot my meds that day.)

But man, it felt satisfying to my ADHD to hear all the loud noises of stuff being smashed. It felt like I was being punished for doing the right thing, so I figured, well, you're not listening to my words when I'm
TRYING to use them and being civil, so, yeah, fuck you very much. I've used my words and been laughed at and snarkily told to fuck off, so here, have an actual asshole response, because you want an asshole, I'll SHOW you what an unreasonable asshole is.

Are there healthy ways THAT MAKE ME FEEL BETTER that I can release my anger where it gives me the same ""Fuck you specifically, you fucking troglodyte"" and ""I want to smash things"" feeling without actually smashing other people's stuff?

I am medically unable to drive, so driving a long way is impossible. I also can't run and I walk slowly for medical reasons, so I find going for a walk in that state just makes me more pissed off.

Does exercise help? Does being in new places help? Does rage journaling help, like writing down all the rage-inducing stuff that you want to say to the person in the moment? What has helped you personally when things like this happen? 

And yeah I'm open to DBT. 

The four-window model actually helped me understand how other people may be perceiving my message when they jump down my throat for ""my tone"" or for making an unwittingly insensitive remark yesterday, which was what set this off. 

 Basically I feel like people super overreacted to my ""tone"" and an insensitive remark that I made and instead of using their words to explain WHY, they assumed malice, got angry, then goaded me further. Take your own advice and use your fucking WORDS.

And yeah, I get the irony of smashing things and expecting others to communicate clearly, but how else do I convey my message when I DID set my boundaries and regulate myself, I did use my words to indicate I didn't want to talk, and I STILL got treated dismissively? It feels like every opinion I have or everything I have to say is met with a ""No, I know I did X just now, but you ALWAYS do Y"" or ""You're just saying that to be contrarian."" Or an expectation that I am being malicious instead of just opening my mouth and blurting out dumb stuff. Or asking for help and then completely ignoring what I say and asking someone else. Like, if I'm incompetent, don't fucking ask.

NONE of this is a justification for smashing things, I fully accept that I am the asshole here... but how do I replicate the vindicated feeling without harming people's things??"

(English is not my first language)

My dad is complicated.
He had a bit of a tough childhood, but that’s no excuse to make your child feel the same way. I love him, but it’s hard not to feel stressed when I’m with him. I get anxiety just thinking about doing something wrong or something he doesn’t like, because I know he’ll get pretty angry even if it’s not really a big deal. If I take more than a minute to choose something to watch, and he gets annoyed and turns off the TV. Like… no one’s stopping you from eating just because I’m trying to find something to watch.

My sister and I have a very different dynamic.
She probably has oppositional defiant disorder and has always been defiant since she was little. She always talks back and wants to do everything she’s not allowed to. She likes to pressure and threaten me. She always wants me to do things for her, even small things she can do herself — like getting her water or making her a sandwich. When I say no, she gets really mad and tries to threaten me or something.
But I love her anyway, because she’s my sister. My mom is okay i guess. My parents are divorced since I was 2 yrs old because my dad met someone else at the gym. 

So this is what happened: 

So yesterday I thought about making chocolate cake tonight. I woke up at about 8:30AM and heard my mom, my little brother and her fiancé leave to go to the store. I didn’t know that we didn’t have flour and I thought we could just buy some candy or some chips later since we usually go to the store at Fridays after dinner. It’s Friday today. 

So now it’s 8:45PM and I asked my mom if I could make chocolate cake since i sometimes do on weekends. She said to check if we had flour so I did, it wasn’t enough flour. I asked her if we could quickly go to the store which was about 6 minutes with car. She said no and that she was tired. I sighed and asked again and she said: “I’m tired!!” 

I said: “can’t we order it home then?” She said “no we can’t!” But we clearly can. She’s just like my father and while I hate to admit that, it’s kinda true. Never give up when she’s set on something. Never tries to compromise. 

I said: “yes we can!” And she’s just going off about how it’s expensive and stuff. Then she said: “you can take the toblerone we have in the pantry. But I didn’t want that, I wanted chocolate cake since I’d been craving it for days and thought it finally be able to have it. I said that it’s just 6 minutes to the store. She said ‘no im tired’. And her fiancé couldn’t drive me since he was putting my little brother to sleep.

My older sister said: ""Ofcourse you want chocolate you big back."" And my mom knows that big back is basically calling someone fat. I’m not fat but it still hurts me when she says that. My mom didn’t even say anything. I was quiet for a moment before smacking my sister on her head then walking away. My sis said “Fucking whore” to me. My mom didn’t even get that angry like she does when I say anything. It’s so unfair since she knows my sister doesn’t listen either way but she always tells me off since she knows I’m not like my sister. 

Then my mom came into my room after I closed myself in there and started talking about how it’s not okay to yell at her even tho I just raised my voice a little and she clearly can’t tell the difference between raising a voice and yelling. I ignore her and record her yelling since whenever my dad and her yell at me I record just in case I need proof to show that they get mad for nothing sometimes. Then she said “are you watching the show with us because we’re gonna turn it on now"" we were going to watch season three of Ginny and Georgia but does she really think I wanna sit in the living room with them after that? 

TL;DR:
My dad gives me anxiety and gets mad over small things. My sister is aggressive bossy and says hurtful stuff and my mom never defends me. I just wanted to bake a chocolate cake today, but we didn’t have flour and my mom refused to go to the store or order it. My sister insulted me, i snapped, and now I’m the one getting blamed. My mom acted like nothing happened and wanted me to watch a show with them right after. I just feel really tired and unheard."
56,3,"I wasn't supposed to be angry but for some reason my sister try to anger over dent sofa,yes I did dent one part of sofa,because I need relax my leg to dent it,my sister try to change,to uncomfortable position part of sofa,lead me angry and I been argued in this second time,I angry and acream and ,""what should I do,and what I am suppose to do what am I supposed to do,tell me????"" My mother and sister wanted to report me to authority,because you are violent angry,maybe I dent to jerk off myself,and I don't want to stressed out and I don't want to be angry,just tell me what am I supposed to do on this situation."

So I have learned recently that a potential FWB that I have had for a few months no longer wants anything to do with me sexually or romantically due to my prior history of STIs, etc
They says that I am a great friend, and they have really been nice to me, but upon them telling me this, I ended our friendship because of the fact that me & them being more than friends wasn’t going to happen. When I told my friends what happened, that they told me that it was a petty reason to end the friendship.

Since we’ve stopped talking, my angry outbursts have been more frequent, I’ve gotten very little sleep, and I immediately shut down upon seeing my lost friend getting more closer to others but they’re more emotionless and distant toward me. Today I took it out on an innocent bystander verbally. I took full accountability for my behavior towards her and admitted although I had a horrible day, that was no excuse for my shit behaviour. 

I really need your honest opinion on this. How can I fix the friendship on the condition I respect their boundary of nothing sexual or what tools can I use to not do this to others moving forward? 

I allow slightly harsh criticism as well, because I know I fucked up."
58,3,"I used to be the kind of person who genuinely liked the world. Like, trees? Beautiful. Random dogs on the street? Instant serotonin. Strangers existing near me? Fine. Fast forward a few years in a new country and… yeah, not so much anymore. I’ve kind of turned into a cynical, snappy little gremlin who gets irrationally mad at everyday things. And it’s been a *slow* burn.

My routine is just... exhausting, even though it doesn't sound like it. Wake up, shuffle onto an overcrowded tram, squeeze into a packed metro station, then another one, somehow even worse, then work in an open office where noise bounces off every wall. No cafeteria, so lunch happens in a chaotic shopping mall that feels like a bad trip. Then it's the exact same gauntlet home, topped off with the gentle percussion of my upstairs neighbors (a bitchy single mother that never says hi to anyone in our building and her little precious boy), who apparently stomp to process emotions.

My boyfriend keeps reminding me to be grateful. “You live in a good area, the landlord’s decent, your job pays alright, and you’re in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.” And he’s not wrong. But also, none of those things matter when I’m one more loud chewing sound away from spontaneously combusting.

It’s not like I hate people. I don’t. I really like my friends, even my coworkers. I just have this low-level rage that only strangers unlock—especially the ones who seem aggressively unaware of anyone around them. The people who stand in doorways. The ones who talk like they’re mic’d. It all adds up.

I’ve been wondering if maybe I just need to live somewhere quieter. Somewhere with space. Water. Fewer people doing TikTok dances in the middle of the sidewalk. But then my boyfriend says I’d still probably find something to complain about. And… fair enough. He might be right. Maybe I’d be mad at a seagull or something.

Still, it’s frustrating feeling this way all the time. I’ve tried all the usual things—meditation, exercise, socializing, not socializing, humming, high frequencies, hugging trees, changing up my routine, even just zoning out with food or YouTube—and nothing really sticks. It’s like I’m constantly in fight-or-flight over nothing, and I can’t switch it off. I jog 3x a week after work, stretch before work, reward myself with nice dinners and sometimes desserts, smile at the dogs and cats in the streets, sit by the river and truly enjoy my life at those moments, but then it all ends the second a stranger passes nearby.

The weirdest part? I had this moment the other day on the metro, just looking around and suddenly thinking, *none of this feels real*. Not in a cool “whoa we’re all energy” way, but in a deeply unsettling, NPC-core kind of way. I looked at people and thought, *what the fuck is all that? Jesus fucking christ its nasty.*

I don’t know. I guess I’m just tired. Of everything being loud, cramped, expensive, and overstimulating. Of not knowing what to change or how. Just hoping it gets easier at some point. Maybe i was born that way, maybe im a misanthrope and that would truly suck.

Anyway. If you’ve ever felt like this—like you’re becoming someone you don’t quite recognize, and you’re constantly fighting that shift—hi. You’re not alone, and I'm sorry you are also going through that"
59,3,"I used to be a relatively calm friendly person, but as of late I can't not be angry at the world. For every one thing I like, there are at least 20 things I hate. Everything happening in the world, racism, job stress, and money issues have all piled up on me. I'm seeing a therapist right now, but it's not helping. I don't want to become a vengeful and hateful person who wants the world to burn, but it's heading that way. I want to go back to the calm, easy going person I was before. How can I get there?

It doesn't make me feel better to hurt something/someone that didn't hurt me. I just feel bad and scared of myself. I've tried working out, screaming, breaking things. It just feels like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound. I've also done therapy, but so many therapists have done me wrong. I just need somewhere to redirect my anger."
61,3,"I'm beyond upset right now and the short sum up is I was playing a game with my crush and we don't call or anything because she is playing on her phone and I was lagging extremely badly and I could bear with it for a while but when I became the seeker of the game because it was hide and seek. My game froze for so long and people were hitting me into the air and the game legit gave me a error code for ""flying"" and my crush was one of the people hitting me and she never does that and because I was so mad of my game already not wanting to stop lagging and proceed to work which it didn't and stuff. When I got the error screen I snapped and said ""your a actual dumbass (my crushs name) and I felt so gulity immediately even tho she didn't really was told that or said to face to face. Because again we don't know each other in real life or call and I felt so gulity that I vented to my friend and I tried to join back and for about 10 13 minutes I got so mad because the lag is still so bad and I gave up and was going to message her that I'm done playing and I got so pissed off again that I nearly said ""now I can't join back because you decided to punch me into a error screen :/"" but I just said it was fun playing and sorry for not being able to come back and stuff. I'm trying so hard to calm down that I'm sweating. Heavy breathing. Biting my jaw shut and trying to do anything to calm down. Can someone please give me advice on how to calm down fast and not insult people because when I'm mad I insult and curse people out a lot and that's the first time I did that to my crush and I would never say or do anything like that but my anger made me snap and insult her without her knowing and I feel horrible about it that I legit teared up while I was upset trying to calm down from my anger"
62,3,"I noticed, if I'm lacking it THC or Nic at any point. Im liable to freak out.

I been dealing with really bad anger issues for the better part of 5 years. After I OD'd on Gabapentin, Phenibute and Kratom. I wiped my brain and had to relearn to walk and talk. yet they never scanned my brain to see if there was any issues. But after that, My anger has just gotten worse and worse and im worried I am suffering from brain damage."

This world is beautiful and I feel most shortly when I get physical or take out my anger on my family because they absolutely do not deserve it. And I wanna stop hurting people and I don’t wanna be an animal.
64,3,"Hey guys! So I(24f) am having a bit of an issue that I hope someone can help me through. I have an ex friend who, to keep a long story short, destroyed my reputation and tried to turn my ex against me. Now I want to clarify I have never been an angry person. I’ve been screwed over much worse in my life and got over it like it was nothing. All she did was talk shit and make a few people view me differently. This was eight months ago and I’m still not over it. I have tried everything: therapy, praying, I even did minor petty revenge and nothing is working. When I asked my therapist she did the whole speech about “you give her power” and “let it go” but I think about the situation almost daily and my blood still boils as if it happened yesterday. It’s one of those situations where I don’t think I’ll find peace until karma hits her. And the thing is we weren’t even best friends, our friendship was less than a year. How do I move on?"
65,3,"I was debating whether to go to the show or not cause I didn't know all the bands and didn't know how to mosh but ended up deciding to go like an hour or two before the show started. It was my first hardcore show, and third concert overall, the other two were thrash metal shows that only had push pits. I was scared to go in the karate pit at first because I thought I might look like an idiot compared to everyone and get hurt, but then was like fuck it and went in and ended up having the time of my life. 

Then right when the show ended and after I went up front to high five the band members, my bag was unzipped and my phone was gone. Literally turned one of the best nights of my life into one of the worst within a split second. I had to make myself look like a fucking idiot for an hour looking around and asking staff members and other people at the show if they saw it, if they could try calling my number or my parents, and then asking if they could please get me an uber and I’d pay them back on venmo/zelle ASAP, cause it was literally my only way of getting home safely and I went alone. Taking the train at night as a lone woman without my phone for directions and being bad at navigating was basically a death wish. At around midnight a security guard finally gave in and called me a taxi that accepts cash because he had a daughter and would hate it if it were her. Fucking worthless cunt didn't just steal my phone but also put me in danger with no way of getting home and calling for help just for a few hundred dollars.

I really don't get how the hell they pulled this off. I was sober, barely talked to anyone, was moshing hard most of the night (harder to steal from a moving target), I had it in a fanny pack in the front of my waist and was pretty mindful of it, and remember having my phone literally three songs before the show ended. It wasn’t even a bad neighborhood and I didn't even see or feel them do it. 

I wanna fucking kick their teeth in, I lost irreplaceable photos of my dog that died and when he was a baby, a lot of important health documents, memories of me and my friends of the brief times my life wasn't so shit, lectures, tutorials, and photos of my work from when I went to makeup school, videos of me winning martial arts tournaments, modelling portfolio photos, and phone numbers I exchanged with some cool people I met at the last concert I went to. Might not seem like a big deal but when you have autism and not many friends, stuff like that tends to hold more sentimental value. I would’ve much rather they stole my wallet and would even pay for my phone back. And no, I didn’t have iCloud enabled, I did try to back stuff up with a hard drive but it wasn’t working too well. All week I had the fun task of spending hours and hours scrambling to change all my credit cards and hundreds of passwords the first few days in case it was a professional hacker that stole it. 

I tracked its location with the find my iPhone app, but police refuse to do shit unless the detective finds footage on the venue’s security camera of someone stealing it to get a warrant. And even if by the slim chance he does, it could be sold for parts or in China before then. If I take matters into my own hands I’ll end up hurt, dead or in prison. Seriously. What if it were a missing person, kidnapping or worse at that location, would they have to go through security footage also?? You can arrest  homeless but do nothing about a grand larceny case even when the location is right fucking there??

Its been a week and two days and I’m still logged into my apple account on that phone, and it still pings to neighborhood around 15 minutes away from the venue, meaning this fucking moron still hasn’t even figured out what to do with it yet. Seriously, unless you’re a hacker or have connections why the fuck would you waste all this time trying to unlock it or find someone that knows how to hack (and isn't a scammer) for just a few hundred dollars or less?? By now they could've made double that amount in a minimum wage job with much less effort. 

I'm already at the lowest point of my life, I had a pretty rocky childhood growing up with undiagnosed autism/ADHD and all the poor social skills/executive functioning that comes with it, and since 2023 my life has been filled with consecutive, nonstop unlucky bad breaks I have zero control over and various unexplained health issues. Getting into metal, punk and hardcore last year has been the only thing that somewhat helps me deal with my anger. I used to think I would end it all at 25 if life keeps going like this but now I really think I might head out at the end of this year. The current state of the economy and fascism in this country at the very start of my adulthood really isn’t giving me much reason to stay either. I’m just so fucking done. This “THiNk PoSiTiVe, At LeAsT yOu DiDnT dIe!” “oThEr pEoPLe HaVe It WoRsE” garbage really gets old when everything you do turns to shit somehow, and so many people screw you over for no reason and never face any fucking consequences for it. I talked to other people that have been going to shows for years and they told me pickpockets never even crossed their minds. Yet it happens to me at only my 3rd show and first year in the scene. Why the fuck am I so unlucky??? Not one fucking person has ever paid for hurting me, and based on this year’s election, healthcare system, and celebrities/politicians involved in rape/sex trafficking rings, this world seems to do a really great job of rewarding evil in the world. I get life can be hard, but every fucking second?? I can’t even enjoy 3 fucking concerts that were literally the only place I felt at ease for the last 2 years while this country and our future falls apart?? People go to concerts to stay sane and forget about their problems for a few hours yet still some piece of fucking garbage has to ruin it for them. 

Please be mindful of pickpockets especially if you go to shows alone and rely on your phone for Ubers or directions for getting home safely. If you see someone pickpocketting, they need their fucking asses beat just like nazis and guys that grope women at shows. These assholes aren’t just stealing phones, they’re putting people’s lives in danger leaving them with no one to call in case of an emergency late at night just for a few hundred dollars or less. Its absolutely fucking disgusting, I really, really hope this worthless piece of shit faces consequences for what they did to me but sadly that's extremely unlikely."
66,3,"I'm a CSR at a grocery store, and my manager is practically demoting me by giving me less work because I've been getting more emotional lately. A big part of my anger comes from stress I feel thanks to my new boss up front, in addition to trying to impress my bosses in general.

68,3,"I've been having some weird beef with this one very passive-aggressive, gaslighting, immature teacher of mine. I have anger issues since childhood but i've been doing pretty good for the past couple years until i had to take her class. Dealing with her causes me to revert back to my old self, puts me in a bad mood, and gives me violent thoughts about her. Everytime i think of her i get the urge to punch her in the face or pray she gets struck by lightning and dies.

Any advice on how to calm these thoughts? My parents are fairly religious/spiritual and they told me to remind myself that karma will surely follow her. Their advice helped a bit but it's still not enough. What kind of mindset do you guys use to make yourself feel better when there's someone you really hate?"

70,3,"Hi there, first time poster here, but longtime sufferer of anger.

I've struggled with anger in various forms for most of my life (currently 30M). It typically has not been acted out with physical violence, but has frequently come out in its worst form as screaming and raising my voice at romantic partners, followed by guilt and shame. This has happened with multiple partners and I can't fool myself into thinking that I'm not the common denominator, and I want it to stop.

My girlfriend of 1.5 years and I recently broke up, with excessive yelling from me during conflict playing a significant role. Around the same time, a couple of friends left my life for different reasons. In hindsight, I've come to realize that there were dealbreakers for me in all of these relationships, and that I'm probably better off not having these people in my life. However, the relationships could have ended more gracefully and my primary regret is not being more assertive and decisive about what I want and leaving if I don't get it.

In the wake of these relationships, I've focused a lot in therapy on assertiveness, setting boundaries, and asking for what I want in relationships. I'm also paying much closer attention to the relationships (romantic and platonic) that I form and whether they're healthy / a ""good fit"", which I think has been a problem in the past. I think this will help a lot in reducing anger in the future, because I'll have less reason to be angry and I'll be better about expressing that anger constructively.

Now that these big, tense relationships are gone, I'm finding that I'm just not that angry anymore. Which is great, but the problem I'm having is that I think the anger is still there. It could come up with future romantic partners, but I don't know how to ""work on"" this if I'm just not angry all that often right now.

Here's what I'm doing right now. In addition to weekly therapy sessions, I am planning to try a group, possibly an anger management group or an ""interpersonal process"" group, which my therapist recommended. I figured it was worth a try since I've never been to one. I'm also meditating every day, which is something I've found in the past helps me feel more centered. I'd also love to connect with a peer or mentor who struggles with or has overcome similar issues.

Does anyone have insight on how to keep working on this when I don't feel angry all that often at this point in my life? Suggestions for how to connect with peers/mentors who have faced similar issues? Anyone in the same boat?

Thanks for reading and any insight you have to share. :)

**tl;dr: I have struggled with angry outbursts for much of my life, especially during conflict with romantic partners. This contributed to a recent breakup with my girlfriend. I'm working on being more assertive. How can I keep working on anger when I'm just not that angry nowadays?**"
71,3,"I am a working person who is 18+. Everyone in my dad's side of family has always had anger issues. His mother used to emotionally abuse me while coddling my sibling, which created rivalry between us. Now, since I can afford to stay alone, I want to try doing that, but I feel like I am abandoning my family. For context, my parents take care of my sick grandparent as well as my sick uncle who was abandoned by his own family. Both of them have extreme anger issues like my dad, and are extremely conservative. I was never allowed to go outside alone, even though I am old enough, and it is not normal in the place where I am living. All decisions were taken for me by my parents. Now, leaving them to take care of both sick people while they themselves are not in their best health feels like abandoning them, but I also do not want to worsen my mental health, since I can't speak about anything to my dad without being scared, as he is a ticking time bomb, and my mother is extremely emotionally manipulative, like most mothers are in the place where I live.

72,3,"By violent thoughts, I mean sending them to the hospital, and in some severe cases, the coffin.

Is that a way of venting anger, or is it something else?"
73,3,I never thought of it like that but it would make sense. I don't know if that's the case all the time but the more someone is angry I wouldn't be surprised if they're trying to cover up some sort of weakness they feel within themselves. Sounds like its on a very subconscious level to.
74,3,"last night was one of the worst nights of my life. 

my brother always had a short fuse. you can kinda tell when hes reaching there, and once you hit a certain point of pissing him off, he kinda explodes.

and ig before i would have just called it ""anger issues"". but this isnt it. and i think anger issues is just such a small word to describe what hes like. because its not just throwing a tantrum and loud screaming and slamming doors.

last night. i heard he come out of his room. then i heard him scream. then i heard my mom scream. then i heard glass breaking. and then i was running out of my room. and i could hear my dad screaming too. my brother had used a glass container and hit my mom on the head. there was glass all over the floor. and my dad was holding him down like he was a wild animal. i remember my mom telling me to go to my room and to lock the door, and i did. 

after that it was mostly a blur. i remember feeling so afraid, my hands were shaking and i couldnt stop crying and i was texting my friends because i couldnt calm down. if it was a metal rod, or a knife, i am telling you seriously, my mom would have died.

im so scared. and i dont know what to do. i really dont. im horrified. i dont want to die. i dont want my parents to die. i dont want my brother to get hurt.

i came out later on and i could see that my brother and my dad were now on the couch, and my dad was on top of him like in a wrestling match or something. his face was like. his face was so hateful. 

i went back to my room and i could hear him screaming that he should have killed my mom. he should have hit her more. he said some other stuff too.

last night i stayed up listening for sounds because i was so scared he would decide to attempt something again.

the next day my dad told me he regretted it. and he just needs to mature. to just give him a few more years. he said he prays the family gets better.

but dad. i dont know how much longer i can give him and i have been praying for so long. dad, how long are you going to put up with him. where is your trigger point?"

76,3," I'm not sure if it's BPD or if it's BPD or I'm just a narc etc. but I struggle to keep relationships with others. I used to think it's because ppl are fake(they are still), but after a while, I started to wonder if I was the problem. This week I love them, gradually I can't stand them because of something that they did or said. They aren't my happy place anymore, just someone I am annoyed by and can't trust. But then I feel bad because I still love them,
 and want them around, but my body/nervous system is rejecting them. I'm constantly in a push pull. I spent most of my childhood alone, now I'm trying to be an adult and form connections, and I just struggle with social life tbh.

This is why I talk down on Myself. I self sabotage, and could have lost some genuine ppl. But I've lost a lot of them. I no longer trust myself to bond w others. And ppl being kind/liking me makes me uncomfortable. Since im not used to it.

 Every little thing I take as rejection. I'm always afraid that one day, they'll think I'm boring or weird and disappear. I heard BPD starts in early adulthood, and I didnt start feeling this way until a few years ago. I'm 23. I'm 23 and yet I'm always in my head so much, that I eventually just shut down and get overstimulated from overthinking thee entire fucking  day. I can ruminate very deeply for hours and days on end, it's actually bordering on obsession and brings me a lot stress and anxiety. 

I suffer from negative intrusive thoughts, which only adds to my guilt as a person. And my need for attention and approval from everyone is so intense, that I legit get sad and disappointed when I don't get it. When I do get it, I feel elated and on the moon. My mood is almost entirely dependent on the ppl around me and how they treat me. This why I'm so depressed. I only feel extra dopamine when I'm being applauded.  I've even caught myself possibly being jealous of ppl with worse trauma than me, because they have a bigger sob story, or ppl will feel bad for them and understand their flaws more than mine. What sane person thinks like that?! My trauma isn't as bad imo. So I just put up a wall to guard myself, and dismiss how much it hurt me. Because it truly did fuck me up. But I always been weird and fucked up before that so idk ."
77,3,"I played Brawl Stars and wanted to complete a quest. I had to win 5 duel battles. In fact, both players fight three brawlers in 3 rounds. The brawler killed is replaced by the next brawler of the player who lost the round. I hate this mode because it's particularly stressful because I can only rely on my own abilities, I can't count on other players to help me win the rounds. But I had to do this quest to earn XP points and unlock in-game rewards. 



It was very hard for me to win, as most of the players I was up against had a much higher rank than me. You could tell they'd trained hard and done a lot of ranked battles, which are generally harder. But I don't often do ranked fights because they're hard and stressful. As a result, my level isn't as good. The thing is, it's really unfair to come up against these players when I know in advance that I'm not going to win. What's more, most of them were hyper-strategic and all played with Edgar because he's better at this kind of game. I finally understood how they used him. They would wait for Edgar's ultimate move to be available before jumping on the enemy and going after him. It took me several games to figure it out, and I thought I could counter Edgar with my usual brawlers. But they were too clever every time. They'd wait until I'd used up all my ammunition trying to attack them before attacking me back. It pissed me off to see them win like that. And even when I tried to use Edgar and apply their method, it didn't always work because they had a stronger brawler with better stats. Some of the players were really mean. When I'd lose a round to them, they'd send clown and thumbs-down emojis. This made me even more angry, when all I wanted was to finish the quest and do something else afterwards to relax. But I wanted to finish the quest because I'd already started it and won 1-2 fights. I only had 3 fights left to get rid of the quest. I admit I should have stopped as soon as I felt I couldn't do it and started to get really annoyed. But I persisted because it frustrated me to stop on the losing side. 



At one point, I just snapped and slammed my phone on the sofa and shouted “cunt” really loudly at one of the players. What's more, he was really mean. He didn't deserve to win with such disrespectful behavior, whereas when I win against someone, I treat the other person with respect. I don't understand people who are mean like that when they don't even know the person in front of them. I was mean too by screaming like that but writing it for the person to read it never came in my mind because I knew it’d be useless and toxic for other players. My parents came over because they were startled because it was in the middle of the night. They scolded me and told me that video games were driving me crazy and so on. They said I was going to do even worse things. They said “We don't want you to stop studying after your bachelor degree because we don't want you to end up like that”. But that's really absurd reasoning. Besides, I never said I wanted to stop my studies after the bachelor degree, I just said I wasn't sure I wanted to continue in biology later on. And also, just because I'm going to stop studying doesn't mean I'm going to keep playing like this. I play because it's the quickest way to entertain myself and forget my problems. Other activities take longer and require more physical effort. As a result, I can't stay focused on the present moment and forget my problems (my digestive problems, the stress of studying, mental health problems...). 



It's really hard not to be understood by my parents, who think I'm just getting worked up over a game, when there's something deeper behind it all. It's just that I'm too lazy to explain because they don't understand. I already explained that I'm a perfectionist and it's in my nature to want to succeed at everything. But they don't understand why it's so important for me to succeed in a game. But they don't understand that it's not just about the game. I didn't feel well all day because I had a stomach ache from all the food I ate during the week. I ate an aperitif during my great aunt's funeral when I knew I shouldn't have because of my digestive problems. I had another aperitif yesterday at noon at my father's family home, and again in the evening. In between, I ate too much parmesan. All because I was hungry, I really wanted to eat something pleasant and there was also a fear of judgment because I didn't want to refuse to eat certain things in front of my family for fear of being difficult. As a result, I'm so angry at myself for not having eaten properly. On top of that, I'm stressed about a lot of things, like the solo trip to Paris that's coming up in a few days. Then there's the Mon Master admission phase (it’s a selective phase to get your school for your master degree). I'm afraid I won't get into the schools I want to go to, even though I'm not really interested in biology, but I just want a Master's so I can change direction more easily. I'm also stressed about my internship report because I'm afraid it won't be good enough. I've received initial feedback from my placement tutor on my first draft of the report. I realized that there were quite a few things I needed to change. I felt like I'd done shit. I'm afraid she'll think I didn't understand anything about the internship we did, and I don't want her to have a bad impression of me when I did my best to get involved in this internship even though I wasn’t passionate at all. I also feel bad about myself for a lot of things. In short, I just feel that my life has no meaning and that I'm regressing in every domain. 



After my tantrum, I calmed down when my parents arrived. It made me so uncomfortable that they were looking at me. I felt sick to my stomach (I still do). I asked them not to worry about me and to let me play some more because I wanted to finish my quest. I told them I wasn't going to get upset. In the end, I succeeded in my quest. I started crying because I regretted behaving like that. I told myself I should have stopped playing. But I couldn't stop because I wanted so much to succeed. I was also sad to be mocked by other players when all I wanted was to be let win so I could get rid of my quests. This game mode is one of the worst. I never touch it because I really hate it. But it's so horrible to have to play it anyway. 



I regret so much that I didn't listen to myself again. I'm so used to having a breakdown like that over a game. It's often Brawl Stars because it's a complex game that requires a lot of training to become better. I like this kind of game which pushes me to progress, but it's also a source of pressure when my mental health is fragile. I want to be able to continue playing this kind of game without it making me rage like that. It would be a shame to stop playing video games just because I can't channel my anger. But I constantly feel like it’s so hard to control my anger because of stress. 



I'd really like some advice on how to stop ragging on games so much.

78,3,"Is it normal for me to get super pissed off when people keep questioning me whenever i say anything. i feel like whenever i say something someone just has to question it and its stupid as hell ""im hungry"" ""why are you hungry? you ate 2 hours ago"" and it makes me so mad. how am i supposed to know why im hungry i just am stop questioning me. sometimes i think to myself that maybe im overreacting but i can promise you every little word that comes out of my chatterbox always gets followed up by a ""why"". its gotten to the point where im starting to dislike people over it, even my own friends. no daniel, i dont want to play this videogame with you for 10 hours today like youve asked me to every waking moment for the past 2 weeks. god forbid a guy wants to be alone sometimes, why cant you take no for an answer?"
79,3,"Is your family member, spouse, kid, friend, coworker, pissing you off? I’ll let you pay me to scream at me for up to 10 minutes. Anything said goes. Let it all out. Who’s interested?"
80,3,"Basically I have had an experience with 2 past co workers who decided to publicly humilate me and a few months later laugh at a co worker bullying me verbally abuse me with looks of disgust over something not even my fault and later avoid me and also both of then decided to show preference for people around me.
I am holding a lot of animosity towards these people and think they deserve to die for being so fucked up and deeply sick in the head for the abhorrent things they did to me.

I am deeply scarred disturbed sickened livid by what they thought and what they did based on that and this experience has made me realise how much society in general seems to avoid and mostreat me and I'm sick of this unfair life because of being ugly 

I am deeply offended by the vile behaviour but it's just a confirmation of how much the world doesn't want me anymore and only wants people who aren't repellent and disgusting like me If you read my comment history you'll see more and I'm sick of having a collected mistreatment and living with this shit.I can't take it anymore 

I've been suffering as an ugly man for years and only lately I've started to really lash out back at this sick hateful world I'm sick of people feeling entitled to lack human decency because I'm ugly .

All those who have mistreated seregated bullied and outcasted me in my life deserve to die in the most brutal ways possible and rot and suffer tremendously in hell for longer then eternity "
81,3,"Today i had a nightmare about having an encounter with someone that ruined my life, i woke up scared and confused but then i felt that i was getting really angry, yesterday i figured out my heart rate was spiking while  in bed cuz i was overly dehydrated, so when i was feeling the episode coming in by instinct i took a big zip of my water bottle. I was like WTF? i felt calmer, like it distracted me, A LOT. I have adhd traits i dont know if thats related, but so far it works, i got angry again cuz my mind works without rest lmao but it helps!! Cold water is what i use, maybe it can help someone else too! Ill have to buy one that i can carry all the time.."
82,3,"Theory:

One reason trauma is held onto is because there is an avoidance of it; there is a desire to not feel the pain; to not be hurt; to not be that victim again, to not be alone, naked, scared, and helpless. But, the only way we can let go is by feeling these feelings and letting them dissolve. Think of desiring chocolate, the chocolate is desired until the appetite is satiated; once satiated, the desire for chocolate is gone.



Likewise for negative emotions, there is a desire for loving-kind awareness and a calmness so that these can be felt and healed.



Exercise:

First, get into a fully positive state, as high of a positive state as you can get. Whether this is through a breathing exercise like pranayama, or an energetic practice like reiki or qi-gong; or whether just by watching some mindless tv show, or thinking about your most fond memory. However you get to the fully positive state is fine.



Next, slowly lean into the biggest problem troubling you (the trauma in this case, or if not trauma, then just the biggest problem); feel it; yes it feels bad, yes it sucks, you can even say that out loud. You can say how bad it feels/felt. You can say how you felt/feel helpless and like the world was over. Feel it. Once it gets to be too much, and you feel you are going to be overwhelmed with too much negativity for your current capacity, then just stop. Repeat the first step, get into the highest positive again. 



And then simply repeat these two steps until it is fully dissolved and there is only positive feelings left.



Bonus step: If you are able, focus on the problem/trauma while doing the positive state exercise

Example: Focus on the trauma while you are calming yourself with breathing

Example: Focus on the trauma while you are getting positive feelings from your tv show

Example: Focus on the trauma while you are getting positive feelings from your memory



Remember, go slow, be gentle on yourself."
83,3,"I, (18F) have an older brother (27M) who still lives with me, my sister, and my parents. For the past 6-7 years he’s been extremely abusive towards me and my family, verbally and physically. My mother does not want to kick him out for some reason. 
He’s unemployed, a college dropout who stays in his room all day. I wonder what he does on his laptop for hours on end. He never leaves the house, barely has any friends, and whenever he leaves his room it’s always to get food or to yell at someone. I’m tired, so are my dad and sister, but he’s such a mamas boy. There have been multiple instances where I’ve wanted to call the police but I’m always scared of the outcome. I plan to move my parents out to a new home with me and my sister once I’m 20 and get a restraining order against him but I’m scared he’ll come for us and try to hurt us intensely one day. "
84,3,"I always felt anger I can't express and I can’t speak to them freely I think that make me look 
Like dumb and they misunderstand everything. Recently I yelled at them to go die[ really i did not meant that], I'm still mad and anger I don't know what caused it, still I feel like some kind of creepy feeling to talk to my family, "
85,3,"Just think about it for a second: why does it make sense that we experience depression, anxiety, fear, anger, loneliness, and sadness when these emotions do nothing but cause destruction in our lives? What if I told you that all these emotions stem from a thought in our mind, and that we only experience these emotions if we believe the thought about them? This means they are made up in our minds; they're an illusion, imaginary, but we think they're real in our own minds."
86,3,"Title says it all. I’m not one of the people with anger issues who can’t talk about it. I’m open about my struggles with friends, can take a joke about it etc. That doesn’t make it right but i know some people who pretend it’s not a n issue. 

Despite this my friend expressed that he feels as though i’m unpredictable and has no idea how to deal with me anymore. This is coming off a few situations in the past few month. Basically one time i totally lost it on him and was ready to fight . The remainder of situations were stuff like slamming a desk or punching a wall while he’s around, nothing directed towards him. 

This is always my worst fear with this kind of stuff. That people will look at me completely different and give me no grace for those actions. Not that they have to, but when i’ve had stuff like this happen with other friends i’ve been given a little bit of grace I suppose. Some understanding that i’m not an unreasonable person but i’ve had a bad moment. "
87,3,"Not to get completely wasted, but just a few drinks to get the tipsy/giggly feeling? I start feeling so much more relaxed. 

I’ve tried so many coping mechanisms and none of them work besides a few shots of vodka. 

But If I drink too much I’ll start lashing out and starting problems w people. It’s a slippery slope and it’s hard to cut myself off. "
88,3,"I have had anger issues for ages and for years I've gotten so much better but dew to some recentish events that occurred, my anger has spiked. I'm so angry. How do I help that?? Seriously. I don't want to turn into a horrible person. "
89,3,"I worked at an courier outlet where i’m in charge of walk-in customers, packaging, and cashiering. But every little annoying the customer makes me angry. 

I may not scream or be very rude to customers most of the time, but, but my body language and tone of voice will show, that will make the customer also irritated by my behaviour or not comfortable.

I will tell you my experiences with them and what makes me angry.

The most frequently asked questions on the phone and face to face is the operation hours. Even though we already have the operation hours sign big enough for everyone to see in front of the door and in google maps. I guess some people don’t bother to read. They always look down on their phone when opening the door.  

Next, is the self collection. Customers must give the pin number to the courier outlet when their parcels have arrived at our outlet to self collect their parcels. The shipping fee for self collection is cheaper than door to door shipping. Some customers still go to our outlet and asked me face to face whether their parcels have arrived or not even though their status shown on their app to me already said that their parcels have not arrived at our outlet. I really wanted to say to their faces that they should re-learn reading at kindergarten, but i kept it to my self. 

Some customers(shippers) complain about the parcel they packed is damaged even though they are the ones that they have done the packaging themselves at home and are too stingy to buy a decent bubble wrap to secure the item. 

One customer gave our outlet 3 stars in google maps all because the staff don’t smile and not the efficient service given to her. As if you pay us to smile arrogant lady, you don’t even smile yourself. 

Some like to spy at the computer, some like to spy the door behind the counter. 

Some customers asking their parcels to arrive as quickly as possible even though they are should’ve to choose door to door shipping instead of self-collect, since door to door is a bit faster than by self collect. 

There are many things that customers irritate me, but this is it for now. 

Is there something wrong with me? I want to control my anger so that I don’t want to be unintentionally rude to customers and want to work without having this constant feeling.

90,3,"I’ve had rage as long as i can remember. I’m quitting alcohol after 4 years finally. It’s been ok but i know i drink when my rage is starting to make itself known. I had an episode today and I’m almost dizzy with the rage in my body rn. Nothing helps. Just sitting and breathing. I have justified reasons to be angry but this isn’t that. I’m full blown raging. I have to break objects when it gets this bad. I choose trashable items and destroy them. Obliterate them. It helps but holy shit, still sitting with this my body is vibrating. I hate it so much. 
I’ve been dealing with this for 18 years though therapy and meds. They don’t help when an episode gets going though. Just needed to vent and commiserate. People who don’t have his have NO idea how it is. They think they do though. Oh well.  TY for listening. "
91,3,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit, but I couldn't really think of any where else to put it.
So I definitely have anger issues just in general, and I'm working thru that and learning both manage my anger and violence while also recognizing that anger is a natural human emotion and not morally wrong to feel, just needs to be handled properly.
But I have one aspect that I genuinely cannot get a handle on, and it's birds. Why? Who knows.
As far as I'm aware, I have never had any negative interactions with birds. My mom has told me I used to chase seagulls and pigeons when I was really little, but lots of kids do that.
I don't think there's anything wrong with birds. I recognize that they are fantastic creatures and a wonder of nature for their flying abilities, not to mention so many of them are insanely smart and/or skilled. Birds are cool, and I think this is an objective fact.
And yet, every time I see bird, whether in person or in a video or picture or sometimes even drawings of them, I feel an unexplainable rage boil up inside me. I want to throw something. I want to hurt the bird.
I can't go to people's houses if they own birds. I have to be careful at the zoo and park (places I love to go to). Of course, I've never actually hurt a bird at all, nor will I ever, so my carefulness is more that I don't want to accidentally stress out the bird (idk they can probably sense emotions) and I also don't want to put myself in a bad mood since I know I'll get really pissed.
The other thing is that it has definitely gotten worse over the years, especially the past two or three. I used to not be like this, just got slightly irritated at the sight of them, but not to the verge of having violent thoughts and feeling actual rage, not just mild anger. This has been very distressing tbh, and what prompted me to finally post something about it is that I just saw a (really cool!) video of a parrot, felt disgusted and furious, and then cried for a while at how strong my hatred of birds is getting. I cannot handle this and I don't want to be this way.
Also I am currently actively looking for a therapist (for a multitude of reasons, not just this)."
92,3,"I hate her. Like there’s a little love because she’s my mom and we have some good times but if I met her as a person and wasn’t related, we wouldn’t be friends or talk. Every time we argue she always has to get the last word in or brings up something else when I’m winning. Like we were arguing over a suitcase not being packed in time and I explained to her how it was because she was out with her boyfriend etc etc putting across good points. How did she retaliate? “I see other people your age working three jobs! You sit on your fat ass all day”. Anyone that’s fat and grew up fat KNOWS that their mother LOVES to use that as an insult. It’s so hard not to beat her up and just throw shit at a wall. I’m covered in bruises and have broken a couple of knuckles from punching walls and stuff. Help "
93,3,"every time I join a fandom of an anime I find enjoyable, the damn fandom makes me so damn mad that I just wish and pray that everyone would die. Is it just me like that or no? Because Ik the fandoms such as mha are extremely delusional and disgusting, but damn I didn’t know it was that bad."
94,3,"A couple of days ago, I got fired because I was spreading rumors about a coworker who was an absolute asshole.

The reason why I decided to spread rumors about her, telling my coworkers that she could not be trusted, was that she called me a retard, which was extremely offensive to me since I have an intellectual disability. She never got in trouble for it or apologized to me for it. 

Additionally, she's a total hypocrite because when we first met, we were good friends and, in fact, followed each other on Instagram. A few months later, she blocked me, even though I hadn't done anything to make her want to block me. She told me that she didn't want any coworkers to be in her personal life, which I later understood and respected. About a month later, I was going to add a coworker on Facebook and learned that on his profile, she was friends with him. I was so pissed off because of her hypocrisy, and I feel like she lied to my face about it.

I'm furious, and right now, I feel like getting violent with her since I wanna get my revenge on her."
95,3,"Recently I (19M) went through a major depressive episode, I pushed people away, I locked myself in my room and I planned on killing myself. Well around last week, I started to feel better. My family only then started to be concerned... not when I was actively in depression but when I was actively doing better... and I'm losing my mind. I cant really get into it but all I can say now is every time I actively try to do better, its held back by my family trying to fix something that isn't there anymore. And I keep trying to explain, I keep telling them my plan ahead and they will not listen. I've struggled a lot with my anger growing up but I had it under control... But now all my sadness has been replaced with burning rage, I feel it in my chest from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. Because I feel completely unheard and feel like every conversation is so emotionally charged, I just can't. 

My depression caused me to think about and plan my suicide, but this anger is fuelling a more impulsive, destructive way of how I'm viewing suicide. It feels much stronger and less thought out, pain or suffering doesn't scare me, it feels like release. I genuinely feel like if I keep feeling like this I will end up killing myself in a fit of rage. Not because I want to hurt my family, but in the moment that rage feels just ingulfing. I have tried to reach out to therapists and none of them have gotten back to me. I don't know what to do. Has anyone experienced similar or has any advice? And please leave out messages telling me this isn't rational, or that I'm being ungrateful to my families help... I don't need that right now, I feel guilty enough. Thanks. "

I know logically it means nothing but I get this rage where I’d like to tear the door jamb out or throw the cup and burn it. I don’t act on it but sometimes I’ll voice my anger to my wife and she doesn’t know what to say because it’s over the most minute things. "
98,3,"I’ve always had a bad relationship with my aunt who is technically my mom ig? Apparently she lied to court and in my biological mom’s words stole me, but we’ve never really been good together only when I was a little girl. But she loves to make me mad then act like I’m the with the problem,she’s set on getting rid of me for the summer which isn’t going to happen but I didn’t argue much so I ignored her calling my gma and mom to take me and went to my room,I’m in my room chilling and she comes in my room and asks did I take her snickers I say no because I didn’t and have told her I don’t like them. She proceeded to dig her hand in my candy that was in the head of my bed and she looked at me like that look she gives when she knows something is going to make me mad,I snatch it away and she leaves so I wipe my angry tears and go into her room where she’s eating her snickers so I snatch them out her hands and take one. She gets up and says “we’re going to fight” she grabs me by my bra strap which I found later scratch my skin raw. She just held me there arguing I pulled away and went to my room we were still arguing and the words “I fucking hate you” came out my mouth, out of all the arguments we’ve had I never once cursed at her so I kinda surprised myself. We argued for what felt like hours and she does this weird thing when I say something she knows is true or curse she balls her fist up and starts sorta twitching or shaking like the demon she is threatening to fight me. Anyway I haven’t talked to her since and don’t plan to but what can I do? Aunt(63f) me(13f)"
99,3,"Have you ever journaled about all of the people who had a problem with you? I have recently. A lot of them I don't think I did anything really wrong to, although maybe I did mess up though sometimes. But most of them? They are horrible. Guilty. I am angry at them just staring back at me journaling. People dump on people and people dominate, overpower or manipulate.

The thing I'm angry about is that they were good at showing their anger at me. They won!

But, this is a mental trick. It could make me turn myself into a criminal or react with the wrong person in the future because I'm wired wrong now that I journaled about morons and negative stupid bullshit.

One example: My ""Life Coach"" was assigned to me because I had a rare painful neurological disorder that still hurts and he was using Heroin on the weekends with his old buddy and he lied to me that he was somewhere else. I couldn't tell he was even using. Then he gets into a Hit and Run with my car while on drugs and they impounded my car and saw my driver's insurance information in the car and the Cops came after me. He fled the state and got arrested back in his home state for drugs and got away with the hit and run with me. I AM ANGRY BECAUSE HE WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD LIFE COACH AND GOT ME TO THE DOCTOR TO GET MEDICINE THAT ACTUALLY HELPED. BUT I AM ANGRY THAT I LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT! That's just one example of many fucked up shit.

I don't want my own angry insanity to make me a criminal. I have gotten a little unlucky with other fucked up things because the wrong people were around me.

Maybe I am angry at criminals who fucked me up.

They say I was 'too nice' to people. And I say, YOU FUCKING PEOPLE ARE RIGHT! People take advantage of niceness because they are fucked up. Perhaps, I don't understand the nature of other people correctly. Maybe they are more fucked up than I thought. NOW I'M FUCKED UP JUST THINKING ABOUT CERTAIN PEOPLE. 

Wondering how people might rewire themselves or be good to themselves??"
100,3,"I don't really get angry at other people (not much, at least). I get angry at myself.

When I do things wrong, fail at things, make mistakes, or lose things (bad memory) I get extremely angry at myself. I end up screaming and shouting, self-harming, wanting to break things, etc etc. It's not good. 

From looking at the things that make me angry-mainly related to me failing or not being good enough-it seems sensible to conclude that it derives from my self-hatred and rock-bottom self-esteem. From there it has just become habit, an automatic reflex.

I genuinely do hate myself and I have no self-esteem, but I don't know how to change that. [I'm bad at everything I do no matter how much I try](https://old.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1ky61mn/im_bad_at_everything_i_do_no_matter_how_hard_i/), I have no good qualities, and even when I try to improve myself I fail. What's there to love? What's there to like? Nobody's gonna like themselves in that situation, surely?

So I don't really have a clue how to improve my anger issues. I'm not going to love myself any time soon, nor am I going to stop being a lifelong failure, but I don't know how to break the cycle of anger->depression->more self-hatred->anger etc etc. I can't just not do things that make me angry because otherwise I'd pretty much have to do NOTHING, it's no way to live my life.

I don't know how to break the reflex/habit when I can't break the root cause, though.

What do I do?"
101,3,"I would be nice and chill one moment, then I would suddenly want to scream at the very top of my lungs for absolutely no reason at all. Just scream until nothing comes out anymore, but I never actually do that."
102,3,"I think I need genuine help. I get angry over things most people won't even think about. For example, my closet door won't close, and is open maybe a centimeter or two, just barely enough to be noticeable from my bed. I've already thrown everything I can at it out of sheer rage and got so close to literally punching it clean off, I honestly don't know what to do. There are so many other instances of this, and I think I genuinely need some strategies that work. Things like counting to 10 don't work either because it just makes me feel even angrier. Any tips you have would be great."
103,3,"What are you trying to accomplish with anger management? What's a goal for the day? What's a goal for the long term.

If you're having trouble getting started, here's a writing prompt:

Today, I will be proud of myself if I...

I'll start.

Today I will be proud of myself if I can take a ride in our truck without complaining about traffic."
104,3,"I don't want to go to Anger Management. I prefer other people's OP's here actually. 

I have chronic pain. I never was angry until my brain became inflamed and I developed nerve damage.

I don't think it's wrong to read about other people's anger even though in my opinion, anger is the probably what insanity is all about. 

With a migraine, you remember all the people who verbally abused you, me I mean, the quiet guy or the nice guy. Now, things have changed. I am angry at thin air. That's better then being angry at actual people although I have done that at times but I don't want to and I told them to leave alone in pain.

But anger alone? It takes balls to get angry at an actual person in the room with you. But anger alone, that's different. Anger with chronic pain alone is a painful insane way to live. I don't recommend it.

I actually think that guying a heavy bag and boxing gloves at the sporting goods store might help. I do cardio at the gym and the endorphins make me normal and happy again for two hours but that's it's back to waking up from nightmares and being in pain.

Anger is inevitable. But not fair as to WHY or what triggers it for certain people. I was never like this before. Now, Anger is apart of me. I am more in touch with it. I understand why people hate each other. Personally, I just hate chronic pain itself. 

I am angry at pain itself and the impulses that pain can manifest."
105,3,"My dad has always been an extremely rude to my sisters and I. He always screams at us if we do the littlest thing wrong and he thinks we are like those children you see in the movies who are like absolutely perfect and don’t say a word and are clean and tidy. He doesn’t let us talk at the dinner table and if we do he screams and swears at us. He has traumatized me and my sister for our whole life. He once almost threw me out of the house because I didn’t listen to him and go downstairs when I just wanted to play with the baby and he only wanted me to go downstairs because I was making to much noise, so then he grabbed me by the arm and dragged me out of the door and said if you do this again your not welcome back into my house and I haven’t not listened to him ever since. He tells us to die every time we slightly disturb his sleep and always is willing to comment on everything we do, have, or wear. He has never been my father and will never be he doesn’t even know when my birthday is. When we were young he even used to abuse us he would slap us and drag us by the arm when our bones could easily break at that age. Like why have kids if you don’t want to bond with them and treat them like kids he always treated us like we were the ones who forced him to be our father.
Is anyone else’s father like this? "
106,3,"Hi, my anger is pretty bad and I’m told I need help but help usually comes with the stress of a financial burden, but the problem is my anger is always just shut out I recently came back from a long trip to another country for over a year, I came back to my family my mum however gave me a very cold reception, she was more upset I visited my dad first as he was closer than she was about seeing me for the first time in a year, my sister has been digging under my skin for 3 days trying to annoy me and i snapped today I shouted as she was trying to boss me around despite being younger and much lazier, she hit me because I went near her so I reacted and restrained her and called her names, as per usual I’ve been almost made to be the violent one and the one who needs help not my sister who lashed out at me with no reason, it’s not an isolated incident either it’s happened lots and my mum never seems to care even once when I mentioned I was suicidal to her she didn’t care and turned it to about herself it’s selfish she’s only glad I’m home because she expects me to get back to slaving away for her I just want someone to talk to other than my girlfriend someone on my level."
107,3,I'm 13 years old and today my dad kept yelling at me for no reason saying that I was talking back even though I was just asking questions Or trying to explain. He yelled at me he said he was going to hit me and I started crying and this happened like three times each time I'm getting even madder so it got to the point where I couldn't fold the blanket properly so I'm go my room  and started hitting my head and punching my thigh and I don't know what's wrong with me.

109,3,"I am diagnosed with many disorders that cause anger, as well as my medications, and i've always had severe anger issues. But I don't understand why it is so irrational. For example: a family member will politely ask me to walk the dog. And it ruins my day for at least a few hours. I don't know why I have such anger at that specific question. I'm pretty lazy, I also don't like to be told what to do. But it's unfair and immature and I'm not sure how to stop it. When i'm asked to do any simple favor or chore, I feel the physical pit of anger in my stomach and I feel like screaming. Is there anything I can do to stop this?"

114,3,"I live in a house share, I’ve lived here just under 2 years and will be leaving in approx 2 months
A new housemate moved in about a week ago 

For context, I am 6 months pregnant, so my body is absolutely raging with hormones, but I am trying the hardest I have ever tried to not completely lose my mind which is saying something when I’ve worked in call centres for 9 years

This new housemate… is infuriating to talk to

I spend a lot of time in the living room, I prefer watching TV there rather than in my bed, but since they have moved in I cannot just sit and watch TV in peace and the conversation being created isn’t anything of intellectual value or particular interest to me. It’s not engaging and I’m finding a lot of what they say to be frustratingly dumb, for lack of a better word.

Example 1:
Me: *preparing a jacket potato*
Housemate: do you like jacket potatoes then?

Example 2:
Me: *cooking*
Housemate: are you cooking tonight?

Example 3: 
Housemate: *sees I have started packing fragile items* are you starting packing already?
Me: yeah, I may as well start with the things I won’t need before I leave like wine glasses
Housemate: oh so you’re taking those with you then?
Me: well, yeah, they are mine 

Example 4:
Housemate asked me if sexual assault meant someone didn’t consent

Example 5:
Tried to tell me the bathroom door doesn’t lock and pushed back when I said it does…
Said the same about their bedroom door and I had to tell them the key is on the outside of their door
I explained all the lockable doors on the inside of the house had the same *type* of key, they tried to tell me that was insecure and I had to explain they’re not all master keys for all of the doors 

Example 6:
I had to explain why the alleyway next to our house goes all the way to the end of the garden and that is was not a road but in fact a right of access.. then they didn’t know what a right of access was

This one isn’t so much dumb, maybe actually lazy and borderline inconsiderate:
I have expressed that the bins are getting hard to take out/bring in because they’re heavy and I’m getting bigger, back pain, narrow alleyway etc, they took the recycling out to the bin which was still out the front of the house from Friday, my other housemate said she would bring it in but must’ve forgotten.. anyway when they came in from taking the recycling out they asked me if I wanted them to bring the bin round to the back garden *for me*. It’s not just my bin, it’s not just my responsibility, just do it. As I’m trying really hard to be cordial and polite I just said it was up to them and they chose to just leave the bin out the front. 

I don’t even know what to call this:
They keep coming to me about the gardening, they’ve said they want to start their own business as a landscaper… but they keep asking me about it like I have any authority to give them permission. Each time I have said they would need to speak to the landlord about it and assured them that the landlord is approachable and easy to talk to. Myself and the other housemate don’t particularly use the garden past the patio so the grass gets pretty overgrown and isn’t an issue that sits at the forefront of our minds, that being said our landlord is pretty quick to get on top of any issues raised, last week there was an issue with the washing machine, he came out and fixed it within a couple hours. 

They’re also sharing an extremely personal information with me in a very immature way. I am not an approachable person, and I know that, I have very few friends and have had managers speak to me about being conscious of how people find me, I’m not rude, just not particularly sociable unless I know you well and it tends to come across as unfriendly. My housemate, for reasons unbeknownst to me felt it was appropriate to talk about how they are trans mtf but not on any hormonal therapies, and not had bottom or top surgery. I had already said that what people choose to do with their bodies is nothing to do with me and I don’t care what they want to do as long is it’s not being rubbed in my face. I had previously tried to shut conversation of the topic down stating I don’t want to risk offending with it being a sensitive topic. 

I’m really trying to hold onto the fact that I will be leaving soon, but if they’ve managed to wind me up this much within a week, how am I going to cope and not lose my shit over the next 8 weeks…? I don’t want to spend the next two months just sat in my room, I work from home every other week and don’t work in my room because sitting on the bed makes my back worse. I realise it’s an accumulation of A LOT of little things in a very short period of time, but if this is any indication of the coming weeks, I’m going to struggle."
115,3,"TW: aggression towards animals 

I'm only here because talking to a therapist or psychologist is not something I can access right now. I struggle with anger management issues and sometimes it comes out at my partner's pets. I've hit them before. I'm ashamed of it. I've yelled at them and I've tried to work on not behaving that way but it's still hard because the way their behaviors frustrate me and give me more work. 

 I'm hoping that in posting it I don't just become people's punching bag. I know animals deserve respect as sentient beings. In theory a gentle and positive approach makes sense logically. And I've tried to implement it with his cats to curb their frustrating behaviors but I don't always have the patience. His one cat has particularly caused me to lose sleep for months. Having said that I know my reactions aren't proportionate to the situation. 

Everything I read about people who abuse animals online, all the medical and psych articles always depict the image of a ""criminal man who lacks empathy and will torture animals and will hurt their wife and kids"" but I'm female and I'm small. I can also recognize that my lashing out gets in the way of their behaviour changing because of being in a nerve wracking environment. I think I'm still in the throes of caregiver burnout from my last job (I quit nothing crazy happened but it caused a lot of stress)

 I want to reiterate that I've curbed my physical behavior towards them. And they've at least never sustained physical injuries. But I don't know how to deal with the feelings inside that spike and make me want to lash out. Honestly I don't even want pets but I can't afford to move out either because I don't want to force my partner to get rid of his cats because of me. 

I'm looking for any insights and help in addressing my own angry reactions because there aren't a lot of resources out there for people who perpetrate aggression and violence beyond like, deeply criminal behavior. I won't engage antagonistic comments. I'm putting myself out here in a hard way and already struggle with guilt. "
116,3,"I just can't deal with it anymore. I've never been an angry person, the contrary - I am usually chill with a patient of a rock. It used to take mountains and months to make me angry, and now I can't stop. I become aggressive, annoyed at everything and everyone, and I just want it to stop.

I started smoking about 4-5 years ago when I started getting nightmares after leaving abusive and violent relationship. It became a habit and it slowly crawled into my life. It used to be fun, and for the past year it just felt shitty. I can't go back to it. I refuse. But I also can't take the anger anymore.

When does it stop? What can I do to calm it down until this phase passes?"
117,3,"I would say to get anger out, get sticky note, write a big X then rip it in half. Another option is to stretch as that does put stress out. "
118,3,"We all been thru stuff. I been thru enough to have court ordered therapy lol when I get angry I can either go quiet n just be n ignore everyone around me except my kids obviously or I let it dig in then upset goes to angry then to pissed n that's when I start raising my voice. I rarely yell. My wife does things that I feel don't help n cause more work for me or money n when I explain or say something it became an argument. So when something goes wrong or something is getting to me she can tell something's bugging me cuz I just will be like tunnel vision on w.e. I'm doing like cleaning, or I'll just sit in my chair n stare off to space. N when she asks what's wrong I say nothing cuz if I bring it up it's an argument and I'm tired of arguing. Yes it's still not healthy but still I don't feel it's usually worth an argument. For example. The dishes no longer fit in the sink, if u turn the water on it goes on the counter... It happens every week sometimes twice a week. After so long of this it's not work getting worked up so I spend 20 min minding my own business cuz it's not worth getting everyone worked up. If I tell our daughter not to do something and she always turns around and says it's ok, it's so frustrating and so I will just go to the other room or just be n stare off into space cuz I can either raise my blood pressure and let it go n everyone's upset or just hold it in and keep the peace. Ya things mite be tense but there's no argument.  N yet people tell me this is mental manipulation?"
119,3,"A small detail or a tiny situation that sometimes doesnt involve me at all just drives to a boiling point on a couple of seconds, i dont want to talk i dont want to discuss , my first instinct is to raise my hand and you know what comes after that.. I used to be very agressive when i was a child, i got on heavy medication for depression and couple of things.. for 4 years i wasnt living, i got off everything and i only take an antidepressive, i feel so much happier and better overall, but this fucking rage i have its killing me, its the only thing that bothers me, ive been supressing it for almost a year, i havent broken any object nor did ive hurt anyone, but its hard, it almost seems impossible it makes me cry. I used to hurt myself to make it go away, i dont want to do that anymore..I dont want to hurt anyone, i hate violence, but i dont feel like myself when this happens. I dont want a healthy way to release anger I WANNA USE IT, ALL OF IT. Its not normal and its making me miserable, what do i do?"
120,3,"So I often had anger issues, and now that's slightly controlled, but one thing I can handle is the fact that my wife usually makes mistakes due to her always with her head elsewhere. To explain today, I would go to the gym and leave her at her work, and we have a remote control gate for the garage; she opens the gate for me and puts the control in her purse, but the control belongs in the car. I only realised I couldn't get home when I came, and I had to go all over back to her work to get the remote back. I was mad about it and I didn't pay attention she was helping a client I just asked her for the remote that she didn't notice to put on her purse and She start questioning me if it was true that she had the remote instead of just going to get the fucking remote so I can go back home and start working. I didn't yell cause I hate yelling, but I'm harsh when I'm mad. Anyways, I got back home 1 hour late for work, and later she messaged me saying I was rude to her in public, which made her uncomfortable. I feel bad about the way I handle stuff, but when it comes from her mistakes, made by always having her head in the clouds, I can't help it, and that happens often.

All that said, how do you guys handle that specific mistake that triggers that anger inside you? I'm a very tolerant person except when it comes to those issues. FYI, I did therapy for a long time, and that helped me with my anger issues, but I'm still not 100% in control of things"
121,3,"cues:

1. false accusation(s)

2. being blamed for no logical reason(s)

3. repeating the same sentence(s) multiple times 

background: had control over anger issues for many weeks, but suddenly they seem to be triggered, and even more in intensity than last time. feeling dizzy a little bit, it's been 15 mins since the last one. im scared of myself. life's not been good for a couple of days, slightly confused about the future and planning out things to not mess up in college (im 18, and about to move out). pardon me if my words are jumbled up. have a happy weekend ahead."
122,3,"Lately I can't stand people anymore, and I don't mean all people, but judgmental people, and especially those who make fun of you or laugh at you, even strangers, I often meet people on the street and I examine their body language extremely, I have autistic traits and this leads me to be super analytical in certain things, as long as people appear respectful and calm I have no problem, but as soon as I see a slightly critical look, a touch of the nose, a gesture that the other person doesn't like me, feeling judged for no reason makes me go into a rage and I would like to beat up anyone who despises me, I was a very shy boy as a child and I was always picked on, I never reacted and I was always silent even when subjected to the bullying of others, I hate those who judge for no reason, I hate those who behave like bullies and I always have, but the more I grow up the more I can't stand it, if I see someone who criticizes me even with a look I would feel like attack him, so that he understands that he must respect people, I'm seriously starting to hate human beings for how much they judge, maybe I'm weird but I've never felt the need to belittle someone or criticize them, I mind my own business, but most of the time it's not like that for others, I'm afraid one day I won't be able to control myself and end up in violent acts, I'm a fit person I train at home, in the gym I practice muay thai and yet it's not enough to vent this anger, I'm a fairly confident guy and yet I feel that everyone judges, and I can't stand judgment I can't stand negativity, maybe I'm flawed, but lately I'm starting to hate all people, I need advice and to share this, am I the only one?"
123,3,"My bottled up anger finally got the best of me and I blew up on a customer about 2 days ago. Customer comes in with his buddy and they want to get a refund on a battery to which I fetch my manager to explain to the customer the whole process. The customer's buddy is just acting like a smart ass and cracking all these remarks to my manager and I finally couldn't take it to which I said, ""if you're going to cop an attitude then shut the fuck up and get the fuck out of the store."" It took my manager to yell at me twice to finally get me to quiet down and go to the back, safe to say that I got an earful from my boss."
124,3,"I’ve had depression and body image issues for many years and I’m in a really bad place right now. I can’t stop sobbing.

For context, I have vaginismus and have never had an orgasm. My body is so broken. I can’t stop crying about it. I hate it so much. I hate being a woman and all of the pain that it comes with. I hate living as a woman, but I don’t want to be a man. I don’t think I’m trans but I just hate having the body I have. I hate being a woman.

I’ve been unhappy for so long. I don’t remember what it’s like to not be severely depressed.

I feel a lot of pain, hurt, fear, and anger around sex. I’ve never had it. I associate the thought of anything going inside me with physical pain and fear. I don’t feel any positive emotions around sex, just pain, hurt, distress, fear, sadness, and anger.

My parents are divorced. My dad is now dating someone who has multiple children (all boys). My mom has said “he has a new family now”. I feel a lot of hurt and anger about this.

And I know that he was just fucking this woman at first. I feel so angry and hurt that our value is based on our pussies. I hate being a woman. I hate the fact that our value is based on if a man can shove his dick into us and fuck us. I just hate it. I hate having the body I have. It’s horrible. I don’t know why it can’t function sexually. It never has, and I’m convinced that it never will.

And for people who say our value isn’t based off of that or only that: It’s why he moved her in. It’s why he’s with her. It’s why men value us, and it’s clear as day to me, as a woman who has a body that’s not good enough.

I feel so much pain around sex. It’s so unfair and distressing to me that our worth is tied to that as women. I feel a lot of anger towards men that they base our value and worth on our ability to be penetrated. I feel like I’ve developed such strong negative feelings towards sex because I know it’s something our value is based on as women, and my body isn’t good enough. My body has failed me.

I don’t have the worth other women have. I’ve sobbed about this for years. I don’t know what I’m cursed with the body I have. I hate it so much. I mourn the fact that I don’t feel like a woman everyday. I’ve cried about this probably over a thousand times over the years. I don’t think sex will ever be anything but a painful subject for me. I don’t think I’m asexual because I’m distressed by how my body is. I wish it wasn’t this way. I feel like I’m mourning my womanhood. I don’t know why I’ve not good as a woman. I feel so hopeless as a woman.

I lack the value other woman have. My body is hopeless. It’s just another thing in my life that’s betrayed me and caused me endless, deep pain. I feel so angry that this is what our worth is measured by, and my body has failed me.

I don’t understand why sex is so easy for other women and other women are able to trade access to their pussies for love, a place to live, a relationship, etc. but some women (like me) are trapped in worthless bodies like mine.

I hate that I’m a woman whose body has no value. Even in my father’s eyes, I have no value. I’ve been replaced. I don’t understand why it’s this way. I just hate being a woman and the pain will never end or stop."
125,3,"theres no way to let my anger out, i have to find a place and make sure no one is looking fucking grab my hair and let tears fall out my eyes, then act totally normal with everyone, repeat everything the next day. 

faking everything feels so normal now "
126,3,"So it's been like 20 minutes since this happened and the story begins when me and my friend were playing and a old lady came up to us and she told us that it's not safe to play here. Bassicly it was an old playground and my friend said sorry, but I lost it and yelled at her that I had the right to play there. I wanted to apologize, but I couldn't find her and it wasn't worth it. She could have actually told me that I was pathetic and if I apologized with money, she would have actually taken the money. I sometimes can't control my anger and I need help. Serious help. Just no therapy. I need meditation, I guess."
127,3,"Any person who has anger issues?
Ik it just weird but yeah
I want accountability partner for anger management

128,3,"Hi all, I F(19) have been struggling with my anger for years, the smallest things can go wrong and all of a sudden I've gone from being in a good mood, to hitting myself, punching things, screaming at my cat (I always feel so bad and guilty afterwards but I'd never ever lay a hand on him) screaming at myself crying because I feel like a monster. 

I don't know what could be causing this, I've struggled with mental health issues due to the abuse I faced growing up (Physical, Emotional, Sexual and Phycological) I've been focusing on healing myself over the past year and honestly I've made leaps and bounds, however my anger is the one thing I struggle to control, I do breathing exercises, I go out on a walk, I exercise or ill do housework.

I don't know if it can be due to me getting over stimulated with my adhd. However I've had a few councillors who have strong suspicions I may have CPTSD. Or I could just be an angry person in general like my dad used to be before he got better, and I'm scared because I don't want to turn into that. 

Any advice you guys could give me to help regulate my anger better, because it causes harm to me, and scares the shit out of anyone who witnesses it. "
129,3,Title I get very upset and internalize a lot so I think negatively a lot and say things that would hurt ppl but in my head idk what to do
130,3,"I’m 23f and my anger has controlled me as long as i can remember. it has nearly destroyed my family relationships, and it has completely killed friendships and romantic relationships in the past. My family has always had issues with it in the mornings, and used to be the most common time i would have outbursts. It was also the biggest issue that my last partner had with me. 

My current partner (M) and i were having a relationship check-in and my anger was his primary concern. in short, it’s daily, over very trivial things, and i seemingly can’t let it go. He said that it’s getting to him a lot, and that sometimes he just wants to say “have a good day for once.” I can’t say i blame him, because he’s right. I ended up having to step away from the conversation because i got so depressed about it, that the same thing that has destroyed all of my other relationships is continuing to crop up in this one. 

When i have outbursts, the anger tends to turn into unshakable self hatred and guilt. My anger is definitely something going on with me internally, and has less to do with the actual circumstances that i find myself in. i usually just try to sleep it off, but i would really like to have healthy coping mechanisms instead of internalizing it.

My partner recommended a dopamine detox and working on my stress tolerance. I recently started therapy, but have only had one session so far and would really like to know if there is any advice that this community could give me that i can start implementing immediately. 

Thank you "
131,3,I let a situation that was totally the other guys doing and made a complete fool out of myself cause I lost my temper with him. This person has been on the radar because of him pushing other peoples buttons and i should have just observed and reported it. Now my floor manager wants to chat on my next day at work (off for a few days) and honestly I don't know what to say. 
132,3,"I feel like everytime I see them I rage. I haven’t seen them in years but if I were to see them today I would scream my lungs out. I want them to feel my pain. I know it isn’t right but it just feels so good in my mind. And they don’t care. 

My ex cheated on me with some girl in his class. My sister had feelings for him and my sisters both cut me out of their lives to include him. As far as I know they’ve never became a thing, him and my sister. So we haven’t had a relationship in 4 years and I haven’t talked to my sisters in 2. I had suicide attempts, failed out of school, had to repeat a year and no one cared about me. 

So when I see them I just have so much underlying rage - and they don’t care. They don’t care if I am angry or sad or how I feel. They just care about having eachother, they don’t care that the family is split up. Like if I were to see them today I would be angry as fuck screaming, yelling about my pain. It isn’t healthy and not right but feels good. The only fantasy I have about seeing my sisters is screaming for me, for my soul, not for actually seeing them and missing them. I straight up don’t like anything about them. "
133,3,So recently I have started taking the therapy because I can not control my anger. Now my whole perspective has got changed towards anger. Instead of running away from it now I am trying to channelize it into the right direction. What I learnt is you can’t stop the emotion of anger. You should not suppress it either. You just need to express yourself in a right manner so that you can tell the other person what is bothering you without offending them or making them feel bad about them. There is just a moment of anger if you do react in that moment you are going to ruin things. Most of the things we do in anger we regret those things later so better control your emotions at that particular moment and let that moment pass. There are numerous ways to do it. Few of them are breathing exercises or try to drink some water or eat something. It will be and has always been a choice to react on things or get angry. You just need to make a right choice at the right moment. You never get hurt because of someone who doesn’t know you. You get hurt because of the people you love so try not hurting them by expressing your emotions so loudly. I have got to know about so many things in last few days though I have so many things yet to learn but I know I can do resolve my anger management issues.

135,3,"First time posting here. I’m trying to put into words how I’m feeling during my second postpartum experience.

I’m not sure if I’m depressed or if this is just the way postpartum feels.
I have a toddler (2+) and a 5–6 week old baby.

I’ve been having rage moments. Especially when it takes 2–3 hours for my baby to settle after feeding. I never know if she’s still hungry, gassy, or needs to burp. I try everything to make her feel better, but it’s really hard to stay calm after hours of trying—especially in the middle of the night. It’s so frustrating.
I have thoughts of just leaving her to cry and walking away. But I can’t.
So sometimes I scream. I punch a pillow or my bed frame.
I don’t yell at her, but I find myself asking her to “please just go to sleep,” like she could understand me.

With my toddler, sometimes I do yell—and I hate it. I try talking, I try being patient, and then I hit my limit. The rage just comes out of nowhere, and I feel like a psycho. Then the guilt crushes me.

Today we had a car ride where all three of us—me, my toddler, and my baby—were crying.

It’s just so hard. I have no help. My husband travels for work, so I’m alone with the girls a lot. When he’s home, he does help, but it’s usually when I’m already at my breaking point.

My doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin during pregnancy, and I’m still taking it. I managed to quit vaping while pregnant, but now I’m back to it. I was under a lot of stress during my second pregnancy. I’m not breastfeeding anymore and just got my period again, so I know my hormones are a mess.

I even considered smoking weed, but I’m scared of getting addicted.
I definitely need support. I honestly don’t know what to do.
Does anyone else feel this kind of rage? Please tell me I’m not alone."
136,3,"Every time a former friend is mentioned I become unreasonably, irrationally irritated (not at the person who mentions them, but at the former friend). I am generally able to work through anger and fear and take self-reflective inventory about them, but this issue has been going on for around a year and even though this former friend is no longer in my life, the mention of her name triggers something bordering on disgust in me. 

I am still very close friends with her wife, and so she comes up in conversation on her end often, and I want to be rid of this seething because it’s uncomfortable. 

The last kind of straw for me re: this resentment (though it isn’t at a particular event - just her existence and how she is - is disgusts me on a visceral level) was that my friend messaged me that their cat died. It was hit by a car. The cat was an outside cat and when she and her wife moved the wife insisted on keeping the cat as an outside cat, even though it wasn’t reacting well or acclimating at all well to the new surroundings. My first thoughts were that I wanted to know how upset the wife was - I want to know how poorly she’s taking it. I wanted to know if she felt guilty or if she was blaming the driver. I had no empathy for her and now when I try I still can’t muster any - just empathy for my friend who has to deal with the emotional fallout. 

My metacognition knows this is wrong and unkind and that it’s probably something I don’t like about myself that I see in her or something I fear but I’ve never felt this irritated at a person just existing before and it should be concerning. I don’t know where to start with this one. "
137,3,"Im not an outwardly angry guy, i mean im hot headed but i repress everything because im logical thinking stoic. 

So if you anger me and i show it you have really fucking angered me . 

I grew up in a dysfunctional household very abusive infighting daily basis as an adult i became much more chill around problems but to the point i am far too tolerant until people push me too far . 

At that point i initially deal with the situation but its the rage thst then begins to perpetuate because if a situation was only dealt with but the triggering situation or person still doesnt get the message thats when i begin to rage until at that point im thinking of violence . Generally i will try to calm down avoid the situation and rationalise the situation. 

Been listening to Dr Gabor about the difference in anger.

One anger is a natural reaction a healthy reaction to keep predators out of your space after that the anger can disipitate as its served its purpose

The second is unhealthy anger rage. Usually stemming from some for of hurt in the past

At a point i get so angry that i begin to focus soley on that problem somebody else might get angry deal with it then move on or they just brush it off. See it for what it is and distance themselves.

Were as i will get angry deal with it then ruminate then begin to rage until the next time im in the same situation im ready to get violent if i have to. 
Ive been pushed like that before which leads to aggressive irritable behaviour until everyone involved is intimidated simply by my body language . 

People fuck around way too damn much and with a history like mine my family history i put up with way too much bullshit from people before i get angry then im pushed to fucking rage

To me rage is the only thing that feels healthy  but takes alot to push me to.that stage "
138,3,"I’m a retired boxer with anger issues that are completely fucking my life up. After I stopped fighting 6yrs ago, I thought life would come easy (I mean how hard could it be after dedicating my entire life to training, nothing can be that hard, right?) but it’s been quite a fucked up journey. I’m also worried I might have CTE with the way I’ve been caring less and less about anger episodes. Definitely don’t fit the description of a sociopath but today for example, I failed an exam for my MBA that I studied my ass off for and thought I had it in the bag. I needed 85% to pass and got 78%. Without thinking, I fucking smashed my $3k laptop outside on the ground and so many people saw. Initially, I didn’t give a fuck. And honestly, was hoping someone would say a smart remark. Which would’ve been absolutely terrible thinking back on it. 

I’m losing my grip on giving a fuck and it’s scaring me. I have a beautiful family, great job and just a few friends and that’s how I like it. I can feel it in my gut getting worse and I don’t know how to control it. Anyway, I came home, told my wife and she calmed me down for a bit. Then, I go to take my garbage out and my new neighbor was walking her dog and he shit in my yard. She hurried and started walking away like she was afraid. I guess my vibe was still a bad one or something. I told her “are you fucking kidding me you stupid bitch? Let your dog shit in my yard and walk the fuck away like a slob” she then replied “I thought I had brought poop bags and forgot them, I’m going to get them right now, I’m so sorry!”. Man did I immediately feel like a fucking punk! I apologized and tried telling her about my day like that would make her feel any better.. I’m just waiting for her husband/boyfriend to come talk to me. Maybe I should go over there first? Or would that make it worse? I don’t know. Things just seem to be slipping away and I’m caring less and less. I don’t expect anyone to read this, I’m hoping it’s therapeutic to just get it out. Anyway, I’m going to seek therapy and reflect on how I can stay calm when shit goes from 0-100 in an instant. If someone does read this and has similar issues, I’d love to hear some techniques or just anything that helps you out. Hoping to be better asap "

I am so fucking angry. For so many reasons. Some of them are completely justified and some of them are completely immature and selfish.

I’ve wanted to destroy and kill and all that stupid shit but my god it’s fucking horrible and real in that moment.

142,3,"I particularly do this when studying and have got something wrong or am not progressing as much as I want to.

146,3,"Hi, on advice of my psychologist, I need to learn to get angry (yes a thousand hulk jokes here) and I need to find things that would trigger anger. Does anyone know any news sites/soc media that specifically reports on the most dastardly/worst things to help me feel angry? And I don’t mean just google news/fox news/cnbc or whatever. 

I find that most resources are on how to manage anger, but I kind of have the opposite problem. 

Any other resources to help trigger anger would be helpful thanks. "
147,3,I just had the idea. We could just vent about whatever is bothering/triggering us and maybe it will help it subside and be a better outlet than our families and friends. 
148,3,"I feel as if I have an in between point of anger that I sit in. There are time where little mildly infuriating things pass by me and I couldn’t care less about it and I move on giving it 0 thought. Where as other times, for a specific example when playing a video game with somebody and I am not performing well I tend to let it get to me, and I don’t want it to at all. 

I’ve been told that I seem more irritated/upset when things don’t go my way say in a video game or other instances which I believe to be fair for humans to feel such a way, just not to the levels of losing my self over it. I apparently also seem to have a more enjoyable time doing such things if they DO go my way, seemingly less irritated and more talkative, whereas the second that stops I go right back to being angry, ruining moods for anyone and everyone surrounding me at that given moment.

I believe this to be genetic as well, as my father had anger problems too that he never sorted out, which I don’t want to put blame on him and call it a day. However, I believe that is not something to ignore, either. It feels like a mix of genetic anger issues, lack of actual ways to go around and solve them, and not thinking PROPERLY before saying or doing anything very unnecessary.

How can I get around such things I’ve been trying to my whole life? I’m finally realizing the effects it has on other people, as well as the tolls it takes on me and I want all of that to cease. Any ideas, tips, solutions or calming suggestions are greatly appreciated."

150,3,"Hi! I just want to know why or how someone can be so angry at all times so I can understand my grandma better. She's always angry, she always has this angry tone, and she's verbally aggressive too. Even if we're just telling her something or when we're asking her a question, she always responds as if she's angry. Why is that? Maybe it has something to do with the way she grew up? There was a time where she also had beef and got really mad at the teenagers passing by her on the streets just because she said they ""looked"" at her wrongly (Which they didn't at all) 😅 so I'm really curious on why she's like that! "
151,3,"Ever get the feeling that whenever you feel silenced or accused by somebody you are in a fight with, and in the end you just get quiet?

Or like whenever nobody is listening to you so you get angry and just say “oh its fine”, and don’t talk for the rest of the day?

Its hard to describe, but I have been feeling that lately whenever Im in a fight with my sister, I don’t talk to her after. "
152,3,"TLDR: Is it better if I just distance myself until I'm no longer childish little fuck?

The title question is becoming harder for me to ignore the past few days. I apologize for the fragments; I'm piecing this together the best I can think of.

I'm concerned that I might have simply been born rotten, and, with my anger, doomed to distance myself from anything truly meaningful. I've had countless chances to pursue genuine connection with friends and most certainly with romantic partners, but I always stop myself short out of fear of having them face my childish, irrational, embarrassing anger. No one deserves to put up with the impudence, the belligerence I exude every day over nothing.

I truly believe I cannot integrate into a relationship, for example, because no one should live in a house where they're disrespected and threatened by their own partner. I cannot justify putting someone through my own bullshit.

I've people over the smallest infractions. I know for certain that I would be at least hundreds of dollars better off if I didn't break so many things. People would trust me.

I visited a psychologist and all he had to offer was that he thinks I could be living a happier life. No shit, doc! He told me to do more ""fun"" things. I avoid that because I'm concerned anything too positive will inevitably go wrong when I ruin them.

A few examples:

\- A woman tried to flirt with me by taking my hat at a party. I ripped it from her hands, stuffed it in my mouth, and offered (threatened) to put it back on her head.

\- I bought a new watch after smashing the old one. I smashed it again after two days.

\- If someone looks at me wrong in the street, I have to consciously decide not to clock them. Never have, thankfully.

I know living this way is slowly killing me, but I don't know what else to do. I journal almost every day and have begun running again, usually two miles a day. But, sometimes the running feels like less of a healthy outlet and more of a form of self-punishment. I never drink out of fear that I will have even less control, though I wouldn't even if I was normal.

At this point, I have to believe that it will be better if I detach myself from others until I'm not a horrible little bitch anymore. I understand that you can't just a person based on just a few pieces of themselves, but you have to look at things holistically, and I'm looking like hell."
153,3,"What did you do? Why did you do that? Why did I shout? Who am i? Im sorry that wasn't me. 
Listen i know your trying to help; giving me suggestions and trying your best to help me through this problem..but shut up, leave me alone, go away..GOD WHY DID I SAID THAT??? WHY is there a hole in the wall? Tv smashed? Phone across the room when I didn't go over there..? I don't remember, why are you crying? Why are you scared? What did i do? I didnt hit you. I didnt bruise you, why are you scared of me?
Oh god I did it again, im so sorry. I just see red. Simple problem turned sour, turned worse. I become someone else. I get so angry it ain't my fault.  My blood boils, i can't deal with it. I dont know why i am the way i am...why am i like this?

Anger issues are not a common issue, but it is treatable. Just wish someone was able to treat mine."
154,3,"Some people need lots of loving people around.

Some people need fewer people but more outdoorsy shit.

In reality, hatred doesn't exist.

Hatred and love are just the extremes of affection.

The opposite of either hatred or love would be total apathy towards the situation. Apathy means total lack of feeling. When you literally just don't even care anymore, meaning you could pack up your shit, or even just take the clothes on your back, and just dip without giving a fuck and be in the streets not particularly giving two fucks because that person or situation making you feel so damn angry is no good for you.

My voices and I, we like our street life.

But we do need sleep.

People, when we get all doomy in our heads and wonder about the bad things, can sometimes develop anxiety. This anxiety can have mighty effects on the lives of sufferers,  resulting in varieties of unique stress responses. Often, people who experience anxiety will only feel comfortable when or soon after conducting certain routines.

Disruptions in the anxiety-sufferer's self-care routine can cause the individual to become angry. The routine helps them feel okay, almost like they are in control about something in their lives, and when this routine becomes broken or inconsistent, anger begins bubbling to the surface.

Of course, not all people have compatible routines. We really don't.

When anger goes too long unchecked, hatred is born.

But there's no reason to hate people. I love people, really too much.

I just feel like distancing myself because I don't want people to see me or remember me in this terrible state, afraid it would hurt their mental health seeing me being so shit and absolute lame."

157,3,"There are surprisingly few resources on the internet that even acknowledge that women are just as capable of violent rage (throwing things, punching walls, etc.) as men. I know it doesn't happen often but it does happen. I've seen it with my own eyes. I've done it myself (I probably have IED). It's a result of ongoing trauma and CPTSD. I have never inflicted violence on anyone (drunkenly swung at a couple of people in my youth and fought someone who fought with ME first, that's it) but what is this apparent assumption that women are incapable of blinding rage? I have lost count of how many times I have punched walls, cars, random surfaces, glass, thrown appliances across a room, became visibly enraged enough to scare people twice my size. I'm not proud of any of this, it's a problem that I'm working on. I feel like if maybe this was recognized in women or even studied more we might have a more realistic, balanced few of gender and society, maybe a lot of us would get the help we need instead of being told to meditate.. idk man.

162,3,How do you deal with rage? With as minimal effects as possible and how do you prevent it in the first place?
163,3,"
   I'm not usually a very angry person. I say I tend either be a passive emotional presence anytime I can, or I intellectualize an uncomfortable emotion I'm feeling in order to reassure myself of what it's made of.

   Anyway, I've been developing a misanthropic emotional world lately. I've been obsessed with evil, and to me, things like giving compliments, or needing love, have this transactional undertone that has always bothered me, but whatever, I've always been stoic about it. Recently, my feelings have transformed into more of a rage or hatred for desire. Things like hedonism and emotional weakness leave me feeling disgusted and immensely lonely.

   I've been looking into the Abrahamic religions to see how they psychoanalyze our relationship with our innate evil, and it's been helpful. But at the same time, this innate evil problem has no real consolation outside of needing an external savior to come down and stoop and relieve us out disgusting evil because we're too helpless.

   One thing ive been doing is writing fiction that's trying to live out these feelings of anger as entities inside of us, jerking us around and commanding us and showing us truths, inorder to get to the bottom of where this is coming from. My prose is dipped and seething with rage, and hopefully if I use active imagination enough, some moral with naturally emerge from my fiction.

166,3,"I was at school today, and there's this pick me girl who thinks she's one of the boys or something. Anyways, really annoying. So i was just minding my own business, trying to get to my class when all off a sudden, they stopped me and told me to skip class with them. 


They wanted to skip with the whole class, so no one would get in trouble (well we would anyways but i guess she just wanted to take everyone down with her.)
I said no, obviously. I'm really focused on studying. So the girl grabbed my back pack, after a while i let go of it. Then the boy that she always clings to also tried to stop me. At that point, it wasn't malicious like idk maybe they thought i would give in?


Anyways, so i try to free myself from their grip, but it wouldn't work. I had 2 people in front of me holding me, and that girl grabbing me by my waist from the back, i believe. At that point, i was so mad... 


like i had so many people touching me, screaming to give in, and to just do it, oh and not to mention, the hall that we were in was crowded af, so i had even less space to move.

Some claim they know what kind of partner I’ve always wanted just because I said something offhand as a kid. Others are convinced I’m unhappy in my relationship. There are people who believe every move I make is just to hurt someone else, or that I’m heading straight for disaster. I've even heard people confidently spread false things about me—like that I lost my virginity at 16 just to get it over with, when that’s not even remotely true. Some say I’ll end up a single mom, as if it’s carved in stone. And worst of all, people who barely know me have labeled me “everyone’s mattress”—as if I’ve slept around, when in truth I’ve only been with a few people. Even though I keep my distance and try not to share much, somehow people still interfere, manipulate me, and try to control my narrative. Sadly, sometimes it works. I'm trying hard to stand my ground and not let them influence me anymore, but it's a long road—and the anger keeps coming back. What hurts most is when I defend myself and people respond with, “But I trust them more. They know what you said.” As if my own voice doesn’t count. All I want is to live my life on my own terms. Why does everyone think they know better than I do? It’s my life. For god’s sake, let me live it."
171,3,I just feel like someday some asshole will cross the line i wouldn't be able to stop myself from punching him in the head even after his knocked out. Or maybe some guy will hit his head on concrete after i punch him. I have history of really bad anger issues and violent behaviour and i'm a bigger guy with amateur boxing training. This idea that i'm gonna end up in prison for manslaughter has haunted me for years
172,3,"Sometimes, I don't feel like controlling my anger, but I know that the way I've been expressing it is not productive and hurts the people around me.

I grew up in a household that still tells me, even in my adulthood, that any emotion other than happiness is not okay. When I hear that, it makes me feel invalidated and even angrier. My anger is also tied to my perfectionism. My parents used to slap my hand and berate me literally over spilled milk. One of my parents also always verbally abuses the other. They used to come home and take all of their work-anger out on us. I feel that memories of the trauma they inflicted upon me adds to how frequently I blow up.

The adults used to almost never listen to me or believe me, even when I was in danger. Unfortunately, I did fall prey to child predators, and this causes me to have some trust issues. Because my family wasn't there for me, I feel that I have a lot of pent-up anger towards them.

I'm rarely angry at strangers or people at school; I mostly blow up at my family over the smallest things. I blow up at my mom the most, yet she deserves it the least. Maybe I just feel comfortable around her or that she'll likely forgive me, because she's the nicest one out of everyone.

\*During\* my anger, I don't feel regret. I probably shout because I feel that that's the only way I'll get heard. Actually, I'm still not heard anyway... I throw tantrums just to get out of a two-hour lecture. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that my family will lecture me for that long. I know that none of this shouting is productive. In fact, I feel sorry when I put my victim in a bad mood AFTERWARD. I don't think I've ever developed any coping mechanisms. I have learned breathing, but maybe I don't try it when I'm angry, because I'm afraid that it'll fail. I don't know how to separate a lot of my small problems, so they just snowball all into one until I blow up at a family member."
173,3,"whether I need to act out in anger or just sit down and eat a nice healthy snack.

I need to eat a vegetable every day, I noticed, or else I start having bad days.

Not just talking about constipation, but also mental focus and overall health. Your organ systems need nutrients to function.

Just thinking.

Edit: to add to that, dehydration makes me a dumb bitch. A glass of water or a few helps a lot."
174,3,"I get really pissed and it usually results in me screaming and smashing my own stuff (I dont really m feel bad since its my stuff) and its the only thing that slightly satisfies me

I’m sick of this being used against me in arguments and also as a reason why I “need to be restrained” I never physically attack people but lately I just want to hurt my sibling

Is there anything that actually feels good to do that will make me not want to be aggressive? Punching a wall or screaming into a pillow just doesnt work"
175,3,Looking for something specifically for anger and social anxiety.
176,3,"Yes, it seems silly and I’m sure it makes me sound horrible.

I absolutely loathe when people ask me questions or ask me for help. I find everything out myself, all the time. I never ask for help for anything. A thought comes to my mind either I sit and think about it, Google it or look at my resources and find my answer/conclusion.

The fact that people don’t do the same thing makes me angry for reasons I’m not sure of. If I had to search it up and look for the answer why can’t you? If I had to do something myself why should I help you? 

For example: I started my own business and shortly after my sister decided to start her own business that was very similar to mine. She would constantly ask me questions like how did you get this, how do you do that, how do you find this? Etc. I would leave her texts on read which I know is very mean. But when I saw her in person and she kept asking me things I snapped and told her if I can figure it out she can too and asked her how shes going to handle things herself if she’s asking me questions for every little thing “this is your thing not mine”. She ended up crying and saying she doesn’t feel supported and if she could figure it out herself she would which made me feel horrible but still I get mad every time questions are asked.

More recently one of my business posts went viral and I’ve been flooded with messages from people in the same field asking questions like “how did you make this video, how did you shoot this angle? Can you send me the link to ____??” I’m enraged and I don’t get why!?? I should want to help people. I do want to help people but my anger gets in the way. 

Even the most simple easy to answer questions set me off. I try to calm down and breathe I do my best to answer but at the end of the day I’m still mad about it, why? "
177,3,"I 14m have always been a very angry person an now am a bit worried (i think) about how its gonna affect me, me mum an dad have screamed at me for ordering knives an tasers to the house an i have told them loads of times that i might seriously harm someone an they dont even care, they just try an blame it on social media or something, i recently jumped someone over snapchat beef an busted his lip with no remorse, i am scared that i will kill someone in the future but no one seems to give me the right guidance "
178,3,"Unfortunatly, I did not become a well balanced adult. I was temperamental during childhood and still am easily frustrated. It is very embarrassing  for instance at work, since it is childish behaviour and it is expected that one is capable of acting calmly."
179,3,"I feel that anger is part of my underlying state of being. There are so many things to be angry about. My family though, they are perfect. I had the best childhood anyone born to 20y/os could hope for. My younger sister and I were always best friends. I never let on that I have been angry like this, especially because I always cry out of frustration. Recently I told my family how I feel and even though they have always made me feel so safe and at home, they left me feeling alone for the first time. 

I feel like my vision is washed in a color that they have never seen before, and how do you describe a new color? 

They say they feel angry, and they tell me things that happen to them that make me angry. In fact, I’m almost always feeling angry for somebody else or for whole communities rather than for myself. But even so,,,, they just ,,, get over it. 

That’s the advice they give me too. “Care less” 

I can’t do it, I am now starting to believe they simply don’t feel this feeling. They get logically upset, but they don’t feel this. If they did, they would see me in this color. "
180,3,"I get so angry out of nothing,  like literally nothing,  I will be sitting having a nice time and my brian suddenly decides to get angry. Like so much I'm scared. I have a very messed up family. I start thinking about them. And I'm ready to do I don't know what. I live a difficult life, I never been asked out or had a relationship and am going through financial hardship,  so I guess I don't realize how much it's taking a toll. Like I'm very upbeat , have a lots of friends. But sometimes in so angry and I contain it, it's so laborious I think it'll take a toll on my health. 
Any advice? "
181,3,"I’ve had anger issues my whole life. I haven’t been this angry in years. I thought I got my anger under control. I’m not sure what set me off, but today, I repeatedly screamed and cursed at a stranger in public, in front of everyone. I felt like I wasn’t in control of myself. I feel like a fraud because some people have told me I’m so calm. Am I a bad person? If so, much time has to pass before I I’m not a bad person?"
182,3,"Sorry for getting format wrong. I don't post on reddit ever. I don't know how to deal with my anger towards my mom anymore and I feel like I'm on the brink of hurting her. I (15F) always get good grades and I'm usually scared of her whenever she had outbursts at me about my grades (I usually get all A's and B's but this year has been kind of rough, still maintaining A's and B's but failed a test recently) She found out about the failed test and told me that I wasn't going anywhere and that if I kept this up I wouldn't even make it into a community college that is notoriously bad. I've been feeling like I'm on this edge of just completely snapping and going batshit and hurting her or myself but tonight I got really close. She just started commenting about how I wasn't committed enough to being a good student to ever take any AP classes (I participate in multiple varsity sports as a sophomore as well as being a part of a local nonprofit where I spend a lot of my weekends when I'm not studying). I just couldn't take it and I grabbed one of my cleats and I was so close to just beating her, and I  had to bite my arm and sit in the dark for \~10 minutes before I could go back to studying. She later came in and 'asked' (interrogated) about a missing assignment. I got really angry again and I grabbed one of those metal wasp repellant cans and told myself the next time she came in I would kill her. I feel so guilty now that I'm slightly less crazy feeling. I was just wondering if there was a way to deal with this aside from just staying at someone else's house for the next while. Or any coping mechanisms because I don't want to hurt anyone but I'm scared I will. I hope this isn't too similar to a rant. Sorry. I'd like any advice. I just don't want to have to feel like I'm one argument away from being locked up."
183,3,"I feel so powerless against my anger and the destruction it causes. I need tips badly. I've tried visualizing situations that typically upset me but when I do that my mind wanders, can't focus, and it takes a ton of mental strength. It's TONS of effort little progress then when I stop, I snap right back to constant explosive anger again. No goal has seemed to work. Being easy on my self doesn't seem to stop it and being tougher on myself self doesn't seem to stop it either. I feel so unlucky to have this freaking anger issue put on a choke hold on me my entire life."

185,3,"My older brother (22M) is abusive to me (18M) and this has been happening for many years since I was small. From young he has been violent to me, punching, kicking and even on a few occasions spitting at me. Emotionally too he says a lot of hurtful things, like I’m a nobody, while he talks about how great and mighty he is. Because of parents are divorced, me and him live together, our parents live elsewhere. These past few weeks have been hell. 4 months ago, in public he grabbed my neck twice, punched and pushed me, and always shouts and scolds me, while saying lots of hurtful remarks. Today, not long before I am typing this, I just came back home and he started shouting at me and when I raised my voice to defend myself, he grabbed my neck again and hit me. And he said “I can do whatever I want, what are you gonna do about it” I tried talking to my mother about this, but all she says is pray for him. I don’t know, but he smokes weed likes 2-3 and drinks a fair bit. Please, what can I do"
186,3,"M22 here. For a little context, I've never been able to properly express my anger since early childhood. I always got punished for yelling or showing frustration so I just learned how to bottle it up for the majority of my life. People always assumed I was a naturally calm and collected person but in reality, I just don't know how to get angry without years upon years of rage spilling out all at once.

I work as a floor supervisor at a venue/nightclub and it's a decent job with a lot of physical labour. The only thing that irritates me is the GM breathing down my neck 24/7. He's absolutely neurotic about certain things and he always manages to push my buttons in the worst ways. 

Yesterday, we were doing a changeover from a comedy show to a nightclub and were given a 45 minute timeframe do so; Definitely not an easy task by any means but that's just how the job is. Things were going smoothly until one of my newer floor members started mopping the dancefloor, which caused the GM to flip the fuck out and start yelling at me; Asking if I was a fucking idiot for letting my colleague do that.

In recent years, I've come to find that someone yelling in my face is a huge trigger for me. So for a good minute I was completely prepared to lose a decent-paying job and possibly catch an assault charge just so I could bash his fucking skull in. Luckily, for his sake and mine, I removed myself from the situation and tried to cool down in our beer storeroom. I couldn't stop myself from shaking and I even punched a case of Budweiser (a few bottles broke but they don't know it was me). It took me like ten minutes to leave the storeroom and pretend like nothing happened.

I think I'm writing this here because I'm scared of what I could do if I'm not able to remove myself from a situation like that again. Years of repressed anger has started to leak out and I feel like a ticking time bomb. So, I guess I'm just looking for some advice from people who have gone through/are going through similar emotions and experiences. Thanks for reading"
187,3,"Whenever I'm (26f) really angry I will start to raise my voice and shake, but if l'm really really angry I get really calm. My voice is still shaky but I say things in a monotone way.

For example, I had this housemate and they were the worst. Very inconsiderate, stole stuff, was rude to guests (like borderline sexual harassment). I had brought this up a number of times with them and they would stop for a week or so and then continue the behavior. 

When it was at the end our lease they asked when We were renewing it. I just got eerily calm and started listing all the ways they had made my life hell. It scared me, it scared them, it scared my friend who was witness to it. It doesn't happen often (only a couple times in my life) but if it does it's always terrifying for me. 

My mom used to do it and it was terrifying as well. Is it genetic? ls it because l'm bipolar? What the f is going on?"
188,3,WHY DOES EVERYTHING MAKE ME SO ANGRY… it’s like I’m only capable of one emotion. I’ve been working so hard to control my communication and trying to not let things just make me upset but I always end up just mad at myself for letting myself get mad haha. It’s like I have something to prove not even to anyone else to myself. As if everyone is attacking me and I have to be on defense at all time. I just really need to get to a place of everything just rolling off my back… maybe one day. Hopefully soon haha.

192,3,"Hi, I’m a 15 y/o girl. For the past few months I have been having increasingly violent thoughts about hurting people, especially my dad. My dad and I have always been at odds. We are really similar personality-wise and are both very set in our ways. It has been the cause of many problems in our relationship ever since I was little. I don’t hate my dad, no matter how angry I am at him, I still love him. He makes me furious, however. Sometimes I wonder what he would do if I took a knife and threatened him to listen to me. Would he actually, or would he just ignore me again? How violent would I have to get before he saw how mad i was? Would my mum defend him? Would I hurt her in the process? What would happen if I drew blood? Would I go to jail? Would I hurt others? I’m not a bad person. I don’t want to think these things, I really don’t. I’m just so scared of those around me. When my friend annoys me, I have thought about strangling her with my hands. When my cat meows too loud, I imagine myself throwing him against the wall (I love my cat and would kill myself if I ever hurt him. I have cried myself to sleep knowing I made him upset if I yelled at him). I just don’t know if this is normal or not. My family doesn’t really talk about mental health much. I have self-harmed in the past. I used to cut myself but not anymore because it stands out too much. When I get mad I usually scratch my legs with my fingernails, drawing blood and causing scars. I get angry at small this sometimes. Today, my phone was really slow so it slammed the edge of it into my leg and now i have a bruise. I have punched a wall, thrown my phone at the wall, punched my head until I was lightheaded. I have written suicide notes and been admitted to the psych ward for a few days because I was scared I was going to hurt myself. I don’t want to go back. I have a counsellor but I feel like this is too big to talk to him about. I really hate being away from home and do not want to go back to the hospital. I am already on Sertraline and Quetiapine for my anxiety and depression so I don’t want any more drugs. I just want to know any tips or if I should talk to someone about this. I also am diagnosed with autism, idk if that matters. Thank you so much for listening to me. I just want help."
193,3,"Sometimes what my partner says infuriates me. For instance today, he hadn’t paid attention to something I repeated almost 3-4 times (about booking a ticket for my commute). When I knew that infuriated me (him not listening) I asked him to go off and he kept talking and it kept getting worse… whatever he said made no sense, I got too furious that I raised my voice and he kept asking me to lower my voice. That made me angry and I ended ip hurting my hand. 
I just cant. I find it so hard around people who make it all worse. I don’t want that. I hate this side of myself. I don’t know how to escape the situation. I just need some peace but it just keeps getting worse when the other person keeps going and not understanding. Why is that?
I want some solutions please! I can’t go like this. "
194,3,"I really really don't like to be violent in any way. I take a lot of pride in having enough self control to not resort to violence except to defend myself or others which has only come up once in 15 years.

I did get in a few fights in my teens and as a kid and I scared the shit out of myself every single time. I swore I would never hit anyone or throw anything when I am angry, and I have not done it AT ALL in over 15 years.

I will admit I know exactly why I want to fight, my wife left because I didnt try hard enough or at all (even for myself) when I had the chance. There is other stuff but she is done and won't even let me fight for it now. Believe me all I've been doing is fighting and begging and I know I screwed up but I know how and why and I can do it right but I get no shot!

I'm even angrier because when we where trying to fix it she asked if I ""fought for our marriage today"" and I said I'd worked on it because I don't like the word fight because things can be worked through rather than fought over. I was mistaken in that thinking and I know what they mean now. I want to fight for it by working through the issues.

I just want to know how to make this STOP again. Fighting is all I think about right now and even with all that's going on I do not mean to fight with her at all I want to fix that. I want to fight another man preferably someone bigger than me. 

However I am not that person anymore I chose peace a long time ago. I'm so confused and I have no idea. I just want to fight for no reason! It's ecstasy just imagining it. I'm thinking of asking my old friends to accommodate this but I don't want anyone to get hurt except me."
195,3,"When I get angry I tend to simply zone out as my face goes into a neutral shape. Then I am usually barraged by violent thoughts but I don't get outbursts usually.

197,3,"I basically was just psychically attacked by a young couple at the grocery store, they were like two “Regina George”s

They laughed at me as they passed me, who knows why, because they’re mean spirited and douchey🤷🏼‍♂️ I engaged them and tried to be friendly, amazingly I had passed the guy walking while I driving 15 minutes earlier and tried to engage him about it, I was being optimistic that I was wrong and I’d get a good response, I look over at the girl and she is just BEAMING at me with a full smile and smiling with her eyes and I smiled back, I let the convo die and put my head down and as they passed she snorted laughed at that/me. I couldn’t believe it, and then they just started laughing and giggling to themselves like crazy.

So I was right, they were assholes. I was very upset lol. Before I left I went out of my way to pass them, well, I was headed in their general direction to another part of the store for something else right before I left, but yeah, I walked right passed them so I could tell her that she was rude.

I was hurt. I’m still hurt lol. I’m ashamed to admit that I keep having compulsive thoughts about beating them up 😅 I’d never act on those thoughts of course I’m sure they’d think me being so frustrated and affected would be hilarious. This or, I’m thinking about a survival scenario where they needed help and I wouldn’t help them 😂 it would be hard for me to show kindness to these people now

They just thought that I’m the funniest of all time. A very small man they think I am lol. I guess they’re right. Man I would NEVER treat someone like this stranger or friend

I was going to call my Mom tomorrow for the first time in a long time but I feel like just telling her the next day would be better, I’m ashamed to admit thatI’m that shooken up.  I don’t know why people are so heartless sometimes, you never know how somebody is really doing when you come across them.

I was so cool and friendly to them, they were so amazingly mean spirited, laughing at strangers. I’m traumatized man, and yes, It makes you REALLY appreciate people who pass you that just mind their own business. What the hell is wrong with people?"
198,3,"I am finding massive cognitive changes when I heavily dose on magnesium supplements. I can go from snippy to smiling very quickly, but let me explain.

I have been putting magnesium citrate into my homemade electrolyte drink, among other salts, because I get cramps so easily. But I have had trouble getting the proportions right. I ran out, and finally just made a lemonade with a gram or so of the magnesium in alone, to help with some Charlie horses. My whole body felt tingles, my muscles kept twitching involuntarily and then releasing like I'd had a massage. It made me very sleepy, too. The cramps evaporated, and my mood elevated amazingly, though I became drowsy. I have always tried to keep the salts in proportion, because I have heard that imbalances can be very unhealthy. But now I suspect I have a chronic magnesium deficit, which seems a pretty common problem.

I have had my electrolyte levels tested several times, because cramping is a serious problem for me, but they always show normal. Doctors have only blown my complaints off and said nothing is wrong with me. And yet, after any serious exercise I can become completely debilitated by massively painful full body cramps, like a Charlie horse in my whole body. I can't straighten or bend without causing the cramps to shift to different muscle groups. It's all I can do to get to some pickle juice and then put Gatorade or similar in my body and hope it helps. It takes electrolytes and about an hour for the cramping to go away. And it hurts bad enough to make me stand very still and cry in the meantime -- a truly horrible thing to wake up to in the middle of the night.

Plus I have always had anger issues, too. There are good reasons, which I have gone into elsewhere, but I don't want to compound this discussion. The magnesium seems to have real effect on my anger management as well. There are visual changes, too, as if I had gotten high or something, colors become less gaudy but also more vibrant, and it's as if details are clearer somehow. I don't know how much is psychosomatic and how much is a real cognitive effect, but I go from grumpy to whistling in no time. With constant goosebumps and body shivers.

I'm assuming I have a massive cellular deficit of magnesium that doesn't show up in blood serum. According to the internet, supplementing daily will eventually build the supply back up, but it could take as much as a year if the deficit is substantial. There is a headachy feeling when I take too much, but it goes away if I take a calcium supplement or just a cheap antacid tablet.

My question is about the anger, though. Is this actually having a mediating effect or am I reaching? It seems to make me feel substantially better, less angry, and it feels like stress relief. But is it just a drug-like effect? Or a placebo, psychologically? Am I masking anger or is there a known effect here? My anger issues are pernicious and ongoing, as my situation cannot change and I have reason to feel my anger continually renewed. But magnesium now seems to greatly help. I just don't want to set myself up for false expectations, thinking my attitude can be improved by simple supplementation if that isn't so.

So far, I am definitely finding that increasing my magnesium intake helps, as a supplement seems to stop acute anger attacks and helps with dehydration, which also seems to lead to a poorer disposition in myself. Is this real? It really feels like taking drugs, the effect is so immediate. It's been a few weeks now, and I definitely find my attitude crashes after coffee or pop or alcohol, but seems to get right back on track with just a magnesium supplement. I don't get so sleepy anymore, but the goosebumps and muscle twitching still happens. My flexibility is returning and I only get cramps in my hands sometimes now, though those go away after supplements, too.

Is there a massive cognitive role for magnesium? I know about the muscle channels and the magnesium/calcium nerve cascades to fire muscles. But are there synaptic uses for magnesium, maybe? Or other cerebral systems that may be misbehaving? I had a crying jag the other day, for no apparent reason, just out of the blue while watching TV. It was very cathartic, but had no connection to anything. I'm wondering if my brain is readjusting to a new chemical balance. Would magnesium actually have such an effect?

There are a number of things that might have impaired my ability to uptake magnesium, and honestly it seems like my body flushes it out more quickly than I absorb it. I can definitely feel a difference when I have my morning coffee now, and a supplement in midmorning helps my mood from crashing. It all seems too easy and very unlike anything I have ever read about. Obviously magnesium supplements cannot be a panacea for anger issues, yet it seems a major component that has gone overlooked in me. But I don't really know. Is this possible or am I conflating something else?"
199,3,"I am a low activity (maybe lazy) person who wont go out of my way to exercise. I usually prefer drawing, playing games or scrolling videos and online novels during my free time. Not really the expressive type either.

I've been seeing a pattern that whenever I do something that require more movement than my usual, i get irritable easily, especially when talking to people. 
For example: 
- I went out to the mall to buy something, walked for a while, didn't even break a sweat. Get home, my dad criticize something i did as usual, if i didnt lose my temper, my mood goes to the lowest point for the whole day. 

My point is, I am used to my fam criticism usually since its almost a daily thing for years and its not really a anything serious. I usually let it be and stay silent, the anger was momentary and i didnt hold grudge. But for some reason, i lose my temper and more likely to lash out during arguments whenever I do some sort of physical activities prior, even if it is not strenuous activity like walking outside or talking to someone else longer than usual.

It's almost like anything that consumes stamina makes my emotion more active? Or is it because of stress from doing something outside of routine?

Is this normal or is there a name for this kind of specific anger trigger?"
200,3,"ring doorbell caught me in extreme anger. I'm a good person and i don't want people to think I'm a bad person but when i get angry I just lose control of everything and i do become a bad person, i actually want to hurt any being i can get my hands on.  What do i say if the ring doorbell person says something about it? i really do feel bad its not just me being embarrassed. I'm even completely self aware in the moment but my body just takes control. I don't want another person to avoid me because they are scared of me and i don't want to be viewed as a monster by another person. I don't know what to do."
201,3,How do you manage anger from your ex husband 
202,3,"When I get angry it’s usually at my job. At previous jobs, I have thrown boxes, yelled, cursed, and even on the drive to and from work I’ve basically screamed in my car until my throat hurt.

I even broke a paper towel dispenser by punching it so much, and slammed a bathroom stall door so hard that it actually went past the lock and onto the other side of it. 

Thankfully it hasn’t to that point yet with my current job. But my current job pisses me off every day to the point where I want to hit something. At best I just look angry or curse (but not often). 

But bottling up my anger isn’t working. I want to hit something. I try to turn off all emotion at work and it’s just not working anymore. My boss and several coworkers continuously piss me off.

203,3,"When I’m angry, I say such awful and terrible things without even thinking, usually to my boyfriend. I don’t mean anything I say but it just comes out. Afterwards I feel awful but in the moment it just comes out and I don’t even know what im saying"
204,3,"How do I get rid of the overwhelming amount of rage and sadness in body without destroying anything or harming myself?

Any suggestions or advice is greatly appreciated. "
205,3,"I’ve been living with my best friend for almost eight years and  her anger only really appeared when she was driving. We could be having the best day and all of a sudden behind the wheel her happiness became aggression. I’ve had to deescalate a lot of parking lot interactions with strangers but within the last year she’s been snapping more and extremely irritated which I’ve been empathetic towards because she recently had a breakup and some family issues. 

She got into an incident at her job and when were we’re talking about it she seemed really confident that it was going to go away she asked me what I thought and I told her there’s a chance there might be a full investigation she immediately began to scream at me. I stopped talking I let her finish and I walked away. A couple days later we tried talking again and but this time when she started yelling at me and I yelled back I immediately apologized but she didn’t want to hear it.

Two weeks later I sent her a text asking to sit down and talk no anger or yelling she agreed to a meeting but the moment I went to sit down she got in my face and started yelling at me about not being a good friend and having resentment against her and that I was forcing her to have conversations and disrespecting her I told her to shut the fuck up and get out of my face. 

I didn’t speak to her at all for almost a month I don’t get angry often but when I’m pissed and hurt I take a long time to calm down when I texted her to agree to try and talk again she immediately told me that moving forward we should have an “associate” relationship and I should mind my business and stay out of her life  she also told me she doesn’t have to apologize for yelling at me because she doesn’t remember it happening and its my responsibility to calmly approach her and tell her that she’s been yelling not to just start yelling at her for no reason.  She also said she has no self reflection because she’s going through a hard time so it’s not her job to manage my emotions.

I was completely taken aback and hurt, I’ve been through an abusive relationships where  my ex  would tell me he were so sorry about being aggressive  but he was in an emotional blackout and I should of tried better to explain to him what he did and my alarm bells just started going off and I told her I completely agreed it was clear we needed space from each other but on the same day I overheard her telling someone that she wants to kill herself and they just said sorry friend hope you feel better. I was more than ready to give her the space she so clearly asked for but now I’m wondering if I should step back in and try to do something. It doesn’t matter if we are friends or not I don’t want her to hurt herself but she’s already told me she doesn’t want me in her business."
206,3,I just can't I seam to stop replying. I need to get some space  but I feel so unheard and im going to lose it.  Often when my partner and I argue I request some space to process my emotions. It's always meet with  another fight. If I ask they don't want it give me the space. Of I leave they blow up my phone and at that point I'm not processing anything from the previous argument. When this happens i feel like im in multiple fights. I'm just so mad so upset to feel like the work I am putting into stopping my outburst and improving my communication is not seen. I try so hard to keep my leavel head but when it blows it blows and I hate that for everyone involved. 
207,3,"I want to preface this by saying that I have searched in the sub for this already, but I haven’t found anything that works for me.


When I get angry at somebody (usually someone close to me, like my parents) I get really angry. It doesn’t matter if it’s a small thing. I get so angry it’s like a wave of anger and it feels like it’s consuming me completely. 

Once I’m alone it just becomes worse and I can’t stop punching myself in the head until I start crying and get hit with.. post nut clarity? lol. But anyway I don’t know how to curb this habit. Afterwards I usually feel horrible, super guilty and when I think about it, the situation wasn’t even that bad at the beginning. I just can’t help hitting myself. Almost always it’s my head or my thigh. 


Please give tips, I am aware of the risks in the long run :("
208,3,"Sometimes I get so angry that I start deleting contacts and connections without thinking. I can’t control myself. My mind races and I overthink everything. It’s this sudden, intense anger that makes me cut people off and burn bridges right away.

Growing up, due to stuttering I often felt ignored, misunderstood, or laughed at. Those feelings have stuck with me into adulthood. Now, I feel like I want to prove myself and get revenge; not by hurting others, but by becoming successful.

I didn't know where to share/vent, so did it here.

209,3,"I have a neurological disorder. My brain literally hurts. It has gotten a bit better with Neurology medicine and extreme Food Nazi supplementation and intense exercise, BUT, I am angry and traumatized by the pain. 

Yesterday, I stared down a guy who stared at me the other day because I was giving everything I had in my will power to push myself through intense cardio, the point of that so that I can feel better mood wise after it's over and I can be more calm. It's not about him. It's not about the last gym I left because people gave me strange vibes too for exercising so angry and intense. It's about ME and my chronic pain. I am mobile with the pain whereas other people unfortunately can't get out of bed as much or they are in the hospital or something. But, he floats around sensing me and I sense him. I'm strong and even tough to endure my own pain but I don't want to compete with him. I get it though. I was wrong. I should not have stared him down for staring at me. I told someone, I'm angry for 20 minutes of cardio to make the cardio possible, but I am very calm right after the exercise is over.

I can't keep switching gyms because they feel my anger. In fact, I'm going to go back to the gym today at the same time after avoiding other times to get away from people who hated me. I am going to try to focus my anger differently. Just wondering what other people do with their own anger at their own pain which I am guessing is the reason we get angry anyway. It could be emotional, childhood trauma, the demands of society, anything, I don't know, I'm not you.

But man I was angry and psychotic when I stared at him. MY FAULT! I was like a crazed soldier. Not good. Not good.

I will try to go more deeply into my inspirational music and try to be okay with random crazy thoughts that happen to pop into me that make myself angry. It's the chronic pain F'n with me.

Anger sucks. I'd rather be angry or going skydiving then suicidal and depressed because of the pain. You live once."
210,3,"Hi I'm going to be honest it's childish for my anger, it came from loosing and being clowner on in a game, where I called them a camper when they weren't, I know I'm in the wrong and I'm trying to come to terms with that but this undeniable anger I feel from loosing and being clowned on for not being as hight level as them isn't leaving, I want it to go away but I'm unsure how to make that happen, it's like a rage that feels heavy and I don't like the feeling, should I play the game until you I win? Will that make it go away? Should I detox somehow?? Idk what to do but throw the anger in me away and it won't leave 

Any help is welcomed, pls don't come at me for being childish and such, I know it is but I need help letting this anger go"
211,3,"I have anger issues, but I have been working on them for a long time. I am very aware of the way that I act, and I have seen some improvement. One thing that I have trouble with is my initial reactions to hearing something that I don’t like. I often get loud, animated, and say things that I regret almost immediately after, and think about those things for days wishing I hadn’t said them. I don’t get physical, but I am 6 foot 3 and 250 pounds, so when I do get animated or irritated, people tend to be on guard. Do you have any advice of techniques that I can use to curb my initial reactions to things I don’t like to hear?"
212,3,"I honestly hate making this post asking for help with anger management. Just admitting the fact that I'm feeling anger makes me feel disgusting and like a horrible person, which I know is not the case, but it's so hard to not feel that way. 

I've grown up in an abusive house. Anger problems run through my dads side of the family, and my brother got the most of it. And i became the, sometimes literal, punching bag. So I know i associate anger with abuse. 

But how do I not? How do I get past this? I have so much repressed anger from silencing myself or being silenced by someone else. I'm so angry I've been pushed to the side. I'm so angry my parents still choose him over me, knowing what he's done and does. I'm so angry they expect me to do everything myself at 16 while never saying a word to him, he's a grown adult! And now with my 1st year of college coming up a lot of true colors are being shown, and it's just making me even more mad. 

I've tried every little healthy venting method. Journaling, meditation, yelling, breaking things (that are okay to be broken). None of it helps and sometimes I just feel more angry it didn't work after. Then I'll wonder ""is there something wrong with me? Do I really have this bad anger problems? I'm acting just like my abuser!"". 

Has anyone else dealt with a situation like this around their anger? Is this something thats only gonna be resolved with therapy? I hate feeling this way but it's nearly constant. 

"
213,3,"To preface, I'll say that I don't act on the rage I feel towards this person. I simply seethe in it and wait for it to go away, or if needed I leave the room for a while. 

I am otherwise never someone who gets carried away with anger but the thoughts and urges I have about this person make me uncomfortable with how intense they are. The person is a roommate who moved in at the same time as my girlfriend and this roommate has been, as soon as I got to know them, someone who annoyed the hell out of me. But the thing is, it doesn't explain the level of fury I feel about them. Like at this point, we barely ever see each other, I've spoken to them directly once in the last 6+ months, but even when they enter the room I'm just fuming. They don't have to say or do anything. Them coming home from work and passing through to get to their room is enough to make me curse them with all my might (internally). 

The only thing I can think of as far as an explanation is that they remind me of all the things I dislike about myself, plus some other things that I don't associate with myself. I've been doing shadow work with my therapist and hopefully that leads to me coming to a better place with all this, but it still is hard for me to deal with on a daily basis.

If anyone here has had a similar situation, where you're normally very calm and collected but only one person sets you off, how did/do you deal with that?"
214,3,"i picked up my dad's temper problems, so my first instinct when i hear someone i hate talking to me or about me, i get irrationally angry... but i can't throw a punch to save my life and if i yell, i suddenly look like an asshole despite my ""be nice and don't lash out"" streak i've had my whole life, so my anger is stuck in one of those souvenir jars you get at a store on the beach. also, i can't afford therapy, im broke :(

despite all my rage, i am still just a rat in a cage. (i love that song)"
215,3,"I’ve been trying to change, but the only way I’ve ever really known how to deal with problems is by fighting. That’s how I grew up handling things. Through my fists I can solve all of my problems I once thought. I’m 18 now, about to graduate, and I know it’s a serious problem. I’m about to go out into the new world and can’t keep being childish like this. Ive train in MMA which was a suggestion from my therapist. So I can channel this anger towards something else but that just made it worse. It’s worse, because I know how to hurt people even worse now. When I lose control, I don’t hold back.

I’ve been in four **fights** during high school, three in middle school, six in elementary, and around five more just out in public. I’ve been **arrested** twice in high school and held for about 24 hours each time. Both times, the fights went too far and someone ended up seriously hurt. The **cops** got involved, I was charged, held overnight, and my parents had to come get me. I wasn’t sent away long-term, but those moments should’ve been wake-up calls. I’m seriously going to live a life like this is I don’t get a hold of myself. 

At the root of it, I think it’s a deep insecurity. I can’t stand the idea that people think I’m weak. If I feel like someone is trying to test me, disrespect me, or treat me like a target, I snap. I don’t let it slide. I never have. And because of that, I’ve done things I’m ashamed of, broken bones, gone for the eyes, even bitten people. I fought like I had something to prove, and it left people worse off than me. Yeah, I’ve gotten hurt too, broke my wrist a couple times but most of the time I came out fine. That doesn’t make it okay. It just makes me more responsible for the damage.

Some of those people probably had it coming. But most didn’t. And that’s what I struggle with the most. I’ve tried counseling, therapy, and I’ve talked to my family. They’ve heard my apologies. I’ve said I want to change. But my first instinct, even when someone just bumps into me by accident, is to lash out. The amount of people I flipped off just because they bumped into me is insane. My body tenses, my mind flips a switch, and I’m already in fight mode before I even have the chance to think. I have no self control and I hate it.

I know it’s not just about anger. It’s about fear. Fear of being disrespected. **Fear** of looking weak. Fear of being nothing. I hate feeling like the world is against me. I hate how alone I feel in this. Most people don’t try to understand. They see the violence and stop there. They don’t see the reasons behind it. Everyone’s scared of me and I’m tired of it.

I **regret** a lot. The things I’ve done. The people I’ve hurt. The chances I’ve thrown away. I wish I could undo it. I wish I could take back the moments I lost control. I really do. And I’m sorry, not just to the people I’ve hurt, but to the version of myself that never got to feel safe enough to let his guard down.

What would you do if you were in my situation?"
216,3,"There's this kid who occasionally teases me at school (emasculate me and is just weird trying to touch me and stuff). I genuinely want to bash this guys stupid face into fucking concrete and beat the shit out of him. I want him to suffer. My sister also has this ex who's a bit of a jerk, and i also just want beat his face in for the shit he says about her. Now I don't think I'd ever do this unless seriously provoked. Is this normal?"
217,3,"2 years ago my Therapist  cancelled one of our apointments to send 2 psycologist to my home. She knew that I wasn't comfortable with talking to other people about personal issues and that she was the only one I trusted at the time. after really long Breakdown from realizing I don't have a say in the matter and I have to talk to them I reluctantly had a conversation with them I talked to them about my stress, my anger issues, and why I haven't been in school lately, I recently stopped going to school because exams made me feel stupid and I got depressed.



 I also talked about my rage filled breakdowns where I would bash my head against the wall or just scream and I felt like I couldn't talk to nobody. I was calm when I told them all my stuff I don't know how but I did it and they took a break with me, 30 minutes later they had the authority and the go ahead to call paramedics and a cop and they were told me I had no choice in staying in my home and they wanted me to go to the hospital, I was utterly terrified that no matter what I said I couldn't do anything and had a breakdown and they almost sicked a cop on me cause they thought I was dangerous.

They also lied about sending me to just the hospital after 3 days of being in the hospital I was told I was going to a Psychward out of my city instead of home, apparently they twisted my story and they said I gave up on life instead of that I gave up on school.

While spending  time in the pyschward they drugged me when I cried and they threatened to keep me in there longer when I told them I was afraid, I couldn't have any shoes or hoodie strings or not even a hard cover book cause they told me that I could kill someone or kill myself with it, and I just felt like I was being treated like some fucking animal and there would be nights where I felt so betrayed my therapist and felt abandoned by my family that I couldn't sleep and I just stay up for whole nights and when I would do that they would just drug me with benadryl again.

Eventually I got out and got to come back to my family but it felt like they saw me differently whenever I was upset or mad my grandma would think I was gonna hurt her or that I need to get out cause she thought I was gonna scream at her or kill someone. at the time My therapist ruined my relationships with my family and I feel like I'm just gonna be treated like some animal if someone finds out I have anger issues 

Only recently I've been recovering from all the trust  issues that the psychward gave me only because Of My best friend now Girlfriend I really do feel like she saved my life cause if it wasn't for her I would've stayed even more miserable and scared of talking to people. I still kinda am but I wanna try to open up again, staring with this post. 

I did write a giant wall but it still feels like a quick summary so if anyone is confused about any details I would try to respond"
218,3,"When I get mad I lose my appetite, I will gag at food touching my tongue.  I've been trying to work on my anger but it feels like every step forward soon something happens and I go 2 steps back. It's gets very unmotivated about trying to fix my anger before I can get a therapist. I'd like to know how you guys stay motivated to keep working on yourself? And how you guys could communicate with your partners about your anger?"
219,3,"I have a lot of pent up anger that swells up daily. I cannot afford a therapist, I would like to know what activities I can do to take out my aggression. I have tried exercising but it doesn’t help the explosive part of my aggression when I want to physically hurt someone. If anyone has exercises to recommend or any other activity that isn’t expensive it would be appreciated. I haven’t hurt anyone in the past and I don’t want to do it in the future, so I need help finding an outlet to prevent it."
220,3,"I have been struggling with anger lately, especially when it comes to my sister asking me not to do things that she deems are unsafe. The problem is that from my perspective, I don’t see them as unsafe. On paper, I feel it could go either way and I would like some outside opinions. Two recent examples:

1. I went to a casino at night. This is a popular, busy casino. I took safety precautions and parked near the front. I wasn’t drinking. I initially lied to my sister that I was at a casino because I was embarrassed. I do not have money problems, but still didn’t initially didn’t share. She freaked out it was at night and that I was by myself.

2. Today we were talking about weekend plans and I mentioned I was thinking of going to my parent’s storage unit to clean out some of the stuff there from our childhood home. They want us to clean it out. She said our parents told her not to go by herself. She didn’t want me to go by myself. I told her it was fine. Again, I take safety precautions I was going in the daylight. She still just won’t let it go 

So now I’m sitting here brewing with anger feeling “handled” and I don’t know if this is a healthy reaction. When I say “handled” I mean controlled, babies, etc. This is a normal reaction or am I just being too sensitive? 

Thank you"
221,3,"whenever im angry, i lose any sense of self, morality, values and anything that is really part of me and i lose any awareness of what i say, who i am or where i am.

the moments i try to recall the times i was furious i just see a big blurry video passing right by my eyes

what the hell do i do? I dont want to be evil, but my anger makes me become satan himself because I become my complete opposite (a discriminatory asshole)"
222,3,"I hate how anger feels in my body. Hot, heavy, like it’s trying to crawl out of my skin. But what I hate more is the part that comes after—the shame. The voice in my head that whispers, “Why are you like this?” I get mad, and then I beat myself up for it. Like I’m not allowed. Like feeling hurt or disrespected or ignored somehow makes me the bad guy for reacting.

Sometimes I feel like a ticking bomb. I hold everything in because I’m scared of what happens if I let it out. But when it slips, when I snap or shut down or raise my voice—I hate myself for it. It’s not just the anger. It’s the guilt that strangles me after. I start to wonder if I’m broken. Too much. Too sensitive. Too angry for anyone to actually love.

I wish I could just be mad. Let it pass through without destroying me or making me question everything about who I am. But right now, it just feels like every time I get angry, I lose another piece of myself.
"
223,3,"I won't get too much into it because I have a traumatizing life lol, but I've always wondered why my anger ignites my suicidal tendencies. I could be bawling my eyes out and having a mental breakdown but hurting myself never comes to mind. But the moment I'm having a heated argument with my partner, parents, etc. The moment my anger hits a certain point, all I want to do is hurt myself. I've learned to cope and haven't cut myself since I was about 15/16. I do grab and scratch at myself though, or hit myself. Which obviously is not good. But I don't know how else to cope with my anger, it makes me so suicidal for no reason. I get to a certain point of anger and care about nothing but wanting to hurt myself. I've had restraint doing anything seriously harmful. But I'm having a hard time coping and can't afford therapy and all of that. I don't mean like a temper tantrum either lol, like I don't get my way or anything. And I never go out of my way to make this known or obvious because I feel like it's embarrassing... But when I have fits of rage I just black out, I hit myself, scratch myself, pull my hair... I suck at calming myself down obviously lol. But I just don't understand my anger. It pushes me to the point of the thought of wanting to die. Is it anger issues? Do I need to enroll is anger management? Lol. I apologize for my yapping I'm just slightly embarrassed about this, it makes me sound like I'm 2. Any advice would be appreciated. "

I wish i was dead so this bullshit would stop. They say to do what makes you happy and you'll be fine but that's bullshit. Life is already predetermined and theres nothing u can do."
228,3,"To keep a long story short, My “best friend” of a decade chose a guy she’s only known for barely a month over me. I voiced my concerns and frustrations, and in response her new boyfriend went nuclear and hurled nasty words/insults at me. Immediately she was defending him, and even trying to guilt trip me into forgiving him. Saying “I’ve never seen him like this before” and “if you don’t forgive people you’ll live a life of solitude” and my favorite “you’re interpreting it wrong.” I told her I don’t want to be near someone who insults me that casually, and she cut contact with me on the spot. 

And here we are, not speaking anymore. She’s still with him, and I’m just so incredibly angry and bitter.  Some nights I want to randomly call her and just scream at her, and some nights I’m just frustrated crying. This has seriously hit my self esteem, because what is so wrong with me that she would throw away a decade old friendship like that? I was always the one there for her. If she needed money, I was there. If she needed someone to cry to, I was there. She called me her sister, we were each others best friends, we did everything together. 

If you want to know what the situation was: 
She had just separated with her abusive husband three days before she met her new boyfriend, and then a week later they were dating. Their relationship moved so fast that she was telling him she loved him by week two. Her husband is not happy with the separation, and has been making unhinged threats. I get a phone call from her crying, telling me her new boyfriend instigated something with her ex husband, and I could hear her kids crying in the background so I immediately went to go pick them up. Later on the boyfriend came over and that’s when the fight with me happened. 

And before you ask, I also tried to express that their relationship was moving scarily fast but I was brushed off. 

I need some advice to stop thinking about her and move on. This happened in January, and I am still just so angry.

Thank you in advance."
229,3,"i opened up a tiny bit to my mom about how i was feeling lonely today. part of that reason was cus of an old flame i used to talk to. i miss her and i can’t seem to get over her even though we don’t talk anymore. 

anyways, idk if it was my dad who told her to say this or if it was her herself but she said “don’t leave your healing in someone else’s hands” and then she followed up with “not saying that’s what you’re doing” but why the fuck even bother saying it in the first place then??? if that’s not what i’m doing who the fuck are you telling it to? 

it just feels like a roundabout way of saying yeah that’s what i’m doing. which honestly i don’t feel that’s what i’m doing considering ive separated myself from this old flame purposely with the intent to move on. with the knowledge that they aren’t exactly healthy for me at this moment. with the knowledge that i can be clingy. you know i consider myself pretty responsible and sensible. i’ve grown a lot. i turn things in on time, i create plans to get shit done, i try to take care of myself when i remember to, etc. buttt nooooooo maybe im just using this person to avoid healing or whatever the fuck. 

and it pissed me off too cus that completely derailed my feelings. it went from me just venting and expressing my feelings and why i felt the way i felt to well don’t use her to heal yourself. 

god and the rest of the day i just felt so fucking angry. i wanted to break something. i wanted to hurt myself. i wanted to punch my wall until my knuckles started bleeding or my hand fucking broke. god that feeling of feeling helpless just angers me so much. it’s a combo of both my parent and loneliness that i feel. my struggle to connect with others…"
230,3,"I find it something gets me off guard, it is easy for to be quick to anger and possibly do or say something I regret.

While the other side, I deal with frustration well because I kind of see it coming, like yes it is still annoying

Moments where I been quick to anger I reflect on what to say if in that same situation again, a bit of a copy paste attitude.

One example was at work there was a 3rd party cleaner doing a big job, we are use them being here but this task they had gave a “spanner in the works”, it was small but a combination of the door not being answered (staff entry, need to ring a bell and wait) without knowing why, all this crap is moved out which for in the way of my co worker who was to let me in, in the end he made the 3rd party cleaner do it and a “finally!” About to carry on and he stops me right away (mind I am still half asleep at this point) and he interrupts “no don’t walk there” it wasn’t rhe longer than walk but the interruption on top of the unknown wait that triggered me might say and I reacted rudely, I kind of cursed “why couldn’t management give us a simple heads up about this” a co worker even said “yeah we could of came early to prepare” and I like “nah I won’t be early, zero practical change, just so I mentally prepared or stretched for it so I do not give my initial reaction, which is one I am not proud of”

Another one at a different job, a personality clash with a co worker so I block him on socials and he puts me on spot for it and I didn’t really want to explain but it lead to him saying “don’t say hi to me, only talk if work related” I mean I was prepared for no causal conversation but I always found it rude to not say hi even if you do not like the person, I was shocked someone was like this, and it lead to argument where I abused him and pointed the finger at him, but I look back if I had been prepared a simple “okay” and move on. And yet to I know of people who see this stuff and aim to trigger it to make someone lose face, as they maybe have something to gain from it. 

Both of these moments I was over it very shortly but have concern for the mentality. "

232,3,"I don't know what happens to me but when I'm upset I get really angry, I break down and I feel the need to break things. A few minutes ago I got into a fight with my dad, which is why im coming here to talk about it as i dont have anyone else. I came to my room and there's a few glass bottles lying around. I went to smash one but I held myself back and dropped it. This isn't the first time I've felt the urge to hurt somebody badly, myself or destroy things when I'm furious. I smashed my tv when I was 15 and and I often throw my phone really hard at the floor. I feel like it's the only thing to release my anger that I can't deal with. If there's nothing for me to throw sometimes I bite my hands really hard until it hurts for hours or I hit my head repeatedly. Lately I've been feeling worse and when I tell my mum she's says I have to learn to deal with it or stop it. I'm scared and I don't know how to as I'm young. Before all this I came to my mum to talk about me feeling down and depressed. She told me that I just feel sorry for myself. I don't have anybody to talk to so I was wondering if there's anything I can do to help. I'm young and my parents can't really help me so if you guys have any tips, I would really appreciate it. "
233,3,"Does anybody else get angry at something and spoil the mood and starts like muttering angrily? My sister gets really annoyed when I do that and I hardly notice, all I think about are my current feelings... In the moment, I'm thinking about my anger, I can't control or cope with it... 

I don't think journaling works to help this, or my pride won't allow me to walk away... I can only mentally cope if I say it out loud and be angry but it annoys everybody. Can someone help me? Thanks

I might have anger issues "
234,3,Iv been doing a lot of self work  on my self to address my anger and my reaction after letting my anger take control about a month ago and making some pour choices. I have a hard time not fliping my lid when fight with my partner. I constantly feel gas lit for these harsh truths my partner says to over anger or hirt feeling dont seam supportive. I'm not sure how to recognize my triggers and how to address them before I let my anger out . Iv tryed taking space and to create a calm down time but any time I try and implement this my partner just blows up my phone and eavin tho iv left in person I'm still engaged in the fight. Iv looked in to taking a anger management course and communication course bit have applied yet. I don't seam to have a problem with anger anywhere else in my life that I can pin point in my other relationship. Why do I feel so triggered when I'm with my partner and how do I identify my triggers before blow up? The problem is once I blow up I can't seam to think straight to save my life I can't continue the conversation and any points I had that I wanted to address are gone. Leaving me feeling like I'm constantly not able to share my feelings or opinion with my partner. 
235,3,"Plain and simple we live in nyc. If you don’t know the sidewalks are absolutely fucking disgusting here. Not that it matters I am Chinese and was raised to always take my shoes off and wear slippers in the house growing up. Well my boyfriend’s mom, brother, and his friend are here. I have asked the multiple times to take their shoes off. Most people in nyc take their shoes off and leave them at the door bc of how gross the sidewalks are! They laughed and said they’re not used to it and how I need to have a sign as if our piles of shoes and shoe rack immediately when you walk in doesn’t hint at them. Anyways wooden floor whatever I’ll fucking mop but I have one long white carpet around 8x10 ft in the living room that they keep walking in and stepping on. IT JUST RAINED and they came in and fucking walked on my fucking white carpet I just screamed then walked away and locked myself in the bedroom. They leave tomorrow and have been here like 4 days. As I’m typing this I feel like I’m overreacting but it’s also so valid it’s my apartment just take ur fucking shoes off. "
236,3,I have serious rage issues with just anger in general and I have no way to let it go… when someone angers me and I have to respond they get the full reth of me my attitude and my daggers out of my mouth with what I say. If I lifted a lot more weights I feel like I would be dangerous around people what do you guys do to let go. Breathing exercises do not work for me 
237,3,"I am seeking assistance concerning my 22-year-old son, who experiences sudden outbursts of anger. This behavior began in high school and has escalated over time. We enlisted the help of a therapist, whom he still sees regularly. He has been diagnosed with ADHD but refuses to take stimulant medications due to “feeling funny in the head.” He is currently prescribed bupropion XR 75mg, which his doctor suggested to address both his outbursts and depression. 

The outbursts can occur unexpectedly, even when he just had a good day. For instance, he was previously employed by my husband’s company but was fired after an angry outburst directed at his father, which included derogatory remarks and negative comments to coworkers. This caused a blowup between the two and my husband kicked him out of the house. Recently, he reacted similarly when requested to assist my son-in-law, resulting in another confrontation that almost escalated to physical aggression. 

He has returned to live at home and, while he is in a good mood and helpful to both of us most of the time, there are serious concerns regarding his handling of his anger. I believe that his current mental health support may not be enough. He doesn’t want to seek additional help, but given the circumstances, I think he may need to see a psychiatrist because I feel he may have a mental health problem more than depression and ADHD. Finding a solution to this issue is important for his future because he isn’t going to get far in life with this attitude. Any advice from individuals with similar experiences would be appreciated and so helpful. I’m at my wits end."
238,3,"I walked in on my mom and dad having an argument, which has happened too many times. Except mom shuts down as is the norm and it's my hotheaded dad who doesn't hear anything but the sound of his own voice. Anyway, we were talking later, and when I disagreed about something he said, he snapped at me to just shut up and listen. I instantly saw red and barely managed to hold onto my temper. I've been practicing holding it back a lot lately, but I was so angry in that moment I wanted to break his nose. Sick and tired of him acting like he's the victim all the time and refusing to take responsibility for his actions. He scarred my sister's face over a fucking slice of cake years ago and you know what he says when she tries to open up about how it affects her? ""It's in the past."" 

Anyway, I couldn't think straight for a good hour after that being around him since we had to eat dinner. But afterwards, when I was alone, I was lifting the heavy weight of something and putting it somewhere else and only after that I realized my mind had calmed completely. I'm not sure what to think or feel. The 180 has just got me a little confused. Is it a good or bad thing? Anyone know?"
239,3,"i get extremely angry over tiny tiny things and get urges to seriously hurt myself and i’m scared i’m going to hurt myself or someone else badly, i never get the urge to hurt someone else but what if it escalates? i’m 15 and ik its scares and hurts my mom to see me get so mad and hurt myself i don’t want to keep being like this. also right after im mad it takes me like 15 minutes, only after i do hurt myself though, and i calm down and am completely fine and not angry at all. i don’t know what to do "
240,3,"My brother and I are so frustrated about our parents because they are always complaining for something that had nothing to do with us like sometimes they put a blame on one of us when it wasn't our fault and even put pressure on us while having high expectations. My brother and I don't feel like helping them. We feel like leaving them and only care about our own lives. We don't feel like giving money to them, they will try to survive by themselves. "
241,3,I was very out of control. I'm 17 this year and I should've known better. We were fighting about a lot of stuff that we didn't do. I stopped myself from hurting her but I tried pushing her just so I wouldn't. But she came back in and I fell on the ground. I cussed her out when I was going back to my room. I've done a lot of heinous stuff and I wished it never DID happen. But I'll take all the blame from you guys. I'm pretty much hopeless at this time.
242,3,"I'm angry in the shower, angry when it's dark out, angry when I am being manipulated by a relative who pries then disses, etc.

But that's because I have a painful migraine.

Wouldn't you be angry?

But, today, I was not angry. I will be again. But, not right now.

Don't know why.

It comes down to setting down the bag of bricks on your back. 

But, anger is insanity. Anger is the toughest all natural emotion that leads to learning but mental illness too.

You can't understand everything that pops up in you or around you so anger is the only option.

Self Contained Anger is okay in my opinion. That's what you can get away with.

Chronic Pain depresses a man. Anger at it is inevitable.

243,3,"This might be veery weird so beware. 
Got my period. I fucking hate periods with every ounce of my being because I just want to rip out my uterus- just like rip it out. I’m so desensitized about this extreme gory-gross stuff, even when I think about it happening to me- that I might just do it. My hormones aren’t making me sad. I’m just so intensely fucking angry. Filled with pure hatred and the urge to kill someone. I know that’s really bad but I meant someone who deserves it. A stupid pedophile who raped little girls. Little boys. I would gouge his eyeballs out, knock my elbow into his solar plexus and shatter his shins. Then I would just fucking maul him like some sort of crazy animal. I feel like a chimpanzee on Xanax. I’m tired of disgusting and horrible men like those crazy incels you see on forums, saying they’re so strong and this and that. I have been mistaken for a man before. I’m hardly under 6 feet tall and weigh 160. But my rage would just give me some sort of strength, I don’t care about my vagina or boobs or my stupid chromosomes, I’ll rip your fucking dick off. Because there’s something wrong with you. You think you can just control and control, call women whatever you want. But I’m done. I’m not a woman, I’m a human. I’m a fucking homo sapien, and I’m gonna spear you like it’s B.C if you say one more joke about raping girls again. Or anyone for that matter. It’s not FUCKING FUNNY. And the only reason I would even bother to keep my uterus, is to grow my family into the strongest existing people and to make humans evolve into their true form, the predator of the wild. The fighter who never gave up despite their size to the mammoth. 
—— I’m really sorry for this weird paragraph. I would never kill somebody, I swear. I’m not in the right headspace, the internet is full of shitfaces and horrible people. People who judge other people constantly and especially making fun of their bodies drive me nuts. So yeah. Anybody else want to make humans strong again? Let’s conquer land and water. I like to swim. "
244,3,"So I have been releasing anger that had never been expressed. It caused me a lot of anxiety and depression . Just really a lot of irritation and frustration too..

Here’s what I did..

I took a pillow and a rolling pin .. I shut the door And imagined the faces of people on the pillow I was angry at. Then I started smashing it so hard with the rolling pin . I abused, I cursed and I said whatever I had to.

I even shut my eyes and imagined hitting these people on their head and body out of rage .

It really helped me. Of course I cried a lot because of the pain and betrayal and hurt they caused me.

Exercising too helps but this was focused on releasing rage and anxiety. It made me feel free and light.

PS: We Don’t deserve to suffer or punish ourselves with suppressing our truth because of others. Remember we have nothing to lose but ourselves.

I wish all of us healing , happiness peace and health 🌱"
245,3,"So, the name is a TLDR. I get so fucking angry at shit that I want to hurt someone/something, and people keep saying ""MiNdFuLnEsS"" is the answer. Fuck that, being aware of myself makes me suicidal. All the typical things you get told like, ""take a deep breath"" or ""just let it go"" make it worse. People saying things like, ""Is King(fake name for obvi reasons) calm yet?"" trigger instantly, and even if I am calm, it brings back tons of rage. I don't like how overwhelming it is, and the constant anger drives me to lash out. Plus, I happen to be in an environment where my anger gets laughed at. Someone please give me advice on how to calm down, and don't say mindfulness. "
246,3,"(if all your gonna say is that you hard to read this post then don't comment bc that just gonna piss me off because your to dumb to read)



was 14 when I first snapped on someone 
From the age of 7 to 14 I was hiding all my pain 
Being 14 and having a girlfriend cheat on you can throw you over the edge and that's what happened I finally just started letting my angry out 

I'm 20 now and I wake up angry about everything in my life 

I work and get nowhere because of how expensive everything is 

The people I'm around just flat out ignores me and so does my family 

I sit and I think to myself I hate the way everything is 

I hate phones but you have to have them or your just sitting there doing nothing or not talking to anyone 

I hate working but you have to do it or your a statistic and homeless 

I hate being single nowadays because modern day women don't know how to love or is always wanting something like money or to use someone 

I hate some people in general 
All some of them do is work,eat,sleep like a robot 

I hate to even think 
Because I think logically and I use my brain as if it was my own 

I had friends but all the do is want to fuck women now 

I had a wife but she wanted to cheat and then say she is poly after 4 years of being with her 


I love it when people blame me for everything that goes on in my life 
Because when I ask them why
They work a job they don't like 
Or why they pay bills they don't want to pay 
Or why do they still live in a place they don't want to live in 
And you know what they say to me 

They say Because I have no choice 
I have to do what I have to do 

Then when I say no it's because you want to do it everything that is wrong in your life is because of you 
Just like everything in my life is my fault 
RIGHT 

then they say no it's not 

Those type of people are called 
NPC's 

Those NPC's are they ones with two cars and 3 kids and work and don't even know what to do in life 

BUT SOMEHOW THEY ARE PERFECTLY FINE IN LIFE 

They have no care in a world about what happens around them 

Thoses are the same people that 
VOTE 

JUDGE OTHERS ON HOW THEY LIVE THIER LIVES WHEN THE PERSON JUDGING IS LIVING THE SAME WAY 
THEY BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IS OKAY AND NORMAL


If I say as a person I'm not okay 
Everything turns around and doesn't care 

But if I say I'm okay when I'm not everyone just say 
OKAY and that's it 

So what do you really do when your in that situation


No matter what it seems like you are gonna be fucked over in a mental way until America falls

247,3,"when the personal issues are brought up and become apparent and when im around the person who angers me i become induced into a rage where i cant work correctly or think of anything else but what bothers me its worse then a hang over.

how do i make sure i never end up doing something destructive and harmful again. i want to be more aware but those logical thoughts are a mist in my mind during my rage"
248,3,I’ve been up and down emotionally. Currently my anger is directed at one specific person. My boss 🫠. I went from being uncontrollably angry to neutral and now back at uncontrollably angry. All I want to do is ruin this persons life. My boss lied to me for 3 fucking years. I lashed out and I realize that I am the aggressor but my mind keeps coming back to the mindset of anger and “wanting justice”. What do you do in between therapy/professional help sessions to calm down and bring yourself back to reality?

251,3,"I got irritated with my mom earlier and I think I’m ruining my relationship with her. 

Here’s some context: I get so irrationally angry at people who I think show even the smallest bit of incompetence. And it can be anything from not knowing how something works to over explaining something I know how to do and I’ll immediately get a bad attitude. I’ve figured out that the main reason I get so upset over incompetence is because I feel as if I can’t be incompetent myself or I won’t be liked or wanted around. So I’m hyper independent and get easily frustrated with others who seem to have no issue making obvious mistakes or relying on others to do stuff for them. 

My point is, my mom is not like that and I think the way I react when I’m around her is hurting the relationship we have. My mom is very much a planner so she tends to over explain things (even when I’ve already told her that I’ve heard it before) and she’ll repeat herself often in the same sentence. She also tends to give me more information than I need at one time. Like for example, she’ll mention an event coming up in the future (usually about at least 2 weeks out) and I’ll say “yeah sure i’ll go” and then it’s like a complete onslaught of information like what time it starts and ends, what’s the dress code, who else is going to be there, what else we have going on in two weeks, etc. So I get annoyed and tell her I’ll never remember all of that I don’t need to know it right at this exact moment and she just shuts down and is like “I don’t appreciate you talking to me with that tone”. 

So it’s just a repeating cycle of her pissing me off in small ways that are completely irrational reasons and then I hurt her feelings because I talk to her like a child. I know that I shouldn’t and that I need to get a grip but honestly I don’t know how and after a big argument today I thought I would just ask for advice from others who might get it. I just want to stop feeling like anyone who shows incompetence around me is a huge burden who needs to be treated as such. 

How do I not get so irritated and angry when someone does something I find annoying? Because honestly “taking deep breaths” isn’t working. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated "
252,3,"i (19 F) think it all started when i left my ex (20 M). he started out great, but when i went away for uni, he changed and put in less effort. i tried my best to stick it out, invite him over, call and check on him, etc., but the lack of effort and consistency and consideration was starting to make me question my self worth. i tolerated so much from him, until i couldn’t. our breakup was a nasty one, and i haven’t dated again since.

it’s been over a year since the breakup, and ive gone through all the stages denial, depression, and anger. i’m doing much better mentally, and ive built a space and a new life for myself, but it haunts me to think that i let myself be treated that way. it genuinely fills me with rage at the fact that me and so many other women i know have been treated by m*les this way, and they literally will not care.

combine that with the results of the recent American election and the current repercussions this country is facing, and i’ve come to realize that m*les are bad people by default. they literally do not see us women as people. they literally will never treat us as equal because they don’t see us as equal. to m*les, we are objects, tools, resources, but never people. and so, why should i see them as people?

literally everything wrong with the world is a m*le’s faults. they don’t bring anything good or useful into the world. all they do is kill, steal, destroy. i despise myself for still being physically attracted to m*les, knowing that they provide nothing of use to a woman like me.

i like to think im young, educated, talented, beautiful, intelligent, the whole package. i like to think that somewhere out there is someone who can be the partner i deserve. but at this point, i just don’t think that partner is a m*le. i don’t think a m*le deserves to be with me. i truly think they’re a nuisance to all life on earth. 

i’ve only fully researched what misandry is in the last year, and i think it accurately describes my mindset at the moment. but i’m conflicted, because i am also a heterosexual woman. i feel cursed. if i could choose, i wouldn’t choose to be attracted to m*les. I would be with a woman and probably be much happier. i’ve found more peace in being with my female friends than around any m*le that isn’t blood related to me. 

I’ve never ever been so full of hatred before. i usually used to be so loving and caring, and now i feel like a completely different girl. I hate that a m*le was able to make me feel this way and feel like my empathy and compassion and love is a curse. but i am genuinely at a point where i think feeling anything positive for m*les is useless as a woman.

 
what do i do? is this something that can be fixed? should i want it to be fixed? please help.

sincerely, G"
253,3,"I've been struggling with regulating my emotions with regard to a particular situation which I don't feel is necessary to get into right now, but my group was there for me. It's a men's group that is facilitated by two women, sometimes one. Last night I told them about my situation, they related, helped me get to the core emotions through introspection, and supplied me with some tools to practice said introspection whilst alone. They are a friendly group who always offer a helping hand, ask if I would like to call/text or hang out.

The purpose of this post is to provide those with anger issues with some inspiration and hope. If you're coming to this subreddit, you might find it helpful to find a local anger management group. I wish I had joined years ago.

255,3,My anger just does not want to go away. I'm mad at basically everyone. Breathing doesn't really help. Is there anything I could do that's been tried and tested and works? 
256,3,"I can't go into tons of detail, but the smallest things can get really blown out of proportion in my head when I'm getting close to that time. I have been trying to acknowledge my feelings without acting on them but I feel like a pressure cooker. I want to hold whatever is irritating me down and beat the shit out of it until it stops bothering me. I have really bad thoughts that I feel ashamed for but I stop my worst impulses and will do things like curse under my breath or be pushy and more aggressive but not causing physical injuries. it is still completely inappropriate the way that I behave at times.  I feel like I can't control my own anger during this time. I feel anger fairly regularly and I understand that sleep is one factor that can contribute, but especially this hormonal anger is a true beast within that I want to conquer. Are there any women here that know this struggle and have any advice for natural solutions (not meds)? Just interested if there's anything anyone has learned in therapy or whatever that they could share. I would have to go out of town for therapy and I have a really demanding job but I'm not in a position to deal with that right now and I'd rather not be on meds. I don't want advice telling me to go elsewhere for help. If you have advice besides that, that is my interest at this time. Thank you for your time."
257,3,"I don't know why but I get irritated by everyone and everything all the time. Someone just making a noise can irritate me so much some times. I don't know why I always feel like this. Everything just makes me mad. Even things that should make me happy like a gift I get annoyed by. It's not like I'm an evil guy, I am appreciative but it just annoys me. I feel like I hate everyone but I know I don't. It's Just I feel like I'm constantly getting mad at people for nothing. I got mad at my girlfriend because she took to long to read something. Not verbally mad but internally. I love her and I knew it was stupid so I didn't say anything, but occurrences like this happen all time. My mom called me today because she wanted to vent to me and all I could think was ""shut up."" It was replaying in my head on repeat and I don't know why. She did nothing wrong but It just made me so annoyed. I love all these people and would do anything for them. So why do I find it impossible to just listen to my mom vent? I feel like this probably makes me a terrible person or something but it's the truth. I just can't stand people. I feel like I've always been this way but over the years it's just gotten worst to the point where the smallest things just tick me off. I'll never say anything because I understand these things are stupid. I just wanna know why I am like this."
258,3,"Hey r/Anger, I’m feeling so lost and could really use some advice or support. I’m usually a pretty chill guy – I can laugh off harsh jokes, take embarrassment in stride, and I don’t hold grudges. People who know me would probably say I’m the last person to have anger issues because it happens so rarely, like once every 3-4 years. But when it does, it’s like I become someone else, and it’s terrifying.

This has happened a few times before. The first time, I beat someone up and didn’t even feel bad until months later. The second time, it was a really good friend, and I still carry so much regret for that. It happened again years later, but today… today was the worst. I completely lost it. I punched a guy, slammed his head into a wall twice, and then kicked his head into the wall. It took a few minutes for me to even snap out of it and realize what I’d done. I rushed him to the hospital, stayed up all night waking up staff to make sure he got a CT scan and was okay. Thank God, he’s fine, and I got him home safe. But I’m so scared that next time, I won’t be this lucky. I could seriously hurt someone, or worse.

Every time this happens, I feel awful afterward. But in the moment, it’s like I’m not even there – this rage just takes over, and I can’t control my body. It’s like I’m watching someone else do these things. Today, I saw fear in my friends’ eyes when they looked at me, and it broke my heart. I don’t want to be that person.

I don’t know how to stop this. These moments are so rare, but when they hit, I’m powerless. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? How do you handle these intense outbursts? I’m so scared of hurting someone again, and I feel like I’m running out of chances. Any advice, stories, or resources you can share would mean everything to me. I just want to figure this out and be better.

TL;DR: I’m normally super calm, but every few years, I have these rare, uncontrollable rage outbursts where I hurt people. Today was the worst, and I almost killed someone. I feel terrible, but I don’t know how to stop it. I need help."
259,3,I have anger management issues since childhood and people just keep triggering me on purpose. How do I stop getting triggered so easily? I try to control it but it's like one little spark that will set a wildfire inside my head.

I am constantly getting the feeling that I should just leave those people (by people I mean friends in my friend grp). Should I just leave them?
260,3,"Good morning!

So I personally don't struggle with anger issues, but I came onto the subreddit to get some perspective from people who do have anger issues so I can better understand something that I'm going through.  I just have a few questions and I would appreciate it if someone could help answer them.  If this is not worded correctly, or if I offend anyone in my wording or if I use an offensive term, please do let me know, as I'm just here for advice and I don't wanna offend anyone or do anything wrong.

Here are my questions! They are going to be very- blunt- again, I'm a very blunt and honest person when asking so please- no one take this offensively.

I mean this will all the kindness and it's coming from a place of wanting to understand rather than disregard. 

My wording is coming from- as you'll analyze- a place of GENUINE confusion rather than degradation. 


1). Why? Why are people even this angry in the first place? And not only why but how? For example- someone without anger issues (I dont mean to call anger an issue, I just don't know the proper terms to not- sound as blunt), would get mildly annoyed by loosing a video game, maybe have a silent rage moment, and get back to it. But someone with anger issues may throw the controller down, yell at the tv, quit the game, and be angry / upset for the next hour. All because they lost a video game??  Why? It's literally just a video game? 

2). Why is it so difficult for individuals with anger, problems, or issues to not only recognize the fact that you are angry, and admit the fact that you are angry, but also why you're angry? For example. If you asked somebody without anger issues, why they were angry, they would tell you right away, or if they didn't want to talk about it, they would let you know. But people with anger issues will either tell you that they don't know, they don't wanna talk about it, and then get even angrier when you try to help them figure it out if they say they don't know. That doesn't make sense. It's like this. ""It's you. You should know why you are angry. You should know what is causing you to be angry. It's you. Even if you're not angry, you should know what emotion you are.""

3). Why is it that even when someone knows that their anger is impacting others, they still struggle to change? I know change, for anyone, is possible. Even if it seems like it's not. So what is stopping someone from making that change? 


4). Why do people with these issues feel big reactions, such as yelling, screaming, punching a pillow or bed, talking rudely, curtly, telling someone to go away, etc, are even needed in the first place? Like what I mean is this. What goes on in the brain? Like what does yelling and screaming and taking rudely or punching things even do? What is the outcome people expect? 


5). Please be aware that this question may come off as bad, but it doesn't mean to be. A post on here about this actually inspired me to write this. Why do people with anger issues see / take advice like it's a personal attack? Like- why does any advice- even if it's just to stop and breathe and collect their thoughts to communicate more- clearly seem
to make someone with with anger issues even more angry? Is it that it ACTUALLY makes people angry, or do people with these issues just not want to hear anything that challenges their way of thinking because they are comfortable doing what they are doing? 

6). Why is it so hard to just- not be angry? That may sound silly and like a stupidly obvious answer, but that is something I genuinely don't understand. And what I mean is, what is stopping people with anger issues from not being angry? Like in the moment, why is it so hard for people to realize that they are angry and stop it so that way they are not?

Sorry that there are a lot of questions, there's a lot I don't understand.

Thanks for understanding, and my apologies for being so blunt, I'm on the spectrum and that's just how I communicate!

261,3,"So long story short everyone has opinions and humans are weak to emotion. I out of everyone understand that. Living in America is tough right now. Especially with republicans and democrats are at each other’s throats… feels like I’m living in an episode of the boys. And a lot of things have been angering me recently.. such as… people commenting and insulting recently deceased who they didn’t like based on “theories” or ragebait. Things such as constantly calling someone else retarted for their opinions on literally anything… gaming/politics/youtuber shit… and everyone just keeps fighting… thinking that they know who deserves to be loved by god or not, or they think they can speak for everyone on viewing others and everyone thinking they are right…. Thinking their opinions hold the weight of the world and if anyone dares to disagree with them then they are scum….. I’m just afraid to talk to anyone anymore… I fear if I say something that disturbs someone else’s views then it’s all like “AHH YOU SUPOORT THIS GUY/GIRL? YOUR SCUM” or “YOU THINK THIS WILL HELP THE WORLD? YOUR A RETARD! LOOK AT ALL THE RESEARCH IVE DONE” Like…. I don’t research every little detail about every person and issue in the world. How tf am I gonna know who and what to support anymore?? Should I just hate everhone and stop talking to humans all together??? 

I feel stuck. How do you guys deal with all this anger in the world…"
262,3,"I was a very calm guy, like the calmest you would probably ever meet. People told me that I helped them calm down if I was around them. 

I never had any anger issues, but these last few weeks, I am literally filled with rage and hatred. I have some heart problems and my family worried about it and my anger started there. Then I realized a girl absolutely didn’t give a shit about me, and it filled me with rage. Then school work is stressing me out, I wanna break something.

Why is this happening? I started hating people, I started hating everything and everyone. Even slightest inconveniences make me angry, and I am failing to keep myself in control. I had best self control abilities, and it is breaking down. 

If this keeps on going, I don’t wanna do something that I will regret for a long time, because I have already done things in my anger, that I regret. Please help."
263,3,"please bear with me, this will be long.

i have these friends - lets call them mary, emily, nathan, and liz (all fake names)

i met emily and nathan back in 2022. they met in 2021 and became best friends, then i met emily the next year and she introduced me. emily and i lived together in a homeless shelter for a almost a year, then she moved in with nathan and his boyfriend (he can be ken). at this point emily and mary have been dating for about half a year, and mary moves up to live with them as well. a few months later they invite me to stay. but then we get the notice the landlord is selling the house and we have a year to find a new place. whatever. nathan and kyle move out, so its just me, emily, mary, and emily's brother mason. 

emily is an AWFUL person. i really do believe she's a narcissist. she's abusive and manipulative and everything you should avoid. the year we lived together in the house was hell. emily has many mental health issues and i cant fault her for that but it quickly came out that she used them as an excuse to be a dick. i mean, she cheated on mary, guilt tripped her, gaslit her, begged her to buy her expensive things and when she didnt emily would throw a full on tantrum. im talking screaming, crying, throwing things, straight up saying that she hates mary and feels mary doesnt care for her. mary let her walk all over her for a while, to the point where mary had dropped thousands of dollars in computers and drawing tablets and the like. as of now i believe emily owes mary $10,000. she would even throw fits because mary didnt want to drive down the road and get her a soda. 
mary had to get 2 jobs to sustain her rent and bills because emily drained so much of her income.

thats not even the worst shes done. mary has confessed to me that emily has pressured her into sex. mary would say shes not in the mood and emily would huff and puff for an hour and say she doesnt feel loved because she NEEDS sex and mary wont give it to her. LITERAL sexual assault. 

emily is a terrible friend, a terrible roommate - she made big portions of food and ate 1 singular bite and then left the rest out to waste and mold for months. she never washed her laundry and wore everyone elses clothes and bled on them. she was so nasty she gave mary many utis because she didnt clean herself and wouldnt wash her hands/brush her teeth before anything intimate even if mary asked. she never cleaned up after herself and never took responsibilty for anything. if we called her out on something she'd say shes having a hard time, or she'd get to it later, or (to me specifically) that i'm selfish and lazy and i dont have any room to talk (and this was because i refused to pick up after her or give her money - nathan and mary say im a good roommate). she constantly told everyone im a bitch and that she hates me.

im angry because of how she treated me, but im more upset because she destroyed mary. mary is such a dear friend to me and i hate that she had to endure 2 years with that bitch. and when they broke up (they still lived together for a couple months before our lease was up) emily was INSTANTLY on dating apps sexting other girls and wanting to bring them to the house. mary respectfully asked if she could at least fucking wait until she was moved out to do that and emily threw a fit but ultimately agreed. the day mary moved out emily told me she invited a girl over to come stay a few days the very next week. and this isnt even the TIP of the iceberg of whats shes done.

but now onto why i brought this all up. nathan is still best friends with her, even after knowing everything she's done. i live with nathan atm (another homeless shelter lol) so i see her often. whatever. i made peace with that. but nathan and i made a new friend - liz. liz and emily have inevitably met (and i have told liz some of the things she's done) and liz and emily hit it off. instantly. i warned her emily is not someone she wants to be involved in but she said ""she seems nice, i want to judge it for myself."" i told liz this is what she does. shes very nice for the first few months but once youre trapped, once youre isolated - for mary gave up her entire life and moved across the state and left all of her family and friends behind to go live in a place she never been to - then her true colors are going to shine.

nobody cares. nobody cares what emily did to mary. nobody cares what shes done to me. to all of us. and that makes me so fucking pissed. how can you excuse this? i hve said time and time again we need to cut her off. shes bad news. but everyones like ""oh when we see her once a week she isnt bad!"" well no shit. she cant abuse you when she knows you can just get up and go home. how can you just forget she's a narcissist? an abuser? a RAPIST? everyone says she can get better. 1, you cant get 'over' rape. 2, even if she could, she WONT. by her own choice. people have called her out so many times but she just keeps making excuses. she doesnt want to get better. she puts no effort into it. she just complains and whines and expects everything to be handed to her. when mary and emily first got together emily said she was diagnosed with bpd, taking meds for it, and in therapy. she lied about ALL of it. emilys in therapy now and taking some meds for various things but shes never been diagnosed with bpd and doesnt nothinng about it. tbh i dont even think she has it.

i want to cut off these 'friends' (because honestly nathan and liz arent exactly prizes either, even outside of the rape apology) but they are the only ones i have and i cant escape nathan. when i finally get my life together i would have no support. and im mad because if i do cut contact i will become to villian and lies will be spread about me. i have been so angry about this for almost 2 years and i feel like im going to explode. i genuinely dont know what to do."
264,3,"It feels like every piece of advice just tells me that I need to just react differently or delve deep and learn WHY I'm feeling angry. THATS NOT HELPFUL. 

I know why I'm angry. I know exactly why I'm angry. Can't fix it though. 

Therapy being suggested is the next biggest irritation because it's not affordable. Idk why it's everybody's suggestion these days when we are in a cost of living crisis in most countries. 

The last two weeks have been a constant fluctuation on being angry, frustrated, depressed, anxious, and overstimulated with anger being the primary issue. Everything is making my blood boil and it won't stop. 

Is there even any point in asking for advice? I'm genuinely at the point where self harm is my best outlet and it's getting worse. 

Also - tell me to go for a walk and die. If a walk worked this wouldn't be an issue."
265,3,"For a few years now, I’ve been caught in a cycle of resentment, anger, anxiety, and depression—and I feel like I just can’t escape it.

A few years back, I was part of a friend group that, looking back, wasn’t good for me. To ""fit in"" and keep the peace, I constantly devalued myself. I let my boundaries slide, shrunk myself down, and disrespected who I was—just to feel accepted.

In that space, I acted out in self-destructive and passive-aggressive ways, often without realizing it. I was hurting and confused. Eventually, I tried to grow and build some kind of moral compass, but I was still very emotionally weak. That’s when things got worse. I was gaslit, manipulated, and emotionally abused. I don't deny my own role in staying in that environment—I take full accountability for that. But it doesn't take away the pain.

When I finally tried to walk away, I did it awkwardly and messily. I was told, outright, that I only had value because of what I did for them. That still haunts me. It confirmed the worst fears I had about myself. Even now, I can’t stop replaying it all—how I let myself down, how I was treated, and how weak I felt.

I’ve *tried* to move on. I’ve tried to be better. But I keep slipping back into anger, shame, and this crushing resentment. I feel stuck. Has anyone been through something like this and made it out on the other side? How do you actually let go—not just intellectually, but *emotionally*?

**TL;DR:**  
Was part of a toxic friend group where I devalued myself. Tried to grow and leave but was emotionally manipulated and told I was only valued for what I did for them. Still stuck in a painful loop of anger and resentment years later. Don’t know how to truly move o"

268,3,"I'm a 23 male and today i hit my father

Well I just pushed him, not enough to make him fall but enough to make him stuble a bit. Yesterday evening i forgot to put the trash out and my father bursts into my room insulting me because i didn't do it, it isn't the first time that it happens people can forget and it isn't the first time he verbally abuses me.

My father was never a violent man, but he was very much abusive with words and insults and threats. I am the last one of six children, the others are all older than me and they don't live with us anymore, so it's just me, my mom and my dad.

This is the very first time this happens, I never put my hands on him and as you can probably imagine he's not very young, in fact he turns 66 this year.

I don't know what to do, today he also went away with mom for a trip and they won't be coming back for a week now. I feel like shit, anger pops up but it's immediately replaced by shame and guilt. I feel like I crossed a like and don't know what I should do, what I should feel...

Today it's also a holiday and I'll be spending my time with some friends but I dunno if I'm going to enjoy it.

If you have advice, stories, examples, anything please share, I feel like I'm in a very dark place right now."
269,3,"So, in 3rd class I had A REALLY BAD temper problem, I had severe anger issues, and things were bad at home. I was 8-9 at the time. So there’s this guy in my class, R let’s call him. R was 9? Reminder 3rd class. He was super bitchy and rude to EVERYONE. He was really spoiled and whenever we would play tag, he’d go “I’m out of breath”, now I respected that Of course, but the thing is the game would just start, and it was only when the person who was on wen tot tag him.

He had asthma, so nobody really said anything. The only thing is, he never brought his inhaler outside, never brings it out when he needed it weird enough. Then it clicked, he didn’t have asthma, how did I know? Well he was never out of breath, and he literally said “it’s just to give me attention, I don’t really have it. I just get out of breath a lot”. Now the reason why, he was ALWAYS out of breath is because he had, never exercised before. We’d go tons of times on walks for fresh air, and he’d always be last or first, everyone would skip him and he’d go “ARE YOU KIDDING MEEEE…. GUYS STAWPP!” Pick me boy energy, right? Now he was super slow, and would get mad when people step on his shoe. 

Now, the titles part, time to shine!! 
He would be super rude, of course like I said. And I had this friend called M, let’s just say. He was nice, caring and would actually be nice to R. But we all know fizzy drinks, right?…. I hope you do, and this one M had was a fizzy drink bottle, but nothing in it just for blackcurrant, but R saw it and started shouting at him. Since we had a “healthy” food policy, yup, he shouted at him for just carrying it around. I don’t think M had any bottles like water bottles to carry around. So he brought the drink. No fizzy drink just the bottle (container like) with black currant the juice in it. So I got up from YM chair, sharp ended a pencil to the brim, and walked up to R. And stabbed him in the shoulder with the pencil…. I know I sound bad, but I had sever anger issues, I know that doesn’t get me out of it, but I couldn’t contain I swear alright? I tried being nice to him and he was just rude as fuuuuhhhhk alrighty??  Now, he got 3 Easter eggs, yup. THREE. He keeps saying now, he never got it, but he still hurts M to this day. I keep trying to contain my anger, I’m making good progress. Everyone is happy with me for stabbing him with the pencil, and whenever he pisses me off today, I get a pencil out. Along a sharpener, and he cuts the shit. He’s now respecting some people, but i still hate him… 

AITA for doing that?"
270,3,"I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to post this on; I am not on Reddit often. For context, I had been friends with this person and the friend group for a few years, and we had lived together. We all usually got along with the occasional argument over dumb stuff. Now they all live together, and I live alone. I'm still friends with one of them. Let's call him Eric(I'm not going to use real names). Eric and I still talk and do stuff together, but I can't talk with him about what happened between me and the other two cause he doesn't like talking about the subject, and I can't say I blame him. The others, let's call them Levi and Ava, they are in a relationship and have been since I've known them. I am a lot closer to Ava than I am to Levi. I consider her one of my best friends and like a sister to me. Levi, on the other hand, we used to be closer, but he started pulling away, and when I tried to fix it and become closer again, he wouldn't try or anything; it was like I was just a placeholder in his life. I won't lie, I was very attached to my friends due to past trauma, and I know that part of this is my own fault. Now, a tad bit more context for the current situation, back in November, we were all planning on moving because Levi got a new job, and it was clear Levi didn't want me to go with them, as he had his problems with me that he wouldn't tell me. So, in the place that was a potential spot to move to, they had this weird rule about how many singles could live in a place together. Now, when I was told this, I was upset; I thought it was another way for Levi to get rid of me. I guess in my mind, if Levi got rid of me, I wouldn't be friends with Ava anymore, and I didn't want that. I said that I would look into it and try to find out, and Levi said not to, cause he'd already checked. Then he hung up, and I got upset. I took my headset off and threw it against the wall of my room, and then went outside for a walk. Afterwards, I went and checked anyway cause I didn't trust him, and I found that it wasn't the whole town like he had said, but a small county where we could have easily just found somewhere else to get a place. I was told afterwards that my throwing my headset against the wall gave Ava a trauma flashback to some stuff that happened to her, and it's not my place to say. I didn't know she was in the living room, and I didn't know that she would have gotten a flashback from what I did. It was an impulsive decision, and I've never done anything like that before. Ava forgave me and told Levi not to use that as a reason against me but Levi didn't listen and I get his point of view, I do, but the thing is, that fucker did the same thing not even a year ago and his was worse. He told everyone to go to their rooms, and then he threw a folding chair at the wall in the dining room and beat his hands against it, which also gave Ava a trauma flashback, but she forgave him for it as well. Now fast forward a couple of months, and I'm living alone and not in the best financial situation, while the other three live together. Levi and I aren't friends anymore now as he won't talk to me about anything, and he tried, or rather succeeded, in kicking me out of our dnd group and mutual game stuff. Eric and Ava didn't like it, but they also didn't do anything about it, and I ended up apologizing for being upset over a situation Levi sprung on me out of nowhere. Now I will say, I shouldn't have ranted or complained to them about the situation as often as I did, but I was upset. How could they still stand by him and not be upset with him after what he did? They even agreed that he was in the wrong as well, but he didn't have to deal with any consequences. I have a hard time reading people, let alone reading them through text, but anyway, I ended up upsetting Ava, and she exploded at me that I added emotional weight to her life and that I had the emotional capacity of a 5-year-old. I know I ended up pushing her to that with how much I was upset about Levi. We aren't talking currently, and we haven't talked in the past month. I don't want to lose her as a friend, but I don't know how to let go of my anger and resentment towards Levi. He knows how it feels to have your friends leave you without knowing why, and he did the same thing to me, over something that he himself did. Why does he get to live his life without any consequences? I've faced my consequences, hell, I probably have more coming my way. I know I've made my fair share of mistakes, but I've tried to apologize and atone for my past actions, and I've been trying to be better. Now, when I think of him and what he did, or when I hear his voice in the background when talking to Eric, or when I get told I'll have to reschedule because they're doing stuff with him that day, even if I made plans weeks in advance. I just get this pit in my stomach of just a combination of nothingness, dread, grief, and anger, I don't know how to get rid of it or how to get better. Please, I want to get better, I want my friend back.  Not Levi, Ava. But I know to get Ava back as my friend, I'm going to have to let go of this anger and resentment towards Levi, but I don't know how, how do I do that?"
271,3,"I have pretty bad anger issues, but my life was completely normal and happy. I know alot of people with anger issues have had trauma and a horrible life but im just normal. when i was about 8 i started lashing out a lot and throwing things, breaking things etc. when i was 9 and a half i started getting angry at the smallest things and i got in trouble a lot. whenever i went to my room in anger after yelling and stuff i would feel really guilty and cry for a long time, that led to mild depression. when i was 10 it calmed down for a bit after my ADHD diagnosis but it got really bad again a few months later. and its just been bad since. i think what may of caused it was my moms mental breakdown, which lasted about 2 years. she staying in bed all day, went to the hospital and mental hospital alot and was never really around me. all  i remember is my dad coming home and taking care of my mom and my aunt staying over some to help.  but i feel like that isnt the cause of it cause i barely even remember it and i was told it wasn't even that bad. was i just born with this? im still just a kid so i dont know."

Any help would be great thanks.
273,3,"
I’m 27, and well at the moment I live alone and I work for the family business. A business my parents own. But well… they’re likely getting a divorce and I’ll explain why. 

My father is… not entirely a good person. He certainly has a flaws. Mostly intense anger. As a kid he physically abused me a few times, and exploded and yelled at me every now and then. Intimidated me a lot. He’s a man who can’t handle criticism or being told no. Would explode in anger when I’d stand up for myself. He needs to control. He manipulates and lies a lot. As things have gotten intense, my mom has revealed to me nasty stuff about him. Including having a cocaine addiction, hiring escort and physically abusing my mother early in their relationship. I understand his situation, as a kid he had to take care of his sick mother with schizophrenia, and had no help from his family, and with diagnosed with depression as a young teen. 

What didn’t help is that he married… well my mother, a woman with her own flaws. I never had a good relationship with her either. Yelled at me on the daily, I can’t speak with her without criticism being talked down to me. She enjoys putting others down and thinks she above everybody else. Yells at all of us in public if she gets riled up. Gossips and spreads rumors. And I’ve seen her smile whenever she’d make my dad upset. I understand her situation too. My grandfather was a quite a son of a bitch. Old school, cold, and hard ass kind of guy who no doubt was physically and emotionally abusive forwards his wife and children.  

All in all, I’m not close to my family for these reasons. Sure I talk to them and go to the family get togethers, and well we work together, but for the most part I try to keep my distance as best as I can. And am very happy I don’t live with them. 

Earlier this year, my dad had a struggle with cocaine addiction that lasted a few weeks. My mother forgave him. And things kind of got to normal again. However in March he fell back on this coke addiction, this time for no reason. First time it’s because he had argued with her badly and they weren’t talking. My dad cannot stand being in bad terms with her and goes into a nervous wreck. My mother becomes cold and distant, making his emotional symptoms worse. So he turned to cocaine. But the second time there was no reason at all. He just did it at a party just for fun, and he went another two weeks doing coke, staying in bed most of the day. And when he wasn’t he was out and about getting his coke and staying out all night, coming back in the middle of the day. I also found evidence of… weird sexual stuff in the office where he was likely staying. My mom has decided to divorce, and he’s become quite sad about this and I can feel a tensity coming from him. He never dealt with his emotions, and I know that this situation will only make him feel smaller. And will lash out. 

I practice a lot of mindfulness, and well I’m learning to just deal with the anxiety. To embrace it. I have a reason for having it, because my safety and my mom and sister’s is in question. However my mind gets the better of me, and that anxiety can turn to anger. I guess it’s frustration I feel that I feel anxiety, which turns to intense anger. And I have fear of letting it out. Mostly with my father. I know my father will is going to begin doing hurtful things to all of us. He’s always let out his anger into me. Whenever things were bad with my mom, he’d yell out to me. Used to blame myself, but now I realize he was just feeling small, and needed to feel big. 

I know there will come a point where I need to stand up to him, and he’s going to lash out. Begin to scream and lose his temper. And I need guidance on how to deal with. My anxiety can get intense, and my ADHD causes some harmful thoughts. I don’t want to be a bad person, yet somehow it seems like it’s necessary sometimes. These are thoughts I have 

- when anger pops up, I visualize physically harming my father to the point of damage. The kid in me who got smacked around for not doing his homework wants to get up and get his revenge. 

- I think about screaming at him and telling him he’s a pathetic little child who deserves everything that’s happening to him. How can you be the piece of shit you are and expect good things to happen? You’ve convinced yourself that things were good and you’ve lived a life of bullshit all your life and can’t stand reality sinking in. You and mom are not good for me, everything you touch goes to shit, you simply want to drag me down and make me as miserable as you are. I will not pay attention to your misery and I do not sympathize with you, do not manipulate me into feeling bad for you it’s going to work. 

I want scream all of that to him. To push him and this situation away…. But I don’t know. It’s going to hurt him, and even if he does bad stuff, for some reason it does make me sad to see my dad hurt. I have a fear of breaking him. 

For now I’ve told both of them to not involve me with their arguments, their divorce is their business and not my concern. 

Can you guide me? I feel like my anxiety is valid, but I don’t know about my anger. On one hand I want to release my anger and put him in his place, so I can feel safe. Even if I may get hurt and things can get physical. Other hand I want to be a better person, and see his tantrums for what they are… just a child screaming cause things didn’t go his way. And remain calm and be the bigger person… but it’s difficult.

274,3,"I was at a friend’s house, he fell asleep first and for some reason just him sleeping makes me frustrated. I also for no reason at all just felt like i wanted to hurt him, this isn’t new either, i’ve thought about hurting people that have done nothing wrong at all, i have no idea why. I’ve never acted upon these thoughts though, i never plan to but i almost just feel like it would make me happy to hurt people, i really don’t like these thoughts and i don’t understand why i have them."
275,3,"I hate everyone. Family, friends, random people. I can be friends with someone for a year, tops, before I start to hate them and see their flaws. Being with my friends I dread. I'll hide in a corner until it ends. And I know Im a bad person for it, but everyone is really easy to hate. Am I just going crazy or something? I hate humanity as a whole, and people will probably label me as mentally ill. Everything I love at one point, I will eventually hate. Please tell me what's wrong with me"
276,3,"During my partner’s anger outburst, I have no idea how to respond. I’d truly love some insight on what you guys would personally want when you have an outburst. 

Usually a miscommunication sets her off, or if she feels rejected. I’ve tried a lot. I try to give her space (which is very hard as I tend to want to latch on and not let go until she’s herself again) however this just leads to her getting even more angry and saying worse and worse stuff for a reaction out of me. I’ve tried to not even argue with her and let her get all of the horrible nasty words out of her, and just keep apologizing until the moment is over. I’ve tried telling her to take deep breaths, to take space to distract, to do therapy methods to diffuse tension like a hug or maintaining eye contact. It seems like the only thing that makes it better is her watching me try everything in the book and then eventually sob crying to make her even more mad and then she decides when she’s done. 

I love her, and I sure as hell have my own issues. But navigating her anger issues is so difficult. She’s not interested in therapy, but always feels bad and acknowledges that she has a problem. "
277,3,"I finally realized I've skillfully hidden away my anger because I learned that my dad's anger was the only one allowed in the house. If my anger piped up, it had swift and terrible consequences so, out of fear and survival, I kept myself always serene.

But after finally cutting him out of my life, and beginning to heal, some anger is starting to bubble up again. 

I don't know what to do with it! Do I just sit and circle around all the times people hurt me over and over? Will it eventually fade over time like grief? I'm such a rookie. "
278,3,Im normally not afraid of conflict but i work in a professional environment so being confrontational is frowned upon now i got a bunch of pent up anger/rage and idk what to do with it
279,3,"I’m feeling incredibly frustrated and angry. My friend Aaryan’s sister, Aaradhya, got an iPhone 15 Plus, and it’s driving me crazy. She’s only a few days younger than me, and I’ve wanted an iPhone for so long.

What makes it worse is that their dad said, “The iPhone is useless for me,” and instead of keeping it for himself, he gave it to her. Aaryan is stuck with his mom’s old phone, and she limits his use to just 4 hours a day.

We used to play Minecraft and Roblox together all the time, but now it’s hard to connect. My network is terrible, and our schedules don’t line up anymore.

I know I’ll probably get an iPhone in the future, maybe when I’m in intermediate 1st year, but right now it just feels so unfair. Watching someone the same age as me get the phone I want is making me feel incredibly angry.
"
280,3,"I go through 'phases,' of varying degrees, of anger. Sometimes I'm angry almost 24/7. Sometimes, I just laugh at something that would, on another occasion, tempt me to put a hole in the wall. And sometimes my mood is a bit more reasonable, where annoying things annoy me to the degree that they deserve. For example, stubbing my toe making me shout and then laugh, rather than get full blown pissed off. These phases can last anywhere from a few months to a couple hours.

But I just want to know: where does the anger come from? Why is it so prevalent in my life? Why does it rear its head so often, and so high?

I know that nobody can give me answers. No one that's not a professional, anyway. But therapy is expensive, and so I'm just trying to work with what I've got. At the very least, maybe some of yall can offer some stories that I, or others who happen across this post, might be able to relate to."
281,3,"I have a migraine. I find a quiet dark room everyday and I stare at the poster on my wall of ""The Sick Girl"". She's lying in bed sick with a book just like me. But, anyone who has a migraine can be mobile. You can still exercise and listen to music to combat the depression or suicidal ideations which I have less of because of exercise and music combined which puts me in a better mood.

But, after getting angry a lot (self-contained/nobody is in the room), I realize I am angry at my own pain but I am angry at people who manipulated me or threatened me. 

Now, it's, ""I'm on pause"". I'm thinking, Wait, what about them? They are fucked up too. Shouldn't I think like that to lessen my own anger so that I can just stare at the poster and exercise?

On Reddit, people seem to be self-absorbed, as am I, but what about them?

I bet there are millions of angry people with sicknesses. There are probably a lot people enjoying walks in the park.

But, I think I want to compete a little bit. I can't see anger in people. It's just not visible. But it's there. I'll bet you anything. "
282,3,"This is the first time I post here, ever since I was a kid I've had problems dealing with my anger, getting angry pretty quickly over stupid things.
When I was younger it didn't escalate more than a tantrum or a bit of shouting, but now when I get mad I feel this kind of tingling all over my body and I have to kind of stop myself from turning violent, it has happened with unknown people that I saw on the street, friends or even family.
I had never felt this before and I was curious if someone else has felt this feeling before."
283,3,"If you have anger issues as a child, how did your parents handle that? 
If you were spanked for it, do you feel like it helped or made it worse? 
Would you spank your own kids for anger issues or handle it differently than your parents? "
284,3,"Current situation summary:  I have IED - esque behaviour. I think it’s currently worse because of postpartum hormones. I’m violent against myself, inanimate objects, and most sadly my 4 year old child (not too bad/violent, but obviously heartbreaking and sickening). 
I recently discovered the term IED on this forum and it’s helped me feel comfortable and motivated to get outside help. I’m not done contacting doctors, but so far the only appointment I’ve been offered is for July! 
I don’t feel like it’s emergency enough to go to the hospital (feeling better at the moment after several good days). 
I’m not sure whether I should even get on medication or just start a therapy. 
Any thoughts? 

More history:  I think heavy marijuana usage (about 15 years ago) sparked my mood swings, lack of impulse control, flipping out. I quit when I came to the realisation that  it was marijuana or my boyfriend. It got better, but never totally went away. With the stress of my kid being a kid it’s been getting worse again. 

I’m a 39 year old woman. I’m doing a lot of good lifestyle medicine:  good food, low caffeine, walk in the woods almost every day, sleep is prioritised and I get a decent amount despite having a 4 month old baby, I speak what I’m grateful for on each walk, and I’m trying to up my mindfulness. 

Something else:  I read a post in another area of Reddit about a woman who’s partner had gotten really angry and lost control. All the comments told her to secretly leave. It made me think: if I were a man, I’d probably have lost my family by now!  Weird thought. 

Embarrassment: when I first started reading posts and comments here a couple weeks back I felt embarrassed about my behaviour because it seemed most people’s anger was verbal rather than physical. I guess I was expecting to find more similarity to my own experiences. Since then I have found some accounts of physical violence. 
I’m especially embarrassed that one of my physical attacks is biting. I’m least embarrassed about my self harm even though that is the most brutal and seemingly out of control that I get. 

I’d be very grateful for your guidance for my current situation, and/or to hear if you’ve had any similar experiences. "
285,3,"Hi Everyone! I've been struggling with control issues for a majority of my 20s (29 rn). When I do not have control over a situation, I tend to work myself up really fast into aggression, and then it turns into overwhelming tears.

 For example: My boyfriend and I just adopted a new puppy this past weekend! He's so sweet and affectionate and just an overall happy and cute puppy. I was raised with cats in my household growing up and I have a cat now (he interacts with the dog very well and vice versa), so this is my first time raising a dog. Much of the things he (the puppy) do that are out of my control, like peeing in the house, chewing, etc, are triggering this reaction. A hard spank on the butt or a loud ""NO""  yell is my overall reaction and I am so disappointed with myself over it. He's literally just a puppy and he doesn't know better, I feel like I have no control over the physical reaction and I am riddled with guilt & anxiety afterwards (to which it's only been twice I've done this). I have also talked to my therapist about this, trying to identify the trigger. What are your tips and tricks to help reel in these emotions in the moment and work through the emotions? I self reflect afterwards, trying to identify what triggers me, but the damage has been done and that's all I can think about. I'd like to try and correct my own behavior before ""correcting"" his if you catch my drift. Thank you!!"

287,3,"Hey giys,i have a question,how do i control my anger?,because everytime i get angry it destroys my relationship with my family and all together hurts mysekf as well,but i cab't help it,after gaming and losing?,i get too angry,even the slightest thing?,angry,and it all together ruins my day and my family"
288,3,"I do lash out once or twice a year. Rarely, I do break something like a glass. Usually, it occurs like me yelling how I feel and then cutting all the ties. My problem is bottling up all my feelings and not confronting people when they cross a line. I am a desperate people pleaser. My trigger usually is feeling disrespected, invalidated and belittled. I have lost a lot of people that I've considered 'friends' over this.

Eventhough I know the reasons, I have no solution for my problem. It is ruining every friendship that I have. 

"
289,3,I have not been diagnosed with anger issues but i definetly have them and i lash out and get angry at people for small things like insults or video games. Earlier i was playing a game and everytike i died i hit something or hit my head on the wall multiple times. I dont know why i do this but i want to stop before i hurt someone in the future
290,3,"I discovered this thread a couple days ago and it's already helped me out a lot. My question is, what outlets do you use to combat anger in a way that actually addresses/releases it? I have a lot of hobbies/outlets (drumming, video games, walking, etc.) but those mostly distract me from the anger instead of actually dealing with it. Sorry if this post is obvious, I'm just really curious to hear what y'all have to say. I'm sick of this sickness lol. Thanks a ton."
291,3,"I am mustering up a lot of courage to come here and speak up on my anger issues. I really need to deal with this. I have been helping my brother with his assignments at school lately. I am perfectionist and he is not. In fact he takes things pretty lightly and his aim is always to just get by. I want everything to be perfect and also am a chronic procrastinator. When I tell him to do things and he doesnt follow through I get extremely mad at him and start shouting and yelling. I live with my husband in a one bedroom and he often overhears these conversations with my brother. He hates it when I shout at anyone and him. He cant take it. He becomes aloof and distant. Yesterday he told me he thinks I am not feminine enough because I shout. Infact in all our fights I am the one who loses control starts shouting and end up being the culprit even if I am not wrong. All these patterns and dynamics need to stop. Its taking a toll on my mental health and life. 

Some childhood context: Grew up in a joint family environment. My mother had constant fights with my grandmother and aunts. My brother and I used to see it and take care of her when she came back to the room. She used to cry, shout, express her anger in different ways. Our dad never said much in such sitauations. I definitely picked up some of that maybe from her. In general, I feel wronged, misunderstood and unheard, unseen and alone all the time. And maybe use anger as a defense mechanism. "
292,3,"Sounds like a dumb question, but everytime I get angry, I destroy anything that enters my line of sight (as long as it belongs to me). Books, plushies, photos, art- you name it, i've torn it to shreds.

Mindfulness and all that nonsense does nothing for me, trying to sit still and not think about it makes it even worse, and i'm not allowed outside alone for reasons. I can't think of anything to do and I know if I keep going at this rate, the bill of shit i've wrecked is going to rise substantially. Its also not fun to break things you cherish. 
"
293,3,"I am looking for book recommendations to improve my coping methods for anger, emotional self-regulation, and possibly stress management.

  
I don't think I am a generally toxic person (and no one else has ever indicated to me that I am), but I do have some very toxic/unhealthy behaviour around anger. 

For context, I(F early 30s)  am a generally a ""well-functioning"" adult. I am in a happy decade long relationship, I have worked a stable job as a teacher for the last 7 years, I manage my finances well and have good relationships with my family and friends who I have known since childhood.

These responses typically come up in conflict with my spouse, although they used to come up in conflict with my mother when I was a teenager and I sometimes still feel triggered by her (it doesn't escalate anymore)

When I feel intense negative emotion (anger and usually frustration and sadness mixed in) I have trouble communicating effectively which instigates or escalates an argument and creates a vicious cycle until I am so overwhelmed and frustrated that I start crying and leave.

Some of the things I have done  when in this state include:

\-Hide somewhere by myself (in a closet, in a corner, under the bed, in a hallway)

\-Hit my head against the floor (I have only done this on two occasions, but I lightly bruised my forehead on once). I often have a desire to hurt myself in other ways, but I've never acted on it.

\-Want to destroy things. I have never acted on this except once, when I smashed a glass into the sink (then immediately regretted it, cleaned it up and vacuumed, and left the house)

\-Catastrophize (self-harming violent thoughts, feeling like I want to abandon my relationship, wanting to burn/destroy all my worldly possessions)

\-I have said some things I regret. Not insults towards my spouse, but questions about whether we should end our relationship.

\-It takes a long time for me to feel better. I usually cry it out. Sometimes after being alone for a while we can talk it out, but it often re-escalates if it's the same day and I don't feel regulated again until I've slept.

These situations don't occur that often (4-6x/year) and vary in severity, but have been a part of my life since I can remember. They  also usually occur in a life-context of higher stress than normal (Ie. moving, new jobs, dealing with a bug infestation, etc.), so I think there is also a need for me to learn better stress management.

I'm not sure if it's relevant, but there's also a possibility I'm on the autism spectrum (my spouse thinks so and my mom agrees), but I've never been diagnosed and if I am, I'm very high functioning.

I probably sound like a nightmare to live with, and I feel pretty humiliated writing this even though it's anonymous. I really do want to change.

TLDR I have toxic behaviour around elevated emotions, especially anger and am looking for book recommendations to improve my coping methods for anger, emotional self-regulation, and possibly stress management."
294,3,"Let me start off by saying this, im not new to withdrawals. Ive withdrawn from every one of the major substance groups or pretty much anything you can name I prob had some sort of addiction to it. I'm on day 3 of light to no weed (Trying to stop, Smoked 1/2 a pound in less then 15 days and realized it was time to quit or take a break at least) but when I don't smoke, My anger is something else and gets me in a lot of shit online. I can't control myself sometimes, and it scares me. Ive quit fent, Benzo's, other opaites and stims ect. And weed is the hardest for me mentally minus benzo's. 

And I was never this angry till I OD'd on phenibute, Gabapentin and kratom. Ever since that OD wiped my brain and left me in critical state in the ER for 2 weeks I have way worse anger issues now, and my head ALWAYS hurts even years after quitting. Pretty sure I have brain damage from it. But im to scared to find out.

  
My dad has I.E.D. from years of prison. 

Use to be when I would get mad I would kinda blackout like a drunk person I cant even rem what I said or why I said it and Im the first to say sorry and beg forgiveness. The second I can calm myself, I always looks at the ones I hurt. And beg and beg for forgiveness. Its a cycle that make me feel like life isnt worth living some times. But I dont want to give up."
295,3,"Whenever i get **actually** angry, I'm ALWAYS hit with a sudden wave of calmness, and I'm VERY bad at vocabulary, but I know for a fact, my body or mind is betraying me and forcefully suppressing my anger into the background.

  
It's so bothersome because I never can express my anger at all, and no, the calmness doesn't actually make me feel better, I still feel troubled and embarrassed even that I can't let it out.

296,3,"I’ve struggled for years because of not seeing very much opportunity and underemployment leading to anger and bitterness and resentment. Any advice on how to manage so I don’t let it fester until I go postal?

Net worth envy is one of my biggest struggles in the top of the fact I’ll probably never have a six or seven figure job. 

Every time I hear about someone who is privileged it just makes my blood boil. "

Thank you for reading."
298,3,"I have been dealing with some ""episodes"" you could say. I am mentally pretty unwell and I am getting help for it since I am in the psych ward currently, but the anger of those episodes and even outside of them scares me.

I had a roommate/friend, who has a pet rabbit. She traveled around and stayed at her bf's house for like 4 months while I had to struggle to get by and take care of her pet. Now, she moved to a different country, and she had told me the plan of taking the bunny and then leaving the apartment stuff to me or whatever. I have been in the hospital since the 4th, she left with her flight on the 6th or 7th and just yesterday, my friend went to the apartment to get my stuff since I couldn't (I'm on suicide watch) and she found the bunny there. Uncared for, no one could check up on her since the only keys in this country were mine and I had 0 fucking clue she LEFT HER PET there in the empty apartment. She just left a couple of apples and hay on the ground and called it a day it seems.

I am incredibly furious and I have thoughts and flashes of just getting my hands on her and absolutely snuffing out her life because WHO TF DOES THAT??? I have 0 clue how to deal with this kind of blinding rage, if anyone has any ideas please help. I have used the boxing bag, screaming into a pillow, ripping up paper and I am damn near pulling out all my hair."
299,3,"Like i get that i can breathe, count, or channel it but those dont do anything at all. the anger dies down much faster if i hit myself. I know those are healthier but if i do them i just get even angrier to the point of just hitting myself again."
300,3,"My life has not been easy. I’ve been physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually abused. Both parents suck, putting it mildly. I can’t talk to certain people about certain things in this day on age due to unsolicited advice when I need someone to listen to and also  having my concerns dismissed and sidelined, which my parents did and I don’t need that in my life. My anger has escalated these past 6 months due to being unemployed (I hated it). Luckily I now have a job and I couldn’t be happier. Plus, I want to learn how to manage my finances without someone controlling them. To me, that tells me they think I’m highly incompetent (if I didn’t learn about money from being unemployed, yes, I’d be screwed) I am reaching out to advisors to help but it’s not enough because someone wants to manage so e of my funds when I didn’t ask. Then again, I’m 27 and this rage needs to stop. I tend to react to certain people when I’m being sidelined and dismissed, again, it needs to stop. No one listened to me as a child and would either be yelled at or beaten if I expressed even a slightly different opinion of them. Although a breakthrough did happen in therapy, which I’m glad of, I still need to work on my rage. Screaming at people I love and care about is not getting me anywhere, at the same time, I’m tired of parts of my family being dismissive and sidelining my issues. I’m also tired of raging when they don’t take what I say into consideration did have a conversation with someone about a major issue, I started off as calmly as possible, the conversation didn’t go well because the longer we wait, the worse things will be and I absolutely hate it when people screw others over.  Then again, I could have just hung up. Please tell me where I’m going wrong on this, I need to know how to remedy this. At this point, it’s getting to the point where I want to shut down completely. Plus, I’m also exhausted from these past months. I did speak to my therapist and she told me she understood what I’ve been saying as she heard a conversation I had with a relative about something major that crushed me. Plus, I would love to be proven wrong about certain family members. They keep showing me their side which hurts even more because I loved them dearly. Again, please tell me where I’m going wrong on everything. I will explain further as needed.

"
301,3,"In the public I cannot display anger or hatred. But privately I blast death metal in my headphones, lift heavy, punch bag, and play violent video games. It’s like I always enjoy these negative emotions. Too much happiness makes me want to puke. It is just who I am I guess."
302,3,"Context: I’m dealing with a stressful home-repair issue that involves many professionals giving me conflicting information, and the clear need to go into debt, which is making me feel powerless. Powerlessness is often a trigger for my anger. 

I’m either stuffing it, or managing it well. It’s a new situation for me to not blow up or get triggered by minor irritations in situations like this. 

I’m worried that it may come out explosively. But by not getting angry, I’m retaining my executive functioning, so I might be in the clear. 

I’m 56, male, and anger has been a coping/safety thing for me since infancy. It’s also caused lots of pain and damage to me and others in my proximity. 

What are your thoughts? And thank you. "
303,3,"I’m the eldest sibling. I have one younger sister who is 8 years younger. My parents baby her and I’m always blamed for things. I’m trying to express irritation in “I” statements, but my parents don’t let me express this. As a result this just builds into anger (usually shouting). My parents always tell me to “grow up” or they tell me I was/did the same, which I take as them invalidating my emotions. My sister is allowed to express irritability and they just take it. It drives me crazy and I feel like I can’t healthily express emotions in front of my family. "
304,3,"I already know what I did was inexcusable. I know I was a horrible older sister and daughter. I just need advice on how to go forward with it. 

my mother had told me (F/18) to make sure my brother (14) doesn’t play video games while she’s at work in another city. He’s supposed to study but he doesn’t because he’s addicted to his video games. I took away the wire to his computer but he found another 2 days later, i took that one away and he found another the next day. i told him to shut it down but he didn’t. i tried taking the wire off the computer myself and he started snatching it. I told him not to and let me take the wire and not to snatch it as the computer might fall and he laughed and said “i don’t care”. I told him he’s not allowed to play video games but he didn’t listen. I pulled it to take it and the computer fell on accident. It wasn’t damaged. I had already started getting angry at this point and I went to my room to call my mom but she didn’t pick up. 

After a while i went out to get my food i had taken a long time to prepare and the servant told me my brother took it. I asked my brother three times where it was and he didn’t reply. I told him if he doesn’t tell i’m going to hit him. (I wasn’t actually going to hit him I just did it to get a response from him and to scare him which again is inexcusable but i was extremely angry and wasn’t thinking straight) 

My father was there too and said “ i dare you”. This was my breaking point and it made me extremely mad because I don’t like being threatened by him. My father isn’t really on good terms with us. He doesn’t earn money, cheats on my mom and drinks. We only live with him because of our culture and divorce is a taboo. A day before this I had an argument with him where he threatened to kill me and called me names. I had not talked to him since. I end up forgetting most of the arguments I have with him so I don’t remember much. 

After he said this I went up to my brother and hit him slightly on the shoulder just to prove to my dad I wasn’t afraid of him. My father came and stood in front of me brought out his hand like he was going to hit me so i pushed him away to defend myself. I told him he doesn’t know the context and not to do butt in. I told him I never wanted him in this house and nobody loves him. I then when to bring a knife so he wouldn’t hurt me and told him if he touched me i'll hurt him. At this point I was completely blinded with rage, I have never held up a knife before and never talked in this way. I then went to my brother and yelled at him asking him where my food was again and he didn’t reply. I then hit the knife against the sofa in anger. i wouldn’t actually hurt him with the knife. he didn’t reply and I walked away again. Afterwards I was on the call with my mom talking about “why would a younger brother not listen” and he snapped back and said “ why would a older sister hold a knife or call her brother names (I called him crazy) ”. Later I found out he had thrown my food away after I had taken the computer wires. After I cooled off i realised what I did and i wanted to apologise I asked him to talk to me but he didn’t listen. My mom tried talking to him on phone and he didn’t listen either and went to sleep. I told my mom I’ll handle it in the morning. what do i do? My brother and I have an amazing relationship and he’s never seen me like this. My mom told me to apologise to my dad as well and I would’ve if the previous argument hadn’t happened. She said my dad always wanted to create a rift between us siblings (I have another brother too) just to prove to my mom she’s a bad mother. We are from an extremely argumentative family this isn’t the first time names have been called and people have been hit. I know it’s not okay and I know what I did was horrible there was no excuse to using physical violence to prove something to my dad and dragging my brother into it. I want to control my anger better but it gets so worse when I think someone is trying to scare me or threaten me."
305,3,"Throughout my childhood I wasnt allowed to have opinions or speak up for myself. I was constantly spoken down to and made to just sit and take it. When I did push back my mother or other people would beat the shit out of me. This angers me because I never learned to effectively defend myself, I'm 29 and have immense issues with defending myself. I can push back a little but that's only in certain situations that I know i can handle without the other person wanting to get physical. I feel so fucking pathetic and im ashamed, I can spot disrespect but can't speak up on it.. idk how to navigate this without someone resorting to violence against me.."
306,3,"Hi I live in a shared house of three people including me we are 4 (we're family), and I keep thinking I have anger issues. Every time my parents say something to me that makes me feel bad, i just shout at them. I really want this to stop. Maybe because I just don't get enough sleep(I sleep 7 to 8 hrs a day, very little), because sometimes I like to do stuff at night. I don't know. Maybe the next level is screaming at my friends. Any thoughts?"
307,3,"[19/M] In just one year, I already broke a lot of stuff such as 5 phone LCDs, 1 tablet PC stylus, 1 cabinet, 1 door, 1 headset, 1 microphone, notebooks, socket adapter, 1 computer keyboard, 1 computer mouse, tons of pens, tons of umbrellas, plates, mugs, and a lot more, all out of anger for random reasons like schoolwork, news, politics, religious discrimination (indirectly), and hatred towards my parents, siblings, and many other people.

It also hampers my studies a lot, especially if I broke my phone since I study mobile app development as well as a CS student. I also couldn't think and focus on my studies properly days or weeks after losing my stuff.

I've been always like this since I was a kid but it just became a lot worse since last year and I couldn't control it. It hit me so much financially and emotionally, especially since I am just a broke college student. Also, losing all of those stuff hurts so much as well."
308,3,"My brother and I would be happy when we are with our friends, cousins and love interests but we will stop smiling when we meet our parents because we still can't forget how badly they spoke and treated us when we were younger.

Our other relatives definitely still doesn't know why my brother gets angry with parents but happy with friends and cousins. "
309,3,"I'm new to the subreddit, so if it's not the right place, please let me know. 

just for some context, I (16M) have suddenly become incredibly irritable. And it's odd because I've never been irritable in 16 years on this earth. If anything, I've always been very calm even when under pressure. And yet, all of a sudden, I'm having an incredibly hard time not lashing out at people, especially when it wouldn't have affected me in the slightest before. I haven't yet lashed out, and ironically, my life has never been better. 

Have any of you experienced similar things? If so, was it temporary? For naturally irritable people, how do you deal with it? do you have any tips? thanks in advance"
310,3,"I dont hate him or anything, but I just cant stop feeling so, I love my father like how i love my mother, but i just cant stop being pissed off at him."
311,3,"I was not usually angry. But, I have experienced severe asthma and now a migraine. Nature is messing with me and on top of that, I've been harassed by people who knew I was suffering. F'n people. 

But, how can you not be angry if your brain is in a constant pressure vice grip. It's inevitable. And my father had a temper that he used at me for his own trivial reasons. I want to destroy my father if I see him again. But, he's a softened man now and he keeps telling me to forgive him because he thinks he's Catholic. It's BS.

I do not want to get arrested. I can't experience the chronic pain in prison. They would sodomize me then kill me. 

I think I have a bestselling novel I'm writing ideas down for. Maybe that is the solution. Not sure.

I wonder what other people would do with a migraine from Hell that drives you crazy and you are always on alert. Everyone is different.

312,3,For as long as I can remember (F45) I have always experienced a flash of red flooding my vision right before I say or do something to someone out of extreme anger. My earliest memory of this is from preschool and the last time it happened was last year sometime during a fight with my husband. Instead of blacking out you red out real quick then BAM you lash out. Only in moments of extreme anger. Anyone else? 
313,3,"# How to Express Anger in a Healthy Way

No, breaking plates is not on the list, but it could be!

Write Your Fears and Resentments

This is a technique created by Anna Runkle, from the [Crappy Childhood Fairy](https://crappychildhoodfairy.com/), in which she teaches people to self-regulate emotionally by writing down all of their fears and resentments, followed by a ritual of letting go and a moment of meditation.

The exercise starts by you writing down, on paper, why a certain thing makes you feel the way you feel.

For example, “I fear that my mother-in-law will make me feel small and insignificant again. I fear I resent my husband for allowing that to happen.”

And you go on and on. Some people, on particularly “busy” days, end up writing pages upon pages. This doesn’t just improve your emotional literacy, meaning you finally give some meaning to your anger that you can later meditate on, it also functions as catharsis. The letting out of anger in itself can blow off some of the steam.

At the end of the exercise, you are asked to burn or shred the piece of paper (very important to be an actual piece of paper), all while ending the exercise with a few sentences where you express your desire to let it go. You write your name, the date, and get rid of the paper.

Some choose to meditate following the exercise as well.

But perhaps the most important function of the exercise is to allow yourself to put some meaning to your anger and not run like a headless chicken. Why do I feel this way? Can I fix it?

If the mother-in-law annoys me, what can I do to prevent her from annoying me again?

And suddenly, you can now move from eating your feelings, distracting yourself away from your feelings, or downright avoiding them, into problem-solving mode, which will eventually allow you to relax.



# Mimic What Anger Feels Like

[Somatic exercises](https://www.healthline.com/health/somatics) are great for allowing you to feel in a non-destructive manner.

Find yourself a quiet place, take a piece of cloth or a towel, and squeeze it hard, all while allowing yourself to make all the faces you would make when you feel really angry. Really focus your anger on that towel, and give it a good squeeze. A good example of this you can find [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPu87cLEHac&ab_channel=SomaticSkillswithEmily)

Other ways to express anger, in the body, in a safe way, are to stomp your feet or simply mimic the movements and facial gestures a child, or perhaps you as a child, would make if you were allowed to be angry. Stomp those feet and get it out. Allow yourself to feel it.

# Long-Term Management of Anger Includes Self-Expression

Do you know what prevents anger from piling up and making you explode?

[Assertiveness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/assertiveness).

Yes, the long-term solution to suppressed anger is learning how to communicate with others and place boundaries with consequences. Anger lingers when the issue is not resolved. When you don’t know how to communicate or perhaps don’t know when it’s time to stop communicating with someone altogether.

You can’t walk through life achieving a state of complete safety. Sometimes there will be people who will disrespect you, annoy you, and trigger you—the trick is to not always be at war and choose to surround yourself with people that make it safe for you to relax. And that’s probably the most important skill one can develop.

I help my clients understand their needs, set boundaries, and increase collaboration both in [individual coaching sessions](https://pasthepast.com/trauma-informed-coaching/) and in [group sessions](https://pasthepast.com/group-coaching-life-transitions/).

# Anger is Not the Compulsion to Act – Angry People Still Have a Choice

Anger is not a trigger towards action, although many people think they should act on their emotions right away.

Sometimes, due to past experiences, we think people disrespect us and walk all over our boundaries, even when they don’t.

Other times, because we sometimes falsely accuse others of trying to harm us and we are in the wrong, we then swing to the other side of the spectrum—we never see anyone as harmful and we continue to rationalize and minimize what is done to us.

Anger and its cues are really something that needs to be explored in a safe therapeutic setting and, why not, in your journal, where you can start investigating when you were right and when you were wrong about other people’s intentions.

# Anger is Not About Aggressivity – It Is About Discernment

What do I mean by that?

[Anger](https://www.apa.org/topics/anger) should be the signal that, in time, becomes more and more accurate at discerning who is safe and who isn’t and when people are stepping over your toes. But by no means is it a channel towards aggression. Anger is just an emotion, not a command to go and break a window."

316,3,"for as long as i can remember i have always had like some sort of rage and anger inside me deep down like i don’t know why i’m like this and i’m not going to lie my english is bad i am not good at articulating what i’m trying to say but i’m self destructing and i hate myself so much for it and i need help 

right now i’m just like relapsing into these like phases where i just can’t control what i say or how i feel and i really try not get physical and it doesn’t happen often but i can’t help it when it does happen especially because i feel as though i won’t hurt my partner even though i try to because i’m smaller than the average person and he can usually hold me down and stop me from hurting him 
but like obviously i can do a bit of damage like it’ll hurt but not like so bad … i’m sorry that sounds so bad but that’s the best i can explain it if that’s even an explanation or just a joke of an excuse 
and it would all escalate from something that could’ve been resolved if my partner had said what i wanted him to or like idk cus it’s my fault at first for being so cryptic like idk why i just expect him to just know and fix it cus it seems so obvious to me but then again i can’t really explain it to him and when i try it just stems up more problems cus he’d say smth i don’t like  or respond in a way that’s like not right to me idk how to explain this part cus it’s not rlly like that but it is?

and i don’t even know where to start to get help and i’m too scared and embarrassed to as well.. i really want to change though but i just don’t see that happening if i carry on trying to fight this by myself like there is smth actually wrong w me and i just can’t fix it myself

317,3,"I'm an 16M Asian person in the UK. I’m wasn’t born in China or anything I just inherit from China, I was born in the UK. Also there may be some content that might upset some of you so if you are a Muslim or a girl, there’s nothing wrong with it I’m sure you are beautiful people, I just got upset. Also sorry that it’s a lot of reading

Back in October I got added to a groupchat that I didn't ask for that had 2 of my friends and a Muslim girl named Aisha and her friend group. After I've quite literally done nothing Aisha and her friend group started saying racist and hate comments to me. After a while of just trying to ignore it I couldn't take it anymore so I started being racist and sexist back. Since then we’ve had back and forth beef and yes there was racism and sexism. Most of the time she starts it, one time I was walking past Aisha, I didn’t even look at her and she went “looking uglier than before” cuz I had a haircut. She’s in Yr 9 and I’m in Yr 11 as well.

One time at lunchtime at school Aisha and her friend group splashed water all over me and 2 of my friends that we were with and again, we did nothing. I wasn’t gonna get involved if they didn’t splash me. Even tho we were in the same place, we were far away from them and they came to us. We also didn’t have any bottles so for the most part we had to run away or take it. The best thing we had to hold water was a tupperware box. One of my friends had a tube of acrylic paint for engineering class and he gave it to me. He said that if they do it again then I can splash them with it and then I got the idea of putting water inside the tube as well which he did. Then when the bell went Aisha came up to us with her bottle and tried to splash us again. Even tho she saw the paint tube, she didn’t care. Then we managed to get a combo. Aisha got splashed with water, then got kicked with a football, then I ran up behind her and splashed the paint over her for payback on everything she’s done. It got on her hair, clothes, bag and shoes. Deffo her shoes and bag cuz I've seen the stains. If it got on her shoes and bag then I'm 90% sure on her clothes, but I haven't seen the stains so eh. Same thing for her hair, I know for a fact it made some contact with her hair and if so then her clothes but I haven't seen the stains.

It wasn’t surprising she and her friend group snitched and we all got questioned. They tried to play victim for too long and for the most part it didn’t work. The staff were like “We've seen the paint all over her hair, clothes, bag and shoes and it's not coming off so we need to see the tube to make sure it wasn’t corrosive” WHY DAFUQ WOULD IT BE CORROSIVE JUST FROM IT NOT COMING OFF. The guy wore gloves to pick up the tube from the bib. Also if the paint can’t come off then I’m gonna have to pay for the damages. IT’S PAINT FFS WHAT’S GONNA HAPPEN, YOU GONNA TURN WHITE? The next day I got suspended for 1 day cuz “the acrylic paint could’ve gone in her eyes even tho you splashed it behind her and it shouldn’t have even been on school grounds even tho it was for engineering class” and I tried to tell the staff that they were being racist and even tho they said they’ll look into it, I just know them too well and I can guarantee you lot they don’t care. “Aisha’s mum called the school and told us that Aisha doesn’t feel safe coming to this school anymore” right well you can tell her that she brought it upon herself and that she got what was coming to her. “You’re supposed to be wiser and older, why didn’t you walk away and tell a staff” CUZ THE LAST TIME I TOLD THE STAFF SOMETHING THAT MADE ME UPSET THEY DIDN’T DO FUCK ALL AND SHES A YR 9 FFS. THATS LIKE RUNNING AWAY CRYING CUZ SOME 7 YEAR OLD CALLED YOU NAMES. I’M NOT A FUCKING WIMP. NOT EVEN 10 MINUTES BEFORE WHAT HAD HAPPENED, A MEMBER OF STAFF CALLED ME A CLOWN THE THIN CUNT.

Update: I've come back from suspension and the staff are playing the ""whenever you are in a situation where you feel like the staff hates you, it's actually because there may be circumstances you don't understand"" which I think is bullshit and they've said this before but at this point I don't even care, I've got like 1 more week then final exams then I'm out of here. Aisha is pretty pissed off but hasn't done anything. She now wears Nike Air Force 1s as replacement shoes. My 2 friends and Aisha on my suspension day got lunchtime detention and Aisha's friend got Isolation. No one has mentioned about me having to pay for damages so I'm just not. I feel happy, like I've achieved something. I got my revenge :)."

My manager said he had warned me before about losing my temper which, to be fair, he did you just yesterday. This is not the first time. I lost my last job of 5 years in November for losing my temper with a manager there too. And I lost the one before that as a retail supervisor for losing it with a customer. I don't mean it and was provoked each time. I seem to get frustrated quickly, especially when things don't work as they should. Is there help you can get, as I can't keep losing jobs? Did anyone else develop effective strategies for dealing with a similar problem you have had? "
320,3,"I've never been a violent person but the past week or two I've been having non stop violent thoughts, constantly zoning out fantasizing committing gruesome acts.

I cringe thinking about it and look like an idiot trying to control myself, idk if this is that big of a deal tbh, im not the type to have sustained bouts of rage and never really wish ill on others, i just need an outlet for my anger. "

I can’t do this anymore. I’m gonna get help. "
322,3,"Me (f 16) and my aunt (who lives with me and my grandma(my caregiver)) got into this fuss. I tend to hold a lot of anger inside, and usually try to hold my tongue because I felt like she had manipulated me into going easy on her (basically just taking advantage of my soft side) after she left my family, and I was extremely angry on her before I forgave her. now in turn she constantly disrespects me (or at least that what she came off as.) and I started arguing and screaming at her about that 

And then it got so extreme to the point of me standing in my kitchen in front of aunt screaming “you both hate me” over and over until I just started screaming and throwing myself against the wall. I get angry and yell, but nothing like this has ever happened to me. 

I just want to make this clear. Most of the time I am an asshole, and I honestly think I’m a bad person. and I take my anger and frustration on people that I love. And I’m so scared because I’m just starting not to care anymore. I’m so tired of climbing my way up this dark hole just to dig myself deeper than I already was and I’m so tired."
323,3,"A couple of years ago I was having a bad day, everything about it was shit and I was doing my best not to lose it and trying to get home to be alone with my thoughts, when all of a sudden a nosy old man comes right up to me and says something like ""but look at that face, you should smile more."" I lost it and I screamed in his face to mind his own business, red faced, tears in my eyes, screamed in his literal face and yes he backed off. Good. Bystanders around us were looking at me as if I had lost my mind. Good. 

What is it with people refusing to mind their own business?"
324,3,"i (15f) have autism, which causes me to get stressed insanely easy. This leads to horrible anger, usually my parents will then retaliate by bringing my mental health up, which makes me even worse. I yell at them and tell them I hate them and insult them in ways that i know will get to them. i feel such rage, and no empathy at all. 

today it happened again, my hair wasn’t going right which led to an argument. my mom then started bringing up other mental health issues (won’t elaborate incase of triggers) which made me so unbelievably angry. i said i never wanted to see her again and that she’s stupid (she struggles with stuff like that) and it ended up with her crying on the phone to my dad. my parents are not together anymore, so when he came over he was also raising his voice at me. I was obviously blinded by anger at this point and i was yelling horrible things to the both of them that I never want to repeat again. at one point he got close enough to me to grab my hand and start crying. this broke me and suddenly i snapped out of it and i was completely numb. 

ive never felt such anger like that before, and the fact it only took a couple seconds for me to switch into that rage, and then another couple seconds to switch back out of it, really scares me. It’s like im a completely different insanely evil person when this happens. 

I don’t know if this is just anger or there is an underlying cause. Why is my dad the only one able to calm me down? Why do i become so evil when im angry? How to stop being so angry?

330,3,When I heard that anger is a cover up for fear it really changed my perspective and made sense.

I have an anxious attachment style and my boyfriend has avoidant, so basically he stonewalls me and I just get increasingly angry while I wait for him to come back to finish an argument/dispute. The other day he left me alone all day and ignored me, then he went out. I was so angry and upset that I cried and ranted and raved on my own until I threw some glasses on the floor. He told me tonight that when he came home yesterday, he didn’t feel safe and even messaged my sister to tell her what I’d done. I feel so bad. I know it stems from my childhood when my dad used to smash things in anger before he left my mum.
Are there any women that have anger issues caused by a violent father figure?"
332,3,"There is someone I really dislike. I have known him for over ten years since freshman year of high school. He has bullied kids his whole life, he poured his drink on my friend on a cruise, and he kept saying the “n” word on another trip when my best friend dates a black girl. I have an itch to really kick the ever loving shit out of him. I’ve been boxing for four years and I won Golden Gloves. We are going to a wedding in May and I am scared of what I could do to him. I’m not saying this is a threat and that I will do something, but at what point do you reach your limit? I have never liked him, but the hate has grown very much recently. You can say whatever you want to me, but when it comes to others that I love, you are messing with the wrong person. I am trying to control this rage, but I am scared of what could happen. What I hate the most is that this is the only thing on my mind lately, it is like I can’t do anything until this is settled. Do I call him beforehand or do I settle this at the end of the wedding? Either way, I will be telling him how it is going down. The message will be to never speak to me again or look my way, otherwise I am bringing the pain. I always try to remind myself that I have an uncle in prison and it isn’t worth it, but man, this guy gets under my skin like nobody else. It is honestly quite amazing to me how people still bring him around. "
333,3,"Hi there,

I'm curious if there's something similar to a phobia, but instead of feeling fear towards the thing you feel rage?

  
I have a rage trigger towards a certain cartoon. I can pinpoint no reason for it, but seeing it mentioned, hearing people talk about it, seeing it on tv or stores or anything like that, triggers irrational rage inside of me. I have examined this thoroughly and tried to find a reason for it but I can't. Even typing this about it I can feel it bubbling.

  
Any thoughts would be great as I'd love to try to get on top of it one day. I'm better than I used to be but...it's kind of ridiculous. "

I think I’m just bored with the same people and the same old day to day ; I go on a lot of dates but am never really interested in someone . "
335,3,"I’m looking for advice specifically from those with experience with a spouse with AM struggles or someone with them as I feel it’s more helpful than reading the first two pages of google results. 

When there are issues that need to be discussed, ones that you typically wouldn’t brace yourself for an argument let alone an explosion, is there even a point in continuing to try to have the conversation or once the persons anger is triggered should you just table it? If so how? 

Example, I got a phone for a parent I care for as they are going blind and needed a bigger phone. I showed spouse and I instantly knew they were upset. I explained why I got it, I explained it was paid for by the parent that doesn’t live with me, their reaction they said was because they were tired of “phone juggling” I knew that wasn’t it and finally they told me it was due to not knowing where the money in my accounts was going. I have no issue showing them, or giving them access so this argument always confuses me and makes me think there is more to it but who knows. 

At this point barely a paragraph of conversation in, they are upset. I asked “it seems like you are really upset, may I know why? I don’t understand.” They said they are upset because they don’t agree with it. Now I’m very confused, a phone purchased for a person going blind that has no impact on spouse at all they don’t agree with? This is where i feel dumb I don’t know how to respond. “I don’t understand it doesn’t impact you or me?” They get really mad now and tell me they didn’t blow up, they don’t agree with it but what are they going to do? Scream, blow up? No. Can’t they just be upset? 

I’m dumbfounded. It feels like I said it was cold outside and now they are angry and I can’t do anything about it until they sleep and wake up fine. 

Now that they are upset however the flood gates have opened. I messed up and said I didn’t see how they were so upset and that was fine yet I can’t even show I’m hurt by way of facial expression they didn’t tell me our electric bill was behind to the point it was turned off. The last in a long line of accounts opened in my name that weren’t paid that I now am responsible for on my credit. This is a recent issue and I seriously can’t even ask why they won’t tell me we are behind, immediately it’s deflected and I’m being barked at “what I don’t understand is where (insert whatever you want here) went”  basically anything to turn the conversation to something I have done whether I’ve done it or not or whether it is even reality or makes sense. This I know is deflection. But how the heck do you respond? 

I mentioned how it’s hard to be carrying such a huge weight and not be able to talk to them about it or show even that it hurts. When I bright up the accounts they told me to just call the cops and put them in jail (what the actual heck?) This turned into non stop demands for answers to things having nothing to do with what we were discussing and me having anxiety and cptsd much of it connected with very abusive people (I’m not saying he is abusive anyone yelling or angry scares me) makes me shut down. I feel like those posters in school that teach you how to survive a dog or bear attack. Curled in a ball protecting vital areas. 

I told him I’d answer 1000 questions, I simply can’t do it when he is this angry and raising his voice or clearly on the verge of exploding. I am as sincere as you could be. Non confrontational. I’ve read the books, I’ve researched, nothing is working and I’m at a loss. It’s like once they get mad, there is absolutely nothing that can even lower the anger level except them going to bed. The next day they are calm again. So do I avoid talking at all? I’ve never felt so helpless before. I just want to figure out how to communicate with them and they feel safe doing so so they don’t immediately get angry. "
336,3,"nobody fucking cares how i feel, i feel like putting my fingers in my eye socket and ripping my skin off"
337,3,"I get angry when I'm saying something or especially if I've repeated it several times, and then my partner tells me that I think or have been saying the opposite. For  example, I might say I think my feelings are valid for being hurt, but I don't think it's right to yell about it, and then my partner will say that no I've done nothing wrong and it's all her fault. And that really sets me off cause I have never said ""I'm right"" or ""I have nothing to apologize for"" or that she deserves to be yelled at. I have a problem with getting angry and it tends to be that I get angry when I feel I have to defend myself. So when she hurts my feelings I yell at her. Ultimately I feel like I'm valid for feeling hurt and that's what I yell about, and I guess that's why she thinks I'm yelling at her because she deserves it? No I'm yelling because my feelings are hurt. I don't think she deserves it. When I cool off I've always admitted it was wrong of me to yell when though my feelings are hurt. But then I just get all angry again cause she says it's all her fault like that's the compromise I'm looking for when I'm literally trying to admit to my own fault. Either that or she thinks I'm lying when I say I don't think it was right of me to yell, just because I did yell? I guess maybe I do feel like when I'm hurt I'm justified to be as upset as I am, but I don't understand why when I've cooled down and admit It was wrong to yell, it's invalid because I was upset and yelling before? That that makes me a liar or a hypocrite?

Just an extra note I am trying my best to manage my anger but I am struggling to get myself to actually stop before I yell. I guess it's because I feel like I'm right to be angry, but I don't necessarily feel like I'm right to yell, I just can't realize that until I calm down."

Since my 20s the women I’ve loved with all my heart also seem to be the ones that I have less patient with many times. That lack of patience leads me to feeling upset and then that feeling leads to anger. It’s exhausting and it’s been haunting me since my first relationship because after I’m angry I get no benefit from it and it literally puts me in a state of pure exhaustion. 

My girlfriend(s) are the ones I see every single day and talk to every single day. This makes me realize that I can be patient with people I don’t as often but when it comes to people I interact with daily this is where I tend to have less patience. My Dad was like that for us as kids and young adults. Is this normal?! Why is it this way? Are their books talking about this specifically? How can I be more patient for the people I see every single day? How can I get a control of this before it ruins another relationship. Thank you. "
340,3,"i raise of own  voice for unknown reason because scare of somebody take it away from me. and i don't know what should i do at this point. and im 34 years old, wonder if this behaviour go wrong for while."
341,3,"Every fucking day. Some jackass never actually stopping at stop signs, taking turns out of order, jumping the queue, pulling out in front of you in a way that requires you to stop very quickly (I would hit them if I didn't), and on and on and on... not to mention the cars that have illegal tinting, illegal license plate covers, registrations that are years out of date.... where the fuck are the cops? I'm not even in a high crime area and it's like they don't exist. Reporting bad drivers does nothing, even with dash cam footage. The police are simply uninterested in road safety, and instead only care to write speeding tickets or kill minorities. Someone tries to kill you blasting through a stop sign or merging right into you at freeway speeds? ""oh, minor misunderstanding""... you follow them home to yell at them, suddenly it's an issue. If the police bothered to do a goddamn thing fucking ever, these people would be ticketed and have their behaviour change. But no. The people who were wronged and looking for a little acknowledgement of that are the dangerous ones... I just don't buy it. These people injure, kill, and maim people with their driving, but saying ""get the fuck off the road"" is worse than shooting up a school. 

It's to the point that I want to just start causing accidents. To the point I don't want to brake and instead smash into their fucking cars and claim I didn't have time to stop. I want to run people off the road. I want to rip them out of their cars and fight them. I want them to get permanently hurt/injured so the next time they think to do some bullshit dangerous move, they'll think of their broken arm and think again. 

I know, I know, ""but people have guuuuuns"" idc. I'm so sick of following the rules and it feels like letting the entire fucking world walk all over you. I wish I cared less, ""get there safe,"" but I don't. Every time I see someone block an intersection I just want to drive right the fuck through them as fast as I can. The only thing ""but people have guuuuns"" does is make me want to buy a gun and carry it with me. They got guns? Now the playing field is fucking level. 

How do you guys decompress in the moment? I don't want to feel this way. I want to just drive places and not get stressed out or have a fight. But I can't let go of these things.

342,3,"I (56f)am so ashamed, in a fit of rage I broke my laptop this morning. It would not accept my password and I was stuck in a password reset loop. It started last night and I was able to put it aside but when I woke up this morning and tried it again without success I could not control the urge to break it, I hit it, threw it, and when that didn’t break it enough I got the hammer. It’s like that frustration had been there all night, just waiting to come out when I woke up. This is not the first time I have broken a device, but is the first computer. This is not how I am unless it is a tech issue then I seem to have no reserves to manage my frustrations. I have to use technology so how can I let the inevitable frustration that comes from things not working not get to me? I count, I breathed and had morning affirmations running, I need more tools for these situations. I am sick now at the person I was this morning and self inflicted damage that I caused. "
343,3,"lost it at work, which caused a fall out between me and my boss that caused me to be a wreck this week. I apologized but it wasn’t enough.

My emotions this week boiled over at a coworker who was pretty understanding but it was a loud outburst in my home while my roommate was also working from home and he’s pretty upset with me .

He’s one of my closest friends so not only am i on the outs with him i’m also in deep shit at work now. 

I just don’t even want to talk about these stories anymore and while i know my family is there for me i just don’t want to talk about it .

Years of progress and a couple months of the best i’ve felt mentally in years are squandered by a few bad moments. No one cares about when you didn’t , they only care about when you did. 

I’m supposed to see a girl tomorrow and I really want to call it off because i don’t want to go out and do anything and i feel pretty depressed so idk if i will able to perform in bed. 

Every corner i have turned in life had been scorned by an angry outburst it feels like. "
344,3,"Is it to join a support group?  
to see a doctor, what specialty?

Thank you!"
345,3,I'm 13 I know it's bad for me to cry at this age
346,3,"I've been having these moments where I feel so much anger even though I know I'm not supposed to. Most recently, I've had trouble sleeping at night so most of the days, I would sleep in until 12pm. I am on my way to change this habit. In the past few days I have woken up early, spent time with my family and I didn't even take any naps. I like to be consistent with this but then just now, I told my dad I wanted to help him with the car and then he told me to wake up early because he'll be doing it early in the morning, sort of in a mocking tone. I know I'm not supposed to be offended but that really threw me off. It felt like all my efforts to change myself are being ridiculed. I didn't take out my anger on anyone but myself. Once I got to be alone, I went on a rant, punched the walls, hit my head, and now my knuckles are swelling. I realized that this is wrong. I don't want to throw anymore tantrums. I want to stop being so angry. I want to find peace. I've tried breathing techniques, distractions and heck, even tried becoming more religious but nothing seemed to help. I don't know what to do anymore, eventhough I've never lashed out at people, I think it's a matter of time before I do so. There's just so many things going on in my head right now and I want them to stop. Please help."
347,3,"I have a bad habit of not standing up for myself. I’ve been working on it but really have a hard time finding the line between standing up for myself and overreacting. Or the line between walking away vs being walked on. 

I used to go from 0-100 fast. Now it’s like 0-50 fast then I control it. How do I get to 0-1 instead?"
348,3,"I don’t understand. I can go all day at work in such a good mood, counting down to when I get home to my boyfriend..but then somewhere in the 30 minutes it takes to get home I’m soo grumpy and in a shit mood. It takes EVERYTHING in me to not take it out on the very same boyfriend I was basically day dreaming about less than an hour prior. 

It also bothers me because my mom was always the parent that came home angry/ looking for a fight and I DONT want to be that person or become that mom. 

I try the work hat “method” (I don’t think it’s actually called that it’s just how I’ve had people explain it to me) where I stop at my front door and mentally take off my “work hat” and leave it outside. 

Except work isn’t putting me in a bad mood…maybe it’s the commute? Even though that’s just sitting on a train scrolling or listening to something. 

Maybe I’m hangry. I don’t know, it doesn’t seem to matter what/ when I’ve eaten or even what kind of day I’ve had. I’m just always pissed when I get home. "
349,3,"My sibling and I get along, kind of. But not a lot. I spend a lot of time crying, thinking about hurting them or myself, and contemplating how much I would've loved to be an only child. It hurts, because sometimes we get along so well that I can't even imagine hating them as much as I do the other times. They are probably one of the main reasons, but not the only reason, why I've had massive panic attacks in the middle of the night thinking about how much they've made me bottle up to avoid talking about with them because my parents always told me ""it's just their ADHD"" or they'd tell me ""it's because you have a therapist and I don't"". But when they did get a therapist, after years of this stuff happening, they suddenly act like they're this sage of wisdom or something, constantly acting like they're the bigger person, even while they're directly breaking boundaries and agreements that had been put in place and reiterated multiple times.

I hit them tonight, not very hard, just a sharp slap on the back of the hand for waving their hand in front of my screen to try to get my attention (after I didn't continue a conversation topic they have been told before I don't like discussing). They complained about it and they always say things like ""you always do this/that, blah blah blah"", but then they turn around and think it's okay for them to be openly hypocritical, berating me and icing me out of conversation if I do/say anything they don't like.

I don't know how to deal with this, I have tried taking time for my own space. I have tried sleeping in a separate room. I have tried talking to my parents. I have tried talking to them. I have broken down crying in front of my parents and told them I don't want to live with them (my sibling) anymore. I have looked online, on health clinic websites, on mental health blogs and other ones, trying to look for a way to fix it, but most of the answers are to 'cut out this toxic person'. I can't do that, especially because my sibling expects me to not only hire them if possible (our plans were to work in the same industry after college) but also to live with them for the foreseeable future because, as they've told me not just in email but in person, ""you're the only person I like talking to"" or ""I can only talk to you about my interests"" and other stuff like that. I was basically their therapist, listening to their problems with school, our parents, their grades, etc etc, until they got a therapist. I'm just starting to wish I'd never been born.

What do I do?"
350,3,"I am still an angry mess. I try my best to control it under my own power but I fail pretty much every time. I tell myself I'll do better. I tell my partner I'll do better. Then a little minor convenience or voiced concern later, and it's all out the window.

I'm tired of my lack of willpower. My inability to really look at myself and change. I want to do more but it feels so daunting and difficult to start. I've read some posts where people have talked about trying to stay conscious of my emotions in the moment, even having a mantra. I want to try that. Usually there's no discernment between being annoying or just been wholly angry. It just happens. But if I can stop myself and just focus on my surroundings, or even that atmosphere of the conversation, maybe I'll be able to reel myself back from the edge instead of letting my angry emotions get the better of me.

Where do I start? Do I try to control my emotions or do I approach this all differently?"
351,3,"I'm 15 f, and I have bad anger issues, sometimes I get physical or say horrible things. Lately I've gain control over my anger but today my grandfather almost made me hit him or yell. So they send me to buy a soda drink, they said between ginger beer or cola but those flavors weren't there. I went inside the shop myself to get it so obviously I didn't see them and both a different flavour. I get home this man says I'm a lair, I felt like I could just punch his old stupid face. He complained how can't they have those flavours and what kind of shop only sells one flavour. I told him there were other flavours and those ones he doesn't like so I took one he can actually drink and that they own a shop but barely have anything. He continued to accuse me of lying, I closed my bedroom door and started punching the pillows and swearing. If you don't believe go by yourself next time you old bastard. Idc if it sounds disrespectful he ruined my entire mood and he always ruins it."
352,3,"Im going to share something with everyone and I hope it helps, Anger is not good for the body it’s poison ☠️ . I let anger get the best of me and I felt my heart beat and it felt black and hard every time it would beat. I would black out and wouldn’t remember what I did. When i came back to functioning normal I was in county jail and  the next day my anger went away and I had to see my kids behind a glass window. My kids had a drawing in colors of our family and cookies. It’s broke me and after I got out I wasn’t allowed to see my kids or have any contact with them. I had to take anger management, parenting and substance abuse. I told myself I will never let anyone make me angry again my kids are the only thing that matters. If you don’t care about your life think about your mother, father, brothers, sisters,aunts. They need you and a true friend will not help you get into trouble but tell you let’s go and leave.I will bitch out of someone comes wanting to fight and I do it for my family. (I hurt my ex brother in law because he hit my wife). I sat in jail for Christmas and new years I hope this helps you if you are reading this. Life is beautiful enjoy it while you can 🙏🏽"
353,3,"For some much needed context: about four years ago, my dad was the victim of an attack that put him into cardiac arrest. The intended one week of ICU ended up being extended to about 9 weeks, as he was a functioning alcoholic and went through withdrawal during the hospital. In the end, he came out with a Hypoxic Brain Injury that has severely changed how he thinks, talks, acts, and lives. Since then, I wish the accident would've finished the job.

This event has put us under severe financial stress, as he got laid off from his job, meaning my mother has to work two jobs to keep us afloat while I am stuck at home with dad trying to take care of him, the house, and the animals. And all that man does is spit it back in our faces. All he does is call mom names and make her feel like shit and it pisses me off. I feel like this happens once a year where dad will say something stupid and it will result in me throwing hands and beating his ass. He's 68 years old and not in his right mind, so I know that it's not his fault--but goddamn the verbal abuse is so hard to take, *I just can't do it.*

I don't exactly have a good track record with anger. I'm overwhelmed easily, have frequent meltdowns, and videogames make me put holes in the walls. I am very prone to outbursts of anger and can't translate that into doing anything productive, such as mowing the lawn or working out. The only thing that seems to work is to turn around and take a walk but that can only happen after my initial big outburst--an outburst that my dad only escalates by being a disgusting asshole. I don't know how to stop that. But I hate my dad so fucking much. He refuses to work, he's constantly punching the air and mumbling swears like he's fantasizing about beating us up, but he never actually does it, it's all just talk.

Either I need him out or I need to fix my anger, but we literally can't do shit because money is so tight. Things are so fucked up in this house and he could be doing so much, brain damage or not, but he doesn't. Legally, he's an adult, and he can make his own decisions, such as whether or not to work or to drive or to live in our house, but it's shit like this that reduces him to that of a dementia patient. One minute he's screaming and cussing and calling everyone names, then the next he's the happy-go-luckiest mfer alive and doesn't remember what just happened.  
  
How do I prove, legally, that he's mentally ill? How do we get him out of this fucking house and into an old-folks home where he belongs? How do I stop the outbursts? If it continues I am going to kill him one of these days."
354,3,"I think I'm giving up on the concept of anger management. My anger is normally directed at myself. I know the exact cause of the anger, and it's normally in my control. I just have to do better in life so I don't get angry at myself. I should just stop worrying about anger and just fix my problems, even if I'm mad in the process. It's better than stifling my anger and ignoring the root cause.  

But maybe this mindset is bad and I need someone to put me in my place. Any feedback is appreciated. Thank you. "
355,3,"i honestly just needed a place to vent this, because the anger and hatred i have for this teacher just keeps building up.

for context, shes my maths teacher and shes utterly useless. never teaches, is never in class, eats in class and shes just a crap teacher. the schools aware of this, i went on a lengthy tangent to a teacher about it, and nothing. they dont care at all tbh.

but recently, shes been getting on my nerves SO badly. she always singles me out from the class, being like ""jane hates maths haha!"", ""janes angry with me!"" or ""janes not speaking to me!"" and its pissing me off so bad i literally dream about hitting her. like she seriously doesnt know when to stfu.

me and my history teacher have a pretty good rapport, hes about the only teacher who calms me down, and my maths teacher knows this. i have maths directly after history on fridays and she sometimes comes into the class going ""janes not my friend today, shes not doing work in maths"" and genuinely all i say at this point is ""fuck up"" or ""yeah cuz you dont fucking teach.""

im just so fed up with her and it feels like she genuinely tries to piss me off on purpose – and its working. ive always been an angry person since i was a little kid; lashing out, shouting, violence, all that. as i got older it became more internalised with ideation of hurting people and getting my own back.

so yeah, i just needed a vent, but any advice on how to deal with it would be nice :,)"
356,3,"
So three days ago I wished death on my coworker’s unborn child….

Me (27F) and this coworker (25M) have been going at it for about two months now. When he first started this job he would make “jokes” about my appearance, my life, my work ethic. But he would say it in way that appeared light hearted…jokes. The comments usually hurt my feelings but in an effort to not be a downer I always just laughed off the comments and made “jokes” back at him. I mentioned the hair comments hurting my feelings once and he told me he was joking but he continued to make them. He added me on social media and would share posts with me (I would usually respond with an emoji or a short comment). So after a while I just figured maybe that’s how he joked with people he considered his friends. He never actually joked like that with other coworkers though…

However, about two months ago everything changed and we started legitimately bumping heads at least once a week it felt like. I spoke to my manager about it after a particularly large blowout and she chalked it up to him being stressed because he just found out that he got his girlfriend pregnant (unplanned). I told her that was no excuse for him to treat people poorly. I understand being stressed out but taking it out on coworkers just doesn’t seem right to me. I continued to keep my distance from him, only engaging when it was something work related even when he would try engaging with me. I made it clear that I wanted nothing to do with him unless it was work related. But even then, he would ignore what I was saying, half do whatever I was asking, or go back and forth with me about whatever I was asking. I am a shift leader to put things into perspective so I have to ask him to do his job when it is not being done. 

Fast forward to Sunday. Me and this coworker are going at it all day long. It started out being about work related issues but I’m saying things that should not be said (dropping B bombs) and he is doing the same. The final straw was toward the end of the day as I was cleaning my last few tables. I walk to the dish room with both hands full of plates. My coworker is also back there on his cellphone and putting up cups from a tray. The tray is blocking me from setting my plates down so I try to slide the tray down closer to him to no avail. Coworker looks directly at me and continues talking on the phone and putting his cups up (I didn’t expect anything more honestly). I finally am able to push the tray (with some excessive force because I’m annoyed) and it falls on the flat surface of the table that we unload our dishes onto. No glasses break but some do fall over. My coworker proceeds to look at me and say “if you were a man, I would have been slapped the f*** out of you” I tell him since he’s so big and bad, do it right here and now and he proceeds to repeat his statement. We get into yet another argument and this time the managers have to break us apart. 

This is where I ruin everything…I call my sister and explain everything to her. She says that she will get her boyfriend to come up to the store and scare my coworker and maybe even rough him up a bit. I’m pissed at this point but I go back into the building and I proceed to show my sister the coworker on video. He begins to mock me and starts telling everyone that I was going to get someone to beat him up. I gather my things and as I am leaving I start just saying anything I could think of. He starts waving and laughing telling me to leave and that I was a joke. I then say to him…”I hope that baby dies…” I say this multiple times…He just looks at me. Everyone just looks at me. My manger tells me to leave the building and I sit in my car outside the restaurant crying to my sister. I tell her what I said and she’s shocked. 

I work with kids…I actually really love kids so I don’t even know why I said it. I didn’t even mean it but in the moment it felt like I did. I was just so angry and my ego was bruised so I just said whatever came to mind to hurt him. That baby didn’t do a damn thing to me and had nothing to do with the situation at hand…
I don’t even want to show my face at the job anymore and idk what to do.

I’m not asking for sympathy, I guess I just needed a place to vent honestly. All of this over petty arguments. I was no saint in any of the arguments either just to make that clear. My points were valid but I have a tendency to drop the “B word” when I’m angry especially with men that I feel are being aggressive and unnecessarily “sassy”…
"
357,3,I have had anger issues all my life but they went down in middle school and have been rising back up ever since high-school started. But the issue is i never wanna hit somebody unprovoked and i don’t want to hit somebody who does not deserve to get beat up. One thing i recognize in this though is that when I’m cuddling with my lover I don’t feel as angry but my friends are telling me that she cant be my only source of happiness and that its unhealthy so i just don’t know what to do.
358,3,"Hello, I need immediate help. Yesterday, I had an argument with my girlfriend, and she broke up with me. I was angry and hit the wall. I never hit her, but I did restrain her. She told me, ""Let me go,"" and I wouldn’t let her. She said, ""Don’t pull me,"" and I pulled her even more. If I saw that she was leaving, I would stand in front of her to stop her from going.



One day, I was also angry and took the blanket away from her at night. She was so scared. She’s a psychology student, and she told me I’m a textbook case of anger issues and that I should get help. But in the meantime, we cannot be together.



This makes everything more complicated because she is leaving the country for her degree, and we were supposed to have a long-distance relationship. But now, that’s not happening. I still have a few weeks left with her, but she is sure of her decision. She told me to put myself in her position and ask myself if I would let a man like me be with my sister. Obviously not. I’m a dick. But I don’t want to be like this anymore. I don’t want to become an abuser, maybe I already am, but I don’t want it to get worse. I seriously need mental health advice.



I’m an idiot. Even when she told me why she was leaving, I felt like it wasn’t a big deal. But now I see it, and honestly, I don’t know how she put up with me for so long. She told me we could get back together if I get better and go to therapy. She said she loves me and wants to stay friends.



Every time she leaves, I feel anxious. I want to see her all day. Honestly, I’m very frustrated. My whole life, I’ve hit things. I even hit my brother once because I was so frustrated. Now I see that this isn’t something new. I don’t know why I am like this, and maybe it doesn’t even matter why, I just want to get better. I don’t want to feel this way or make the people I love feel unsafe. I really need help, and I don’t know where to start.

"
359,3,"I’m seeking advice for some kind of anger management, or at least a way to try and manage and re-route it. ANY advice helpful.
It’s ruining my life. It’s ruining the lives of my friends.
I get so annoyed and aggravated at the smallest things, and I just can’t take it anymore.
It’s making it harder to live with myself.
"
360,3,"So, bit of background. Nearly 32, still living at home. I'm 7 months into a care-pathway after getting drunk and shouting at someone in a pub (I know, I'm an asshole) and now I'm wondering where I'm going. Also, if there's Karma in the world, I'm feeling like something's lacking..? "
361,3,"Hi ther everyone!  So I personally do not struggle with anger or anger issues, so I'm asking this for another person so I can assist them.

There is something that I'm not understanding about anger. 

Why do people with anger issues, not understand the difference between being  expressing their emotions, versus being rude while doing it.

 I know often times it said that people with anger issues don't realize that they're doing it, but if it's been going on for a long time, and someone has called them out on it, I would think that they would've realized by now?

So I don't really understand the whole disconnect between thinking that you're expressing your emotions versus the fact that you're actually being incredibly disrespectful and hurting other people.

I'm asking because I'm in a relationship with someone who has extreme quick to react anger issues, and they don't understand or even realize the difference between telling me what's wrong and taking out their anger on me.

And then afterwards, they will realize and then apologize, but they will keep doing it over and over and over again.

I've come to crossroads where I don't know what to do. I know that this person has anger, issues and I'm somewhat empathetic and compassionate to that, but at the same time, I deserve a lick of decency. I don't want to be screamed at and yelled at all the time.

Is there something I'm doing incorrectly? I'm trying to deal with it by figuring out  what's wrong and trying to get down to the bottom of it and trying to just help and calm down things.

Most often times the questions of what is wrong is either met with I'm fine or nothing, and then, as I don't believe it, it gets more and more intense, and it ends up being an argument and a screaming match, and the person ends up getting pissed off that I even asked why they were talking a certain way or what was wrong in the first place. 

I don't understand why this is upsetting for people with anger issues. 

Essentially. ""Why are you getting mad at me because I need to know why?""

I'm not understanding why it seems like nothing I do is right. 

If I try and deal with it in a calm manner, I get walked all over. And disrespected. If I tried to deal with it firmly, I get asked why all of a sudden I am acting so rude, and if I try to match energy, I get told that I'm just matching energy.

And then afterwards, I ask if they wanna talk about it, and they say no. So how can I know what's wrong if you won't tell me?

I honestly have no idea what the hell to do, or how to deal with it. I know that may make me sound like an insensitive, absolute, asshole, but I don't mean to be.

I have never dealt with anyone with anger issues. It seems. I'm doing something incorrectly or the individual is just not understanding.



So I'm asking is there anything that I can do differently or is there anything that I should tell the individual whenever they're angry to calm things down?

I know each individual persons anger issue is subjective, but I have no idea what to do. And apparently, according to the individual I ""don't know how anger issues or emotions work."", So I figured I'd ask the Internet.

362,3,"Hi My wife and I have been arguing for a long time now, we’ve been having regular conversations about how I react to criticism and how disrespectful I am towards her. If I’m honest, I find it difficult to replay how the conversation went and how I was in the moment. To be clear, I do not physically touch my wife or scream.

I end up apologising and say I’ll work on it. However, I’ve put little effort in to try and fix it because I am Not seeing any results from the things I tried

Meditation 
Reading
10 seconds count down
Breathing

I just want to recognise it so I can manage it. I struggle to know the difference between when the conversation goes from constructive to destructive

As an example, I was explaining to my wife about how my mum was upset with me over something, my wife brought up how she thought my mum might feel upset and she went on to somethings that had agitated her about me but we had already discussed those things earlier that week. It felt off topic and a bit of a dig, which upset me, so I called her out on it and it turned into an argument….

Is therapy the best course of action for me? 


Thanks"
363,3,"So for context, I'm currently 20 years old(turning 21 this year) and in the past I used to have this principle to not let others into my head easily. And I was not the type of person to get mad, even when this 15 year old kid punched me in the face due to a misunderstanding I didn't get mad, I just chose to understand. Like in the basketball court, even though I sucked no one dared to talk shit about me cause they knew that it wasn't gonna work, no one got in my head. I used to believe that I shouldn't get angry easily because we have to be the type person who chooses  their fights, because we don't know if who ever is in front of us got a gun or not, I avoided every trouble I encountered.

But now, I get so mad easily to the point that I snap for about like 10-40%. And then others who pisses me off are living in my head rent free. What a transition right? but yeah, I want to change this because like I emphasized earlier, I used to believe in picking my own fights and that I want to apply this to myself again in case the next person I snap at is actually strapped and could kill me any second. It's crazy how much people can change when they get older even for just 1 or 2 years."
364,3,"There's a woman who is constantly bickering in a voice intended for other to hear, she threatens the dogs at the smallest things and it doesn't evenake sense because she makes really, I mean really violent verbal threats at the smallest inconvenience. It's even worse with the child, not her own which makes it worse because she ends up using phrases like ""how monsterous can a child be"" and other verbal abuse that are directed towards children. Basically it's beyond infuriating to live in close proximity with such a person and I don't like socialize with abusive people, like, at all. But I still try my best to treat the other like a learning person deserving of respect although I don't actually respect them.

She says things like I'll kill you, I'll hit you, I'll thrash you to both the kid and the dog and I know it's not actually gonna happen but she doesn't care whether it is actually understood that the child and the dog is safe. She complains about every little thing and ngl it feels as if she has a severe case of superiority complex.

So today I had to be around her for a small time, there was an issue regarding the basic facilities and she starting blabbering away again, but confusingly it was directed at me. Confusing because when I tried to make conversation with her she talked over me again and again and again. So basically I quietly went to my room and put on headphones and went back out to complete the work I was doing. Her body language changed and maybe I'm assuming but I think I saw her feel a bit upset. Regardless, in my head I was laughing and so proud of myself. Even though it might not be real it felt good thinking I made her upset without spitting half of the venom she spits every hour."
365,3,"I lost control of my rage tonight.

A few months ago, the neighbor next door to me in my low income housing physically assaulted me with a move he learned playing football in high school before he fell apart. And that night, I was obliquely threatened with eviction if I reported it to the police. 

I complied, keeping it quiet to keep my tiny studio apartment, but simmered with rage at the owners. 

This guy is a mess, but he's charmed too. He is a meth user and violent individual who pretends to be docile when anyone he isn't abusing is around. Poor little him, he's being discriminated against for coming from a rich family who sort of disowned him but gives gifts to other residents and the management that might be a factor here. They even gave me a scarf set at Christmas, which I accepted politely, but never used, though I needed it. 

I cannot be bought, poor as I am.

Another tenant just got evicted for r*ping a neighbor who has left for that reason. She was becoming a friend. But she was already a survivor of trauma. She refused to go to the hospital or press charges. I completely get why she left after all this, but not why she wouldn't press charges -- except decades ago when I was r*ped, I never told anyone official either, not until much later. So yeah, sadly, I get it. Except that guy has attempted it with other women, myself included. He's gone, and I don't have power there.

But the precious golden boy, let's call him Mark, he is the only one can do no wrong in the property management team's eyes. Or some of them. He attacked the super twice, one time causing a concussion. He has attacked my best friend across the hall. He defecates everywhere. He screams and laughs in the halls at 2 am when he's met his dealer. 

But he puts on this big act that he's developmentally disabled in front of police and any other authority. This is highly offensive to those that are actually coping with such. 

Anyway, as soon as they're gone he starts shouting like a frat boy on kegger night and speaking in a perfectly normal way, calling the cops and the landlady and super and all us tenants names, mocking us all, pelting us all with undeserved vile invective. Because he can. And for some weird reason we're just supposed to put up with it all.

When he attacked me that time, he ran at me as I was approaching my apartment door and getting my keys ready. His door was just past mine. He charged down the hall, a tall, sloppy, filthy young white man with eyes blazing a meth-fueled high, and screamed that I was stalking him! What?! I was just going home!! 

He tried to crush my ribs as he dipped way down to ""shoulder-check"" me, almost knocking me down, but when he tried to smush me, it was the first I've ever thought of the extra 20 pounds I can't seem to shed as a good thing. The fat protected my prematurely frail bones. 

Fast forward to tonight.

This evening, we all stood on the sidewalk watching the firemen work as the red lights flashed over us, and the rage built in me until I finally exploded when a girl not even old enough to drink, supposedly on ""security duty,"" was saying that because poor Mark has ""issues,"" the police would not be involved. His pyromania, his habit of starting fires in various places in the building, was a ""disability"". 

THAT'S when I lost it. 

I socked Mark in the back of the head. But I have weak arthritic hands and that was the extent of my prowess in fisticuffs. 

My MOUTH is my weapon, and I now had his attention, which was the idea. So I started in on him, finally! 

I unleashed verbiage to make longshoremen blush. The shrieking condemnations that poured from my lips were shocking enough to make other neighbors stare, gaping, in a circle around us.

They'd all been with me, on my side, about him when no one was watching or listening; my best friend's boyfriend had been venting in a rage at him earlier, saying he has to be evicted, his fists clenched with rage. He just didn't want to burn to de*th in his bed. I get that.

But no one backed me up. Afraid of consequences, knowing Mark has some kind of charm the rest of us don't, they stood silent to a one, choosing to stay subservient to avoid homelessness.

Well, if the building eventually does burn down, we'll all be homeless, won't we?! There's a long waiting list for apartments, and the shelters are full. None of us wants to be homeless. 

I get that. But it hurt. I'm afraid I may have called my friends a pack of cowards. I hope that part was just in my head and not out loud. What if they all hate me now? 

What options does anyone in this position have? What recourse do I have if the new landlady, who's hard as nails and doesn't like me, decided to evict ME?! 

The only response Mark gave to me swatting him on the back of his thick neck was a mild, annoyed ""OW!"" But  what he's done to me, to the super, to my friends, to my other neighbors, is not only wrong but criminal! To say nothing of his not only doing meth and other street drugs here but dealing them in the building! The hallways and elevator are littered with things I can't bear to look at... Things dangerous or contagious to touch. Occasionally I even find blood.

This is why poor people get so dispirited, then even degraded. We all have differing stories, having arrived at poverty in various ways. Disability. Huge medical bills. One guy is a high functioning autistic person. Another had a stroke and lost his grip. One guy's a thief, him I don't like, given that he robbed my storage space and took most of my clothes. 

Another guy had everything: fast car, high-paying corporate job, I think in the finance sector, pretty wife... But his bipolar disorder caused him to burn through it all, after which his wife left him. Crushed, he plunged into depression and got stuck there. He's my age, and he's the one who had been venting about Mark setting fires and why wasn't he in jail?! He's my best friend's boyfriend. She is a stunningly gorgeous Millennial. He still likes the ladies. But in the face of authority, he, like all the others, falls silent. He couldn't cope with being homeless.

Problem is, neither can I, and if they tried to evict me for going off on precious Mark, and no one else backed me up, which they won't, even my beautiful best friend who has a job and a life... Can they evict me? Would there be a hearing? 

More to the point, how could I help get Mark, who has a court order to take psych meds he openly tells people he never takes, evicted and maybe taken to some kind of treatment center? 

He probably has Medicaid and won't do rehab. He has vehemently refused all help. He's threatened his family for trying. I told him that if he wants that path in life he should unalive himself. Before he destroys other, actually innocent people. I was, I admit, saying terrible, appallingly vituperative things. 

What in God's name have I just done? 

What would YOU do? "
366,3,"It all started one day when i was playing a game and was extremely upset, I'm a very hateful person and I hate alot of things like people, losing, family etc it's a lot.

Suddenly my heart started to hurt in the middle of it and I started feeling cold shivers on it.

It felt so weird and painful, like someone was putting this hands on my heart and squeezing it slightly while also rubbing it. The best way to describe it is when Stella grabs Subarus heart in re zero.

I started laying down and fell asleep recovering by the time I woke up, since then I've had a lot of issues with my heart.

One time I got so mad I broke down my door repeatedly punching it and making my door snap into tiny pieces which all stabbed me.

I threw my door across my room and went into another bedroom and realized how much pain my heart was in and then fainted due to pain.

When I woke up everything was better once again and I continued living until today.

Today I was playing a really hard game and finally beat it, but there was a part where you have to reclimb the dungeon and I tried doing it.

And my character ended up dying horribly making me lose all my progress, I got so mad I threw my pillow and started kicking and hitting my bed frame extremely hard causing dents i threw my phone across my room and went crazy with rage and bloodlust.

And then when I checked my phone it still counted the fact that I won, and that my fury was for nothing.

My heart badly hurts as of now and I find t hard to control my anger in my daily life, I'm 17 and I keep struggling with calming down.

There's actually a lot of in-between events where I got pissed off but in all honesty these 3 are the most painful moments for my heart.

I know if I don't calm down I'll probably die, but I can't control it.

I also have a lot of other mental issues but I'll only talk about my heart as of now."
367,3,"I've had something like Intermittent Explosive Disorder all my life. Seroquel helps, but I kept investigating what affects me.

Magnesium alone made my anger a lot worse. But recently, I found that combining it with calcium makes me better than ever before, much better than with none of the supplements.

Does that make any sense? My blood levels for Ca and Mg are normal, vitamin D constantly on the lower edge (28-30 ng/dl) despite supplementation, remaining blood and thyroid tests fine as well. Could I really have a deficiency of both magnesium and calcium?

369,3,"Hello, my husband has a short temper but has never been physically or verbally physical towards me or our kids. He gets angry at situations/objects and just escalates. Tonight my 5 year old wasn’t listening to him when he told her to come down from the bunk bed. He starts screaming, totally out of proportion for the situation (in my opinion but I was in the other room). Next I hear her screaming and run in - he’d pulled her down the ladder and knocked out her loose tooth and there was a little blood. She was scared and he apologized, she still wanted him to put her down. What do I do? "
370,3,"Like you're trying to assert boundaries and ask for space, but they follow you or don't let you go. Seems hard not to snap when things like this happen? Does anyone have any advice for specifically dealing with those kinds of people? TIA."
371,3,"When I'm frustrated/angry 
And it's usually over something completely stupid, I either bite my self so hard I can bleed , or break the object of my anger, like, the internet...(I broke my phone In half)
My iPad screen (I was playing a Roblox dti parkour oby event)
Or right now, I bit my self to a point the pours on my leg that are on the bite mike, some are scary open red

I knew I couldn't break my phone or iPad, BC that would not fix a thing, and make things worse 

So my next best solution. Biting my self , it helped 

Why? (Playing cookie run kingdom and trying to defeat a boss, following a tutorial, I have the same team and around the same builds and upgrades, and I still lost , repeatedly) 

I hate this part of myself, not like this self destructive behaviour is good, and I really shouldn't get annoyed over such trivial things 

But idk what I should do. I try not to get angry at, things
"
372,3,"I almost beat someone up today. I was walking down the sidewalk and a man came up to me and asked me for money. I had my headphones in and was listening to music so I didn’t really hear him, all I remember is how close he got to me. I was looking down at my phone but in my peripheral vision I saw him approaching. He was within 2 feet of me on an empty sidewalk. I just kept walking but I heard him utter something foul and at that point I turned and shouted some obscenities at him. He didn’t turn around. I kept walking but as we got further apart I saw him throw a bottle across a car at me. I snapped. I ran across the road as fast as I could at him, shouting “you want some mfer” with my fists up. He put his up but I could see the fear in his eyes. He started backing up. People were looking at me crazy so I retreated. I was so close to hitting him. I’m usually a pretty chill guy but I have an anger streak and it scares me sometimes. I’m not usually like that to homeless people but I live in NYC and I see some real scumbag shit. I feel like I overreacted and I actually feel really bad about it. I don’t know where it came from but I need to address this. I have a therapist but we don’t meet for another week and I could use some advice here. "
373,3,"to an obscene degree as of late. I moved out of my dads house for the first time back in august and so I'm kinda new to adulting, the general stress of adult life combined with my roommates extreme passive aggressive tendencies have been make my anger problems flare up like a supernova. I wanna scream really badly all the time but I need to be the bigger person so I just end up white knuckling my emotions til said emotions pass, I try expressing my emotions to other people but its like I'm speaking in greek to them. I'm honestly at loss on what to do. it makes me wanna cry, like a lot"
374,3,"I keep having incel, misogynistic, hateful,  hateful thoughts about life and i am constantly on edge. Please help

My situation. If this post violates any rules im sorry.



every single day especially after my fight with a couple of friends that happen to be women. I keep falling down the incel rabbit hole. I keep feeling like everyone is out to get me, that women see me as subhuman, and that people don’t respect me. I keep overthinking everything and taking every little thing personally and constantly feel attacked and angry over rejection or people distancing themselves from me. I lashed out and been extremely rude to a couple of women for no longer wanting to be my friend and keep having thoughts like they should have less rights and that they shouldn’t had the right to distance themselves from me and reject me. I keep having thoughts on causing problems and fighting everyone.



Every day, I’m either anxious, stressed, or resentful and angry, i hadn’t truly been happy in several months, I’m always on edge, looking for the next person to wrong me so i can lash out.  i get extremely full of rage when every woman that wrongs me also has a boyfriend while I’m single.

I don’t know what to do, i can’t afford therapy, i can’t afford professional help. My sister and mom keep commenting on how i always look stressed, and anxious for no reason. Everytime i try to step out of my comfort zone and go out the house i get super anxious, overthinking everything. i constant coast throughout the day either at school, or the gym and stay home watching YouTube. Im underemployed and have to pay off a 2500$ credit card balance so i can travel before the end of the year.



i don’t know what to do, i want to be happy again i don’t want to be in my 40’s and miserable. I feel very bad for all the people i had mistreated, i feel bad for the people i hurt.

Anyone some good stories/ ideas or experiences?

377,3,"Standing up for myself makes me suicidal. It's a long pathology that comes from early childhood tortures and the cPTSD that resulted. I can't lie to myself anymore, even in trauma, not in many decades. And since everyone else does lie to themselves, everyone else's subconscious protects them from understanding me. The chronic anger is both fully justified and overwhelming, but there is no escaping from it, no managing it, no working through it, no accepting it. I can't go to therapy, except with very specialized people trained to help torture survivors, or they will misunderstand and abuse my trust to defend their own sanity. And there's no more they can help with anyway, after decades. ""It was my choice to survive,"" is how such therapy goes, and everything that follows is my own fault. But, I am reminded, I always have the option to change my mind. I mean, at 15, that's a tough road to face, and to walk for the rest of your life.

It's a constant losing challenge, because well meaning people lie and gaslight me without even knowing they're doing it, every day. If I fight it and stand-up for myself, for what I know is true, the lies turn to scapegoating and the misunderstandings compound endlessly until the people force me to go away. Everyone actively tries to obfuscate my perspective and the meaning of everything I say, to attack me and drive me away from them. It's biological more than psychological, and built into society as one of the few things we blindly cooperate on. And our subconsciouses spend our entire lives protecting us from ever realizing it. It looks quite sociopathic from my perspective, because the willful ignorance and lack of empathy is staggering. It's a wall of perception that humans will not willingly acknowledge, cannot normally get past and remain healthy, and leaves me without friends or family or any kind of support. Eventually most people try to kill me, one way or another, if I let myself get close. Animals are my only real friends.

My landlord is an abusive alcoholic and literally threw me out of his apartment when I went to him about the neighbor upstairs having a flood that was pouring into my apartment. He said it wasn't his problem, as he was drunk and didn't care, and bodily threw me out and slammed the door. A lot of my stuff is ruined and I haven't slept all night, trying to dry out the toilet water and doing laundry. I had to call the property owner in another state to get permission to have a plumber go into another apartment, which took an hour or so. They have also told me that they don't care and I will have to sue them to make any changes or get any remuneration. And I was reminded to pay rent. This is not the first leak, but it is the worst, and it started days ago. Nobody would listen or do anything while it was still in the hall, or even when it started pouring into my apartment. I'm relatively poor, and I was forced to take care of everything on my own. And now I'm losing my mind.

I used to be suicidal, for decades. I beat it, but the result is that I don't have that dream to give me hope anymore. So when I get really pushed, I shutdown, I go into fugues and lose time, hours sometimes. And that's started again. It's dangerous to drive like that. My cat is worried about me. I haven't worked for a few years, because many people in public have started routinely bullying to get their way, and I'm unable to stand up for myself without dire emotional consequences. Over Covid I started making money with online writing, and eventually quit my job to escape people, for my peace of mind. But ChatGPT ate my lunch and there's no competing with the speed of AI. All my writing accounts are gone, except one, and they only asked for one piece in the last few months. I am running out of money and need get get back into a job, but the fear and anxiety are very real, and the daily anger and outrage of dealing with other people.

All I want to do is to stand up for myself, but that doesn't work for me. It's like some vast, magical conspiracy, because no matter how much empathy or logic I use, once I'm emotionally hurt, no amount of talking for myself or advocacy on someone else's part will go well for me. Not ever. It makes zero sense, but most torture survivors know how it goes, which is why most don't survive long. I'm really struggling today, trying not to be stupid. There's literally nothing I can do, except let it eat at me or make things unbearably worse. And my patience is gone. I'm fading in and out. I'm shaking my head, ""No,"" almost unconsciously, nearly like a palsey.

Exercise pumps up the anger, makes it worse. Pot, Xanax, sedatives, only make the fugues longer. Alcohol makes me stupid and want to get violent. Psychedelics haven't been useful for decades and only throw off my neurotransmitters now, the same as the SSRIs and norepinephrine stablizers, make my depression almost unstoppable. I am never welcome in church congregations or support groups. There is literally no place to go or people to talk to. Reading great masterworks sometimes helps, if I can get lost in the book, but it's only a respite. And when I'm really lost in anger, like now, I can't focus on reading. I've spent several hours just writing this, as I keep fading out.

There are probably no other people here who have broken with consensus reality and lived to tell about it, and acclimated to all but society afterwards. Likely not a single person in all of Reddit, statistically speaking, probably not in all of the internet, as there are only around 2500 people incapable of self-deception in a planet of 8.25B people, and most of them don't live long. Certainly nobody who has had those challenges since before puberty.

But I have to try. I'm trying as hard as I can. I really need empathy and support right now, but I have spent my life trying (and failing) to accept that there will never be anything like that for me. There has to be hope in reaching out. There has to be hope somewhere. I can't cope. I'm losing my mind.

I keep thinking about all the liars and assholes in the world and how I might me happy if they were gone. But that's actually everyone. It feels perfectly normal to me that I don't lie to myself, because we are all meant to believe that. It's just not actually true for anybody else, and I can barely grasp that. It just doesn't seem possible, even after so many decades. I just can't believe that people are not capable of learning better. Full stop. People cannot ever understand me nor show me empathy. My effort here is like troll bait, because nothing anyone says will do anything but make it worse. But I don't know what else to do."
378,3,"I’m curious if anyone else here has someone in their life who just knows how to push every single one of your buttons? Whether it’s a friend, family member, or coworker—there’s always that person who, no matter what you do, seems to drain you emotionally or trigger a deep frustration. I’m not talking about the occasional disagreement but rather someone who *consistently* seems to make you feel on edge or angry.

How do you deal with them? Do you have any coping strategies to protect your peace, or do you just distance yourself?

I’m hoping to get some insight, because it’s exhausting dealing with someone who brings out the worst in me."
379,3,"I find myself in this predicament yet again. For as long as I can remember I’ve been fed this idea that I should strive for the military by my dad. “Send me a selfie when you kill your first immigrant with a 50 cal” when I was thinking about biochemistry in the navy. When it came to the choices I really thought about it would always come to medicine or science. Not ‘acceptable’ murder following ethical code. I’d even get taught to act like a maniac back home and to never take accountability for it. “If a dog ever comes for ours, here’s how to kill it…”, giving me a knife at 13 for “hunting” which we must’ve done twice. My dad was in the paras for 3 years and claims to have went to the SAS but there’s a few inconsistencies I found with that. I’m gonna sound awful here too, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t play a role. I certainly haven’t acted on his advice but I hardly dismissed it. It felt like an extreme response to set an example. 

Recently we were at a pub and this guy came to the table that was pestering me non stop about going out for a cig with him. Creepy creepy guy. Caved after the 20th time roughly even after telling him I don’t smoke he wouldn’t stop. Tries to lure me into this corner with “come and look at this weird cat” wasn’t falling for that shit went back in. Told my dad afterwards and he was joking about it quite a bit. This motherfucker comes back in and tells me about how his husband said he raped him but that was a lot of shit. At a loss for words to be honest don’t say anything to him. Everytime I go to the bathroom I’m clutching this knife ready to at least leave this fucking dirt bag in a hospital bed for the rest of his miserable life. Because I know for a fact that the police wouldn’t believe me at all, even if my asshole was torn to shreds by this fucking over glorified cum stain. Luckily he never came through. I should’ve avoided it all together. That should’ve been the first step. Leave. Fucking run if I have to. Don’t throw my life away. But how could I really understand what I have to throw away if my whole life I’ve been in fight or flight(mostly flight)? I’ve been robbed of everything that should’ve been pure to me and am left with this relentless hunger to kill something or myself. Before I even truly knew what it would mean.

I told my dad I’ll need a break from him and about how fucked up all of this was. Got disowned for a few months and he’s Told everyone he knows how much of a junkie fuck up I am. I smoked weed from 13-21(how old I am now, I quit a few months back after my friends got locked up never looking back) and did quite a large number of other drugs too. What can I say, I’m tired of being on this over-glorified floating grain of shit with these talking heads so I got fucked up to get away from that. Also a good bit of my aunts side of the family won’t talk to me at all. Quite a bit of the neighbourhood thinks I’m a scumbag because I did drugs, well they can go fuck themselves with a toilet brush.

I’m affraid this is me now. I’ve kept it all in yeah, I have an ok job, I can put on a pretty good front for people, although mask off a lot more recently; I’m at uni doing psychology because I have this crazy dream that people should be treated like people and not dogs chasing a bone. You want to be pretty, feel good, have a nice house, have a nice partner, build this life we structured for you, but whatever you do, don’t question it. Because that’s when you realise no one’s there for you really and it’s all for an agenda. To an extent. My family loves me but I can’t really receive that all the time. Usually when they worry about how I’m feeling I get angry with them and tell them not to worry or deny that I’m feeling like that because what the actual fuck can they do? Rewrite my life? I’ve sought help about this, I called the GP 100 times on average (not an exaggeration. Really) to get help. Medications with a 5 page list of potential side effects. A counsellor for £60 an hour. He tells me to care less but that’s talk of a conquered man. I should care. When I don’t care about people, I constantly think about harming them. I can’t put into words my general hatred for people. It’s totally warped me. I’m no longer a scared little kid with a troubled family situation. I’m a man full of rage just waiting for a reason. Sometimes I feel like I have to kill myself before I take the life of someone who doesn’t deserve it, but that’s easier said than done. Welp rant over. Gonna sleep now."
380,3,"Today I saw this video of these two girls laughing really loudly in public over a ringtone and I opened the comments and almost people were like “this isn’t funny” whatever. So I decided to just leave that gif from A Bugs Life where all the ants are staring awkwardly. I figured that was pretty harmless and funny, and it got a few thousand likes with a few replies saying “you must be fun at parties” and “you lack joy” which is whatever. I even got one calling me a c*nt lol. But then I got a comment from a girl telling me “I hope your fiancé leaves you”. Which felt like being punched in the gut. My fiancé is everything to me and brought joy back to my life after being homeless, being stalked by a guy for a long time, and getting PTSD. I didn’t care about the other comments because it’s like 4-5 rude comments. But that ONE comment made me so angry that I couldn’t even think straight. I’m just sitting on my bed, eating nilla wafers, trying to calm tf down. Genuinely, who says something that disgusting and vile and cruel over a joke, and a very tame joke at that. You want to call me? Fine. You want to swear at me? Go ahead. But her insulting my relationship just made me so angry. How do I get rid of this anger?! It’s been over an hour and I’m still angry."
381,3,"Just looking for peoples opinions- 
If a person is generally very passive and calm but when they feel mistreated or blamed even though innocent and they react in destructive anger like break things (never harm a person) but lash out at inanimate objects belonging to the person so not damaging anyone else’s stuff.
How can we understand this behaviour? Is it normal?"
382,3,"I am asking not for a frien or family... but for myself.

There are times where I lose my control when provoke (such as fighting my sister for B&E... long story) and these can be reasonable. I mean everyone get angry when provoke to their edge. But there are times when I just act like a terrible person. I mean I once said to my parents at the zoo they are terrible parents... and I wasn't a kid when I did that! I don't know why I said that and I know I wasn't angry despite telling my parents that I was feeling aggressive... it was just me being a terrible person.

Honestly, I hate myself to the point I love hating on myself. And everytime I want to fix myself, I always fall back to where I was. I remember crying after every time I break out in rage as a child that I rarely cried outside of my anger. I know I am not mentally stable... but I don't have insurance to get the help I needed.

So where do you draw the line between a  good person with anger issue... or a terrible person who use rage as an excuse."
383,3,"I don’t t really know what to say. I’m just going to put this out there and I don’t really like sharing personal things to strangers but here I go. I have anger problems. Where it be games or any other minor inconvenience like school homework, I just get so insanely mad. I’m tired of it but I don’t know what to do. I try changing to a growth mindset by I don’t think it worked. I just fell right back into anger. I think part of this is having high expectations to change fast for the sake of the people around me who I might annoy with my constant anger which in turn leads me to be angry at myself resulting in more lashing out. I’m honestly not sure what to do. For the record, I do have autism which from what I understand can make it hard to regulate any emotion. Writing this all out has definitely helped me think more about it and cleared my head a little bit. But please, if anyone has any ideas or encouragement, I could really use it. I just don’t want to be angry anymore. It’s only hindering me now."
384,3,"My parents have really lost it mentally. I don't think they've ever really had it together emotionally... now that I'm almost 35, it's really clear. And I'm really angry. And I in the last few months have felt a new upheaval of anger at my dad for how much he is escaping reality by indulging in conspiracy theories ... to the point where i'm worried it's putting our financial stability at risk. Like he straight up doesn't believe covid was real, at all. But he ISN'T evil. He isn't stupid. He actually tries to have reasonable discussions with me about our opposing politics (and his aren't racist or sexist even...) ... but his beliefs are just so off the wall. I don't understand how he's gotten so sucked into this bullshit. It's so horrifying. I really, really really exploded at him a few months ago after he like shared with me enthusiastically about how the New York Times is state-run media, parroting some bullshit musk retweeted. I read the Newsweek fact-check out loud and by the end I was screaming at him over rhe phone. I need to make it up to him and just let my anger over this stupid crap go. I love him. He's old. I don't know how much longer I'll have with him. "
385,3,"I have a pretty important presentation tomorrow, because i have brain fog i cant really formulate sentences very well while practicing in my room. I got really frustrated after the 5th try of not being able to even say the first sentence right. I stopped practicing, and started crying and started doing something else to cope. Then i went downstairs and i acted moody because i wanted just want reassurance, it was childish of me because the response was expected but not what i wanted to hear. My mom got mad at me for acting like that and we had a big fight. I ended up storming unstairs again.

I turned around and looked back at the stairs and suddenly really wanted to just freefall from there. Probably because i wanted them to care about me, i just wanted support and reassurance i needed right then and there. I was so angry i'd risk doing that for some attention and im still shocked about it."
386,3,"Does anyone else feel like their anger is a monster inside them? I know where my anger comes from, being abandoned as a baby by my mother. 

But all my life I feel like there's a monster inside that ruins everything. If there was one thing I could change about me, I'd rip the anger out of me. But I can't. Instead I have to live hating the very essence of who I am. 

Sometimes I feel like killing myself is the only way to silence this monster, to finally feel like me. 

I'm sick of hurting people. I'm sick of hurting myself. And I feel like no one will help. My GP just put me on antidepressants. I went for private therapy but it just made things worse because they didn't really understand my problem. They just made me feel like an awful person for being like this. 

Does anyone have any solutions? I don't really want to die; but I don't want to live like this anymore. "
387,3,"Hi, 

Lately, I’ve noticed that I get extremely frustrated and have the urge to scream whenever I hear people fighting—whether it’s my parents or my sisters. I just don’t want to hear it. I enjoy the quiet, and then they ruin it by arguing over something as small as buying the wrong bread.

I’ve also realized that when my boyfriend makes me angry and starts a fight (for nothing), I completely lose control. I turn into a madwoman. The last time he refused to say sorry, I grabbed every gift he ever gave me and threw them on the ground. I cut through all the stuffed animals he gave me, tore up the cards, and even destroyed a little memory book he made for my birthday.

Maybe I break things because I can’t scream at him. But when I’m in that state, I feel so heartless—I don’t think about the consequences at all. I just turn into a different person, and I don’t know what to do about it.
"
388,3,"I'm new so hope I won't break any rules. NOT A RANT just geniuenly asking for opinions. So my bf always shows his negative emotions in anger. I feel like he is HIGHLY disrespecting me in public and it gets even scarier when he throws things or break stuff. Like the other day he got mad at himself for doing poorly in a test and he threw his pencil, ik it aint that biga deal but we were in class so it was weird? Then he tore some papers apart, again in class, and scrunched some more. I try to be there for him, but he straight up ignores me. Do angry ppl need space in these situations? I felt like so, so I left him alone but then he got mad at me for \`abondaning him when he needs me\`. But when I AM there for him he doesn't talk to me, walks right pass me or when we are walking together he gets ahead of me and walks really fast. Am I just supposed to follow him, is that the right approach? And like once he got so angry for the phone lagging he threw it so hard to the ground it broke he had to go get it fixed. he disrespects me and is rude to me when he is mad. Is this normal for an angry person to be rude to the ppl they love? its been a year he said hes working on it but nothing has really changed. am i cooked?"
389,3,"I haven’t the clue why it feels like this but at times when shit just isn’t going well and everything is pressuring me it feels like even the slightest inconvenience pisses me off, like someone hooked my body up to a fucking live wire and I’m stuck dealing with it in my fucking head like a mentally ill fucking psycho, and all I wanna do is fucking hurt something or someone, I just wanna fucking stomp their fucking real or imaginary face in until I can use the fucking tongue like a towel to strangle them, sometimes if feels like my brain can’t even fucking think coherently and I just wanna be violent on something"

I am 27 years old and throw tantrums like a 2 year old because I feel constant, extreme anxiety and panic till I explode. It’s incredibly embarrassing, degrading and humiliating having police and social workers constantly being called on me and having crisis hotlines hear me scream bloody murder endlessly. Everyone is sick of dealing with me. The outbursts have been happening for the past twelve years but the rage/anxiety has been with me my whole life.

393,3,"Hi all,

I (42F) recently had my ovaries removed and also changed my anti depressant. 

2 weeks on and I’m experiencing white hot rage. I go from happy to psycho in a split second and it’s generally triggered by my children being children and being brats. lol. 
Generally good kids but they are just so full on (2 boys 7&4) and both ADHD. 

For some reason I could almost kinda hold my sh*t together before (though i was still barely coping and seeing counsellors to help). But now the timing of this med change and the instant menopause have thrown me into definitely NOT able to hold my anger in. 

Results in screaming and at times giving a smack on bottom which not proud of and do not want to do this. 

I do find my overall suicidal tendencies are better so I want to stay on this new med and just learn to manage my anger. 

So far I’m giving myself Me time.
I’m getting sleep
I’m exercising
I try to meditate. 

What are your go tos as a parent for anger management?

394,3,"I don't usually put myself out there like this but things are getting very serious.... I grew up in an extremely abusive household... violence was an every day occurrence...I'm somewhat of an introvert but every now and then... I feel happy and express that feeling.... I had got into trouble about 20 years ago for being in a domestic violence situation... I was definitely the aggressor....I was blacked out drunk.. I only say that because it's the facts... I'm not saying it to excuse my actions... so many things happened after that situation.. way too much to type.. but now I'm in a relationship with another woman.. I just turned 39 and she will be 43 this year... we love each other soooo much and for the most part.. things are good..lately I've bn having this heavy feeling of hate and anger..not necessarily towards her..Just in life in general... last night things got bad.. the worst it's ever bn... I can't even begin to express myself on this... I never want to be the reason for the tears.. I'm the one that should be wiping them away! Honestly I just feel this hate inside of me .. not towards her.. Just this anger that I can do nothing about! I'm hurting wat we have and I just need to know that things can get better....I have faith in it.. but is that right or wrong?... again, this is about me and my actions...doesn't matter what she has said or done because I need to be in control of me!... I'm willing to go more in-depth if someone wants to reach out"
395,3,I have bn diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder and schizophrenia..I also suffer from depression and anxiety..

I'm not perfect and I have a lot of issues due to my upbringing...but I'm not making any excuses...I've gotten physical and I hate myself for it.... wat do I do? If this Makes sense to you and you want to talk.. please let me know.. I don't want to put everything in front street 
396,3,"Recently I've heard that a girl I had a crush on for most of my life has been cheated on and mentally abused ,thankfully she got out of that relationship  and is moving back with her parents. I am happy for her and sad that her relationship ended up in such regard I wish nothing but happiness for her. 

I want to harm the boy that treated her poorly, and I don't mean like a light beat up, I want him to fear coming close to her ever again, I can't stop day dreaming about pulling him to a curb and threatening him with him swallowing his teeth. 

I do not like harming anyone, the guilt and the feeling of the anger burning away after harming someone feels awful ,makes me sick. But when it comes to thinking about hurting the guy I feel a tingling sense of pleasure and satisfaction. I need to know if this is normal or if I am showing signs of a Psychotic break "
397,3,"I am so intensely angry about being given such a dogshit life. It feels so gravely unjust that I have to endure nothing but misery and frustration while everyone around me gets to have joy and happiness in their life. When I feel like I am reaching a breaking point I watch livegore videos to calm myself down. I'll watch a mom see her child get crushed by truck and think, well at least my life isn't as bad as that. They always react in the same way, stomping their feet, dropping to the ground and waving their arms and legs about like a child having a tantrum. Seeing this is the only thing that pulls me back from the brink. Even then, sometimes I think their suffering does not exceed mine. I am not sure other people have the capacity to feel the degree of despair that I do. I feel like I show a level of restraint that is unprecedented in all of human history given how I feel and how little I have acted on it. I think I have been caused brain damage by the anger I feel and how long I have felt it. I wake up with headaches every day. Life is daring me to break."
398,3,"I get so mad sometimes and can’t keep my opinions to myself/show people respect when they (mainly) do stupid shit or test my patience. sometimes someone driving or walking too slow makes me lose it. at the same time, i can take a lot from people who are actually losing their shit too because i get it and id rather someone punch me in the face than display pure ignorance or make me repeat myself or waste my time. i am so rude to strangers sometimes too. i can really be a bitch and i don’t care what people think of me (i do love my family though but i don’t let anyone outside of them in my life really anymore). i know i have a lot of trauma but i haven’t made much progress in therapy and ive been in therapy for a while. i want to figure out why im lashing out and direct my attention towards my own growth rather than everyone else’s imperfections. but i just keep getting more jaded and pissed off. 
what makes you angry and do you know why it makes you angry? how do you approach dealing with it? "
399,3,"Everyday I get pissed at someone, either in the present or from a long time ago, and I think to myself, ""Be reasonable. They don't mean to make you angry, and even if they do, it's not something worth getting so worked up over. Don't be stupid,"" so I seethe quietly and I don't lash out. 

I have been pulling myself back like this for years and I am fucking sick of it. I'm sick of tolerating my constantly self deprecating friend who would feel worse if I told her to stop, I'm sick of tolerating my friend who will complain about easily fixable things and then not take my advice(shit like ""it's so cold!"" ""put on more clothes"" ""nah i can deal with it""), I'm sick of tolerating my friend who doesn't mean to be a smartass but is anyway and it pisses me off each time. I'm sick of being nice and considerate and open and understanding to every fucking person no matter how much they piss me off because there could always be something deeper to their behavior. 

I recognize how much these things piss me off so I try not to be like that to my friends but that just makes me even more upset. It's fucking infuriating. Fuck if I destroy my relationships. To hell with right and wrong. I want to lash out and I want it to feel fucking amazing"

401,3,"I literally cannot control my anger anymore. Im a mom to an 18 month old son, and I realize this is a hard age. All he does is run around being a menace, hitting, throwing, screaming, throwing tantrums. I am at the point this week where I dont even want to be his mom. I feel so bad because I try so hard to be a good mom and then I feel guilty when I lose my temper and yell at him.

I just want to scream and destroy things all the time, Im always mad at my husband and yelling at him and losing my temper. Ive had moments where Ive had to step away and scream and throw shit to help. And even then I really dont feel better. Idk why I cant just be normal. My dad was the same way always shouting and as a teenager. I so badly didnt want to be like him but I see myself doing the same thing to my family. I hate it but managing it is impossible.

At this point in my life everything triggers me. Ive been in therapy and on medications for around 10 years now, in and out of therapy. just recently started back up for this exact reason a few months ago. Ive used meditations, breathing exersizes, DBT, CBT. This week has been ecspecially hard since I am changing medications and all I want to do is run away from my family and be alone but being a sahm I have no escape! 

I think I'm autistic for a lot of reasons but mainly because i get so overstimulated and overwhelmed. I have a great need to control my enviornment, quiet, clean, tidy, not a lot of clutter. I'm hyperaware of my body and  specific about touch. Being a mom has become an aggresive form of exposure therapy, that at times I'm entirely unprepared for and an unwilling participant. While Im complaning about being a mom I mostly love it, I just want to be better. I dont want to pass these problems on and I dont want my son to suffer constantly the way I do. 

I guess I'm mainly looking for advice on what to try, medications, therapies, literally anything. I just want to feel better. In my youth I dealt with major depression, and now here I am a fucking ball of rage. Honestly I would go back to that if I could. I just feel like I'm on fire, shaking and vibrating.

402,3,"I remember my father keeps on getting mad because I do my work very slow and keeps on yelling at my brother so I took his watch and what I did next was, 

Father: hey why you have my watch?

Father: *looks at me with big angry eyes* 

Mother: it's ok the watch is waterproof

403,3,"I’m not exactly sure if this is the right place to post this

Tonight I was with some coworkers at the waffle house and they were telling me a story about me that I cannot remember. Basically there was a different night about a couple weeks ago. We were at this gas station where we sometimes go after work late at night and play a claw machine. We were going to get changed from behind the counter and the guy there was somewhat flirting with one of the women coworkers and she was also kind of laughing then kind of afterword. She says that she was married and then he said I don’t care that’s when everybody said that I got agitated and told the guy well she already said that she’s married you know I can bodyslam you from across the counter right and he trained his tongue really quickly after that the thing is I pretty much remember everything else from that night, including the part where I saw him jokingly flirting with her, but I do not remember him saying I don’t care and then getting agitated and saying the stuff people told me I said in that moment and I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of panicked by it nobody said that I acted out in any bad way though I was talking to her tonight and she actually said that she was thankful for what I said, and I was just protecting her. I’m not really concerned about my behavior more of the fact that I honestly cannot remember any of that. I feel like the parts of it are coming back to me, though it could just be placebo effect. All I remember from that was she saying that she was married and the clerk just left that
And it does sound like something I would say if something like that happened.

Is this something that’s normal?

Edit: again I’m not exactly sure if this is the right place to post this if this is not, please direct me to a place where I can ask this question"

I was one of the guys in the front row that was there when you gave us a speech about how great the draft is, and how we should be grateful to have our lives put on hold. I'm so fucking grateful. Grateful for the loss of my job and relationship and the suicidal thoughts it gave me.

Grateful to see your smug, self congratulatory grin up there while I had to salute you. I'd salute a pig over you. Gladly. And through your entire speech, my parents were there. You told them they should be proud.

I want to say something, Nikos: I hate you. Let me say it again: **I hate you.** I. Hate. You. Really. You're out of touch and people like you are the reason the suicide rate here is up, and why half a million of us have moved to Germany. You are ugly. You are disgusting. You're repulsive.

409,3,"I've never been to an AA meeting myself but I guess they have daily reflections in their book. I stumbled upon the reflection for Match 20th today and I thought it was appropriate for anyone trying to work at an anger habit:

""ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

I have found that I have to forgive others in all situations to maintain any real spiritual progress. The vital importance of forgiving may not be obvious to me at first sight, but my studies tell me that every great spiritual teacher has insisted strongly upon it.

I must forgive injuries, not just in words, or as a matter of form, but in my heart. I do this not for the other persons’ sake, but for my own sake. Resentment, anger, or a desire to see someone punished, are things that rot my soul. Such things fasten my troubles to me with chains. They tie me to other problems that have nothing to do with my original problem.""

I agree 100% with the part that says we forgive for ourselves and not the other person. Hope this helps bring people calm and clarity."

412,3,"I have never been violent when angry, but I get into states where I just break down and yell a lot. It happened a lot more when I was younger, especially in my teenage years. I grew up in a family that was high conflict, lots of verbal arguments and screaming matches between my parents and other family members.

I was diagnosed with PTSD after surviving a natural disaster as a teen too. The PTSD symptoms can lead to anger outbursts. Usually though my anger is more directed at myself then anything else.

Since covid started, I have struggled more and more with anger. Every year since has been challenging in a different way. The lockdown periods were most intense, but I mainly internalized my anger and turned into an alcoholic. I quit after lockdowns here ended for a year, but then got into drinking socially again. For the last few years I've been working as a cook, and often my schedule has been very demanding. Work sort of became an escape, but I had a few moments where my job would overwhelm me. Luckily each employer I've had has been really understanding, mainly because I usually am just mad about the situation and threaten to quit lol, but I still feel quite bad for not handling things better. A lot of the jobs I have done have also been pretty dysfunctional though and not the best working conditions.

I recently was hospitalized with a ruptured kidney, because of a congenital issue, where my ureter is narrow. Since then I've quit work, and been focusing on my health more. During this time I have struggled a bit with anger and feeling helpless. Without any booze to numb my feelings it has been more intense and the last week it has been really hard to deal with, where I feel physically sick and shaking during the day with anxiety. My temper has been short over minor things, and I had a meltdown the other day when i missed a bus, and had a literal tantrum about it.

I feel stupid, but I have been spending more time actually looking at why I act this way. When i feel helpless or that life is out of my control, anger tends to build up. Then I end up dwelling on past trauma and over analyzing things in my life, thinking how things could've gone and then getting angry about my choices. I realized I haven't given myself enough space to process my emotions, and that I have been afraid of them. Rather then feeling anything I try to stuff it down, which makes the anger worse.

I've reached out to counselors recently, and I've started to open up a bit more about the things over the last few years that pissed me off. Mainly that the pandemic really screwed with my life trajectory. When that started I had just spent a long time working through a lot of issues, and was getting my life together. The whole pandemic I basically was bitter about that. Even though I was lucky in many ways, I was financially well off, I sank into deep depression.

All this anger does though is dig me deeper into this situation. It's bad for my health as well. And I hate subjecting people to my outbursts... it makes me blind to the good things that can happen in my life, and it pushes away the people who can help me.

I'm taking off time after my next surgery to go back to studying, and giving myself more time to actually get in touch with my emotions. Part of my anger is always trying to do everything perfectly, and always aspiring to get ahead, but the reality is that there is more to life then that. "

414,3,"I’ve always struggled with emotional regulation, but my anger and rage and self destructive tendencies have taken a sharp uptick lately and I’m afraid it’s putting me on a very dangerous course.

My home situation is not great, to put it lightly.
My basically lives with another man now and our “marriage” has decayed to the point of a few visits here and there. We own a business together and then work consumes everything.

I am constantly isolated and alone and have been experiencing increasingly dangerous explosions of rage. I feel myself gravitating closer and closer to the edge of the cliff and I’m starting to worry that I don’t have a life ahead of me. I’m genuinely worried that someday possibly soon, I’m going to have an episode so explosive and self destructive that I won’t survive it.

I’m genuinely afraid. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be a burden on my family. I don’t know who to talk to. And even if I do talk to people, what is it going to accomplish for me? I love her so much and I can’t imagine living without her but I feel more and more like she’s already gone. I don’t know if I can take this anymore."

For example, this morning, I opened the fridge and saw that my oldest daughter (20) had left a glass bottle teetering on a shelf. It fell, shattered, and even though it wasn’t a huge deal, I completely lost it—yelling and fuming. Now, hours later, I’m still angry, and I hate feeling this way.

i wanted to start off by saying i’ve had an extremely shitty life. i had an absent father but he was physically present. he was very emotionally abusive. my mom is a narcissist and extreme manipulater as well. needless to say when anything happens i get REALLY angry. 

Well recently (yesterday) i went to sell my phone on marketplace and the dude stole it and ran and now im out all that money. I’m sooo angry and all i can think about is if i had a gun i could have shot him in the back and got my phone back. i could go back and do whatever i want to the building i know he’s in. 

What am i supposed to do about this anger? i’m not going to a therapist because in my eyes their a waste of money and space on this earth and the past times i’ve gone it hasn’t done anything except make me more angry and want to kill the therapist. 

i refuse to go to doctors as well bc i’ve had horrible experiences with them as well. why am i paying them for doing nothing??

i don’t have any boxing equipment because im still at my parents house and the reason i was selling my phone (and a ton of other things) is to to get the hell out of my shit parents house. i have no other family except the parents… i don’t know what to do. "

The first pencil he threw I ignored, the second I ignored, the third I went over to him and grabbed him, I didn’t know what I was doing, I didn’t know if I wanted to punch him, shove him, or pull him. I was just so angry and I wanted to output it into the physical world. The day before I heard my step family joke about how my mother might end up on the streets, when I went to my main house I was slightly angry and annoyed. Later when I was going to bed I stayed up chatting with an AI, (yes I know it’s weak and embarrassing) I had stayed up late and I just regretted installing the app in the first place, when I woke up (today) I was feeling alright, I wasn’t feeling great but I was okay. When third period art class rolls around I began to work on my art project. I was doing okay and going strong, but once her threw the third pencil I went “from 0 to 60” as the principal said.

420,3,"If on something like social media, if the topic of suicide comes up, and people will say stuff ""it gets better"" or ""life is a gift"" to discourage people from being suicidal; this makes me so angry for some reason.  Like, Ill go along with it, it makes sense, I dont want to encourage someone killing themself.  But inside I just want to punch people saying shit like this in the face and strangle them.  What the fuck is wrong with me?  I never ever EVER say stuff like this outloud, but my internal reaction to people grieving someone who ended their life is ""OH FUCK YOOOUUU"" 

Am I some kind of psychopath?  I guess I feel like people that dont understand how godawful existence is for some people get to dictate and be the authority on what they can and cant do?  I really hate this about myself, I feel like a monster that wants to spread misery and suffering."
421,3,"Monetarily, that is. For me the big things I can think of are all of the apartment security deposits I've never gotten because the rental special doors being made of paper. Another big one is when I accidentally smashed the glass of a liquor store door storming out, I guess I kicked it with my foot before I pushed it with hand. All together those 3 or 4 things were over 4 grand down the toilet, probably close to 5 I don't even remember what I paid for that fucking door. I feel like I don't even get into a destroying mood often with my anger but it clearly has happened enough.

And that's just the numbers I can think of for physical property damage. God knows how many times I was so worked up I couldn't even will myself to make dinner so I got Uber eats. Or plenty of other times hitting retail therapy online after the fact. Being angry is horrible for the finances.

I guess I should just count myself lucky I haven't gotten into legal trouble over anything yet."
422,3,"My mind is gone, all sense of logical is gone and I'm stuck in this body with anger and impulses just banging on the door. I have anger issues like my dad, I don't normally punch things, but I feel rage and I scream and shout and cry nonstop. My sister, mom and friend told me my anger issues is the worst part about me. Everyone says to control it, but I can't, I want to though. It's horrible when im angry, I'm deteriorating every single relationship and I don't want to, I just want to calm myself down and don't act irrational. "
423,3,"Random question, does anyone else when they feel any negative emotion/feeling does it translate straight to anger. Be it inwards or just a common need to throat punch to closest numpty?

Been this way for well over a decade now, and I can self manage to the best of my ability but just wanted a reach out into the void."
424,3,I suffer from depression as diagnosed by the doctor for PTSD childhood trauma.i wasnt sexually abused or nothing but my father who later turns out wasnt my real dad was hands on used get slap hit punched for anything to a point where it was just being there was the reason. Long story story short iv bin on all kinds of medications for it nothing seems to work I'm always angry especially to the people who mean the world to me 3 children a wife who's finaly given up with my shit. Any1 else think maybe I have anger issues not depression soall this medication could well not be doing me any good. Just looking for outside perspective. Excuse my literature I'm pretty slow when it comes to writing things down lol. Tia 
425,3,So for the last year anytime ive had to do math for homework or to study. I get so fucking angry and have a mental breakdown. I need a way to cope through this and not get angry.
426,3,"I feel angry when I'm unseen and disrespected. I'm angry when disingenuous people become successful. I'm angry that my efforts are unseen. I'm angry that I can't ever make anyone happy and that they will always feel unsatisfied one way or another. I'm angry that no matter how much I love and care for a person, if one or two things don't go as planned, they will turn against me. I'm angry that I have to be nice and acceptable instead of communicating my genuine thoughts and emotions in order to keep people on my side. I'm angry that no one I meet understands me. I'm angry that my life is dull when my mind is energetic. I'm angry that most things turn out worse than planned. Now, replace angry with sad. That's how I feel. I use anger as a coping mechanism for my sadness."
427,3,"I've been angry my whole life; I've struggled with my anger since I was a child. Often times my anger caused me to violently lash out on those undeserving of it. I used to think it was cool when I was younger beating up people who made me angry, but now that I'm older I'm finding it hard to control my anger which I really need to do because I'm in a position where I cant afford to have an outlash like I did when I was a kid. Which is hard because I can't control myself as hard as I try I lack self control and it's Infuriating I really need help holding myself accountable "
428,3,"I get angry ridiculously easy. My stress turns into anger, my anxiety turns into anger physical pain turns into anger etc etc. I dont like being angry, which often makes me more upset when I realize I am. I build up anger at things that dont matter and lash out when its not deserved and then I have this post anger clarity where I realize im just an asshole and im going to eventually ruin all my relationships. I dont know how to handle this. Ive looked for help before but everything is just “recognize triggers” “acknowledge your problems and know when youre angry” but im already so aware of all of it and it doesnt help. it just causes me to do this stupid spiral post anger where i get upset and angry and tell myself things that just arent true. 

i want to be better. i dont wanna be angry anymore i want help i want to be a good friend "
429,3,So when I am angry or upset I just want to break something. That thing is usually the closest thing near me or the thing making me angry. So I found this journal I've never written in so I am now gonna write in it when I'm angry. But not just write a little note in it. I am gonna write down why I am angry and then take my anger out on the page. I just stabbed the heck out of a page and I crinkled it and ripped some parts of it. It helps a lot I would recommend doing something like this instead of breaking valuable items like I did. Have a good day 💗
430,3,"Being angry destroyed my life. I'm still not sure I won't end up in jail. And I won't make it. I have had a terrible temper from childhood and it would cause me to lash out physically then.

Well I've done the same as an adult and after years of hostility and aggression - I am almost completely alone. This loneliness hurts so much and it was caused by two things anger and arrogance. I don't know why I was born and then led this way. 

But anger consumes me and it will destroy me. I have lost all desire to keep on living."
431,3,"Honestly, I just don't understand why they don't have a setting to choose quiet introverted roommates in college. Like, what the heck. I am stuck with these hella annoying ass people that always bring their friends over and I absolutely hate it so friggen much. About two days ago, they were over until two am , which is absolutely ridiculous. They were being so loud and screaming the whole time. I had already fell asleep and was woken up twice. I couldn't even go back to sleep after and had an eight am lab the next day, so I was absolutely angry and still am. I just hate them so much. So rude and inconsiderate. And now everytime I come home, I am just mad mad as hell and I just want to yell at everyone up in this building cos wot the hale wot the hale. ughhh. Also, they take up all the space in the whole friggen place. Like they take all the drawers and cabinets. The least they can do is be quiet at night what the hale wot the hale. "
432,3,"I currently have a really lousy boss. Who doesn't?

The issue I have is that they often make unfair remarks about my job performance, and I've gotten to the point where I cannot bite my tongue anymore.

What do you do to keep a lid on it when it gets really bad? I'm open to ideas."
433,3,I genuinely think something is wrong with me every little thing pisses me off to the point where I’m breaking my belongings I can’t take it anymore it’s always an uncontrolled rage like I literally cannot take it anymore doesn’t matter how minor it is if something in the slightest goes wrong I just get soo irritated like so stressed to the point where I feel like I will kill myself 
434,3,"I have been struggling with me mental health for a long time. I thought my anger issues were as good as gone. However I just woke up from a bad dream.

I was on a vacation with my parents and their dog. Suddenly my mom asks where the dog is. She was gone. I instantly panicked and screamed her name, hurting my throat. I spotted her with a couple just walking away and I got so angry I ran and basically assaulted them both while screaming. 

If this dream represents the anger I feel in my waking life. Then I don't even know where it's coming from. I'm terrified and dissapointed. I dont want this rage anymore. "
435,3,"There's this on guy, we'll call him Cayden (14 m) who has beaten my woman (15 f)  ALOT. I (14 m) have a plan to deal with him today, and a basic rundown is that she'll have him follow her home with ""fun"" as bait. I'll be about 10 yards behind tailing them with a rope and a mask. By the time they get near a secluded area, she'll tell him she doesn't wanna wait, and drag him there. That's when I beat him into submission and hogtie him, before tossing him somewhere he'd have to yell for help to get out of. Even if he doesn't accept, I know his home address, his full name, and both of his parents occupations. He's a skinny, ginger, pale kid who thinks he's from the hood, but isn't. He told a bunch of his friends that he beat my ass, when he's hidden his face from me in fear. Any bright ideas on other ways I can make him cry? (I'm posting them on tiktok btw)"
436,3,"I wanted to share my recent experience with TLauncher to hopefully help others avoid the same issues. About seven months ago, I tried to log in to TLauncher using my Microsoft account without knowing that I needed Minecraft purchased, and that it would absolutely mess up everything. Three days later, I lost access to my Microsoft email account and have been unable to recover it since. I've been trying for SEVEN GRUELING MONTHS, but I haven’t been able to. I know I shouldn't have done that, and I feel absolutely stupid, but why did I coincidentally get warnings from Microsoft and lose access to the account five days later? Please, don't use your Microsoft account for TLauncher. I swear, TLauncher, you guys have ruined my life by this. I've lost access to some of the most important stuff to me."
437,3,"I struggle to feel any negative emotion other than anger. I feel like my brain shuts off any sadness, pain, anxiety, sometimes even physical emotions like physical pain, hunger, exhaustion, and instead I just feel anger. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a term for this or a way to cope? I don’t mind not feeling sad and all that, but I struggle to have regular reactions to other people’s emotions because when they feel sad or anxious in a situation my first reaction is to respond with anger and I have to work really hard to suppress that. It’s not anger at them for having those emotions, I just simply don’t feel them the same way. It’s hard to console someone who’s sad and crying when instead of also feel sad I just feel angry and want to break whatever the thing that is making them cry. It’s not a very productive way to live life.

TLDR; I feel angry instead of sad, hurt, hungry, tired, anxious. and in the real world you can’t just punch the bad guys to make your problems go away."
438,3,I get so angry sometimes I just can't control it. I never hurt my gf physically but this did a mental toll on her. I would get so angry sometimes and I would try and hide it. I would punch things and she would get scared. I don't blame her one bit for getting all her things and leaving but she gave me a timeline for my therapy and other things before she just left even though I'm showing the progress. Just hurts so bad but I will accept and grow
439,3,"He played me and dumped me over text twice, stupid of me to fall for it the first time and take him back but I did. Now I'm so mad im imagining horrible things happening to him and seeking a rage room. None in my area. I just feel like I need to smash shit. Is this rage normal after being used and betrayed? Why can't I just let go? It's been a couple of days now and I just wanna forget he ever existed but the rage comes in waves. "
440,3,"Lead Up: back in January my boss crossed my boundaries. I went to HR to start a paper trail to note how I felt, didn’t ask for action just wanted it to be a report. Previous to this I have had no issues, after 2.5 yrs this popped up. 

The event: My boss changed the tone in the middle of our 1 on 1 and crossed my boundaries again and I didn’t catch myself before I acted out (I wasn’t expecting her to do that) 

Should I have been more proactive the first time it happened? What is a professional way to explain to a higher up that what they said crossed personal boundaries? (What crossed my boundary was not constructive criticism nor was it framed that way)"
441,3,"Can anyone shed any light on what exactly anger management is? I am specifically going because I have very easily triggered anger outbursts. Like *slight inconvenience* —> I scream horrible things to/about whoever is nearest me and go break $h!t. Triggers are always almost things that don’t have long lasting effects. Ex: I drop some clean laundry on the floor, I have to go get gas when I get in my car because I forgot the day prior, I run into a doorframe, etc. Thank you in advance! "
442,3,"It’s my biggest flaw. Perhaps the only time I feel an emotion intensely is when I’m hurt. I don’t feel sadness. Or anything else. I just feel rage. Rage that consumes me, can’t focus on anything else. It’s like tunnel vision. I have ADHD, wonder if that’s correlated at all.

Wondering if anyone has any healthy methods to deal with anger specifically when feeling hurt? 
"
443,3,"Sometimes I get really frustrated when my parents ask too many questions when I'm doing my work like I basically told them angrily ""can you stop asking so many questions when I'm trying to do my work?"" "

446,3,"My dad used to get these anger bursts - was scary as a child: my whole body reacted and shake within and fear invade my body of saying the wrong thing or hearing him talk down on me on or my mom and wanting so bad to defend myself but I knew if I open my mouth I would get more in trouble so just shallow in.

Don’t get me wrong - despite all this that could sound like a bad childhood my dad was still my hero, love him, respect him, secretly wanted to be like him. 

With the years, I have notice I share his traits, sometimes the impotence of being listened to but not really heard produces the same body reaction - not a child anymore - so instead of controlling out of fear, I go full blast and can say hurtful things; even worst since I know what hurts more my spouse I specifically choose those words that can damage the most (kind of like when my dad used to yell at my mom) just so I can “defend myself” - I hate this about me and the more I hate it the bigger it grows; self-awareness turns to self-disappointment and the circle feeds itself. Spouse doesn’t take it so I also get feedback that increases the resentment.

Some days ago, during the beginning of a fight, I got a: “ok, but now say it without your winning voice” and it did teach me some sort of trick to stop me on my tracks I want to share with you: 

when you are about to explode and you feel the winning kid coming out of you wanting to be respected and heard and listened to because you are in all the right to - **swap it** - in your head gather all the strength that you can and think: “I’m not a kid with a tandrum - my spouse is, I’m the adult, kid is not listening to me is not that he doesn’t respect me, in fact I’m loved and THEY are the ones that need to be heard, they need a daddy I could be the kid but now Im choosing to be a daddy” - sounds stupid but so far is working 🤷‍♂️

Do you guys have a similar story? I would like to hear how do you deal with the anger bursts. 

"
447,3,"Hi guys, I dont know if this fits the sub. Lately my hearts starts hurting from anger that people cause me. I always had a anger issue but never was physical and I try to shut up and isolate myself from situations. But the problem I face is that some coworkers are rude and outright disrespectful to me. I try to stay calm and dont say or do something that I might regret. So after calmly exchaning a few questions with these coworkers, something like : ""Are you fine?"",""Do we have some kind of problem?"". I just shut up because I actually would like to scream from the top of my lungs. But I cant because its not the right thing to do and may open more issues than solve them.
So I repress so much anger that my heart started to hurt since last saturday.

What should I do? Can you guys give me advice how to handle my anger better?
Thanks"
448,3,"37 year old guy suppose to be getting ready to start work  but nobody has gotten back at me. In January I thought I was gonna start a job as they sent me the job offer and hiring package after interview and conducted background check but was left hanging.

I did reach out to them once but they said background was still pending. Never heard anything since. I went to interview for my former employer last week but now haven't heard anything from them.

Getting very discouraged. My friend now want text me back. I told her I would buy something from her but I can't even do that. I told her the truth after being ghost an I think she don't wanna talk to me and probably think I'm a broke loser 

I suck I'm a very unlucky person."
449,3,"Not trying to go into details, I’ve never felt this much anger and hatred towards anyone before. Physical harm towards anyone drives me mad, makes me super upset. 
My father has not physically harmed me but has physically intimidated me and has forcefully shoved me (in an outburst of anger) on multiple occasions. He has mentally and emotionally traumatised me beyond belief. I cannot look or hear his voice without wanting to throw up. I have tried so much to communicate with him, but he will never change. 

When I think about him, hear or see him I want to beat him to a pulp, I want to twist a knife deep into his body repeatedly till he’s just alive. I want to punish him for what he has done to me. 

I’ve hated people to the same amount as I have him, but it has never hit this hard. I’m struggling to control myself. I think due to the fact that he is my father, someone who is supposed to love and nurture you, it hits harder. If he thinks I deserve to be treated the way he treats me, then bloody hell let me stab that monster to death already. "
450,3,"Hi, very new to the sub so please delete if not allowed. I am just posting to ask if anyone has had a similar experience to me, and potentially has strategies to calm down. Basically when I get angry, it’s normally because someone “wronged me”, and it may be something very small and that I know is stupid and irrelevant but just can’t let go. 

What really bothers me apart from my brain obsessing over it for a long period, is I don’t feel urge of violence or anything, but really feel like fucking a persons life up? An example is I wasn’t invited to a party, which really doesn’t matter, but I had this really mixed sense of anger and frustration, and I found myself literally plotting how I could ruin this persons life (get them fired, break up their relationship). 

And yes I know how fucked up that is, but I get this response every time I’m angry, and I get in that mood at the flick of a switch. Does anyone else do this, and what are your strategies to deal with it because I really hate it."
451,3,"Anyone been placed on medications for anger? If so, did they help? I've resorted to self-medicating and I'm still ticking in an unhealthy way. My anger gets so intense I often can't sleep and it's destroying my relationships. I get intense quickly and have a hard time getting myself to calm down in a reasonable amount of time. At least 3-5xs a week. Please help. "

I was not allowed pain killers after dental work and was forced to be in pain.

When I was kid I used to go the dentist. I had a few cavities growing not much but a few I had to get filled. 
After I got my cavities filled I was never allowed to have any painkillers Tylenol or ibuprofen up until 18 because my mom told me I had to consider the pain as part of my punishment for getting cavities.
I did remember being in terrible pain to the point of it being traumatic but I decently have some anger and resentment towards that. I didn’t get needed work done 16-23 because my trauma. 
It got so bad I had to get a tooth pulled at 23 and I have had lots of dental work since then. I just don’t get it, why some people are so mean a child. At the time I was age 9-14. 
My first dental appointment at 5 years old was also traumatic. I refused to sit in the chair. It was my first time and I was scared. I got held down and was crying and screaming, I kicked my shoes off hoping they would break the window. Eventually they gave up and my mom didn’t take me back till I was 9. When I was 8 she took me to the dentist with her so I knew what was going on. 
I just don’t get it :( "
453,3,"Every time I’m genuinely trying to be the better person and be silent and not express my angriest thoughts, but often times the people around me just make me bottle it up more until I casually get angry at people I care, become super judgmental and force them to “walk on eggshells” that they decided to stop talking with me. I so badly want to move out, so I can live on my own and not be with certain family member or people who I’m strongly ambivalent towards. Seriously, even when I observe why the people around me get angry, does that mean I have to be the strong one here and not be angry and always be silent and observing? Regardless, I just want medications and get into therapy, but I’m not sure where to go to. What I do know is I want to look forward to moving out and just parting ways. "
454,3,"I have had anger issues since I can remember. Every-time I get angry my father treats it like an emotion people aren’t supposed to have and that I shouldn’t be expressing. This makes me more frustrated whenever he has this reaction. It’s getting to a boiling point as I had to take two gap years now due to medical reasons. I have a plan to leave by this summer, but that’s still months away. The anger leads to sadness and the more intense the anger is, the more I want to end it all afterwards. I’m contemplating if a life angry is even a life worth living. So far it’s not."
455,3,"Guys, I need answers ASAP.

So basically my family all has issues. Like my sister once went to a mental hospital cause she was suicidal and was having homicidal thoughts. She once tried to ""stab"" my other sister because of something. Shes now okay. But i'm Kinda concerned because my mom and dad are not really great parents, we have CPS involved but there's no abuse but more Mental abuse verbally. I'm experiencing  something similar. i have homicidal thoughts or suicidal thoughts whenever i'm mad or sad. i've been experiencing this since i was 10 or 11?. I want to know what kind of mental issue i have. I know its kinda stupid but like i have some social workers who work in CPS who talk to me in school but i want to have a therapist because my parents wont get me one. Since my sisters are all religious i'm somehow different so i'm afraid.And basically i told my sis that i wanted a therapist and she said "" They wont help u, U need god"". I know shes religious but i don't believe in god, I guess for now ig? But its really not helping. I'm a very sensitive person so i cry easily and today i fought with my other sister. She told me to leave her room cause she was pissed of by me. I rolled my eyes at her and went to my room. Once i entered i cried..i was angry then..i got thoughts like ""I'm gonna fucking kill her"" or "" i cant take this i'm gonna KMS"".

So i really need help because i know i have a horrible mind. The way i think is just so monstrous. My mindset is so unhealthy. currently i starve myself and struggle with food. Like binge eating due to stress or days where i just try to starve myself. I get really angry when people correct me or i get angry when i'm just so offended. Like one time my big sister corrected me for leaving my stuff on the floor when she does too.I got super angry and thought : ""what a fucking hypocrite ill kill her"" like honestly this is scaring me. I do actually wish my family was dead..or just me killing myself. I tried attempting to kill myself. But while i write this..i still wish my family dies. But i'm writing this because i want help to? if that makes sense.? like i'm genuinely confused. i don't know if my thoughts are a crime either. I'm Scared to talk about it...so like pls help?

ive had this behavior pattern since i was 8-9 years old. I still find comfort in anger or sadness. like tbh i love the feeling of being this way , but a part of me wants help? It all started when my sister caught me watching porn at a young age. I got angry then that was my first homicidal thought. I don't want to grow up to be a psycho. So ive been experiencing horrible behavior thoughts at a young age..so i need answerss <33 So yeah

I know i'm like this because of my parents and the environment i grew up in my house. It got worse when i told my mom i was going to kill myself in an argument. And to my surprise she laughed about it and called me ridiculous ;/. One time my dad got angry cause i caught him cheating on my  mom. I confronted him and he said ""IM GONNA KILL U"" to me . i got so scared but my mom still is married with him because shes a gold digger ofc lol.

so i got that pattern from my dad i guess

so no wonder i'm acting like a psycho at a young age. I know i don't deserve this im still so young. I need to enjoy my youth and not this. My parents only give me love when its conditional love ;/ They neglect us and they just don't discipline my younger siblings so id say its educational abuse and mental abuse. CPS said it themselves.

Im not worried abt the family rn Since CPS is helping. But i'm worried about me.

PS: i haven't attempted on killing any of my family members i'm just scared if it goes to that point yk? soo im not a murderer chill ;p

plz dont hate me 4 this

D:"
456,3,"This is going to be a long post and I do not know where to start. My family consists of my parents , my sister and I. My dad is a really good father , takes care of us, is involved but there's a big issue. His anger issues often make it impossible to live with him. All the good things about him are shadowed by his anger. He has a habit of shouting at every small thing not to his liking. This morning, I woke up to him screaming at our house help who's been working for 20 years ( who in general he is very nice to , helps fund her daughters education) because her 2 year old son pooped on the floor. He lost his temper and told her "" I will hit you"" among other things. I was upset about it a bit but let it go. He then screamed on me because of some minor reason I.e I could not tell whether a particular toothbrush was his or mine. He then screamed on my mother for some other reason as well. This continued till the day, when he started screaming because the fruit platter was left uncovered. This is when I reached saturation and I told him normally without screaming that this habit of his would Make him along and nobody would live with him. I know I could have phrased it better but I had nothing else to say. All his good behavior is overshadowed by this unpleasant behavior. What should I do? He's obviously very upset with me"
457,3,"A few months ago, I got in a verbal argument with a person who's in my college and he verbally abused my mother. At that moment I controlled myself and didn't make it a physical fight as it would've had bad consequences but to this day I get flashbacks of that moment and get into a really worked up state and usually smoke a lot to try to get it out. It doesn't help that the dude lives in the same building as me and I get intrusive thoughts of going to his room and beating him up. I know that it's pointless now to do anything since I didn't do anything back then in the heat of the moment and I hate myself for not just getting it over with there and then. I'm having a lot of trouble processing this and I can't get over this and I really need some guidance."
458,3,"I feel a deep disappointment in my life right now. It’s like no matter how hard I try, I can’t get things to fall into place. I always thought I’d be further along, doing more, feeling better, but it feels like I’ve hit a wall. I’ve worked hard, but it never seems to be enough. I keep asking myself, “Where did I go wrong?”

There’s also this burning hatred inside me when I think about my father. It’s not even anger anymore—it’s just pure resentment. The man who should’ve been a role model, the one who should’ve been there, never really was. Instead, I’ve spent my whole life trying to figure out who I am while carrying the weight of his absence. It’s hard not to feel betrayed, to wonder what my life would’ve been like if he had shown up for me the way a father should.

And then there was the time I got jumped. It wasn’t just the physical beating; it was the feeling of being powerless, of being in a place where I thought I’d be safe and suddenly, I wasn’t. It messed with my head. I’ve been carrying that sense of vulnerability ever since, always looking over my shoulder, trying to find my ground again.

Love? I don’t know what that is anymore. I used to believe in it, but I don’t think I’ve ever really found it. Maybe I’ve been too afraid to let someone in, or maybe I’ve just never met someone who makes me believe in it the way I used to. I don’t know. I’ve tried, but it feels like something’s always missing. Like there’s this huge gap, and no matter how hard I try, I can’t fill it.

I’ve also been broke for so long, it’s like a part of me doesn’t remember what it feels like not to worry about money. It’s a constant stress, a weight on my shoulders that never lets up. The worst part? I’m unemployed. I don’t know what I’m doing, where I’m going, or how I’m supposed to get back on my feet. It’s hard to keep believing that things will change when I feel stuck in this cycle, unsure of how to break free.

I’m just tired. Tired of feeling like I’m falling short. Tired of trying to prove myself to people who don’t care. But even with all of this, I know I can’t give up. There has to be more than this, right? There’s got to be a way out of this mess. I just have to figure out how."
459,3,"Something happened at my work recenly where I got upset, and any attempts my manager made to help me calm down only felt like they were being condescending at the time.

I feel like whenever I get angry or emotional, I feel like I reach a boiling point and can't just calm down. I've never hit anyone in my anger, but I'm scared that one day I could.

Is this a sign I have repressed anger?"
460,3,"Has anyone had any personal experience dealing with repressed/internalised anger? 

It’s something that I’m struggling with quite badly. I can’t let go of things that happened in the past. I feel so much disproportionate resentment and it’s eating away at me. Like I keep thinking about a bad argument I had with a friend ages ago and even though we made up, I secretly still feel bitter and resentful about it. I know it’s dumb and I feel so embarrassed for being like this. Some of my anger is directed at myself because I feel like I should have stood up for myself more instead of rolling over for them and allowing them to speak to me like they did, but I also feel like I should have moved on and I’m being childish/ridiculous. Even now it still plays on my mind and I feel so much rage building up inside me, then I start getting terrible thoughts I’m ashamed of. There’s other stuff too but this particular thing stands out to me. 

I’m neurodivergent for what it’s worth. I feel like this is relevant here. I don’t know what to do. I just feel so much guilt here but it’s like I can’t help it. I would give anything just to make all this go away and be normal for once. Also, I’m afraid that I’m going to lose control one day and all this is going to come out, then I’ll feel even more shitty about myself. 

I recently started a new course of therapy but I can only afford one session a month; and I’m not sure how it’s going to help me in this regard. "
461,3,"I’ve never posted to Reddit before so here goes. 

For a little background, I currently drive a 2001 Honda civic. It’s a tiny little thing, low mileage, it was great when I first got it. But now as time has gone on I’ve developed a pure hatred for the thing. The lining on the ceiling hangs down so it looks terrible, there’s no radio, only one of the windows rolls down, the passenger door doesn’t latch closed, the exhaust system has to be replaced so it sounds like a lawnmower. The loudness of it alone sends me into a rage, I can’t accelerate quietly, that just doesn’t exist and is not possible with my car. Yes I can get it replaced but it’s over $1000 and with the current economy I can’t do that right now. And I can’t just go out and buy a new car for the same reason. 

The newest addition to the long list of problems is the gas cap door would not open when pushing the lever to disengage it. I tried so many different solutions. Banging on the door to knock it open, unlocking to car doors to have the car register its open, putting the car in and out of park, nothing. 

Mind you, I find this out while I’m at the gas station… so that means I need gas. 

And now I can’t get any gas because the door to get the gas in the car won’t open. I end up driving home and the first thing I do is let the anger get the best of me and I punch the door and I kick it. I then went and grabbed a flat head screwdriver and before I could even logically think of how to open it without breaking the door I just pried it open. 

Immediately broken. 

I threw my screw driver in my bag, sat in my seat and immediately started to cry and regret that I had just broken the gas cap door. Because now do I not only have a broken gas cap but it’s just one of the many broken things on this car now. 

I can honestly say this was the first time I let my anger get the best of me in years. The immediate regret I felt sucked. My hand also really hurts from punching a piece of metal. 

I just needed to speak my anger out, I don’t know if I feel better or less stressed but at least I’m admitting I regret breaking it. "
462,3,"I lost it on a Canadian today. She told me what's going on in my country is my fault. Like doing everything i could, protesting and voting wasn't enough.

She told me the suffering of my friends and family under this regime in my fault and I lost it. I said things i would never say if i was okay. I body shamed her and insulted her art. Idk maybe she never realized what real suffering is happening right now. My friends and family can barely afford to live right now. My gender non-conforming friends want to die and i don't want to be here without them. My immigrant friends are scared and my friends with children can't afford to give them eggs in the morning, even though they are middle class.

Idk, the anger dam had been building and she pushed the right buttons. She was trying to make me mad, i know she was. And i let her win. I think she wanted to prove Americans are violent and I may have proved her right.

I hate this feeling. I let an uneducated blob of a woman get to me like that. Anyway, Canadians always treat Michiganders badly. I should have known. Like when I went to Stratford the first time and some toothless lady spit on me when I was just a kid."
463,3,"I've always had anger issues and ODD. It was never severe until now. My mom about 10 months ago started and is continually cheating with a very, very bad man, who happens to be my father. She does not care what he did to me and her other daughter.

Now, my anger is different. when I got older, my anger was more manageable, but I had more of a slower burn with an intense outcome if I got angry. It only took a little bit of time before I snapped.

For days now, I've been feeling it. The anger stemming from the situation with my mother. I want to fight. I wanna just strangle someone who pisses me off. I've been mouthing off more lately with her and I know it's only a matter of time before I snap. Just yesterday, I almost strangled this bitch who told me to shut the fuck up. A friend had to talk me out of it before lunging. It's like I've been ITCHING for a fight. All the school fights happening around aren't good influences either. I wanna start shit. I want to fucking punch someone who says shit to me. I wanna smack the shit out of my mom. I wanna just scream, yell, argue.

How do I manage this?

ETA: Thought I should mention, my mother is a neglectful parent, refusing to let me do anything a teen my age should be doing. Getting an ID, license, job, ect. She pulled me out of therapy because she was mad I wanted to talk to MY therapist alone. I have no support system."
464,3,"Everyone thinks I’m really happy, positive and a positive role model. Which I enjoy being - it’s like a role model - everyone should aspire to be the change that they want to see in the world.

HOWEVER

Inside I’m full of rage and anger, everything irks me and I just want to let loose with a tirade of abuse at people. It could be someone who I have to work with who gets things wrong, people that seemingly fall into a barrel of dicks and end up sucking a tit, or people who are just outwardly selfish and in it for themselves.

I’m constantly resentful for everything and it’s a struggle. I want to be a chill guy and that’s what I have to outwardly portray, but sometimes I think that maybe violence IS the answer (to some problems). 

It keeps me up at night, distracts me from enjoying the moment- which causes the whole thing to feed into itself. I feel like it’s a disease. "
465,3,"Going through it with fiancée and her family. I yelled at her self-made invalid mom while fiancée was in the room. Mostly about money and lack of it. Plus ya know state of the world. They told me to go eat and get a second job, so I blew my top a second time, asking fiancée when she ever cooks. Her father saw me slam a car door and said “I hope to slam his head in the car door” like he’s fucking Fisk lol. 

I am at a loss for what to do to sleep, if an apology is necessary for freaking out, and whether space will help the relationship or break it further. 

I’ve said a lot of nasty shit in texts about the situation, I’ve been incensed. Punched my bed a few times about an hour ago. Wish I could punch a hole in the wall, but last time I kicked a wall I broke my toe. 

I’ve never hit anyone, but that “””temper tantrum””” has her mom thinking I beat her like Rihanna. And if her father is gonna have violent fantasies, I’ll let him slam my head in the car door. Unless he’s too pussy to do it."
466,3,"I don't know if this is the right place to come for advice, I feel a bit silly writing this all out, but I don't know what to do. I'm a senior in high school and every time I have to do any sort of work that I don't know how to do I get incredibly frustrated and enraged and it's really hindering my ability to do any work. 

It's especially bad with English-type subjects. I'm supposed to pick two pages from the book we're reading and annotate them but I feel like I don't know how to annotate. At all. I honestly don't think I've ever annotated something in my life. It's due either tonight or tomorrow it's kind of unclear, and I'm just so angry. 

It's ridiculous, but I just feel completely stuck in every single way. I used be more easily frustrated (and considerably more self-loathing) and the only way I could get it out was through self-harm. I don't do that anymore but I just don't know how to deal with any of my emotions. 

I feel like I have to throw my laptop and run outside until I can't anymore and rip off my skin to get away. It's just such an uncomfortable feeling. The only thing that stops this is completely abandoning the task at hand and either overloading my brain with content or lying down on my kitchen floor (it's cold). This is fine when I'm freaking out over something stupid but I have to get this done. 

Does anyone advice? I'm going to university in the fall and I can't be acting like this when I'm faced with actual hard work for the first time in my life. Also if anyone tells me to just take deep breaths I'm going to crash out."
467,3,"Someone really really really screwed me over and I just can’t let it go to the point where I’m plotting on physically harming them. Just the thought of this person screwing me over and shrugging their shoulders and continuing to live consequence free is just something I can’t accept. I’m literally becoming enraged just typing that. It’s like I can’t stand for it and I can’t just “let it go”. Like I said I’m to the point of plotting to hurt this person beyond the point of coming back from it because that’s the only way I feel I’m going to feel at ease with the situation. 

I don’t believe in karma because even if it does occur I’m the type of person that isn’t satisfied unless I can visually witness it happening. Like it’s not enough for me to “think/hope” they are getting their just deserve I have to see it to feel satisfied. Example if someone killed my friend me knowing they are in jail for life simply isn’t enough. No I want a seat at the window on their execution day type thing. That would be the ONLY way I could move on. "
468,3,"Hey guys, I’m a first-time father and am looking to provide as stable and loving of an environment for my partner and baby as possible. I do a good job of this for the most part, but must admit that certain aspects and triggers (lack of sleep, stress, arguments about certain topics, recalling painful memories) can sometimes put me in fight-or-flight mode and make it difficult to manage my emotions. I’m currently taking vilazodone (antidepressant), mirtazapine (for insomnia), buspirone (on occasion) and propranolol (which has seems to have made the most beneficial effect in blunting adrenaline and allowing me to sit still in discomfort and filter my reactions). I’m also very into working out, self help books, weekly talk therapy, etc. 

I’m just curious if anyone has had any major breakthroughs undergoing anything similar and what the solution was for you. Particularly in terms of blunting or preventing adrenaline. Thanks! "
469,3,"I (18M) have major anger issues and it seems that no matter what I medicine I take, what precautions I take, or even what steps I take to prevent myself from getting angry. They never work. Ever. I also get very destructive, I’ve broken many Xbox controllers and headsets and many items that were important to me, all because I can’t control my anger. I’ve tried multiple times to talk to my family members but they give me the same shit. “Just breathe.” Or “take a break.” It’s like they think I’m stupid and haven’t tried those. Does anyone what to do? "
470,3,"Abuse is mentioned in this post. If this sets you off then leave.

I (M27) am having some real struggles with my girlfriend's (F30) ex (M40s). He is recently back in the picture, trying to use her son (M5) as a weapon against her. For a while, he was distracted by a new woman and never bothered seeing his son. Now that's over, and he is twisting her arm for visitation. He's an abusive nut job that assaulted her during the relationship (never layed a finger on the son, thankfully) and is a master manipulator. From what I can tell, this is just a control tactic to screw with her life and try to disrupt us, it has nothing to do with seeing his child.

Where my issue lies, my own father did the same with me and my mother. Lies, manipulation and using me as a pawn to get to her. He abused her, and then when he couldnt touch her anymore, then he would abuse me instead to get to her. The same hate and rage I put to bed for my own dead father and his actions 20 years ago now is pretty much back with a passion because of the parallel. I see the stress he is putting on her, the anxiety. I worry if he will do the same to her son (who I've really grown to love as much as his mum) now he can't physically harm her. This is really getting to me. The solicitors she tried to use to issue a letter to block his visitation have done nothing, and now he is coming over to our village for 3 days to see him. 

I can't stop this hate and rage in the back of my mind. He is tampering with her life, the child's life, and, just in general, our lives for his own sick amusement. I'm worried that I'll snap when I see him, and I won't be able to keep my aggression in check. I've had control of my anger for many years now, but I can't even focus on anything right now with this in the back of my head. The worst part is that I know my hate is completely justified because I love her and her son, and it comes out of a place of wanting to protect them. I just dont know how to shut this off and don't know what to do."
471,3,I need help. I don't know why I'm just irrationally angry. And at work I don't want to smile I don't want to be angry but when I'm there I get angry. And  I hate saying hi or if I don't hear someone saying sorry. Or if I have to repeat myself. I don't know why I just can't be nice even if inside I want to be. Or I start smiling when I shouldn't. What's wrong with me. I have to fake being polite.
472,3,"When someone says or does something that angers me, irritates me or just makes me cringe in the slightest i immediately have to snap back with something. Even if i’m having a completely normal and happy conversation with someone i like. it completely enrages me when i hold myself back, but i also feel so much guilt afterwards. help?"
473,3,"I just hate it when people throw things especially if it's done in anger or frustration. It just triggers me so much that I get in a sour mood. Like idek why I'm mad when their actions weren't directed towards me. I just hate the action, the loud thud I hear. It makes me go into fight or flight mode. I just want to know if others deal with this too or why they think it happens"
474,3,"I need to get checked probably. I’m dealing with some things I can’t get closure on, and some days it really drives me to rage. To me it feels white hot, and that I need to release it immediately, whether at an object, on someone, or on myself. It physically hurts. And during that time I experience an array of emotions, like laughing and crying at the same time. Sometimes if it’s so bad I bang my head against something until the “pain stops”. Sometimes it lasts a day or maybe longer, and it’s intense. Is this something everyone with anger issues go through or is this something bigger?"
475,3,"Can we normalize just telling people you didn’t want to invite them. I’m tired of people telling me “we didn’t think you would want to come” or “it was just a last minute thing” and things like that. Just straight up tell me you didn’t want me to come. 
And this doesn’t happen all the time but assuming I’m mad after not being told about plans is what makes me mad. "
476,3,"From personal experience....I know it's difficult, but if you ever get into an argument with your gf, spouse etc. the best method is to walk away or no sell it. As soon as you lose control even if you are valid you lose it all when you blow up on her and scare her. Then you become the villain and everyone thinks you are a piece of shit. It's better to walk away so your best to manage it, because you will never win getting angry."
477,3,I remember my brother got so angry and he shouted at our parents to be patient. He accidentally scared a woman who was walking beside. 
478,3,"I don't know what to do. I feel so lost. My partner and I have been together for 11 years. We're 31. He is the only person capable of triggering this very uncomfortable rage in me. I feel ignored by him often, so when he asks me a question I've answered many times before, I immediately feel a swell of extreme, unbridled rage. I yell at him for ignoring me, I call him arrogant and mean (never anything worse than that though), I scream, and I sometimes feel the urge to hit him (but NEVER would act on it). I curse a lot in these rage episodes. Sometimes I even yell ""f you"" at him (rarely). It terrifies me; no one else triggers rage like this in me. I don't want to be like this and I can't afford therapy right now. He's so calm and collected....meanwhile, I lash out at him, resenting him for making me feel ignored and discarded, for wasting my time, for constantly interrupting me, for wasting my energy. I know it sounds selfish but I hate him, like really hate him in these moments--and then hate myself even more. I feel so much guilt and don't recognize myself after these moments. The lashing out feels inevitable once the rage is triggered, but I know it's my responsibility and it's not inevitable. My question is...how do I stop the flow of rage once it starts? How do I prevent these triggers from turning into full-blown screaming attacks? I think he is going to leave me if I don't get it under control, and I don't blame him. "
479,3,Luckily for me it’s always been an internal management thing. Like I shove it down. Deeply unhappy. I snap at people. And in my head I’m always like “why is life so hard”. I don’t know how to deal with this new found problem.
480,3,"How the hell do you make something clear to someone like say a really pushy salesman that you are not interested in their shitty products without coming off as an asshole? I swear, whenever it comes toward those guys, I feel like I should either be passive and act intrigued or tell em straight to fuck off. There have even been situations where one of my friends was threatening to stick some tape on my neck, and I kept telling him no, because it wasn't funny to me, and when he actually did it, I threw a fist his direction. How exactly do you make yourself assertive? Not overly passive but not seem like a short tempered dick?"
481,3,"So, I'm usually a pretty angry person, hurts to say but it's true. Recently I've been trying to just 'not care' anymore, which helps with not letting my feelings take over in a situation. 

I'd like to give a quick tip/piece of advice to those who can read a text and make them feel some type of way which has been helping me recently aswell.

**If someone sends you a message that ticks you off, wait to respond. Do not respond immediately, this will let your emotions take control. Click away from the message, go do something else or finish up whatever you were doing, then come back to it.**

How this differs from just answering immediately is is that it gives you time to process your emotions and respond with a clear head rather than reacting purely on impulse. When you acknowledge the message, take a step back, then come back to it, you're allowing yourself to react more objectively, and not through anger. You MIGHT still be angry even when you took a step back and came back to it, but atleast now you'll have thought your responses through, and took the time to fully dissect the message, instead of reacting with emotions and saying something you'll regret later.

Most of the time, anger is blinding. Even if the sender didn't imply to cause any frustration or arguments, you might see it as the opposite. The urge to immediately make a point and let out your feelings on the topic is strong, which can lead you to go all out. A saying I've heard went a little something like this: **""In an argument, listen carefully. People will tell you exactly what they’ve been wanting to say to you for a long time.""**  
You do not want to be the 'people' in this scenario. 

  
Now, on the other hand, I can't give much advice about managing anger IRL, because it seems to me I can get more ticked off online than in person. However, I'd assume the same principle applies to real life aswell. Of course, you can't step back from a conversation in the middle of it, but I'd recommend to take a quick 10-15 seconds after a anger-inducing statement to think about what you're going to say, and break down the statement. Don't feel pressured to respond immediately, they can wait.

Let me know what you think about this!"
482,3,"I swear it feels like when I get angry, I just get worse and worse until I do or say things I cannot take back. It stars off as a fuse but then becomes a wildfire"
483,3,"Hi, there is so much here thats just not tennable to write it all. 2024 literally buchered my family.

Sister lived in hospital for a year, became a paraplegic with 3 surgeries that had 50 50 mortality rates.

Dad stage 4 cancer ( find out day one of sisters hospital surgeries) 

Complete and utter heathen scumbag cunt of a stepmother who thrives on drama.

I am a school teacher who has been off for a year as i was threatened to be stabbed by a student several times and the school believe in positivity and that children that threaten teachers with knifes shouldnt be punished.

A lot more happened due to everyone breaking under the pressure.

My dad handled his cancer diagnosis very poorly. I am emotionally intelligent enough to understand how extreme that is but his behaviour was the same as it was our whole life, and let us down extremely several times due to his wife. In a 15 year relationship every scenario with this woman was a berating of our mother (both have never even met) my dad never did anything about it. Well he let my sister down biblically because of his jealous wifes needs? Whole world caving in but keep a petulant stupid rat jealous bitch happy. His words were always happy wife happy life....which is ok if you have no one else in your life but most do, he was always emotionally simplistic, lazy and selfish. Anyways I called him a coward, told him he is his wifes pet and he should be ashamed at the things he is doing. This is a time were family need to stick together his daughter has lay in hospital nearly died 3 times and he never went go see her for a fucking month. Dont give a fuck if youve got cancer if your trying not to hurt her, abandoning her to cry for her daddy in a hospital for a month is abhorrant fucking monstrous behaviour, he wasn't very receptive of this hard truth. He might have cancer but it didnt stop him working for arnold clark for a further 8 months. He put more effort into patrolling fucking carparks.

Anyways naturally i wanted to see him and did everything in my power to make contact this year 100+ attempts. When told he was dying, i just went straight to the hospital. I was escorted out last week. They had my photo, they confirmed it was my step moms wishes. I was refused entry.

He died on Friday night. 

I felt nothing other than anger. I received the call and went oh well 5 mins later i returned to my friends who i was with said my dads just died i feel nothing. No sadness just nothing and tried to continue my night albeit very awkwardly. I just didnt know what to do.

I still feel nothing, writing this triggered anger but generally nothing. I am concerned i have passed an emotional threshold and stepped right into a coldness of sociopathic behaviour, i cant cry or feel sad, my dad died an absolute weak coward. I have asked my uncle if i can have his second name because i will not share it with my step mum. (Im the last of my name who can birth a boy, family name dies with me)

I now expect trauma, its the baseline. Trauma is 'vanilla' for me. I genuinely have gone from a professional successful man to literally envisioning jail time in my future. I chop people up in my head, i hang from rafters in rooms and shrug 20 of my hanging bodies out the way like curtains walking thru the house. I hallucinate me dead everywhere.

Recently finished counciling (all of above in more detail spoken about), verdict was it cant help as my issues are ongoing, growing and out of my control, which means i am reactionary to current events. Basically fobbed off ,time will heal was the prescription.

I think i have the potential to become something truly horrific...which horrifies me and is now an add on to the poor cycle of mental health.

I'd be gone but ive got kids and they are all i care for. People talk about pathways. What if my path is a conveyor belt I am glued onto.

Ive quit teaching. I am not fit and have zero tolerance for students anymore. I'm a punchbag that will punchback now. Im 36 and restarting life from scratch an extremely dark person and i just cant fucking stop! 

I'm not looking for the positive nice response from anyone. I'm looking for others like me, who just want someone that gets the need for venomous toxic language as a coping mechanism for how completely shite life can be, you might save my life or i might save yours. 😥

Any fellow psychos feel free to reach out."

485,3,"Hello

Mid 30's individual here, my mother passed away in november last year. All my life I felt I was a placid person, it would take a fair bit for me to lose my temper. But ever since my mom's passing I've felt my temper and moods take a big turn for the worst. I have screamed at my poor dogs, smashed and kicked things around my house. I've also begun getting into screaming matches with people, there was an instance where I felt it was a coinflip whether I would physically attack another person who stole a parking spot from me in a reckless way. 

I've begun considering looking for a psychiatrist but in the meantime I would like to ask people in this community to share with me what works for them, to dial down their anger in the moment."
486,3,"Hi guys,

It's been a very long time that I've been dealing with my present situation. And I'm so exhausted of trying to figure out which approach would work best to make my husband snap at me less. Let me dive in:

We have been married for almost 5 years and share two children. Our youngest will be a year in a couple weeks. Before we had children, things were wonderful. We were able to talk. We appreciated one another and the unique little things about each other. We truly were a textbook definition of a happy relationship. 

Fast forward to having our first child, my spouses mother became very embedded in our home and began getting involved and creating issues. we ended up reaching a point where she just doesn't come here but he can take the kids there. But during this process he has became very angry with me. Snapping often and it honestly happens over mundane things like being tired, exhausted, the house not being to his standard, etc. for example, after I had my son (I was 2 weeks pp), he yelled at me for putting a my own laundry in the baby's hamper by accident. Or he got angry with me the other day for signing up for a Pilates class because he would be too tired and not feeling well after working all week - and when I asked if my mom could come watch the kids for one so I could go, he snapped at me and told me I was being pushy. 

He has been a wonderful spouse until the anger got to him, but slowly the respect is gone from both ends. Due to how often he snaps, I have now resorted to being rude when he snaps. I have told him I want a divorce, I've told him he is behaving like his mom, I've said that I don't enjoy my time with him anymore. It's been over 3 years and I have just reached my limits. 

What can I do? Is this marriage a lost cause? He doesn't do therapy - we tried couples counselling. He doesn't believe in it. He has told me ""I'm working on my anger, I don't need therapy. I know what I do wrong"". 

I don't want to split my family up but I physically feel that I can't I cannot tolerate the disrespect anymore and asking gently for him to change doesn't work, ignoring him doesn't work, I do t know what to do
"
487,3,"Hello. I am a person who has not felt anger in years (the last time I felt anger, I was a small child). I find that I do not feel angry, even when I 'should'. I feel fear, pity, hapiness, nostalgia, indifference, frustration too; everything except anger.  
This leaves me resenting people who feel anger. When I encounter an angry person, I think they are immature. I think they're unwilling to work through their emotions, to 'let it go', that they care too much and place importance on trivial matters, unwilling to understand others, or just calm themselves down. This might sound outrageous to you, I know it's much easier to say than to do. But since I am a person who is never ever angry, it can really get to me when someone else has trouble managing their anger.  
  
I need your insight as to why/in what ways your anger causes you trouble and is difficult to manage. Why anger would be helpful. Help me put myself in your shoes. Help me understand your side of the story so I don't alienate/put people in boxes/assume things that are wrong. "
488,3,I’m getting angry more often; I don’t want to hurt any one or myself but ohhh I’d love to shove my hand through the nearest wall. Worst part is I know it won’t help. I’ve not taken help well and it makes me worse to practice the exercises. Gave myself a migraine from it. I get this way when I screw up and it seems to be happening more often. I don’t know if I’ll receive it well but does anyone have any advice?

490,3," Anger managment tips?

I find it very difficult to understand abs regulate my emotions as a whole but it seems to be particularly bad with anger. Just about anything can set me off and then I become pissy, frustrated and violant for the rest of the day or sometimes longer. Unfortunately I often end up taking it out on my friends which is really unfair on them. I usually try to surpres the anger until I'm alone and can take it out on my self but that's Not always the case. , I've tried  a lot to try regulate my anger but nothing seems to work. I'm in my rather early teens so I have limited options on what I can do (I don't want to speak to a professional/teacher or parents)

And I know hate my family as they say I'm just trying to get attention as a I was young when it happened and I just can't believe they would do that to me and so I'm now fucking angry as hell 
What would you do if you where in my shoes? "
492,3,"I struggle with my mood swings constantly as a bipolar. But the worst one is anger. I will snap all the time at the littlest things and I feel like I can’t control it no matter how hard I try. It’s to the point where when I even try to vent to my friends all I get is “damn”, “that’s crazy”, and “it’s not that serious”. And I hate being known as the person who constantly gets mad at everything and even snaps and goes a bit insane whenever she gets really pissed off. I breathe, I journal, I text help lines. Non of it seems to help. I thought I was doing just fine until someone made the comment that I need help if I’m acting like this. What do y’all do to stay calm and not snap? 

"
493,3,"I’m 183cm or 6 foot and a guy and I get really mad and feel like I’m weak when I see someone taller than me and I get so insecure about myself I used to cry when I got home cuz I realize no one will love me because I am too short. But now, when I see someone taller than me and I feel that way I beat them up. Usually I wait until they’re at the stairs, then push them down and when they are on the floor knee them in the back of the head. Most of the time they pass out and get a concussion. So far I’ve been expelled from 4 schools and rn I may end up in juvenile detention. I just get so angry. "
494,3,"In my case, my mom and I got into a heated argument. Nothing, nasty... just level 1 angry.

And when I went home and got into my room, I feel my mind trying to  create these dialogs for the already over argument.

So how do you deal with it."
495,3,"I’m 24 and for many years I’ve been going full rage mode when I snapped at my mom. Breaking things, shouting till my voice hurts, hurting myself and more breaking things. I realised I always snapped at her tone of voice changes, especially when every time she questions me or question what my friends intention in a tone of voice that just sends me into a full rage. The tone of voice she used sounds like a police officer giving a speeding ticket. Her ""Normal” voice or voice that she used when she’s not questioning me anything sounds alright, sometimes when guest comes over to our house, her tone of voice sounds even better, a positive vibe even. But when she starts to question me like today, she questioned about my friend’s intention, she asked 'Why is your friend treating you so well?’ 'What are their intentions’ the more I explain myself, the more agitated I got and I went into a terrifying rage, punched and spoilt the furniture, destroyed my plastic pencil box, slapped myself and hurt my hands punching the wall. Why am I like this? I wish I’m not so triggered by her tone of voice! But it’s like I could sense her micro aggression and her unnecessary fears when she used that tone of voice to question me. When I tell her that her tone of voice she used to question me is annoying, she says 'no I’m talking to you nicely.’ That pisses me off more and sends me off into another rage, because why is she denying! why can’t she just acknowledge she change her tone of voice when she questions me! look, I don’t know if she’s doing it on purpose or she don’t realise that she changes her tone of voice when she questions me but I don’t want to snapped at her anymore, every time after I snapped at her I feel drained and sad and my head hurts. I am finding help, anyone, Reddit commentators please help us. We can’t go to therapy because we have no time and I financially I am not doing well. Tell me what I can do to not go into a violent rage and how can I not get affected by my mom’s tone of voice and how can I stay calm in a heated conversation. Please help, this problem have been going on for decades."
496,3,"For the majority of my life (I’m 25), whenever I’m put in a situation where I try to explain myself or my thought process and it’s not being understood I get sooooo upset that I just want run and go and hide. 

For example, the reason why I’m making this post, is that I’ve realized that it’s a reoccurring thing between my fiancé and I, is that whenever I feel as if I’m being attacked (most of the time I’m not, I’m just on the defense constantly which is my problem, I know) I will automatically start trying to explain myself, and the reasoning behind certain thought processes or quirks I have, which in turn makes my fiancé believe I’m trying to start a fight. 

I’ve always had trouble controlling my anger, once something sets me off, it’s hard for me to calm down. The thing is, I’m a very chilled person usually but if I feel like I’m being misunderstood after I’ve tried to explain myself 5 times over, I get viscerally frustrated and I just want to get up and run away. I honestly don’t know if this is the right subreddit to be posting on, but nonetheless, any insight or advice would be appreciated. "
497,3,"So I (f23) have recently been struggling with explosive anger tendancies and its really affecting me and I have become frustrated with feeling like I am not making any progress. I got a book from the library called ""letting go of anger"" and I found it interesting, but not really helpful. 

  
I am very much a hands-on learner and I think a workbook that is interactive and gives prompts and steps to guide me in this journey and help me see progress would be best for me. I have seen a few online but I want to ask if anyone can give me some good recommendations.  

Thank you!"
498,3,"I'm also a woman, just so we know it for context if it matters. Basically I've always had some anger management issues and I've no idea if it's from my father (who also has problems) my autism or the rough childhood that made me mad at the world (I'm doing much better about separating myself from this)

I lash out with attitude towards my wife when she frankly does not deserve it, at all. Maybe it's because I see her as a safe person but that's not right or fair, she's tired of it and I don't want our otherwise amazing relationship to become strained because I can't get a hold of myself.

So how can I do that? How do I stop myself from snapping at her (or others) when it's such a quick reaction that's far too natural at this point? I've promised her that i'm going to do my absolute best to be more aware about how im feeling before I react to her, even if that means just leaving the room for a bit.

I know Therapy probably could help, might not. Regardless we can't afford it. I'd just like some advice...thanks.

"
499,3,"I mainly take out my anger on myself. I usually punch the side of my calves because I've broken most of my electronics or anything I see. I've destroyed my coffee table, laptop, gaming units and my phone. When I drink it's even worse. I'm so much more hateful towards anyone in sight. I was cuffed and tried using my cleated boots to kick an officer in the face. (thank god he didn't take legal action.) I wanted him to hate me. I needed him to take action against me. If I had a weapon I would have done something because he was being a bitch to me.

501,3,"Or worse, I hold the anger in and fear embarrassment. Not to mention if you lose contact with the person that anger just festers - not because you hate them, but because the exact opposite. And a small part of you hopes - but knows - it’ll never happen. Because IF THEY WANTED TO THEY WOULD!!! So I wonder - do you let it go for a little while and retrace your steps 2 years later? Lol. Or do you just let it sit there until it hurts a little less over time. Cause when a person tells you to never contact them again - you don’t. And it just makes you look stupid if you. Cause let’s face it, they didn’t care. "
502,3,"When my brother is at home only with his parents he would shout and yell them in anger sometimes in self defence or for no reason. People always wonder why outside he is very nice to others but at his own home with only his parents he will get really angry. I think I know why, maybe it's because he thinks that his parents still treat like crap just like how he was abused in his childhood. "
503,3,I'm 25 years old and a female. From Guatemala... anyone to talk to?
504,3,Just got sober and living at a sober home and everything sober just pisses me off. Especially people. I went to an employment agency today and the woman right away gave me a bad look probably because of my tattoos and piercings but I don't feel I should change for people or society. Was going to take a shower and of course some guy has to be taking a 2hr long shower. Go for a drive got some tailgater right on my ass then I get to walmart and I swear not one person wants to move or yield for me goin down the aisles. Fuck people.

506,3,"I need some serious advice here; mostly referring to online arguments

I know the healthy thing to do is turn away and not engage with this sort of thing but...it's hard for me NOT too? Like, especially when it's something I'm passionate about. I don't wan to feel weak, I don't want to miss out on making my point and I especially don't want the other person the satisfaction of winning

Does anyone have any advice? Is it in the mindset or something, because I'm drawing a blank and this is legit starting to tear me apart"
507,3,"So basically I had very close friends from my middle school. One of them being a girl, and another one a boy. We were “kind of from the same school” but both my besties were not friends. Never even met in all these years. Then I had another friend (M) who was with me in the same school and my girl bestie. And they were sorta friends but not so close. My second male friend left school, so he was not in contact with my girl bestie. But I was in contact with three of them separately. And all of them are my really close friends , more like a family. It’s been 15 years now. The two guys are also friends, from childhood. But they did have some issues, but still friends. They’d speak to each other maybe once or twice a year or so. So basically none of them were really in touch with each other until I went back to my country a month ago. I met all of them separately and then decided to invite them all for a dinner and make them meet. My girl bestie was not ready to meet them, she’s not a very social person. And basically hates to meet new people and socialize. But I forced her to meet others also. So when we went out for dinner all of them had a good time. Oh and there was my girl besties little sister too, who’s almost 18 and 10 years younger than us. So after this dinner we started to hang out often. But soon I started to feel like they’re always talking to one another. Until I force myself into the conversation no one would really talk to me. They’d make jokes with each other, and make joke on me sometimes to which I’d just laugh. But I felt it so many times. Before I felt this, I made a WhatsApp group for all of them. And on the first night I realized they all are chatting with each other. Even the young girl was more into the conversation than me. Anyway I came back to other country and now I see them meeting literally every other day. They’d say occasionally that they miss me so much but I still feel so lonely. Not sure if I’m being jealous but now everyone I see them I feel so angry. And I don’t like this feeling. :( 
"
508,3,"Its been months but I'm still somewhat haunted I couldn't accept when I was supposed to. This past Christmas, my sister had someone come pick up a package from my mom's house. They lady was kind enough and offered to cut my hair and paid for my Uber ride to the Barbershop. My sister notified me and has been since late 2024. I made sure I always told my sister I was ready whenever she asked when I was going to go. The lady repeatedly asked my sister when was I gonna go and now I don't know anymore. It was definitely an incredible first impression that I wish I got my haircut the month SHE offered the present, Christmas. I still remember the lady's genuine smile and friendly gesture. I'm happy I wasn't the only one she thought of but I was probably why she decided to give out Christmas presents.

I can't shake the feeling and regret and now I feel somewhat pressured. To the point where I'm near greatly angered I didn't follow through. A women shouldn't pay for a man's haircut. Yeah. This is the slogan I'm going with now.

Don't block your blessings."
509,3,"I grew up in a home with a very VERY angry stepfather, who was jealous that my mom prioritized me over him so he hated everything about me. All I’ve ever known anger wise is rage and resentment. I have no idea what a healthy outlet for this emotion even looks like at all. I truly hate being angry, because I get mean. I become a downright bitch. So for years I’ve been suppressing it but it seems like I don’t have the skill to do it anymore. I’m just wondering if anyone here knows how to express and release anger without saying horrible things to people, yelling, making them feel stupid, or slamming things? "
510,3,"hi all! i’m currently dating someone who has a bit of an anger issue problem. 

i tried to look up advice from people with partners who have anger issues, but they all described abusive behavior.  he is not abusive at all. he’s blown up before at his parents, his friends, his coworkers, his boss, me, etc. so it’s not discriminatory towards me (if it were, i would’ve dropped him immediately). 

his biggest triggers are traffic and stress. he has awful road rage, which really made me hesitant to start dating him before i knew. he also dropped out of college a couple years ago, and any suggestions of further schooling or strategies to continue his certifications stress him greatly and could set him off. it’s like his limbs move on his own and someone else jumps into his throat to say mean, snappy things against his will. he always apologizes profusely immediately after. i’m a very calm, zen person so we’re complete opposites. i tend to take his outbursts hard, even though i understand this is an issue he’s struggling with. i want to make sure im responding to his emotions properly and not making it worse. 

he’s previously had therapy for this and—according to his close circle—he’s gotten a whole lot better, but he still has some residual struggles. 

how do you want others to respond to your anger outburst? what’s the best way you’ve been supported by a different person/partner? thanks! "
511,3,How to effectively communicate when one gets angry.
512,3,Anyone so angry and depressed at life that you just contemplate going all out on crashing out because it's hard to just give af and keep trying? I know I get it but my inner reason just convinces me not to give into that thought even though it's hard.
513,3,"We’ve all had those moments—someone says or does something that instantly sets us off, and before we know it, we’re reacting in ways we regret later.

For me, learning to pause before responding made a huge difference. Just taking a deep breath or walking away for a minute helps me think more clearly instead of saying something I’ll regret.

What works for you? Any techniques or mindset shifts that help you manage anger better? Let’s share and learn from each other!"
514,3,"This game has become a medium of poison for my emotions. I've punched my desk so many times, I don't know how it still stands. How many more times is it gonna be before it's a wall, or something more important to me? I've only decided to say something here because my desk is a lot harder than I thought it was and now my hand is facing the consequences. How do I remain calm during this game? I've told myself over and over that is indeed just a game but my anger doesn't seem to care."
515,3,"Felt something leaving my body through forehead

Yesterday night I had an intense rage session on feeling being stuck in my life & in pure anger & deep seethed rage I had this feeling for the first time that something, some energy left my body through my forehead and as a auto body response I covered my forehead which I am unable to contemplate. 

I am trying to preserve my prana but everytime I prolong the retention I enter a phase of extreme mood swing and pure rage & anger which seems to not know any boundary & if not for me being alone could easily orchestrate a catastrophe!! 

I feel this phase to last for 3-4 days which then subsides into calmness & pure control on my thoughts and actions as if my consciousness has become detached from body & is able to control body much like playing a video game ! 

Has anyone felt this experience?? Or any one can suggest what's happening to me ?? 

I find myself as a person who has affinity to rage but offlate this rage anger takes a longer time to build and become expressive compared to earlier times . "
516,3,"Am I the only one that gets infuriated every time I have to take notes for college? Like iI'm not just like ""Oh taking notes is so hard and boring boohoo"", no I mean like every time a professor talks so fast and tells us to take notes for a upcoming quiz I get super overwhelmed and angry and I actually want to throw my laptop at the wall. Sometimes i just walk out of class because I cant handle it and I do regret it afterwards sometimes but I literally can't take it, especially when I have 6 different classes in one semester. (Note: II'm 24, autistic and have some ADHD symptoms so I tend to get overwhelmed easily.) I just want to know if Im not the only one who feels like this. Does anybody relate to this?"
517,3,For at least 10 years I had to hold my anger inside just so I wouldn't explode on people. I'm trying to be a better person but anger is one of my struggles.
518,3,"I’m so angry every single day.  I hate everything about my life right now.  I usually just keep it to myself and sleep if I have a chance but sometimes I will text someone to get it out.  I hate doing that because no one wants to be on the opposite side of an anger rant.  Sometimes lately I am so angry I don’t know what to do with myself.  It makes me feel like I could tear everything around me including myself to pieces.  I’m by myself mostly all day and night, 7 days a week.  I can’t figure out a solution to my problems.  My family all says they’re behind me when I text with them but that doesn’t help me and no solution is ever found and the problem stills sits in my lap day after day.  After over a year.   At this point I don’t think I’ll ever be happy again.  How can I be?   I’m being left up shits creek by everyone I know.  I couldn’t tell you the last time I smiled.  My face doesn’t even naturally smile anymore.  That just compounds my sadness and anger. "
519,3,"As far as I can tell, nothing really wrong or warrants me being this flustered. Not gonna lie, I've thought that maybe it's something similar to bi-polar, though I've never been diagnosed with it. But I'm sitting here buzzing with irritation. I want to smash shit, throw things, and break as much as I can... but I don't have anything I can 'afford' to destroy without regretting it. "
520,3,I remember my brother used to get really angry at our parents for breaking his promise to buy him the things that he wanted. He would tell them to just fuck off and he goes to buy for himself. 
521,3,"A friend of mine (let's call her Z) has shown increasingly concerning behaviors over the last 6 months to a year, and I want to talk to her about it, but I don't know how.

Z has been drinking more and saying violent things that are pretty jarring.  A few months ago, we were at a bar and talking about my upcoming wedding (later this year) when she said something along the lines of ""I swear to god, I am going to kill your sister if she fucks up your bachelorette party.  I am going to punch her and punch her and beat the shit out of her.""  For context, my sister is my maid of honor, so she will be organizing my bachelorette party.  When she said this, I responded by saying, ""Honestly, she is very good at this sort of thing, and regardless, that is such an insane thing to say"" but she just kept repeating violent things.  I kept trying to interject, but she was just too drunk to be able to hear/understand anything I was saying, and I just dropped it.

I had been meaning to set up a friend date to confront Z about how her behavior has changed over the last year, most notably that any time there is alcohol involved at a friend group event, she doesn't just has a few - she gets wasted.  But then the other night when we were at a friend's house for their birthday, she said something very similar to me about my sister and the bachelorette party again (it was just me and her in the room): ""If she fucks this up, I am going to strangle her until her eyes bleed.""  I raised my voice to her for a second saying ""WHOA okay this is NOT okay"" and told her how jarring it is to hear something like that because most people do not carry that much rage around with them, and that I think she needs to go to therapy.  I told her I  had been meaning to talk to her and I didn't want it to happen this way (while we were already drunk) and apologized for it coming out like this, but I needed to say something in this moment.  I reiterated that we are still friends, this is a safe place, that I love her, that I'm sure hearing this information is probably a lot to take in and we don't need to have all the answers right now, and all I want is to help because I have seen a major change in her behavior over the last year.  We ended the conversation, hugged, and went our separate ways for a couple of hours.

One of our friends (let's call her A) noticed Z and I talking earlier that night and asked me if I ""talked"" to her, since ALL of our friends are concerned about Z.  I told A what happened and that I will be having a follow-up conversation with her highlighting her drinking and anger.  That is when A told me that a little over a year ago, A had been on a weekend ski trip with Z and both of their husbands.  A was injured and couldn't ski, so Z stayed back with A, and Z proceeded to binge drink all day long (A was not drinking).  That night, after A and Z's husbands returned to the hotel, at some point, Z got angry about something her husband did/said (it is important to know that this man is extremely sweet, a little dumb, and overall a very good person I have known for years) and then proceeded to tackle him to the ground in rage and attempt to repeatedly punch his nuts.  A said that it looked like Z's husband reacted in a way like this was NOT the first time because he was ready for the tackle and immediately covered his nuts so that she couldn't get to them.  A said that she was shocked by it and didn't really follow up on it because it was so scary.

I was a victim of domestic abuse many years ago, so I am particularly disturbed by this new information.

So now I am here, and I need help.  I don't want to drive my friend away (and start the fallout of our friendship) because I push too hard and it makes it easier for her to refuse to get help.  She has never gone to therapy, and when I mentioned it to her this past weekend, she scoffed at the idea.

I texted her yesterday to see if we could meet up to continue our conversation, and she is available in 1.5 weeks.  I am thinking that I will invite her over for dinner - I will make us a nice meal.  When we meet, I will talk through my thoughts from our conversation last weekend, and note that I learned about the abuse A witnessed.  I also want to have resources available for her.  Should I print out articles?  Anger management hotlines?  Anger management classes?  Maybe take an online anger management quiz/test with her so that it underscores that there IS an issue?

Any information or advice is greatly appreciated!"
522,3,"I'm going to preface this as much as possible. Last September, Me and my gf at the time found a lovely little stray cat wandering around our apartment so I ended up taking me in and he's the sweet guy in the world, if maybe a little too adventurous.

  
These past couple months have not been well to me. I lost my job mainly due something I shouldn't have neglected at work, My gf broke up with me a month later, and I've been desperately searching for a job, while relying on my parents for financial aid which I don't care for. All of this had made me stressed, and feeling like gutter trash but unfortunately I made it worse.

When my gf first broke up with me, I felt I had lost control of everything, my energy was already sapped, and this just made me believe that the last drop of hope was extinguished. My cat that night was pawing at me for attention reasons, and something in me snapped. I picked him up, carried him to the bed and held him down hard, to the point where he quickly wasnt ok with it and bit down on me, which resulted in me throwing him down on the bed and uttering a primal scream. I was hyper ventilating for nearly 5 minutes after words. Eventually after being warry for a while, my cat eventually came to sleep with me and all was well.   
  
Fast Forward to today, and I was trying to play game today and the cat got out, this has happened once before and was my fault in openning to window to the screen door, which he pushed down. When my ex told me he was out, I got insanely angry, grabbed him and stormed back to the appartment, where I proceeded to act out like I had previously did, I know he was in pain with the screams as he bit down on me and I released. He hid under the dresser for half an hour, but now he is doing better, purring, and vying for my attention as usual  
  
I feel like a horrid, depraved person. I can't take my anger out on an animal that doesnt know or understand what I'm going through, especially when he's always been by my side. I realize that for the 30+ years of my life, I've bottled every negative emotion I've felt, and now I guess its starting to seep into me and cause me to lash out due to the amount of repressed feelings and anger. I talked with my therapist and we are discussing options to safely manage my anger. I will try this, but if they do not work, there is a strong chance I will have to give up my cat as I fear of hurting him again.  
  
This post was me posting the honest truth, perhaps writing to reddit, or in general may help. Feel free to post your feelings about this, I know it's pretty bad, and I feel very low of myself right now."
523,3,"Hey everyone, I'm a 21F and I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years. As you can see from the title, my in laws aren't good people and I've had to deal with a lot in the past 3 years. 
They're very controlling of the people around them. Including my boyfriend, his sister, and anyone who gets involved with them. For example, they pay for his sister's entire life and love the control that gives them over her. She was previously engaged to someone and they began to pay for his car payments and other things for him and this made them feel they had the authority to involve themselves in his life and their relationship. Which eventually ended and they played a huge part in that. 
My boyfriend and I lived with them for a year, and  my mother in law body shamed me heavily throughout that year. I'm underweight and have a small chest for a girl, and she took every chance she had to remind me of that. She called me ""little cupcakes"" and if I wore anything with a V neck or a dress, she'd laugh at me and say that I had ""no cake"" and ""my little cupcakes showed"" this of course had lasting effects on me and I think about her comments every time I look in the mirror. She would also judge my hair, my makeup, and how skinny she thought I was. So I never got a break from her bullying. 
Her husband I believe is a psychopath. I can't say everything he's done since a lot of it has to do with personal family things. But to me, he's threatened me by telling me he keeps information on people to use against them, he made sure I knew this fact and would remind me how he knows things about me. I'm not sure what but the uncertainty is fearful. He would tell me in detail how he stalked and harassed his daughters ex boyfriends and It felt like he would share these stories as a warning to me. Like he would do those same things to me if my boyfriend and I ever broke up. Another incident was one day I couldn't find my debit card that I always kept in my wallet in my purse, and he came up to me and showed me a picture he had taken of my card and told me ""don't ask why I have this"" and I never got an answer as to why he had that photo and I never found my card. A year later, he told my boyfriend he took that photo to ""intimidate me"" but why he felt the need to continue to do things to intimidate me, I'll never know.  
He looked for my sisters Instagram account and was caught watching her stories and looking at a post of her in a bikini on a beach which disturbed me so much. He's never met her and I didn't even think he knew her name, so how he found her social media is again something I'll never know. 
I've blocked out so much of living with them, I can't remember everything that happened and I wish I could. I ended up getting a new car because I was so scared that they knew what I drove and felt like I was in danger. The car I drove before was my dream car and I am still devastated I had to get rid of it. My anger towards them for everything my boyfriend and I have had to go through is indescribable. My boyfriend became an alcoholic when we moved out of their house due to the trauma of living with them, and they blamed me for his alcohol use. I lost my boyfriend, my car, my ability to feel safe, and also a bunch of my things because they threw my belongings away while living with them. 
How do I get over this? I hate them and I can't get over my anger with them "
524,3,I saw a reel that said your not angry enough and that’s why you’re always anxious. And I realized I NEVER get angry with people but I’ll randomly feel so FULL with anger. I’m trying to figure out how to let my anger out 
525,3,"Always been a little hot-headed (thanks, genetics), but ever since my dad passed, my anger has been on a whole new level. We're talking blackout, say-the-worst-thing-possible, instant-regret kind of rage - over things that, in hindsight, are absolutely ridiculous. Feels like my brain just goes *full send* on destruction mode, and I'm left picking up the pieces after. It's exhausting, and I'd really love to not feel like I need to issue a daily press release apologizing to everyone. Anyone else deal with this? Tips? A punch card for a rage management club? Help.  "
526,3,"You know, I try to be positive, I try and convince myself that I have irrational beliefs, I try and think the best of people. But they keep proving me wrong. They keep making it very hard to believe that they are anything but worthless cruel evil scumbags. I mean look at them, always raising the prices again and again. Greedy selfish pieces of garbage is the definition of this disgusting human race. Mature adults working together to create a world of complete despicable evil. Creating massive class divisions and being cool with families starving. All the while they adore filthy rich celebrities who buy luxury crap instead of helping starving children. Filthy disgusting human vermin! So why shouldn't I be angry?! They deserve all the wrath I can throw at them and much much more. But I need to calm down for my own health. Just be a happy ignorant idiot that goes ""la la la, happy happy."" This is the way to be healthy and positive. I need to be like my cat, just not have a care in the world and just be happy playing with some piece of trash on the floor. But I can't stop being mad! Everyone is so selfish and cruel, I can't stand it!!!"

for some reason i have suicidal thoughts when im angry. -- ive had suicidal thoughts before but that was when i was pretty depressed and generally wanted to end my life and it was all i could think about. 

this though, only happens when im angry/frustrated.. and its a recent change ive noticed. early-mid last year, i dont know what the heck happened to me but i had so much rage inside of me. i would get annoyed at the littlest things and it would build up and id have an ugly outburst .

ofc its tone down since then because i realised i was putting so much anger and stress onto my family for no good reason. so im not as annoyed with everything - which is good. im improving and i got a journal for my birthday a couple months ago and i write whats pissing the hell out of me in that moment and all is well because after a few minutes, ive calmed down. 

but ive realised i sort of repress my anger like... a lot. hm and in the midst of it, i know its dumb. like its so stupid to be mad at this thing????? such a waste of my energy.   

  
yeah most of this probably doesnt make much sense, i was trying to write out me having self inflicting thoughts while angry etc but then it sort of just turned into me remembering all the times i was angry this past year.  

im just disappointed in myself, really. i think i might get a journal to try and get into a more positive mindset, make some good habits.  and see, thinking about it and the future, gets me smiling but i need to actually put in the effort.. commitment.. motivation. or maybe i could just get on meds.. but that cost money and in this economy i dont got it!

528,3,I don’t want to be angry but I find my self getting mad about everything big or small.  I have suffered from depression/anxiety for over a decade and take meds for it.  Not sure if my anger is a result of my depression/ anxiety.  My kids play multiple sports for both travel and school ball.  I find myself angry at the refs/umps or the coaches for the dumbest stuff.  I tell myself it’s cuz I don’t want kids to get hurt but I know it’s not.  I find myself angry when I am not intimate with my wife for a while and I refuse to initiate because I feel like that’s the only reason we are intimate.  I find myself angry at the little things that shouldn’t make anyone angry.  When I feel like my kids have been wronged I don’t think logical I immediately want to burn the world down and cut people out of our lives for minor situations.  I’m going to lose my family if I don’t find a way to fix this.
529,3,"My niece (5yr) is absolutely obsessed with me. I love her but she drives me crazy. I didn’t choose to have kids, i dont have kids. It was your decision to have your kid and now you cant stand your own child but dont put that shi on me, i didnt ask for this. She is just too much. Her parents think its ok to throw her on me whenever they like and i have things to do and enjoy my quiet alone time. I dont have the patience for this noisy creature. She is too loud, almost always sick, invades my bubble and touches all my things. She never gets tired and on top of that she has a very short attention span, so its not like i can just have her play one thing or turn on a movie and im good to go, she gets bored easily of everything and wants to do so many things in a matter of seconds. I am an introvert, can you imagine how that makes me feel? I also hate getting sick and kids are gross. She also always talks in a high pitched voice or yells, i cant. "
530,3,"Everytime I'm furious and blind with rage I notice I'm not the only thing that's raging, if you know what I mean.
Is this normal?"
531,3,"I want to scream until everyone's ears bleed. I want to scream until my throat bleeds. I want to scream until nothing comes out and become voiceless.

I want to bash my head against a wall until it bleeds. I want to bash it against a wall until it breaks my skull. I want to bite something so hard until the thing that I sink my teeth into breaks. I want to break or slam an object against a wall or any hard surface very hard that it crumbles into teeny tiny little pieces. I want to punch and slam my fist into someone's face until it bleeds and breaks. I want to grab someone's head and slam it against a table or a wall really hard, over and over and over again, until they're unconscious (maybe even dead).

My blood boils. My chest is full of rage. My heart pounds and aches. It eats my stomach, leaving me feeling hungry every time I feel upset. My teeth clench to the point of almost breaking. My body visibly shakes. My fists clench tightly to dear life and sweat. My throat tightens. My breathing intensifies. My head heats up and fills up with anger. Even my veins pop out. All or most of these are me fighting for dear life to keep myself in control. Some of which is just from feeling a little bit of my anger (not even it's full wrath) or even just thinking about it.

My body is a cage for all of my rage. It is slowly eating me away, leaving my body to slowly deteriorate with time, with nowhere to go. No amount of physical activity will be enough to get rid of this powerful and merciless monster inside of me. It's only a matter of time before it becomes unleashed into this world, without warning.

I would never ever go around putting my hands on anyone, nor would I ever want to. I would never want to hurt or even want to kill anyone either. But my anger says otherwise. It doesn't care who gets hurt. In fact, it'll do everything it can to inflict as much pain, suffering, and damage as possible. It is anger like no other, and it scares me, knowing that I could snap at any moment (I rarely get angry, which has lead to so much built up anger over the years) and that anyone around me could seriously get hurt."
532,3,"I'm either numb as fuck on SSRIs, or when i havent taken them for a week I get back to being extremely irritable to the point where its getting suicidal.

The best part? I feel emotionless off SSRIs too. I feel nothing except getting irritated. Any normality I felt before is gone, I feel like it's permanent and it happened out of nowhere (1-2 years now). 

It pisses me off beyond measure. I cant get a single fucking break."
533,3,"Both of my parents might have anger issues because they get angry easily. I rarely get angry. However, my anger is so intense and violent (more details in my previous post) that I black out from it (it happened once when I was little and raged and was the only time I remember ever feeling rage)."
534,3,"I am so  tired of not having the emotional maturity to deal with my frustrations. It feels like most of my anger comes from parenting, specifically the fact that you can't just stop when you are burnt out. When you are pushed to your limit you just have to keep parenting. This is what I struggle with the most and I want to develop the resilience it takes to actually deal with my emotions healthily during these times."
535,3,"Hey so I'm currently on a bad situation and I noticed I've been a lot more angry for no apparent reason, so if you have some tips and tricks it would be really helpful, I always find the same, get away from the problem or breathing but I ask because that hasn't worked.
Thanks for reading, sorry for any misspelling."
536,3,Hey I am 30 year old female. I have been angry since a long time. Due to anger I lost the love of my life and now I think I will die alone and now the anger has started my work life too. My family life too I am angry all the time and the only reason my parents haven't given up on me is because they are my parents. Pls can anyone help
537,3,For context I have fibromyalgia which basically means my body is in pain and that makes me just really tense. Whenever anyone messes up even slightly around me I get worked up. Even when I’m alone I just find myself hitting shit and wanting to break shit and scream because of the pain. Idk how to deal with it does anyone have advise for me to deal with it?
538,3,"To add a bit of context, I’m mostly a pacifist. I hate fighting and violence with a passion. I got into a lot in high school and the violence just wrecks me mentally.
So why, pray tell, do I feel nothing but either rage or emptiness. Got into a fight in a WinCo. Stood up for a cashier that was getting slurs thrown at her, and this guy attacks me. So I bite him. And now I have to spend 5k I don’t have to make sure this garbage didn’t have aids or some shit. 
It’s anger or nothing. Why oh gods why am I even here."
539,3,"Hi! I am not 100 percent where to leave this but I ""need"" 24 hours of anger management for court. I was looking for one that's online and self paced. Does anyone know if this site is real? I keep finding websites that people say are scams but only found one person saying bad things about this website. If anyone has used it before for court and know they work, please let me know 🙏 "
540,3,"I struggle with getting incredibly angry and irritated whenever I'm stressed. I get angrier when I can't pinpoint exactly what's stressing me out, and even angrier when I know what is stressing me out and I can't do anything about it. I've tried exercise, I've tried meditation, I've tried volunteering and going out and art and everything. Nothing helps. I'm angry all the time and I want to hit things and break things and be mean. But I can't do that because I know it's wrong so I end up hitting myself and crying because I can't talk to anyone about how angry I am without being told to calm down and to change my way of thinking. No fucking shit I'd love to change my way of thinking! I don't like being like this! And being told the same thing over and over and over again, to just calm down and relax, makes a body want to destroy something. If I could just calm down and relax, don't you think I would have fucking done that by now? I'm beyond tired of being like this. I can't be around people for long before I have to hide away to stop myself from acting out and being stupid and angry. A life time of suppression and doing my best to please others even if it's not good for me has led me to this, I think. And now, ironically, I get so angry with myself for wanting to be selfish and do what I want and what makes me happy without judgement and criticism. Anger sucks."
541,3,"I play games sometimes, which is mostly playing monster hunter. I find it fun until i reach a part of the fight with a monster where it gets very annoying to try and stay calm. this makes me very enraged, and I say I'll quit and never play ever again. but after a child of days in my free time, I miss the gameplay a bit and the style of the game. it makes me confused if I should try again or just leave, because I know there's a chance if I try again I get angry. I'm very confused. "
542,3,"Wasted another day cleaning up the messes others left through their incompetence: lost USPS Express package cost me $2,500, incorrect order fulfilment, wasteful employees, unresponsive consultants, etc.

I pay all of these people well and do not short change anyone, why is it so difficult for them to perform the tasks they are hired to do?

I have so many important things to do and so many people that count on me I can't possibly efficiently handle all these tasks but it seems that in this current world people don't honor their commitments and it really has me down and pessimistic about the future, not sure what to do.  One mistake is fine, 10 per day is overwhelming but it's becoming the norm, any advice is greatly appreciated! 🙏 "
543,3,Idk where to ask for help with this. I've already done this ages ago but I'm not getting better. Do I have a rage problem? Whenever I see someone being an asshole online weather is youtube or twitter or here on Reddit... I just have to respond. I have to tell them how bad they are. Then it turns into this whole thing. I'm so tired. I don't want to do this anymore. Whats wrong with me? I can't stop fighting. I need to accept people are just assholes and there's nothing I can do about it. I need to ignore them but I just can't do it but this isn't a good life. I say the wrong things then others jump in calling me a pathetic asshole and oh jeez
544,3,Sometimes I get so angry want punch a wall. I get angry and frustrated that most people have life better than me and had family actually caring about them.And frequently lash out on people no reason. 
545,3,"For context; I am a Freshman Year in College (20M) and so far Im doing well. Recently, I recalled some stupid things I did back in my Senior Year and it was a presentation about a topic.

It was in groups, so me and my group did the presentation and what we are gonna present. The day came and but I was also tired; didn't had sleep and I've had family problems over the past days. I never had anyone to talk to about it.

Anyway, the Presentation came and this group of boys was making so much noise and had their phones in loud volume while they were playing meme videos. Their behaviour was disruptive and boisterous, my teacher did tell em' to stop (because he's known to be very nice and chill, never gets angry) the problem was their age gap between the teacher was around 5 years. So imagine a group of boys not listening to the teacher. But anyway, I was so disrespected that no one is listening so I threw an eraser straight at their face and dragged an empty chair outside and said;

""Get the F* out of my classroom if you're not gonna listen.""

Class went silent and they also went silent, I processed my thoughts and I was like ""Oh shit I fucked up my Rep"" so I quickly continued and tried to forget what I did. My teacher told me to chill out and I apologized in the middle of the presentation. The classroom was dead silent on the whole lecture and later on, I apologized to the group of friends but some of my classmates said ""I wasn't wrong"".

Technically, these group of friends already pissed some certain teachers My History teachers slammed the Whiteboard because they were sleeping, They were also caught cheating in a Quiz and their paper was torn apart and got a 0, and its too many. But like I said, I don't know what came over me and I didn't get in trouble either. But I was just recommended to my Guidance Councellor and told me I could've addressed their behaviour better.

This is just a rare instances of my outbursts, but I've been seeking help even before this incident.

546,3,"My mom plans to give me a roommate when I'm in college but I want to be alone since I know and I'm aware of my own attitude and personality. If I get irritated or see small mistakes I lash out of people and would resort to over the top violence. I'm scared of it myself, I'm scared of what I can and will do. What to do? "
547,3,"Hello all,
My 12 year old son has been angry since 7 or 8 years old. He often seems angry from just asking him a question, and God forbid you interrupt him during an activity or try to enforce consequences. Can anyone in the UK recommend anger management courses or therapists for children? "
548,3,"It's very hard for me to talk about but I have to ask. Please forgive me if this post is really short. I was at an anime convention last year, I decided to put on some body spray but I was scoldingly told not to. I bit my tounge and put it away but I don't understand why I was so incredibly angry about it. I couldn't help but imagine great violence against this person. Most likely just a coping mechanism unfortunately. I didn't want to be angry, I think I might have known it's not worth but I still couldn't handle it. This is incredibly painful for me to remember. I'll explain more if it's needed. "
549,3,"I swear I want to beat my sister’s boyfriend’s ass. This mf is 21 and does nothing but game on his pc. I get it. I game too. But this mf is mouthy as shit. He’s a real keyboard warrior. I swear. He’s a controlling prick. He manipulates my sister to depend on him. Him and my sister been living with my mom and me. We get into an argument that caused them to move out. He called his dad. He said something mouthy to my mom when he walked out the door. I said “wtf you say mf!” He kept walking. His dad then came up and tried to scare me and my mom inside our OWN HOME. I walked right up to his bitch ass and said “WTF YOU GONNA DO, BOY” His dad looked scared as shit. Then he turned around and called me and my mom “trash” meanwhile my sisters bf was threatening to call the cops on me. Haha. When I get mad like I am idgaf. Call the cops. I’ll make going to jail worth it and I’ll fucking feel good about it. Fuck that mf. I’ll beat his fucking face in. He disrespected my mom and believes he didn’t at all. He believed he was being disrespected. I fucking hate narcissistic lying bitches. I fucking swear. I’ll smack him upside his fucking head. He called me and my mom “pathetic” in a text. Idgaf what he calls me, but he shouldn’t disrespect my mom like that after she let him live with her for a year. He judges us for being on food stamps and called us leeches. Meanwhile him and my sister use the EBT card. He also made my mom apologize to him. My mom only apologized because she wants to see her grandson. How fucking shitty of a fucking person is this? I fucking swear. I’ll go to fucking jail and make it worth.

I want to bitch slap this mf so bad. Some people need their ass beat. He is nothing but a fucking punk. I’ve done more than he did at his age. All this mf ever did was sit on his fucking pc his whole life and have this big “gamer” attitude online. 

Help me find reasons not to fuck this guy up

This nigga ain’t nothing but a fucking punk ass bitch"
550,3,"I've been thinking about this for a while but I guess never asked anybody about it. A few weeks ago, I had a huge angry outburst in my room, crying and screaming into my pillow and hitting/throwing anything that wouldn't be damaged for around an hour straight; all because I forgot to sign up for the options I wanted for this semester. It was an easily fixable problem, all I had to do was email the vice-principal, who usually gets back to me within a day, and would definitely be willing to fix my issue. I knew that for most of the time I was breaking down, and yet I just couldn't stop. It felt like someone else was controlling me. I don't think I had a ton of stress on me at the time, either. I don't know why this would've happened, because usually I'm able to collect myself within a few minutes, or at most, maybe half an hour, unless it's a major problem. It was just really strange"
551,3,"Can anyone relate? : When I’m upset, I get angry after the initial sadness goes away. Then I really want to break something or hurt someone. Like bash someone’s head into a wall or stab someone. Not a specific person, but I just want to. I know that I could/would never do it, and that feels worse than a person who goes into a “blind rage” and hurts people by accident. It’s the opposite. I WANT to be violent. I used to cut myself and I’ve quit mostly successfully, so it could be misplaced anger. But I used to feel this way before too (just not as much)."
552,3,"Even when i was in the best physical health eating right, drinking water, exercising and taking time for myself and others. I was still depressed and irritated at the smallest things.i still get irrationally irritated at the smallest things. Feeling depressed even though i did everything in my power to feel the greatest.

 So if there's anyone out there that feels frustrated from their mental health not following their physical health your not alone. "
553,3,"I think there's no reason but it could be my brain trying to block that reason out like its done my entire life. I just wanna break or punch something so bad but I don't wanna scare my cats. I just feel so filled with rage, I hate this. "
554,3,"I'm going through a lot in life right now. Recently divorced, getting rejected a lot, figuring myself out, took myself off my anti depressants, etc. I'm trying to be more authentic, and that includes being open about my emotions, at least until I can learn to let things go on the fly, which I'm not expecting to come quickly. 

    Anyway, it was break time at work. I went to the break room to grab my snack from the fridge. My coworker was also grabbing something and started to close the door. I gently (from my perspective) grabbed the door handle with two fingers to show I needed to get into the fridge. My coworker gives me a disgusted look and asked why I snatched open the door from him. I tried explaining that wasn't the case and I just needed to get into the fridge, and he started raising his voice. 

    At this point, I lost it. I'm so tired of people telling me what I'm feeling like I don't know. I understand I can't control how other's see me, and I'm working towards accepting it. But this keeps happening (minus the outburst), and I have no idea what's going on. I'm trying to be open to the idea that I've been in the wrong, but how could my understanding of my own emotions and the world around me be that skewed? "
555,3,"I feel like I'm suffocating. Everything sets me off. Someone giving me a weird look or just making simple eye contact with me for a split second makes me irrationally angry. I haven't always been this sensitive. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

At school I just want to grab my classmates by the neck and start beating their heads into the desk, or start doing the same to myself. I am genuinely enraged most of the time, and I want to stop feeling like this because it is ruining my life at the moment."
556,3,"A few months ago, I was dating a close friend of my two best friends. He did not treat me very well when we were together, and he broke up with me in a not very nice way. My two friends are still friends with him, which bothered me a lot. I talked to them about that and they said that they understand how I feel, but they are still continuing to hang out with him, and they talk to him about his new relationships. I am trying to accept that I can’t change whether they are friends with him at this point, but I still feel frustrated about the situation every time I hang out with them. I would rather not feel this way, as it is quite exhausting, but that’s of course easier said than done. Any advice?"
557,3,"I can get angry for 4+ hours straight and i end up throwing,punching,kicking things and i just cant control how angry i am. The outbursts can have legitimate reasons like someone gettin over on me or messing with my life or work or it can come out of nowhere. I can be irritated by the tiniest thing or the biggest thing. i dont calm down until the feeling of rising or heat from inside goes away am i the only one or does anyone else get this angry? I thought i had it under control for a while for about half a year but recently its been every couple months to every couple weeks to almost every other day now.

(Before anyone says anything yes ive been to therapy multiple times nothing they try to teach works so i stopped going and im against prescription medications i think its a waste of money and doesnt solve the problem)"
558,3,I've been generally okay at keeping my anger in for the last 3 years but lately I'm noticing that I'm just a fucking asshole to people. They make a mistake or say something that's kinda dumb and I just can't help but react strongly and be a dick about it and I don't know why. It just feels like everyone is either really stupid or trying to piss me off most of the time. I've really been trying my best to be a good and helpful person IRL but online I easily blow up. Does anyone have any idea why and/or what I can do? I don't want to hurt people with my anger but I do it anyway and I hate it so much.
559,3,I’m a teenager with massive anger issues and I can see it effecting my well being. I’m easily irritated and always bottling up my anger.

560,3,"For context, I have two brothers I currently live with, both younger. Lately I've been, as they say, 'crashing out,' so badly that my dad took away my phone. It's like I can't even show my emotions.

And when I was sick yesterday, my brothrs were thankfully kind enough to serve me an apple with oranges and a yogurt. Some healthy stuff right?

As said before, I'm sick. So...I barely ate! I just simply sat it aside because I planned to eat it later. I fell asleep.

Fast forward I wake up, take care of myself, and bam. Massive headache
 Can barely sit down or stand up. It's almost as if I have a concussion. I try to rest.

(Anyways)

One of my brothers decided it'd be nice to mess with a sick person. He hit me. Just because I didn't give him his candy he gave to ME for valentines day. I ate a little and coughed on it prior, not knowing he'd ask. I calmly explain to him, since he's 8. He hits me. I calm myself down, saying in my head that he has ADHD and Autism. I calm down. I explain again, this more firmly, I'm sure you can guess what happened.

He hit me. I crashed out.

I hit his back so hard my hand hurt, he screamed, and that's where I had my phone taken.

Today, my brothers hit me so much I broke down in pure anger. Crying while yelling. They call me a baby, so I tell them how much I sacrifice for them. I didn't eat, drink, I barely slept, it's hard for me. The headache is back. I scream at them how much I want to hurt them, and ways I'd hurt them. It's ridiculous considering I'm the oldest kid at this house. But it's too much. 


How do I control my anger?

561,3,"A lot of times when my boyfriend gets angry about things he hits something or breaks something. He recently was mad about something going wrong on his Xbox so he broke his headset and controller and almost broke his $500 console. In the past he’s broken at least 3 tvs, a console, a vacuum, a couple phones, headsets and controllers. It’s not an everyday or every week thing but it’s often enough that we have lost a lot of money because of him breaking things. I’m not sure what to do to help him if I brought it up he’d probably just get mad and not listen to me. He acts like it’s a normal thing bc he’s done it forever and his mom has acted like that’s just how he is and you can’t do anything about it. It really upsets me because we also have 3 kids and I really don’t want them to grow up thinking it’s okay to just break things when we’re mad bc that’s what dad does. I’m not sure what to do or if there’s even anything I can do bc he probably doesn’t want to get help. Or maybe I’m just overreacting I know a lot of guys break things but I didn’t think it’d ever be to this extent. Anyone here have anything helpful that’s maybe helped them or others they know?"
562,3,Any one else just get into a blind rage over the stupidest stuff and then get even angrier at yourself for how stupid it is and then all you can be is mad for being mad and everything is stupid and pointless? 
563,3,"I majorly only rage when gaming. But I hate it when little things don't go the right way. It pisses me off so bad I end up breaking random shit.
I've broken like 2 laptop displays in rage, I'm trying my best not to rage anymore but it's very hard and I'm scared at the fact that I might break my laptop display again

564,3,"Just lately feel angry at my life and people/society in general this week. Sure some good things did happen like me getting interviews for better jobs as I desired but I still feel upset over other factors such as having my time wasted on bullshit interviews for fake MLMs or Devil Corps. I also had my car in the shop for half a week only for me to have to pay $90 to diagnose the vehicle without fixing it (because the shop wanted to charge me $150 for a ""smoke test"" before giving me a full diagnosis as I asked for before). Then when I went to the shop today the dickhead decided to close early before I could get my car from these fucking shady money grubbing assholes. On top of that I also had to deal with more stress working with and talking to my dad today (but that's been a thing for most of my life and sadly he is probably a strong reason I struggle with anger to this day). I feel so damn frustrated and tired of life that I honestly ask myself why tf do I just keep waking up to this instead of doing some shit like blasting myself to be done with this bs forever. I'm aware that is a permanent action for a ""temporary"" feeling but those ""temporary"" feelings keep coming up in my life over and over to the point it feels like it'll never end. Anyway...just wanted to vent on here because like the rest of yall on here I am angry and it feels difficult to live like this. I know it can possibly get better but the anger gets so real to the point it feels like it'll never stop too."

I'm so self destructive, anything that upsets me brings out the worst in me. I can't live with this anymore, I need help. I can't just break everything around me when I get mad, I can't just hurt myself to keep me from breaking things. i want to be better, I want to change but I cant. I'm scared of ruining the relationship I have with my partner because they had to see this side of me. I'm scared of ruining my relationships with my family. I'm scared of losing my job because I can't handle stressful situations. I'm scared I'm gonna hurt myself or someone I love because I can't control my anger. I hate myself so much, I hate everything about myself. my anger, my slothfulness, my over friendliness to others, I hate that I can't do a simple task when I want to because I don't have the motivation and get overwhelmed over the slightest difficulty. I get into arguments with my dad and it always gets heated, and it happened this morning and it was about cleaning my room, and I crushed the entire bag of chips and pack of Oreos I just bought and poured them in the trash, why? I don't fucking know, it just happened and I saw how much of a monster I am, how terrible my anger has made me, I'm unintentionally torturing myself and when it doesn't work I resort to using psychedelics to give me an ""answer"" but now I realize I just really love to dissociate because it's the only time I'm ever at peace and that means I can't do that anymore, I don't want to because I do want to and when I don't find answers I'm just regretting everything and breaking down

life is so frustrating"

At first, I would try to explain her very sweetly but she somehow always seemed to not really pay attention to it or doesn’t really care about what I’ve just said to her. If I said it today, she would ask me about it the next day. Second times are still alright. I still have my patience and will try my best again to hammer into her head. But at third or fourth times, my tone usually shifts to a much more unfriendly one and she would notice it and doesn’t bring up about it anymore. I know that it’s my bad and I would always feel afterwards but during that time, l always feel like she cannot comprehend the very basics. I would always tell her and try to explain her questions in a very, very basic words that even a four years old can understand. But I think it’s not her fault and it’s on me. I feel like I’m being a dick. I’m just not patient enough with my Mummy and I want to learn how to. I love my Mum. She’s old. She’s going to be a frail little woman in a few years and I don’t want to treat her like this. I want to be an extremely patient person when I’m with her.

(Maybe it’s just genes but I would love to let you all know that both of my parents are very quick-tempered but they are very kind and very patient with their kids just not so much to others so just wanted to know if I picked up my parents’  habits)"
571,3,I have been angry since I was a kid .. sometimes it gets bad depending on the situation of what makes me mad ... I'm always thinking of the past & everyone that hurt me .. & everytime I tell my story to someone I thought I trusted they turn against me or do the same as what others did to me or make me feel like im crazy ..I feel like I have nobody to talk too... I'm constantly yelling at my kids when they don't deserve it also they like to push my buttons even if I try to do gentle parenting they take avantage of it & turn bad shit crazy nor more rude towards me infront of others which I explode right in front of others... some people tell me to calm down which makes me even more angry... once things get me really really mad I'm already screaming my head off even at my kids ... some people that are around me get tired of me yelling... I wish people can understand how hurt am I deep inside ... is there really hope for me to change my 10 year old is picking up on how I react .. I'm scared to create a toxic household 
572,3,"I've seen a lot of people online say, that you're always in control to stop the anger before the switch flicks. But personally it's almost like a 0-100 when there's a trigger, there's no buffer time to catch it early. It feels just like what used to be more paralyzed panic attacks for me when younger, those just became anger attacks as I got older. I genuinely get tunnel vision in an instant, I boil over in a matter of split seconds despite I was smiling just seconds ago, I scream, I punch, i hit my head against the wall, I lose all track of the consequences of my words and actions. And once it's over I barely remember the incident clearly. I only remember this small window in the tunnel vision of the object I was focused at. And I feel guilt. Immense guilt. It calms down just as quickly as it starts. Just 100 back to 0 in an instant, suddenly i want to apologize to everyone and everything and hide in a cave for a month believing I don't deserve people even talking to me.

I just think blackout rage is a very real thing. I am working on it, seeked therapy, and I definitely do not think the way I act is okay in any way. But I think some people genuinely just lose all control and consciousness because it puts them in a fight or flight mode, and I've seen people not believe that something like IED is real, while it describes the way I feel and act really well."
573,3,"I wouldn't really call myself an aggressive guy I'd say I can get annoyed easily but I just keep it cool. However whenever I do get angry I just play funny videos in hopes that I smile and feel better. If it doesn't work then I just drink. I don't even set myself a limit I just drink until I feel my throat swelling. Even tho I respect therapists and stuff cuz I do understand what they're trying to do, I hate therapy cuz every time I've talked to an adult or whatever it was always ""Go on a walk"" ""Go to sleep"" ""Think about what you can do"" ""Do this and get back to me"" ""Let it go"""
574,3,"I had a BPD meltdown last night which probably gave me brain damage.

Not that I don’t deserve it.

I just woke up from a decent bout of head hitting, In a fit of rage, I punched myself in the right temple until it hurt to open my mouth. This is common behaviour for me when I feel overwhelmed or angry and need to get the emotions out. Well I’ve been hitting myself consistently like this for a couple days. Now it’s around 4:30am and immediately upon waking I had brief nausea, excessive sweating, and a migraine directly behind my eyes. It’s worn off a bit now but I know it’s gonna pick up again as the day goes on. Lights have become too bright in recent days and it hurts my head. It’s hard to focus but I think that’s just me being me. I don’t want to waste a clinics time if it’s nothing, but is there any way I can test at home if I’m concussed or just a bit out of it or overstimulated. Usually I can bounce back but I’ve noticed this time is harder to stay awake, and I’m fatigued all day. Also I’m mad at everything right now. Like seeing red and kicking shit type mad at any sound or sight. I deserve to feel this way, in pain and angry all the time. I’m such a piece of shit. "
575,3,"You know when you feel that intense heat all over your body, when you start shaking, when your heart starts pounding ... when you know for sure you're going to explode? What can I do in those few seconds to diffuse my anger before I explode? "
576,3,"I struggle a lot with anger against my dad. My mind keeps playing over and over memories of hurtful things he's done or said. My dad has three sides: the nice guy side, the jerk side, and the side where he's driving me up a wall by telling me what to do even though I'm 39. I get angry just at the sound of his voice or if he gives me unwanted advice or tries to control my choices. He has also expressed anger throughout the years whenever he sees interracial couples, and now when I see an interracial couple I get angry and replay what my dad taught us over the years. He was a jerk and a disapproving control freak, yet he didn't help me at all to have direction in my life, never taught me how to do well in college so I failed, never helped me pick a career path and now I hate my career, never taught me how to pursue a woman and so I failed with so many."
577,3,"So I(21F) have always had a short fuse when I comes to getting angry. Nothing to awful, but I can get angry quickly. I haven't punched a wall or thrown anything but my mouth and attitude have gotten me in trouble. My (21) Boyfriend has pretty bad anger. Not only does he get mad quickly but he also punches walls, throws/breaks things etc. Well we have a now 7 month old. From October-Novemeber I had made him go to his families because his anger and frustration with our baby was getting out of hand. He is a stay at home dad so I understand getting frustrated but it was getting bad. He wouldn't hurt her or anything, but he was breaking the stuff that I pay for/have to pay to fix. Well he came back home and since then, his anger has gotten alot better. He still gets frustrated but definitely not to the extent it use to be. Lately I've been feeling like I have taken on that anger. I don't punch anything or anything like that but I've had the urge to quite a bit. My daughter has been making me frustrated much easier than before. I think I have a control on my anger for the most part. But I have started yelling alot. Every little thing sets me off. It genuinely hurts my heart when I've calmed down cuz I've never been like this and I don't know how to feel. I really don't want my anger to get as bad as his was. 
I just feel kind of lost lately. Wondering if this is somewhat normal or what..?"
578,3,"I cannot stand to be at work because every single thing my boss does infuriates me. He sucks his teeth before he starts speaking, eats loud crunchy snacks like apples and cucumbers, asks me stupid questions that he could easily find the answer to himself, etc. Hearing his pants swish when he walks through the office pisses me off. I hate when he tries to read something on my computer and sticks his face like 2 inches away from my screen. He constantly has 50+ tabs open and then doesn't understand why his computer is acting weird. He doesn't know how to properly download files or attach them to emails. He will literally have a spreadsheet open on his computer and ask me to open the same spreadsheet just to delete a column for him. He'll write something up for me on paper, and then READ it to me when he brings it to my desk. It makes me want to scream, ""I CAN FUCKING READ, JUST PUT THE PAPER DOWN AND WALK AWAY."" It's so bad that as soon as I see his truck in the parking lot, I roll my eyes and get stuck in a terrible mood until I finally get to clock out and go home. His existence bothers me to no end and it makes me feel like a huge asshole. Why is this happening and how can I shift my mindset so that he doesn't bother me so much?"

This was in July of 2024

I was texting my friend, and this guy started texting me, and I looked at his profile he was 25 i was 12, and I even told him that, and he texted me, ""Age is just a number"" and I texted no and he started harassing by spamming my phone and he called me i answered and he said ""show me your beautiful face"" and I said ""I don't know you your 25 and I am 12"" and I blocked him


Another time, I had Instagram, and this guy followed me on Instagram and started liking my photos. I was 12, and I was kinda uncomfortable with him liking my photos, so I texting him this, ""How old are you?"" He said,""I'm 32 beautiful""  I texted back and said ""Ewww I'm 12"" and blocked him"
580,3,"i have anger issids since i was a kid, i spent countless hours in therapy and got extremely better, to the point that some of my friends wouldn't believe that i ever had these issues... but as you probably know anger can only fade, not vanish, and if in the past i would get angry in social  context, now i do in private, obviusly for the stupidest things: losing at a game, not finding s good font for an essay, a simple glitch on browser, not finding a good word for my poems or whatever.

when this happens i scream, bash things around or even punch/bite myself (fortunatly not strongly enough), but i'm tired of it, fully, i came to the point that i cant play ang game or do anything at all because i know i will get angry.

now i cant afford therapy so i don't have the professional help i would need, so let me ask you: how would you deal with it, knowinf that i don't really want to quit gaming and stuff? thanks in advance :)"
581,3,"Me and ex had an off and on relationship. we are broken up now for a year, and he has a new girlfriend, and he looks way happier we her than me and I can't stand it he takes more photos with her, kissing her more, hugs her more, cuddling more, he even kissed her infront of the teacher. And I am sad"
582,3,"For context my mom and dad have always hit me ever since I was a child. Overtime cps came, my dad changed for the better but my mom got worse and developed mental illnesses after. 

During all of this I decided to take the roles as peace making for sometime. I would try to keep my anger in check but it would always end up with me getting beat up whenever I try to act like an adult in the situation. 

So eventually over time I gave up and I became more resentful about my home life so times I would hit and say hurtful things. I regret it and apologize afterwards but tonight I really fuck things up and I dint know how I'm ever going to forgive myself or move past this. 

So my dad bought me and my sister the same underwear packs and when me and sister brought up the concerns about us possibly mixing up underwear he dismissed it so I decided I would keep a watching eye of things under the time being. Today I forgot to and my mom basically tried to figure out which is which and took and after failing to figure things out we decided that the both of us were not comfortable using either, especially because of my history of swelling down there and us not wanting to break boundaries us just not wanting to So we decided to throw those underwear's , my mom got mad and started yelling and I told her we don't want to risk any problems in the future with thoe underwear's and not make each other uncomfortable and my mom decided to not listening and told us to just give each other the underwear's and use them. She took them from my hand and I kept on telling her the reason to after I did something I regret. I hit her on her shoukder so she could listen and she got mad and things turned more physical. 

I know im in the wrong and I told my friends about it and they also agreed that I'm in wrong. I just feel so bad. 

I feel evil and I'm scared to apologize. 

I tried everything to be a better manage my anger but the more I stay in this house, the more I stay with her the more anger I get and I just can't mature forever and I hate that. Why can't I just be smart why can't I just act right. 

I dont want to hit her it just makes me like her and I hate that and I don't want to be her. 

I hate this. "
583,3,"I don’t want to get too into it because i don’t feel like making this a rant. I just don’t know how to calm down my anger and be nice to people who look down on me. I’m battling the urge to tell strangers online to unalive themselves, and i know the world would be better without them existing in it. But that’s not who i want to be. I want to be kind. Does anyone have tips for not getting so angry? How do i calm myself down? Because i still want to try helping them find the right path. But its just difficult when their current path is so hateful and for no good reason. "
584,3,"I have a lot of built of anger/resentment bottled up towards a lot of people, starting with my family, leading to my coworkers and ending with my boyfriend. I think Im at a point that I need serious help. Can anyone help me?"
585,3,I got so much going on and no one cares. no one takes the time to understand or ask me anything they just tell me and that’s it. I have so much anger because of it and I have to smother it or I get screamed at . 
586,3,"I'm 19 years old and a few months ago I realized I have very horrible anger problems . When I was younger people used to tell me I had it but I used to think they were gaslighting me . Which they were but I thought It was always because my environment I used to act the way I did. Mostly because of the people I was raised by and how horrible they were. All these years later and I feel like I'm just a bomb full of rage. Ironically, if you were too meet me in real life you would never know unless you ticked a switch. Which I've worked very hard to bury deep down. Like do deep down to where in situations I don't know how to react or know which emotion to react with . Everything makes me so angry it seems like. But I feel like everytime it's justified in a way . Like I don't just get mad for no reason, I feel like .The number one thing is humans. Really that's the only thing. Some more than others depending on the day. The only thing that really helps me is my girlfriend and doing stuff I like and her putting me onto weed. But then her family hits every target for what ticks me off and I can't remove her from her situation until she moves out so I have to deal with her stupid family and sand step dad who's so so sooo close to getting put in the ground for what he did to her. That's one of my problems. I can't let things go no matter how long ago it was and I have memory problems so if someone accuses me of doing something I couldn't tell them for sure if I did it or not . I genuinely don't like getting mad. I can proudly say I'm a very moral human being (lol even though I just said not so nice things up there.i know I know ....)But as soon as I get mad all that goes out the window and not to sound edgy but I literally turn into something below a human. I hate ignorant people . Like people who deliberately and in deliberately do things without critical thought or who are stuck in there own ways even when it's wrong, especially if your an adult . For instance like a trump supporter. I hate narcissists, extremist, liars and people who have no sympathy. And also Christian's telling me I'm going to hell because I don't believe in there god. Any religions really. And conspiracy theorists. And social media. Now that one genuinely destroys my brain. Hate, rasicm, propaganda, just arguing to argue not to solve any problem just pure nonsense. Somebody like me I can not do social media. One time I payed 500 dollars to fly out and go and shoot and rob this worthless trash if I even dare call human maybe a rat for acting like he's some top human . The only thing that stopped me was my friend telling me think about the future .I really wanna move far away from society where there's peace and quiet. I can just smoke and live with my wife while chasing our dreams . But I can't do that I would  have to think about my children yknow ? Like give them the opportunity to experience the world and form their own opinions and not to mention my girlfriend . She says she wants what I want but I think she's just trying to make me happy and I don't want my way of wanting to live to get in the way of her dreams . Does anyone have any huge tips to make me stay in my normal self. Because even some days god forbid what I'm about to say ever happens even when I try to picture it I just think of shooting my self me hitting the love of my life over a argument even though me and her have never once got into a argument. We are actually pretty mature for our age. But I nightmare for me is me hitting her. She doesn't even know I have anger problems, really no one except for the people I was raised by. So I just wanna know how I can cool this problem."
587,3,"thsi is short because im crying  rn but whenever I get angry I go insane like I bite myself and scream and rip up books and startt crying. I justdid this a few mintues ago and I want to relapse now so bad my arms feel tingly like o want to cut myself again. 

I do this usually when I get mad andd itdk what’s up with me I tried taking anger yests online but they don’t fucking tell me abyrhing the questions r always like “do you yell at your friends??lol” and the image is of someone shouting like no you dumb fuck o don’t that’s the issue.idk if this issue is real ornot 
whenever I throw things I don’t feel any remorse or baything and then the anger just goes away like that and I feel so bad but icant do anything about it

Im so fucking sick of this idk what’s wrong with me. If nay yof you fuckers make fun of me in the comments I swear ito fucking god. know it’s wrong and I look insane you don’t need to fucking remind me or make fun of me sounding edgy im very aware of that and i already hate myself so you dont need to tell me
"
588,3,"So I just snapped and yelled at people (my throat is sore that's how I yelled) over something kinda minor and I don't even know why I reacted this way.

This I logged in and blocked 3 of my oldest friends.

Why? Idk really.
They like me but I don't like them back the same way? .....I think? Maybe because I feel I don't deserve them? Idk I need therapy but can't afford that so guess I will implode and shoot myself one day."
589,3,"I spent so much of my life redirecting all of my anger at myself. It felt good to be able to lash out so easily, even if I was the one at the receiving end of it. Now, when I'm angry I can't tell myself I'm a waste of life or whatever. And that's undeniably a good thing and has improved my life in so many ways.

But now I don't know what to do with my anger. It just kind of sits with me and festers. Sometimes I hate people so much that it scares me. But it feels like I have no other choice than to hold onto those emotions. "
590,3,"ever since i can remember I cry when I'm angry not because of Im sad at the same time I literaly can't hold it and worst part of it people think I am crying because Im sad and depressed and I can't tell them Im crying  not because Im sad or something I cry because literally ım bout to break you into 1000 pieces and I hold myself and my body Literally turns on the alarms , I dont know why I cry as I said its a phenomenon I experience since I know myself , what u guys think bout it"
591,3,"Im angry everyday. 
Im angry in the morning through to night. 
Yes there are periods of the day where I can get a brief moment of peace and forget sure but I’m angry more often than that. 
When I get angry or “can feel the anger building” however you’d like to phase it, I can literally feel it. I don’t know if this is something that happens to everyone as I don’t know a lot of angry people other than myself or if it’s just me. 
I’ve had this ever since I was a child and I’m now twenty two, I’ve never really thought about it/ let it worry me until now in my adulthood. 
I can feel it in my arms mainly, like a frustrating tense tingling sensation, but I can feel it everywhere. My legs my chest, from my fingertips to my toes. 
And this feeling if anything makes me more prone to lash out and be violent. 
It’s the MOST frustrating feeling I’ve ever had. 
And now I’m aware of it unlike I used to be, I can constantly feel it. Even when I’m “not angry” and now it begs the question, am I always gonna feel like this? Angry?
I’m already trying my hardest to sort my anger out for the betterment of my relationship and my unborn children before it’s too late and I feel like this is the first thing i need to address. 
Unfortunately there’s not really a lot of information on this feeling I’m having on the internet it’s mostly saying maybe I have high blood pressure which I don’t. 
I’d just like to find out if this is something everybody has or some people have and what’s the best way to deal with it. 
"
592,3,"Tis happened to me, a kid called ""flourish"" raged over a 1 day roblox ban and said f mobile players, I was a mobile player and I got really angry at the kid, I called him a slur and told him to die, which was too far, I posted this in r/youngpeoplediscord to make people make fun of him, but instead, people came to me and the tables turned, so I got permanently banned in the subreddit and I couldn't go back, and right now I'm managing my anger issues, hoping to not attack anyone for small reasons again."
593,3,"Hey all , I dont really know what am I writing now but I ll do it anyways and see what happens. im F 31 , and I kinda down know what  to do with 3  major flaws in my life. Anger , short temper being aggressive when things going out of control. I was always accusing myself for everything, but Im coming from a family where my mother  was drinking since im like 12 and I was getting really bitten by my father and mom for years..Both were screaming , we never had a real conversation. Thats the only thing I ever learnt to do. That. Was the only thing I ever saw. I knew that this is not what I want from my life.  I  am doing breathing  techniques and yoga and I seeing a therapist too the last two months . I came out of a 2 years relationship last November with someone I  still of course really love and care about ,  but he also had a similar childhood so as you can imagine we both had some serious demons coming out. When we were fighting  he was so unfair and nonsense sometimes , I got so upset I physically attacked  him. I hate my self for that. I dont want to shout , I dont want to black out and become my mother , neither my father. I’m just lost with the right way to manage these feelings 
Thank you for any advice ✨"
594,3,I keep asking myself this and I can’t quite figure out why. Why are you feeling so angry?
595,3,"I never used to be like this. For most of my life I was a pushover. Sure I had self hatred like I have now, and I've always had anger I take out on myself and objects, but never others. But then I was subjected to several years of domestic abuse, I got out of that, I also started ADHD meds, I found myself and my life in complete shambles, years behind all my peers and I've grown so bitter. I take everything as an attack, I'm even lashing out at the person I love the most. I always emphasize that he hasn't done anything wrong, and he understands that and says he doesn't like it but isn't deeply affected. But we both know it needs to change. I keep trying to implement techniques to make myself stop but I still fuck up. 


I NEED TO NEVER ACT THIS AWAY AGAIN. No more screaming rage, no more immediate acting without thinking. Small things trigger this white hot rage and I need help learning how to interrupt before I act. Please, if anybody has any advice, I would very much appreciate it. "
596,3,"Cant fucking do any schoolwork because I hate learning it. I hate spanish I hate the language and the culture but I know those thoughts arent true it just it's easy to learn but I'm just not interested in the subject at all but I have to get the work done to graduate

ive tried showering, aggressive journalling, exercising to get this anger out but its still here. ive even imagined an argument with my friend and let it out there but every time I sit down to do the work it regenerates

how do i get over this emotion to do this?"
597,3,"Basically my friend, he gets so undeniably angry at games of all genres. Fps games I can understand getting angry at but he gets angry, like, REALLY angry at peaceful simulation games and very slow paced games I dont get it. Is this a mental thing or does he really get that angry so easily???? I can't spend time with him because his anger literally reduces the fun I have. I need answers because I don't understand how someone get angry at literally every single game out there..."
598,3,"I always wanted to let it out peacefully and not scare anyone but it’s getting to a point where it’s affecting family, friendships, and relationships.  It gets so bad that people think I’m gonna hit them when in reality I just throw my hands and yell.  I don’t know what to do except just hold it in and wait until I get home but even then it never works.  "
599,3,"In my dreams I am very intensely confrontational and angry, wanted to yell and be mad towards everyone. I don’t know why and can’t think of any real reason to be mad. It’s like this deep feeling I can just tap into on command but there’s no real cause.

I was raised in a household where confrontation was just shouting and swearing. My mother’s anger is unreasonable and easily triggered. As a teen I used to bottle up bad feelings until they exploded but now I’m an adult and have learned to communicate properly. 

But this anger is back. How do I understand or stop it?"
600,3,"Title says it all. How can I let my anger out without destroying stuff or yelling at someone I know? I thought about going to a punching bag maybe. 

I feel like I need some sort of way to hit stuff to let it out. Running or doing push-ups just makes me angrier if I was already angry. 

Any other ideas?"
601,3,"I don’t know if it’s anger, irritability, repressed feelings of sadness guilt etc but I’m fucking tired of it. It makes me lash out for no reason at myself, at my partner, I talk to myself in public when I’m frustrated just because my phone was being too slow and I couldn’t do what I wanted to do. I have nothing to do with this anger I have no idea where it’s coming from I could say it’s from all these different things which is why I’m putting this post into multiple groups because I don’t know what the problem is.
What has helped you guys? I don’t even know why I’m upset but I’m so upset that I’m hitting myself in the head and everytime I feel like this it feels like I could rip open my chest with my bare hands. It feels like something needs out. Thinking about that makes me cry like can’t this just GO AWAYYYY anxiety sadness all of it could be so much more manageable but this feels like a monster it makes me feel like a monster it fucking hurts "
602,3,"pre and post my job switch, in the past few months, I have become way too erratic and unable to control or sometimes even understand my emotions. I have been feeling lonely and thus my mood is often down.
during an argument with my so, I said something which I don't even recall typing cause I was just so angry and blinded. but it was bad just plain bad. i want to stop this impulsive venom spewing which will impact me in a lot of my relationships. any way I can get my mind calmed and in control?"
603,3,"I was bullied in school and even though I’ve graduated hs a year ago I ruminate on everything they said everyday and fantasize about killing them, no distractions or mood stabilizers have seemed to work and I hated therapy, which leaves me feeling like I have no options, how do I get them out of my head"
604,3,"I have been a short tempered person all my life but within the last 2 years I have become an unrecognisably angry person. I’m on sertraline and have been off and on for 3 years since my uncle killed himself and it really messed me up. Sertraline does help me but only surface level ? Like I can feel the anger fueled head rush and high blood pressure but I just tend to shut down however before I was on my meds and if I occasionally miss my meds I go straight back to my angry violent outbursts and I HATE IT SO MUCH. I want to be a friendly kind person and my friends have never been on the receiving end of this they’ve seen me do it but I’ve  never done it to them but the people that are on the receiving end of my angry outbursts are my family and boyfriend and why is that ??? My family has an amazing relationship and always has and my relationship with my bf is perfect (if it weren’t for me) like he is the most calm relaxed least angry person ever in the 4 years we’ve been together I have never ever seen him angry to the point he raises his voice or anything. I have also tried therapy 3 times but it never got me anywhere coz they never understood the extent of my outbursts 

Basically I’m just wondering if I’m alone in being so furious all the time over the smallest things and if I’m just an absolutely awful human who needs to be locked away 
This is so ramble and doesn’t make much sense but


Thx guys if anyone even responds x"
605,3,"I want a goddamn reward

I talked about this the other day and now I'm just angry.

Greek here. I just served a year in the military. By the time I found out how easy it was to avoid the draft, it was too late and I was already in.

Look- forcing someone away from home, isolating them, dictating their appearance, pushing their body to breaking point and forcing them to do menial unpaid labour (might as well be unpaid, that would be less insulting than €8.50 *a month*)- under *any other context*, that would be considered abuse.

I wasn't a very patriotic person before and I'm certainly not now. I've been given nothing in return and I don't want to hear it, the usual garbage about it teaching me resilience or discipline. I also don't want to hear how it's up to me to reward myself because sorry, I'm not the one who ruined that year.

I want f***ing compensation. I want *something* that tells me they see me or I'm appreciated or even that they're sorry. This is not good enough. It's just not. And no, I'm not showing up to stupid reserve drills. If they want to fine me, then be my guest."
606,3,"So this morning, I woke up in a frenzy. Why? Cause I thought I was losing hair. Ik ik. It's not that important, but I'm a girl, so I take that stuff seriously. So I'm already raging around the house, trying to find oils and moisturizer. Whatever I can find. It's snowing where I am, but I also get extremely hot at night, so I opened the window. Well, now that I'm up, it got way too cold, so I proceeded to walk to my window after much needed hair care and closed my window. What I failed to realize was that I left my glasses at the top of the window. Why? idk. That's just where I put them so my son can't reach them. Anywho guess what happened. Guess? I broke my glasses. I was sooooo pissed I fumed. I cursed. Screamed. The works. 😌 I brought my kids out of the room. Told my son not to laugh at my pain. Tried to be as calm as possible. But I still raged. Well, my man is a wonderful man. As I'm raging in the room 😤 taking a hit of my blunt to calm down. Yes, I said that don't judge me. He's in the other room on a youtube video on how to fix them. I shit you not. I'm such an ass. I didn't need to rage like that. Of course I said sorry. I always do this. I know I need to work on this, and I'm trying. I need therapy 😩. This post was really an appreciation post. Does it look like it? idk. But anyway, thanks to my man. I love him 💕 he goes out of his way to make me happy 😊 I don't deserve him."
607,3,"Everyone thinks  I am an easy target. For many, I am just a punching bag to abuse. I can take it anymore. I am tired of holding back and not fighting. I wish I was more aggressive then nobody would pick on me. I don't deserve this. I try not to antagonize anyone but it's no use. There's no point in being civil, especially where I live. You can't reason with animals. "
608,3,"I (16f) feel like I have anger issues. 

Now, this is never a problem around friends or strangers, or even extended family. Mostly just the family I live with. My parents, older brother, and younger sister. 

I get angry over the smallest things. If someone mentions something about what I am wearing or eating, if they ask me simple questions that I don't want to answer, when small things go wrong. I hate it. I hate this part of me but I feel like I cannot control it. I don't feel like I have any reason to feel this way either. It's not like I have any crazy trauma, or even massive amounts of stress. I can't think of any specific triggers, aside from when any of them comment on my body or eating, but half the time that isn't even involved in the situation. I know that I should be able to handle my emotions, but I don't think I ever really learnt how to.

I have been lashing out more I think recently. I will call my siblings names and insult them over tiny things, I tell my parents to leave me alone and get even more mad when they become (understandably) upset over that. I am at a point where I worry that they are beginning to, or already hate me. I can't handle being this way anymore and I want to get better.

My biggest thing at the moment is trying to get to a point where I am able to stop hurting my family because they don't deserve any of this. I want to learn how to control the anger in the moment. I need advice as to how I can stop taking everything out on them.

Therapy isn't an option for me at the moment, as much as I would like for it to be. I also feel like I can't talk to any of them about it until I actually figure some stuff out for myself. 

Any advice at all will be so unbelievably appreciated. I want nothing more than to change and get better. "
609,3,I get so angry over the smallest things and it ruins my day/ makes me want to hurt myself. If one person makes me mad it makes me hate all people and feel so violent. It exhausting and I just wish I was normal
610,3,Idk what to do honestly I just feel anger 
611,3,"Hi guys , i have a lot of mental health issues . And I have some anger issues too. I’m going through a lot right now, struggling with my relationship ( feel like I’m being controlled and he dumps my alcohol out and puts it back where he found it and then I feel crazy like did I drink that?) work issues , my family is toxic and to top it off I lost my older brother / bestfriend to an over dose April 27,2024. I have so much anger in me with everything and I just feel miserable the littlest things trigger me. Like the sound of someone crunching on chips it’s stupid. Are there any work sheets you could recommend? I’m 31 years old and I’m just lost. I also started seeing an actual med doctor hoping he could help me and get me on a mood stabilizer but he didn’t do that and took my other meds away without weaning me off so I just went cold turkey. And right now I have really bad brain fog. I went to my sisters this morning and to be honest I don’t really remember coming back home "
612,3,"What would you do if someone gets angry easy and often. When they do get angry, it's a toss-up what happens. Throwing things at the wall. Trying to rip things. Banging his head on the ground. He's on medication that's supposed to make the anger easier to handle. It really doesn't. All it means is that he can't tell people about his anger or they might talk about increasing his dosage. He will literally go to the bathroom and fix his face so that there is no trace of abnormal distress. No one needs to know anything. It's stupid. Incredibly, incredibly, stupid. I feel at a loss. Anger management was his New Year's resolution. But it never happened. I don't know. Advice?"
613,3,"Currently crying bc of the aftermath, but for as long as I could remember, I’ve always been the sibling that none of the other siblings want to mess with, or get me angry, because of how I get. Going back to a really bad incident my sister (who is 10 months younger) and I were not getting along and one thing led to another, I got super angry and wrecked her entire room, just flipped it upside down. My anger gets to the point of violence, i’ve broken my car window. Put holes in the walls, harmed myself etc. Definitely not proud of everything I’ve done but reaching the age of 16 that stopped when I became really depressed, and stopped caring about my life in the world, and everything, I started smoking weed, and doing a bunch of drugs. Fast-forward to where I am 18 about to turn 19 in a few months. I met this boy and it felt like he just read me we clicked instantly, I really liked him and we end up falling in love. I did not know that I still had such anger issues until we ended up, moving in together, and at our first apartment we ended up in this really huge argument I could not tell you what about for the life of me, but all I know is that it happened again. I just wrecked and destroyed everything that was in reach and in my way. I didn’t care who’s it was what value it had nothing I just got angry, and started breaking everything. After that, I felt super bad, super guilty and we talked through it. Everything was fine, but then it happened again and again and again. After the second or third time, I really told my boyfriend that I wanted to fix it and I wanna work on making myself better, and that he has to be patient with me because he is also not the best person ever when it comes to trying to descalate the situation. Fast-forward we are now 21 my boyfriend, and I both went to living at our parents house for some dumb roommate situation, and we just got into another argument again and I wrecked and broke and destroyed everything in my room. Now I’m sitting here in tears in the middle of the mess. Just wondering. Why am I like this. why can’t I fix it. Why isn’t there anybody I can go to talk about this. I’m such a terrible person. I need help. "
614,3,Not myself or whoever I used to be 
615,3,I told my therapist today that i feel my anger to such a physical point in my body where it feels like i need to itch my brain and it overstimulates because i cant shake that feeling when it happens. (Ps my anger stems from depression long story short) 
616,3,About 2 years ago I lost my dad and a cousin last year. Finding life getting more and more stressful and frustrating I have to leave the room to vent because I hate what I turn into. I was told last year after two blood tests that said I have high cholesterol. Ok my diet has been not that great. I don't smoke I rarely drink alcohol. I did a bit of research that said anger can raise cortisol which in turn raises cholesterol. 
617,3,"I've always grown up as a shy kid which made me incredibly hard to make friends or form relationships. Every friendship I had growing up never lasted long or never went too deep. I've been isolating myself for these past few months because I ruined a friendship and a relationship with my anger issues. I feel like it's my fault why everyone keeps leaving me. This all started with my first break up a few months ago when the girl of my dream told me she wanted to break up so she could focus on herself, only to find out later she lied and was already seeing someone else. That broke me so much and what really brought out my anger. A few months later I got into another relationship, this girl was really nice to me and I hate myself for what I fucking did. She tells me one day she went to a party a accidently hooked up with a dude and told me she was deeply sorry for it. In a fit a rage I called her shit and even began self harming myself right in front of her. We never spoke since but I've been trying so hard to change and become a better person but this rage is like a ghost that haunts me. Anger issue runs in my family as my dad and my older sister has it, my father is more tamed with it but my older sister is a real bitch about it. I am worried I will become like her, I am worried I will hurt other people like I did with my 2nd ex and my best friend. I am worried I'll become worse and shitty person and idk if I'll ever be able to escape it since it's in my blood. Every feeling of anger I feel, I've tried my best to internalize it but eventually it's going to reach a tipping point where I hurt someone or myself. I've been thinking a lot of my Ex's lately with valentines day coming up and I've just been angry at myself with how badly I ruined 2 relationships because of how fucked up I am. My social anxiety has gotten worse and I'm deeply afraid to be with people. Idk who I am anymore. I've been isolating myself so I wouldn't hurt others but the loneliness is overbearing and making me go crazy. "
618,3,"I'm a teenage boy, and obviously teenagers in general experience a lot of emotion, such as frustration and anger. The issue is, most of the anger is directed to myself. I'm angry and upset with myself nearly all the time, and I hate myself further if I take it out on others so I take it out on myself. I yell at myself and cuss myself out in my head, I sometimes deprive myself of enjoyable activities, and I tend to hit myself some times too. I know this isn't a healthy thing to be doing, but I don't know how else to manage it. I never want to have the people around me suffer because I can't control my temper, so I just take it out on myself so they aren't affected and my anger goes away. Am I bad for that?"
619,3,i literally don’t even know how to explain it expect that it makes me act like a child with issues i can’t think i just want to kick and scream and hit things i literally feel like i’m 7. and i can’t calm down to the point like it’s not even just anger it’s physically uncomfortable to feel this way and it makes me want to break down 
620,3,"I have now punched two holes in my wall and I punched a hole in my dresser. Today, I was taking too long on boarding a bus  and I antagonized the driver. I can't remember what he said but he was moderately rude. I sat down and I felt my rage is boiling over. I walked off and then I yelled at the driver and said ""fuck you"". When I stepped outside, I threw a plastic bottle filled with orange juice at the bus. I feel like I am going to really explode and possibly hit someone. When I was on the subway, I wish I had a bat so I could smash all the windows. I wanted to hit one of teenagers on board. What gets me angry is I can't stop thinking about how people hurt me in the past. I can't let it go. "
621,3,"Just like the title says, I am unable to control my anger, no matter if I workout, spend time outside to take fresh air, it always comes back the same way it did before (or worse), as if I didn't take a break from whatever action caused this (mainly online gaming and bad things from the past coming back to my mind).

I literally feel like a bomb about to explode every day when something makes me angry, it's as if no matter what, I couldn't vent it all out.

I came to the point of acceptance, that I will not be able to control it and break something again in the long run.

In the past I ended up breaking through the years many expensive things, and this year 2025 I do not want that to happen again, today though, it almost did hence why I came here.

Although anger is very good for some things (boost of energy, more confidence...) it's also a double filed sword that I am unable to control.

Does anyone relate to this or can give me some advice?

Sorry if my English is a bit weird, it's not my main language."
622,3,"I am not sure but no matter how many times I said to her to keep it down given my interviews are in scedhuele she tried to shout a lot, and shouted like a crazy woman and though I was firefighting , she said get out of the house. I had interview planned and such a lack of support from your own family brought my morale down. 

She said its because I was in her room, trying to get AC. It was so hot, so I just thought maybe it will help as the room was empty but again she started shouting and wailing like anything next day without telling the reason, its like living with an adult child which borderlines a***se

I am feeling down and a bit sick now. I dont even want to talk to her and have rational decision. I just , to have such a horrible person in the house makes it very uncomfortable."
623,3,Why do I get the urge to mutilate stuff for no reason? Also I've said death threats when I was little due to not getting what I wante causing me to snap in anger and retaliate. I used to kill small animals as a child. I just don't get why I wanna tear stuff up so badly. 
624,3,"It was all going smooth for a month and even I thought I was doing well. I had to shift my house and expenses kept on building up and I was under stress. My wife and I had argument and thats where I snapped. My wife is kinda argumentative and has a loud voice, which triggers me a lot, all the time. We had a big fight. I verbally abused her and pushed her around. My anger was so instant, I did not even know how it began. She cried and I slept in a separate room, couldn’t sleep for the night and started repenting for what I have done. I regret the next day for the damage I have caused. Similar situations have occured multiple times . I want to be a good husband.
I want to change myself , my wife loves me so much and I push her away during fights. I thought I was changing but no, It happened so quickly I am not sure where to begin."
625,3,"I am having major issues with my anger just overflowing and losing it. I start shouting, I see red, I can’t hear anything, I’m literally a monster. Between forgetting to take my medicine and trying to maintain a family I feel like every day my life is constant struggle, one little thing can light the fuse and explode the bomb at the same time. I see therapists (solo and couples) but I just can’t figure it out. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m desperate for help, I can’t lose my family.

There are times where I feel like I am doing great, then it all happens again. The worst part is half the time I can’t even remember what I am angry about. My brain can’t hold onto a thought for a second so I can process what just happened. I just feel hopeless. This disease of my brain has made my life so difficult. I just want to be able to not get angry. That’s all I want. "
626,3,"Ive been working retail 4 years and I don’t know. My anger has gotten so much worse. I have had anger issues since I was a kid, being autistic and having a dysfunctional family setting. But I don’t know, my anger didn’t get triggered as easily as it does now. At my job it can range from customers seeing me as a glorified servant boy. Helping people with more money than me, people who are happier than me, seeing happy couples. My patience with old people especially. Im only scared about my anger because when im extremely angry, i’ll snap and say/do bold things. I also just hate waiting on others, especially people who can’t pick something or have to inspect cheaply made customer grade garbage. I can’t really change jobs due to college and im supporting my mom during a divorce. It feels like 50% of my thoughts are so angered centered. "
627,3,I am curious when talking about anger and struggling with anger and rage we often hear alot of it from mostly men who experience it. It is very rare to hear women facing the same problem I am curious how many of here are women here face the same problem as well and how does it impact you? 
628,3,"I am 29F. I have struggled with anger issues since I was a small child related to SA. About 10 years ago I was put on Celexa to manage my depression and anger issues. It helped quite a bit. I still take it to this day but with Latuda. I got in a pickle to where I wasn’t able to get my medication for 3 days. Yesterday, I went to go deposit a paycheck from my part time job. I couldn’t find it anywhere and I needed it to get my meds. Because I hadn’t had them, it triggered my anger and I began sobbing. I went to the pharmacy to try to pick them up anyways and it was $1 more than I had in my account. I left the pharmacy saying to myself “what am I going to do all weekend”. I had a little fit in my car and went on to work. I asked my best friend to pick up my meds and the pharmacy tech asked if I was ok followed up by saying I had a “huge meltdown”. Again, I was crying and questioning what I was going to do. I didn’t feel like it was her place to say those things and it made me even more angry. Anywho, I have little outbursts from time to time and other people always over exaggerate what happens. That leads to a cycle of embarrassment, shame, and the feeling of wanting to end my life because my anger makes me feel less of a human and undeserving of life and love. Does anyone else struggle with this? How do I cope? 

TL;DR I got upset at the pharmacy yesterday and now I feel like I don’t deserve life. "
629,3,"Looking to understand myself better.

Backstory: my husband comes from a different culture that is not time sensitive, and also has very different gender roles than what I am accustomed to. Example, the male partner does not communicate where they go, what time they would come back, or anything really related to where they went. This is strongly cultural, and I have personally seen this play out regularly in other families from the same culture as him.

He has started a new job, and the schedule is changing a lot, also he chose to work nights when I really prefer him to work days as I work days as well, and we could have nights together. 

For example, today, he came home too tired to spend time together in the morning or have breakfast together. After that he went out and had said he would not hang out with his friends, but then did hang out with his friends an extra two hours and did not call or text about that (this has been a frequent point of argument for years - I would just like a notification! So that I could spend time with my friends, or do something else, and not just sit at home, waiting ). And then he said that all of a sudden he did have to work tonight and he would be leaving early (the day before he had said he would cook and drive the kids). 

Then things will come up. For example, one of the days he just ran out in the morning and said oh I have a work interview. Other weekends, he said we would have the whole day together and then on the day of, with no forewarning, he would say oh yeah I’ll be going to work all day today because someone called me and said there’s an open shift.

Sorry for making this so long. I feel terribly triggered when this happens as then I have a total meltdown and cry and sometimes I feel very very intensely angry. I am trying to understand my attachment to schedules or if it’s even that at play or something else.
I also have this feeling of not being able to spend enough time together that keeps coming back a lot.

Question : What significance do schedules hold in your life? "
630,3,"Ever since I can remember I have always had angry outbursts. Growing up if my dad was trying to teach me how to ride a bike or play a sport and I couldn't do it I would become so frustrated and genuinely feel enraged. As a child I was sent to my room in moments like this and I think that it worsened my emotional regulation skills. Now as an adult I find that this occurs frequently around my boyfriend and it is purely unfair for him to be around me. Growing up my parents told me ""if you continue to act like this you will have no friends."" I do have friends, and always have, this side of me really only comes out with my family and my boyfriend, the people closest to me. 

I always wonder if my ""anger"" is on another level compared to others. I try to tell my boyfriend that he doesn't understand that I can't do anything in those heated moments because I literally just feel the need to scream and throw things (I am aware that is ridiculous and I don't do so). But nevertheless in these moments I am rude, short, want to cry, and I also begin to think of anything else that is going on in my life that is stressful and it combines into a tornado in my head with what is currently happening overwhelming me to the extreme. 

It takes a couple minutes but I can usually tell that this is going on and when I realize I need to stop, the thought of having to calm down from my ""tantrum"" makes me even more mad. Does anyone have a method or answer or anything that has relieved their inability to calm down immediately or even something that has shifted your perspective to not get in these moods to begin with? I would love to hear what works for people, what doesn't, any advice. Honestly, I just want to be enjoyable to be around and I know that I am not. "
631,3,"I find it really interesting with my angry outbursts. If someone cuts me off driving, I don't care. I never once in my life have experienced road rage. WIth that being said, there's this special hatred / frustration I have for technology. But it's not with video games, or anything else but computers. 
Because I know the issues on a computer come from the company I work for giving me shit tools to work with, I get super angry at the company / the laptop, and start hitting it. I recently got a new job, and within a few days because the company VPN was disconnecting every 15 minutes ( just like I feared, because I worked with this VPN before, and was using drugs to cope with how much I hated that job) I broke the space bar on the laptop. Not a big deal, its not noticeable, but I'm sure when they figure it out in a few years they'll be like, what.

I'm not sure how to stop my anger for VPN or lag. For instance, because of the company connection, when I update a name on a file, it takes about .9 milliseconds longer, maybe a whole second, and it makes me so. fucking. mad. 

My last job didn't need a VPN to work- and I knew that was a luxury- I have been in tech work for a while / excel work - but they were going away with some of the applications we were working with, so I decided to jump at a 40% salary increase with remote work.

But straight up, the connection is so fucking terrible I'm almost punching the computer sometimes, not working until way late because I've noticed when less people are on it works better, and am taking longer to get work done because it's impossible to work when you get interrupted every 12 minutes.

It's sad some of the largest companies in the world have such terrible tech. I've already had 3 tickets with IT and they've been completely useless in giving me the right servers for the VPN, I've tried dozens and no help. And to top if off today i found out they installed 32 bit excel on fucking windows 11, so it keeps crashing over and over. Getting paid this much is like working with a broken jack hammer and their expecting an ice sculpture. so stupid"
632,3,"I have come to the conclusion that I have to ***stop***. To stop, in general.

Every day I'm in violent and painful flashbacks because of what people (especially my parents and brother) did to me in the past. It hurts like hell.

I have so much compressed anger from my life that it's gotten to a point that I can't unleash it without causing so much destruction that it would put me in jail.

And every day I constantly ask myself what I can do to mitigate the pain, or to forget about what they did to me. But I can't find any solution. Any at all. And it's already been years that I'm like this. The only solution is (TW: violence) >!to kill them, but that would put me in jail, so that doesn't work!<.

All these years I've been trying to *achieve* things, to *find* solutions, to *change* my life. Despite all the ways in which I've altered my life, nothing has worked, I'm still suffering in pain for the same wounds. The common denominator in everything I've been doing is ***doing/trying/chasing/persevering***. And now I see that that's what keeps triggering my wounds every fucking second of every fucking day.

So now I see that what I need is to stop. Just stop. Everything. No trying, no initiating, no chasing, no changing, no running, no accelerating, no pushing myself, no giving in, no moving, no explaining, no giving chances.

I remain open to other people to come to me, or to good things to happen to me. But I'm not initiating, chasing or trying anything else anymore. I'm completely done. This is the end."
633,3,I have these like random bursts of anger and i get so mad i scream break things smash things curse and yell. I get these freak outs around really bad ones where I had one where i got really mad at someone (my own family for context) and I went outside and I grabbed an axe and smashed a huge wooden rack with the ask and i threw bricks and i smashed them and i just like freak out and i want to know whats wrong with me. I feel my chest gets really tight and i dont really remember what i was thinking at the time but i remember certain parts of like when i was breaking stuff but i dont remember what i am thinking and i feel like its wasnt even me and when i had to talk about it i didnt really have any words and i just i had the same feeling again when me chest gets really tight and i dont know why i get like that ive have like 6 of these really bad freak out in like a 4 month time span and i just want to know if anyone knows anything about this asking for answers!
634,3,"Idk how important it might be to mention this, but he’s also autistic. 

Recently, he’s been having some really vengeful thoughts that he’s confided in me about. Mainly involving revenge. Revenge towards members of his family that have failed him, towards former coworkers, someone who recently scraped his car in a mild collision when the other driver wasn’t paying attention yet the insurance company sided with said idiotic driver anyway, and even certain other individuals that hold just a little too much power in society at this current moment.

He’s also had moments where the slightest annoyance in a game we’ve played together i.e. FiveM GTA sends in flying off in a rage. I’ve even heard him violently banging his desk, as well as other stuff in the background while letting loose a list of fucks, cunts, and similar cussing of that nature.

It’s not like it’s all he ever talks about or does or anything, but he brings it up often enough to make me worried for him, even though I completely understand why he’s been feeling this way.

It doesn’t help that he hasn’t really had it that great, especially when he was younger. The guy has dealt with staggering amounts of disrespect and abuse from others in the past.

That being said, I want to help him, or offer some advice or solutions if possible on what he should do, but to be honest? I feel out of my element here, and I’m not super confident in my abilities to help him out in a way that he needs other than suggesting some forms of therapy. Which you know, is kind of a “no shit” answer, but it’s all I’ve really got.

I don’t know if this is the best place to ask this, but any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated, especially if it doesn’t involve asylums or prison lol."
635,3,"I feel soo much anger in me, but I somehow cant freak out and just start throwing things around. All of it just sits in me and it feels so bad. Why can everybody around me just let go from time to time and I cant."
636,3,"Trigger warning: abuse.

When I was a little kid I was sexually abused, multiple times by my mom’s friend’s child. (It’s complicated so I’ll spare you all the details.)

It went on from age like seven to eleven before they stopped being friends and I never saw him again. I’ve been through depressive episodes, attempted to take my own life, SH’ed. All of those issues and I’ve really struggled to handle it myself and help myself.

I recently explained all of this to her and she let it go, kinda brushed it off.

She randomly told me when she was talking about the Bible that it’s poetic that she named me Grace and I’ve struggled with so much and that GOD GAVE ME THE GRACE AND UNDERSTANDING. I’m a Christian (and an lgbt member) so I completely understand what she meant, but she then continued to tell me that it was apart if gods plan.

That everything happens for a reason.

She said that I should thank the lord for the strength I was given to make it past all of that.

As if I didn’t spend every night as a child begging god to make it stop, to help me, to save me from everything that was happening. It’s not fair. Why are there so many Christians who have to give God thanks for your suffering.

I’ve suffered through a lot and it’s always “it’s apart of his plan”. Well what about my plan? My life was ruined when the lord let that kid enter my life, it was ruined when my sister began to sexually abuse me, it was ruined when suddenly everybody I loved was ripped away from me, and I should say thank you?

It’s bullshit. Sometimes I question why I stay with the religion. Part of me thinks it’s fear that even God will abandon me."
637,3,"i printed them on a business card, with a symbol.

>""**Darling, i am angry, i suffer.** 

>**I don't know why you have done this to me.** 

>**I don't know why you have said this to me.**

> **I want you to know I'm doing my best to practice taking care of my anger.** 

>**Darling, I need you to help me.""**

we would hand each other a card, or leave it out when we were upset. we had a rule that if it wasn't brought up in 24 hours, we needed to live with the issue.

the cards showed our anger in a healthy way, and allowed the other the understanding, and chance to fix the issue. it also allowed us to get out that we were angry, and gae us time to cool off from the issue. they were a huge help. i hope you give them a chance, and never forget to listen to your partner, it is the best advice i can give.

REALLY LISTEN. listen to understand the motivation. not just the words they are saying.

save your relationships before it is too late.

i did far too little, far too late. please learn from me."

639,3,"I've struggled with anger for a decent portion of my life. For alot of that time I also have felt guilty for being angry.

It feels like people try and use your anger against you to direct the issue to something other than what caused the problem in the first place.

These last twelve months something a councillor said really seemed to strike a chord with me, even if it's basic in nature.

I can't remember the exact statement per say but it was along the lines of learning to identify when you are justified in being angry and not putting yourself down for have a human emotion.

It really seemed to help me.

There are definitely times at the moment where I am livid, and to be honest others may not like it, but that's when I explain to them what has made me angry.

It's one of those things where it's a case of, well yeah if you don't want me to be fucking angry, then stop invalidating what I'm saying.

So for me at least, improveming my ability to be assertive has allowed me to acknowledge times where I actually want to be angry.

I just wanted to share this as I know it's very easy just to feel like there is something wrong with you and you get made to feel like the one who is in the wrong. 

That is not always the case.

Anger can be used for good as well.

I find that to an extend people take me more seriously when I'm annoyed. I wish they would just listen in the first place, but that's the world we live in."
640,3,"I'm 16 and I think I have anger issues. I punched someone at school for bullying me which I have never done before. My folks spanked me which builds up pent up frustration because I am helpless and can't to anything to defend myself when being spanked which I took out on a school mate. Ever since then I have been angry. I feel like yelling at people when irritated and punched a hole in the wall out of frustration And feel like just screaming but don't know what to do, just to imagine beating the shit out off the person annoying me. It also doesn't help that I like the character nate from euphoria "
641,3,"My wife and I have been working on my anger. Sometimes she says things to me in a demeaning way or talks to me like a child. When she does, I usually lose my temper. Although, we are taking counseling and things are gradually getting better. Does anybody else have a similar situation? Please share thoughts and or advice. Thank you."
642,3,"Where I come from, there are very few people who follow traffic rules. The rule says, in a residential area, the speed limit is 30 kmph, but no one gives a fuck, especially big cars who think they can drive whatever speed they want to, while honking aggressively to get people out of their way.

Well, I was on my motorcycle, going the speed limit, and I can see in my mirrors that an SUV is speeding behind me. Usually, even though this pisses me off, I give way to avoid a fight.

He speeds up very close to me and starts honking. I ignore him, he keeps honking. I got so pissed off, I just blocked him and slowed down even further.

Those few moments gave me joy, knowing that I'm pissing him off as much as he's pissing me off.

He then held the horn blaring and kept inching closer.

By then, adrenaline kicks in, something snaps in me and I slow down to a stop, blocking his car from moving.

He gets down, I tell him it's not a fucking highway and he should drive slowly, he says it's everyone's road, he'll do whatever the fuck he wants, a huge argument ensues, and as usual, and as expected, no one wins. We end up calling each other names and people had to separate the two of us and send us our separate ways.

I lost control today, after many days of biting my teeth and showing restraint. It could have gone much much worse. Today I didn't resort to violence. But tomorrow I might. I feel so ashamed of having gotten into a fight on the road, acting the way I did, being an immature person overall.

I'm afraid I might kill someone one day due to road rage. I'm not even kidding. I feel like I would get joy out of beating someone to a pulp.

I'm in therapy, it's not helping. If someone out there knows a permanent solution, please help me out, because I'm tired of always managing my issues. I want to genuinely get better to the point that I'm not an angry person anymore!"
643,3,"I started using a rhodiola rosea supplement and after 3.5 weeks i could see significant improvement in my anger and irritability. I didn’t believe it would work because previously i have tried l-theanine (in lower doses) and I didn’t feel anything different. I used to get so irritated and used to have anger tantrums 3-4 times a week. Now I feel like everything will be okay and don’t get irritated as often. Im much more positive. 

However, i feel like its too good to be true. As far as i know there aren’t much side effects to it. Im kinda worried that it will cause some issues after using it but for now its fine. "
644,3,"This morning, I’m walking my dog in my neighborhood and a neighbor from a street over stops me and says, “You know what people call you who don’t know your name,  “that nice guy”. At first, I thought he was bullshitting me, but he said, “no really, everyone thinks you are so nice”. Boy did that feel good to hear.

I’ve struggled with my anger as long as I can remember, but have been very intentional about managing it. Hearing that, I felt somewhat vindicated. 

That said, much more work to do. There’s hope folks. "
645,3,"Hey everyone,

I came here to find a solution for my severe anger outburst. 

It is going to be a VERY lengthy one so please be with me.

 My parents are good people and like every other parent they have always wanted good for me. But whenever there is some problem, they tend to make personal attacks on me, especially things that make me severely insecure. So recently, I have lost my job. My parents impliedly misbehaved with me even before this. This is because I chose a course of my own choice, I selected a boy who has been with me through all my thick and thin and who respects my parents even more than his own family, still they question my choice just because the boy I selected is of dark skin and short in height. Losing my job was the last nail in the coffin. 

My parents have been misbehaving with me ever since then. I still did not say a word to them. They have their wedding anniversary today. While on our way back home, I was upset because my sister had lost my ear phones the very day we started our journey to this trip. These earphones are expensive and were gifted to me by my boyfriend. My sister kept it casually and lost them. 

I still did not get angry about it and calmly stayed with my family throughout the trip. When we were getting in the car this morning, my parents still showed no concern towards my problem and when I calmly tried to explain why it bothers me so much,  they out of nowhere told me that ""you lost your job because you're so non cooperative"". I was appalled at their response.This really upset me and made me severely mad at them but still I had not more than a slight argument with them. 

Now when they stopped the car on the way to grab some morning tea, then also my mother said ""Nobody liked you at your workolace and look at me everybody likes me at mine""
. Not minding much, I started looking for my earphones and found it in some random corner of my seat. My family said many things after that but I kept mum. But I lost it after sometime and told them about how they never accept their mistake but it's always a problem when I do it. Just few days ago my sister misplaced my mother's earphones too and my mother ACTUALLY started crying sitting inside the restaurant but when she found her own earphones back, she casually said not more than a few lines to my sister and when I did it , it became an issue for them.

 The problem now begins. I could not take those personal attacks anymore. To be honest , my mother's marriage has not been happy. She has cried each day and has been upset on my father many times. I told them ""why do you even want to celebrate your marriage when you have not been happy at all?' This is because she has been attacking my insecurities since morning and I could not take it. After that my mum burst out in anger and said such shameful things about me and my boyfriend. She literally started to abuse him. Now I was holding tea in my hand. Somehow my hand shook in anger and half the tea was spilled on my legs. In a fit of anger, I poured the remaining tea on my mother's side of the seat and also the tea cup. My family went nuts after this and even I was shocked to the core about what I did. So I seriously need your help or at least guide me in how I can overcome my anger issues because I seriously want to get out of it. I am tired of taking bad karma on my head. I really want to change"
646,3,"I’ve been like this since I was kid. Angry when I lose a video game. Throwing my controller, want to hit/break something, and putting myself down. Still now, I love playing online games on my phone. But, when I lose, I throw my phone, hit my phone, and I stay angry all day! Anyone have any advice? I know just delete the app. Like I said, I love playing online app games. Im addicted! I just hate losing. "
647,3,"Hi everyone
I have been struggling with anger and wanted to know if there's any online courses I can take for anger management? But I don't want one that's like video recordings. I want ones that are like zoom sessions. I cant seem to find anything. "
648,3,"I have dealt with anger issues my whole life, even went to therapy for them when I was a kid, and for a good while I feel like I was handling them really well, but recently it feels like a lot of that progress has been lost? Maybe it's because I'm finally trying to socialize again, compared to before where I was kind of isolating myself, but I don't really know why I'm getting set off again.

It sucks, because it's so embarrassing to get as angry as I do about little things that in hindsight don't seem like they should matter, and I end up hating myself and feeling terrible because I don't want to hurt the people I care about in an outburst (emotionally, not physically). 

Does anyone have tips of things I can try to do that might help me manage my anger? I try to walk away when I can, and think of how embarrassed I'm going to be afterwards when I look back on the issue, but that's not always possible and doesn't always work. I'd really appreciate some advice, because I haven't felt this uncontrolled with regards to my anger in years, and I personally really don't like who I am when I'm angry, and wish I could control it better."
649,3,"Kinda a vent, kinda seeking advice. Just struggle bussing rn  
  
I love my friends. We bonded because of some horrible shit we all went through at the same time, and they're my ride or dies. A selfish part of me is grateful that we went through something awful, cause we saw a lot of each other at our worst and that kind of fundamentally has attached us to one another for better or for worse.

That being said, my patience is at an all-time low. I feel like I'm at a low simmer all the time and the littlest things can set me off and make me act like an absolute bitch. I'm annoyed, I'm pissy, I'm short, I can't take jokes like I used to and I'm scared I will do something that ruins everything.

There's more complexities than it just being ""me"". I've been in therapy for a long time (8-9ish years) and I'm only now confronting a lot of trauma that has stacked up over the years. My therapist said I was avoidant, and when I thought about it some more, she's 100% correct. It feels too heavy to even approach, let alone begin the process of untangling it. I've sung the merits of therapy for years, but I'm realizing now that I didn't confront what I needed to, how I needed to. Have quite a few pot-calling-the-kettle-black moments. I can't even approach the subject matter without physically cringing, wanting to run out of the room, disassociating, you name it.

It's going to take me a while to work through this, and I have the desire to tell my friends I might need more patience/support but it feels selfish considering that I've been a less-than-stellar friend. Some part of me says I don't deserve it, and I just want to fall off the face of the earth while I fix whatever it is I need to fix, though knowing me I crave company and attention, so that wouldn't last long. I hate that I can't just do that.

There's also an aspect of being that vulnerable with them. I hate opening myself up to judgment, even though I know I should be safe with them, there are the what-ifs. What if I'm judged, what if they think I'm attention seeking, what if they say no, what if dumping this in a group chat of 10 people has them all side-eying me.

We've got a pretty even gender split between us, but there's that divide between m and f as well. I'm 24f, and you know how you can just feel that disconnect and have no idea how to bridge the gap? If they'd even want that? If they understand, or if they don't understand and don't even want to try to? That kind of stuff.

I feel selfish, I feel weak, and I feel like there are certain matters that I can't confront or bring up with certain individuals, and it frustrates me to the point where it's just manifested as ugly, ugly anger and walls I'm putting up because I feel like there's nothing I can do but sit on it and be mad. My patience is non-existent and it might already be getting gross and toxic to deal with.

TL;DR Trauma and anger is making me miserable and I'm taking it out on people who are most important to me and it's not looking good girlies!!!!!!!!!"
650,3,I genuinely hate that everything makes me angry. The smallest things will trigger me and make me just shut down and it ruins so many things. I genuinely try to get out of it when I feel it happening but it’s like I have no control over it. It’s like the only emotion I’m capable of feeling or showering is anger… 
651,3,"Hello. I just got in an argument with my girlfriend. 

She was mad that I didn't watch her livestreams as a way of supporting her, where as everything from setting up the stream, to the point of making up titles and captions for the streams are done by me on her behalf. 

I didn't raise my voice in the argument. I just said that in the future, it's better to say it directly that she wants me to watch her every stream to support her further than what I already did for her. 

Honestly, I didn't know what I've done, everything that I've done is considered a ""support"" To her, doesn't matter. 

Long story short, she cried saying that I can use my hear and feelings instead of her telling me directly of what to do. 

Did I feel guilty? Absolutely. 

At this stage, I'm thinking am I a psychopath or a sociopath to say that when you want somethingy it's better to use a direct language. 

Thanks in advance for your replies. "
652,3,"I so desperately want to have friends but I just can't talk to people. Whenever I go to work and see my coworkers being able to talk about anything like it's so fucking easy I get so mad. I struggle with this so much and people just have no issue. Or if I go to a bar and see a friend group or a happy couple it makes do mad I could hit them.

I know this feeling is wrong, and I feel the anger is part of the reason I can't be social, but how can I not be furious? It's just not fair. Everyday I see people being social and happy it feels like I'm starving looking at people eating. Does anyone feel the same way? "
653,3,"Like the title says I have always had problems controlling my anger and frustration especially when I lose. I have tried to mitigate this by exercising and taking up hobby’s in my school like football and wrestling but I still can’t control my anger. I feel like I’m worthless and that I can’t do anything right but and I don’t know how to man up and stop getting so angry at myself.
My mother is coming up to visit me soon and watch one of my match’s and I’m worried I’m going to fuck up and that she’s gonna see how much of a loser I am. I just wanna know how I can be better."
654,3,"I've always done this. I talk to myself no matter how I'm feeling, but when I'm mad it's usually cursing, sarcastic muttering, or some other bs. I just ramble. I was upset and muttering about something someone did the other day, and made a frustrated comment - ""how fucking difficult *is* it??"" - and they heard me. I don't really notice the things I say often when I'm very upset, but when they asked me later if I meant for them to hear that, I was ashamed and horrified. It sounded just like my parent when I was young. 

I don't want that anymore. I caught myself doing it again, and I have to wonder - do I want people to hear me, subconsciously? And why do I do this anyway? It just fuels the anger, I never feel better. It's like a passive response at this point. I don't want to give up responsibility for it, though. I want to stop. 

TL;DR - How do I stop grumbling like a delusional asshole when I'm angry?"
655,3,Is there anyway to get rid of my anger without being able to yell at the problem directly?
656,3,"TDLR: My dad blows up over literally everything and his insults hurt so bad that to preserve my mental wellbeing and health even a little I need to know how to not get upset so I set him off less.


Hi, I know some people will not agree with this, hell, I don’t morally agree with the general idea, but it’s all I can think of.

I’m 16 years old.

My dad has anger issues, one wrong word, tone, or volume and he starts yelling, yelling about how I don’t respect him, how I’m stupid, the whole works, just saying things to hurt.
I grew up watching this as the only outlet of anger in the house and have unfortunately adopted it. I am not as bad. I don’t always flip at the switch of a hat, but sometimes I do. I don’t mean to, and I feel horrible afterwards, especially because I can’t ever remember the episode of rage. My father.. doesn’ t. When he does apologise it sounds rehearsed and fake, and I’m pretty sure my mum prompts the apology almost every time. When she doesn’t, he either doesn’t apologise, comes over and starts to sound like he’s going apologise by starting with “I’m sorry” then apologises for my stupidity, or other some other insulting thing, or, he apologises because he knows that I will just simply accept it because he beat me down enough that time that I won’t even think of not accepting because I just want him to stop yelling at me.

This happened 2 and a half hours ago:
My father and I were talking about a chest CT I got a while ago, neither of us could remember what it was called and while I trying to think and remember he kept throwing out ideas. He often does this, speaks when someone is clearly trying to think, I raised my voice a little, not much, so little that I wouldn’t even consider it yelling, just talking a little loudly, I said that I was trying to think and he just keeps talking while I’m trying to think. Immediately, he starts yelling.

I am still crying, almost sobbing because of what he said, and the fact that depending on what is said, I believe that what you say when you’re angry, you have to at least half mean it. An example straight from today: a parent saying while angry that they hope their child will suffer and die: They mean it, they have to mean that, because if they don’t not only is that a problem in itself, it doesn’t matter in the slightest because it’s something you can’t take back.


I want to know how to stop myself from raising my voice higher than normal volume when getting frustrated or how to force myself to keep my mouth shut. Before the frustration is expressed at all, because even slight expression of my anger sets him off.

I know what I’m looking for is unhealthy, but mentally hurting myself enough to push myself into constant apathy would be less damaging than my father’s words at this point.
So please someone tell me how, because I this might be my only possibility. "
657,3,I just yelled at my sister for her yelling st me whenever I do anything I could be sitting down everything's clean all I need to do is done and she will still be mad at me.

658,3,"Hey y'all! I think I'm going to post this on a few pages, but what are some of your best practices for releasing anger? My family of origin has caused me so much pain and they continue to push the boundaries I place. I'm in therapy and that does help. They're in a religion that I have made a sharp break from and I'm quickly learning all the ways that very religion has led to the very circumstances we as a nation find ourselves in today. I'm so angry. There's so much rage inside me and I know I have to feel these feelings, so I can not work past them, not ignore, them, but feel through them, so I can start releasing it. I find value in rituals/ceremonious practices (for example buying my cat flowers every year on her deathaversary and putting them by her urn) but I'm not sure what to do when the anger is just so visceral right now. I know anger is grief and grief is something I'm more comfortable with but I'm here for any ideas you might have for ceremoniously letting go of anger, releasing these circumstances I have no control over.... What do YOU do?"
659,3,Hi guys! I am 29 (F) based in Mumbai. Since past couple of years I am facing anger issues where I just end up shouting and using hurtful language at time with my closed ones.

660,3,"It's been a while since I felt really angry, so I was hoping I was getting over my anger problem. I'm a teacher. After a meeting I was talking to the principal about my strategies for working with ESL students, and she wanted me to share what I was saying with a couple other teachers. I started telling the other teachers about my strategies and one wouldn't look at me and had a mocking smile. This teacher has laughed when I've spoken at meetings, so I asked some other teachers about it, and learned that there's a clique of teachers who've been harassing other teachers by laughing, gossiping, and false-reporting. Since she wouldn't look at me I told her to look at me when I'm talking, then I told the principal that there's an issue I needed to address. I said that a couple teachers had laughed at me when I was mentioned at a meeting, and that I'd learned that there's a clique of teachers who've been targeting other teachers including myself. The HM asked if that clique included either of the teachers present and I said yes, the teacher looked at me like I was being crazy, and I said ""you know exactly what I'm talking about."" She just laughed and said ""no I don't"" and I said ""I know, it's so fucking funny."" Obviously, cussing at co-workers is unacceptable, especially at a school. Plus I did it in front of the principal. I apologized.

Now I feel absolutely miserable. I wish I hadn't cussed, and I feel so stupid for doing so. My real concern is that I don't want this to affect my relationships with the other teachers, because my relationships with them are important to me.

I've been low key and relaxed lately, and things were honestly going well for me, which may have contributed to my lashing out - I wasn't expecting it. When that surge of adrenaline or cortisol or whatever rises, I need to learn to defuse it. I just feel so miserable. These moments of intense anger are just making my life more difficult."

664,3,"What happened was our stove wasn't working because it had/has some gas issue idk so we him(15m) and I(21f) starting checking if all the knobs are on or not and my brother asked me in the middle of it if our stove has a button too, I answered saying no it does not but then again for second time he asked me the same thing ""are you sure the stove doesn't have any button?"" 

This is not the first time, for things i need help with and have checked thoroughly with he would ask me same questions not once but repeatedly, that irritates me a lot

So yeah I shouted at him saying ""when I said no once that means there is no button don't you understand"" to which he replied he is just asking and wanted to know and that I didn't need to shout at him.........fyi we have this stove since 21 years now! Works perfectly fine and has no damn buttons but a pipe connected to a gas supply! 

I lost my cool sat in my room and we kept on bantering, I told him not to irritate me more and to just shut it but nahh he went on making weird noises and that's it I completely lost it and told him that he is an asshole (gandu to be specific which translates to asshole but has more impact)

Now I always always try to bite my tongue in moments I get angry I been told I can be very vicious with words, but this time I said f it,  but once I said it he was taken aback, his voice changed and could see his eyes watering up ....... I knew I fucked up real bad, he is a sensitive kid, dumb as fuck but has got a good heart....he told me I've always been like that to him and now he doesn't wanna talk to me at all 

Genuinely I didn't realise that I've been this mean to him and still don't recall anything like this except 2 major ones which were my fault and I'm willing to change cause I love my brother a lot I don't wanna hurt him and wanna be someone he can rely on, share things with but yikes I've been anything but a good elder sister 

I feel really bad, it's my 1st day of period, I don't really get pms symptoms or whatever, and he was being irritating a lot! But that doesn't mean I can cuss at him

So yeah how should I handle this?

What can I do to control myself better?"
665,3,"Hey, I (m21) made my mom cry after telling her to go fuck herself. So basically what happened was that, we were having a legitimately good conversation and I was in the middle of taking out a folded table which bumped into a small waterborne that spilled all over the place. My mom started yelling at me to pick it up because I kinda froze as I was still holding the table. Anyways, I obviously picked it up and before I could do anything else, she became furious for some reason and accused me of weaponised incompetence and went on a rant about how her brothers, her father, my male cousins and me, barely clean up after ourselves if we spilled something (This is true for my grandfather and uncle but me and my cousins actually do clean up), anyways she kept yelling at me as I began to mop the floor and after I left the room, I was completely mad at her.  

Me and my mom usually have a good relationship but there are a few issues, alot of the time, she would take her anger out on me by yelling at me or just generally making a small issue into a massive problem. She also guilt trips me constantly and can be kinda controlling and suffocating but these are not common moments and we have a good relationship however, whenever I called her out on her behaviour, she would either say ""That's what a mom is supposed to so"" or she does apologise and promise never to do it again but that promise has been broken alot. Plus she also has cussed me out before and showed me the middle finger 

So when I came back to the room, I was completely furious and tired of her mood swings. She did apologise to me when I came back but in a very amused and half joking tone, so I just snapped and told her to go fuck herself. She looked hurt and sad, she told me that I crossed a line and she can't forgive me for this, which made me immediately feel bad and then she told me to stop talking to her.  

I feel so guilty and ashamed of what I said but I'm also still angry with her. I'm the one that had to forgive her for her mood swings and her controlling behaviour. I'm just so tired, sad, angry and confused, please help me

666,3,"So I have this anger issue that started developing about a week ago. (I'm 15) Whenever I get mad at a game or at something random, I just find the first thing to just completely maul. I'm talkin' nearly breaking the thing I've bitten. Has anyone else had this issue or is it just me?"
667,3,"I’ve never really felt comfortable admitting this issue before, but it’s something I’ve been struggling with for a long time—dealing with anger. A lot of it stems from childhood trauma, and I often feel haunted by my past. When I get angry, I feel very explosive. I’ve broken phones, punched holes in walls living with family  and sometimes even feel the urge to pick a physical fight with people. I also have moments where I feel like cutting people off from my life, even though I don’t lash out at them. My anger is really about my own trauma and frustration with myself.

Most of my newer and even old friends don’t know I have these issues because I never show any signs of anger. They believe I’m always calm and nice, and that I don’t have the capability to get angry. However, when something triggers me, like memories of my parents or feelings of frustration with myself, it brings up a lot of emotion.

Right now, I’m seeing a counselor, and therapy has been really helpful in helping me understand these behaviors and why I am the way I am. I’m wondering if anyone else who has struggled with anger like mine could share what has helped them or how they manage these feelings?"
668,3,"Having some significant issues atm that I'm struggling to get a lid on. Long story short, nightmare neighbour, injustice and biased policing. I'm powerless in the situation and it's a day-in-day-out kind of scenario. I have no options available to me other than endure and remove myself from my own home of 25 years whenever possible. My work flow has more or less ceased entirely because of this neighbour, which is one of very few things that brings me joy.

I've always had problems with anger but I'm almost always in control of myself. I used to have pretty good coping mechanisms in that taking myself off for a hike, listening to music, shouting/beating into a pillow or doing something creative would almost always put me back on balance.

The issue atm is that there is been a cascade of injustice in a short period of time that has more or less destroyed my quality of life and work schedule. I am not experiencing any relief from any of my usual coping mechanisms and I feel as if my anger is going to eat me alive. For example, I've only been sleeping for about 3 hours at a time because I'm thinking about things I don't want to. I go to bed angry and get up angry, and there is no end in sight. Furthermore, I have no one to support me in any capacity and my options are limited outside of call-based counselling which are mostly women that typically don't handle anger-based venting very well, and there is often not a man available to take over.

Grounding sucks for me in this context because it's just a reminder.

So, anyone got any secret or advice for me? I'm trying to be practical and mature about this because I recognise that it's becoming an issue.

Thanks."

I wanted to just go in my room, but then that led to talks. I know sometimes I do treat my brother wrong, but I feel as if I can’t control it. 

Some days( most days) I am just so short tempered and everything annoys. 

I don’t want my brother to grow up and feel as if I don’t love him, or he hates me, but I can’t control my emotions.

670,3,"Stupid Reddit stuff makes me pissed. I don’t understand why everything I post keeps getting removed or why there’s so many different sub groups on the same topic but use it for very specific reasons. I don’t understand why people gang dislike my comments when I am the one that is right. I don’t understand why people lurk in groups just to attack people. I don’t understand why people don’t talk to me in DMs. I don’t understand why people dont put their age in their bios when they are in nsfw spaces or their account is literally just for porn. I don’t understand why people don’t answer you right away. I don’t understand people. I hate it. I hate not understanding things, it makes me angry and feel stupid and it makes me even more mad."
671,3,"i don't know what to do anymore. i have extreme anger issues, and nothing helps. i've had therapy, tried grounding, tried walking away, nothing works. people say ""just don't get so worked up about it,"" but they clearly don't know what it's like. i've broken multiple expensive items like my phone out of anger. i've physically hurt myself out of anger because that's the pnly thing that calms me down. i genuinely want to kill myself out of just anger. i'll start scratching my arm until i'm bleeding, punch my arm until it hurts really bad and bruises, or bite my arm hard enough so that it's sore and bruised. i want to control this before i hurt someone or myself really badly, but nothing helps. i need advice, please."
672,3,"just now my sister helped me taking out the laundry (total 2 batches, she took the 1st one and EXPECTED me to hang it out) while I said clearly I will take it out and hang it right after my work out.

when i came back, the laundry has been loaded (2nd batch) and the 1st one has been unloaded, i asked her ""why dont u hang it afterwards?"" and shes got pissed bc she thought i said that i would hang it, well i said i will take it out and hang it, not just hang it.

I feel annoyed because it doesnt line up with my workflow

and she says like ""isnt that more efficient like this?"" and my reason is bc taking them out and hanging them is one set, and especially when i alrd told her that i will do it (shes busy, i dont expect her to mind this at all yet she does and it makes my blood boil)

and the rest of the job, my mood just super freaking sour. i did everything in anger such as cleaning up the lint mess, mop the floor, etc etc. even when i writing this i am still pretty pissed

i just dont like it when i said that i will do it even when its gonna take a long time, and then u meddle in MY workflow..

i dont understand why? i have always have this rage when people try to help me since the age of 3... i remember clearly i squish out of anger the banana on my hand when my grandpa tried to help me peel it.

i dont wanna be like this but this has been feel like a default to me and it cant be changed at all (trust me i tried and the annoyed feeling and anger just take over my feelings i feel like i wanna cry bc i hate it when people dont wanna line with my way on a very specific task that has been tasked me to do)

any advice and inputs would be helpful in any way! thanks!"
673,3,"I just recently starting going to therapy, slowly getting into healthy living, but I still have some deep anger within me and I hate to admit it, but it seems worse whenever my partner is around.

Examples is, he sometimes won’t pick up his trash, or dirty clothes, or sometimes he’ll let our kids cry it out when they’re acting up and won’t use their words.

We are trying the best for our kids, but it’s sooo hard.

I quit smoking weed. 

So there’s that.

But even then it didn’t help, I try take a break, nap, could never do any. 

Any advice helps."
674,3,"Long story short, I was helping my mother remove snow from her car and in turn she was helping me with my car. While I was using the tools I have to remove snow, she took the shovel to scrape of snow and scratched up my driver window. Luckily I stopped her in time before she got to the rest of the car ruined the paint. I know she meant well and was just trying to help but I am so upset that it didn’t dawn on her that a shovel with a metal edge can scratch up a car. What do I do in order to get over the anger and remember that she meant no harm."

676,3,"When I (30f) was 22, a guy I lived with, slightly younger than me (I think 18, might have been 19) picked a real big fight with me during one of the lowest points in my life. I wish I could tell you who started it or what it was about but seven years (that has gone so fast) is seven years too long ago. I have vivid trauma flashbacks to when he eventually threw himself on the ground and told me to kick him (i don't even remember why at this point, but he was always a bit of a ginormous drama queen) and I did. Once. Just once. Never again. Never laid hands on ANYONE after that no matter how angry I feel.

I remember being angry. I remember feeling justified. I remember immediately afterwards going oh my god, no, I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry. But I can't remember anything else. 

After this happened I was so traumatized by my own actions in anger I started developing malaptive disassociation. I look in mirrors and all I see is abuser. This person started warning people - my friends - about me, and I was honest with them about the situation and they told me that it wasn't my fault. Even the person I kicked admitted they shouldn't have antagonized me like that and not expected me to react in a moment of heated anger and adrenaline but...

7 years later. Despite forgiveness I did not ask for (in fact, it was them who came to me, and asked me if I would accept theirs, and I did. I do.) I still lay awake on nights like tonight reliving that memory. I'd had similar outbursts with fights with my siblings, and of course my siblings all laugh and say, well you forgave me, right? And I say, well yeah, I beat the snot of you too. My parents say we are bound to lose our shit eventually too. Even three therapists have all assured me, I've done the right thing. I've moved to improve myself. I have gotten and given forgivance. 

And yet I am still prone to anger. I still relive this one memory of hurting someone. Sometimes it is replaced my hurting my mom during my teen fits. Sometimes, my brothers during my childhood. Any time domestic abuse comes up on a screen, I am reminded of my own disgusting, selfish behavior, and it triggers this deep need to end my own existence, or run away, or tell the world I'm an abuser. I never have, and I have an amazing number of things to live for (especially my elderly parents and disabled brother who rely on me, I promise, I am safe.) 

But I want this anger to stop. I fear it. I fear losing control. I fear destroying lives. I try to live good. I volunteer. I take care of my friends and my family. I have many positive things going for me. But there are days this intrusive memory pops up and I wonder, who will be the next victim of my anger? My mother, again? My partner? God forbid, my future children? 

I don't know what I seek from posting this. Solidarity? Answers? Guidance? Maybe just simply...relief in letting it go out there into the world and admitting that anger has traumatized me for the rest of my life.

I don't want to be chained to this feeling I can't control anymore. I want to be free."

I’ve got no reason to be pissed or upset. I’m feeling tense and anxious and I’ve got no right to be. Nothings wrong right now but I’m crying for no good reason. I really need to punch something or just feel pain. I feel like being injured is the only kind of reality check that works, is it bad that it grounds me along with hurting others?

679,3,"Today was my (21F) first time acting like a karen. I always had anger issues but lately it’s worsened. I always shop at a small grocery store which in my country is the norm. It also has a small parking lot. Today when i was about to go threre i noticed a truck was blocking the entrance. That sometimes happens bc they have to unload stuff but it has never blocked the entrance and also the store is on a busy street which means you cannot park on the street. Anyways I wasn’t able to park so I wasn’t able to go in there so i had to come back home. When i arrived i was so angry that i called that store and was just yapping about that they shouldn’t allow their entrance to blocked and so on. I wasn’t rude or anything i was just telling her that they should keep the entrance open no matter what. At the end of the call we both knew i just called to rant about something and i think she was cool about it. Am I becoming a karen? How do i control my anger?

680,3,"I am an awful parent. In the past two ish years, my anger outbursts have been increasing to the point of aggression. I used to get angry and was able to handle it a lot more efficiently. Now anything my family does throws me off. I yell at them and just have this like primal instinct to just want to destroy things around me. I don't but it's so overwhelming. My family has noticed that I've become easy to anger at every tiny thing. I try to distract myself if they bicker but if it lasts a while, I go in and my rage becomes volatile in the form of yelling, and obviously make the situation worse. I tell myself to stop but it is an urge to make everything stop/silent. I sometimes think Covid had something to do with it. They found a laceration in my brain after suffering from a new, constant headache. But then, maybe that's a scapegoat? Yelling has been my go-to and I hate myself for it. I hate how I make my family feel-- scared, anxious, and guilty. I am reading parenting books on how to stop yelling, doing workbooks, and resuming more constant exercise. Ugh, I don't know either if it's because my mom with schizophrenia has been a more constant variable in my life (she moved in with me) and she is not kind to me. I don't even want to go inside my home anymore. I wish I can make everything stop and I can breathe again."

His parents are nice enough people but they generally don’t have many interests or hobbies. They like basic things the pub and a bit of shopping ect. They don’t really try new things (that I am aware of).

They are coming to visit… I suggested a couple of cultural things to do museum and a play.. suggested some nice Resturants.

I was told no they won’t want to do that.

I now find myself pissed off and angry that I have to lower my standard to ensure they are entertained at the level they require.

Why do I have to do what they want to do? Why can’t they take an interest in our interests?

Would this make you angry? 

Honest answers pls "
682,3,"I came across a video today that indicated that while a lot of the time depression shows up in the sleeping,  lack of energy realm, for others it can also show up as irritability and a quickness to become angry. I had never thought of or realized it but this fits me very well and explains a lot of the frustration I've had with life,  etc for the last few years. 

Coming across this has opened up new doors for me and I finally feel like I may be able to make forward progress into becoming the person I really do want to become.

I never outwardly been angry at her but I do mutter under my breath very mean things abt her when she either talks bad abt herself or says how bad her life is. She is the most wonderful person in the world, she has helped me so much in life and I love her. I want to know why I am always specifically angry at her. I have tried to find out why for few a year now but I don't find anything that would help me. I don't want to be angry at her when ever I meet her.

684,3,"I live in a new low income building with shared laundry, bad mix I know. I am ALWAYS intentional about doing it early and promptly taking my clothes out when the time is up, always clean the screen, etc. Respectful. Today I went to throw my clothes in the dryer when i got the alert that the wash was done, and I find all of my clothes piled up on top another machine and someone pulling their cart away from where my clothes were after they loaded theirs in. I asked her if she moved my clothes and she dismissed me with a shrug and left. I was so angry! It was in front of another tenant which made me feel like I needed to check this bitch so I could establish myself as someone not to mess with.... in the laundry room lol. 

I decided to go back down when I thought she'd be there to confront her about the disrespect, I could not let it go. When I came out of the elevator, unfortunately for her she was waiting for it, so when the door opened I told her she needed to learn to have respect in a building like this because that shit might not go well for her with someone else. That she needed to apologize in a situation like that.  I asked her why she did it and she came up with excuses that she is a caregiver and only has 5 hours until work and the other machines were broken, which just set me off. I was definitely raising my voice at this point as told she had life fucked up if she was going to operate like that. My final words were telling her if she's going to be doing that entitled shit then stand on it when someone confronts you about it. She ran away.

I felt pretty good about it, but also ashamed of my anger. I don't want to let people get away with being a punk to me so I feel like I want stand up for myself, but not many other women I know would do that and they feel uncomfortable about it when I express anger. It's such a huge issue. 

When I went to put my laundry in the dryer, the apt management was in there for some reason. so I think she may have told on me? they didn't say anything. Any insights welcome on this. I am really trying to figure out my shit in life and anger is one of those issues."
685,3,"Sometimes I go to the UPS store downtown to drop off some stuff I need shipped out. 

So tonight, I dropped off some parcels, got my receipt, and was ready to make my way back to the pad. 

as I was about to put my car into reverse, I feel and hear a loud thud...Sound was so loud, I heard it thru my earbuds I was wearing to listen to a podcast. I look around check my mirrors and see a car door up against my rear passenger door. Rear passenger on the driver's side of the car to the right Of me just bumped the crap out of my car super carelessly.

When this happened, the driver of that car looked back and realized what happened at the same time as me, and for a brief moment, we looked at each other. However, he doesn't act on it and puts his car into reverse and was about to maneuver out. 

I get out and immediately stop him. I tell him hey man you just hit my car with your door and didn't say anything. He tells me, "" what? I didn't hit your car bro"". 

When I tell you that shit made me snap, that shit made me completely lose it!!!  I told him, you looked right at me mf don't play stupid. 

It was at this time, I realized that the person sitting in the rear was the driver's wife, you know, the person who hit my car...
Obviously Im not an idiot and I'm not gonna get aggressive with a female, but it's the fact that the driver knew what happened and he knew I knew what happened, and he still tried to drive away. 

So yeah, his wife tried to diffuse the situation by apologizing, which is fine, that's all I wanted in the first place....and that's why I told her, I said well that's what you're supposed to say, you don't just try to drive away and not say nothing. 

But what made me even more, upset, was that this woman tried to calm me down by saying that she had her child in the car. Which it did; somewhat...but in that moment I just had to let my ego win? 

I told her that I didn't give a fuck about her kid, (I didn't mean that, I was just pissed off) and that you need to be more careful and make a conscious effort to not do that anymore.

Truth is, I wasn't mad at this woman at all, I was truly pissed off at the driver, because we made eye contact and he knew that his wife fucked up and tried to brush it off like it was nothing and drive off. 

My car is no prized possession. It's a piece of shit, but it's mine and I try to take care of it. But It's the disrespect that I cannot take! It's the little things that will piss you off.


I know I fucked up and lost my cool. But who am I to just accept my personal property being violated right in front of me? Laying in bed feeling awful about it,  but then there's something deep down that feels satisfied in a way, almost like I'm an addict and I got my fix. 

Please don't judge me "
686,3,"Everything I've heard or experienced, big and small, every compliant, annoyance or insult aimed at me (or near me) gets replayed over and over in my head. I can be in the middle of something and an angry thought suddenly appears and I'll spend minutes if not hours just stuck replaying it over and over, getting more and more pissed off at it. I hate it so much."
687,3,"Went to process a replacement card with my new name. Brought my court order and passport. All of my information was correct. The guy immediately rejected my application because the court order wasn't original. I pleaded with him and started to cry. He asked to see my passport again and, I don't know why, I slid it hard across the divider. He handed it back and told me to slide it across respectfully. I did, and I apologized profusely. He made me a new appointment and I'm now inexplicably anxious that the appointment is a weird 'gotcha' and that I'm going to get in trouble at the office when I go back.

I'm so fucking tired of feeling like any small inconvenience could potentially endanger my ability to live the way I'm living. I'm so tired of feeling reactionary in this way. I know how to differentiate between following the rules and being discriminated against. This wasn't it. I feel ashamed and guilty for how I acted, relieved I didn't get in trouble, because he would have absolutely been within his rights to kick me out for it, and angry at myself for blowing up because of how I feel about the broader political landscape."
688,3,"All my life I’ve been an empath and that’s made me depressed bc I was easily affected by witnessing injustice for others, as well as becoming depressed over personal experiences.

I used to be suicidal and think I don’t wanna be here anymore, but recently I’ve just about had it. The people who I see terrorizing society and even within my immediate family enrages me to a point of no return. Anyone who does or says anything unnessacarily rude/evil/objectively fucked up, I immediately imagine them dead and me feeling relieved. It’s been consistent for about a week now but Im actually kind of worried about myself. I’ve been writing a murder based novel to cope when I’m super angry but I don’t want to live the rest of my life like this.

I feel people will say find a hobby to release the anger but it just comes back 10x stronger, I’m not sure if that’s helping. I just wish I couldn’t care at all. Is there medication anyone has taken to calm them down or make them not care about things with the same intensity?"

691,3,"I’m 18 F and I get angry over everything. I’m constantly angry, especially when it comes to my family or my closest friend. He’s my best friend and I love him but for some reason everything he does and says even when it’s not wrong, it makes me soooo angry and I’m not like this with anyone else. It’s easier to control my anger when it comes to people I don’t know, which I think is common?

The main issue of this topic is that I get angry over even the tiniest of things constantly. Example: I have this bulletin board on my wall and for the past two years even the slightest touch can make it fall off. I was cleaning my room and it fell off along with everything on it and I just wanted to hurt myself and smash everything and just started to ball my eyes out. Sometimes it even drives me to pull my hair.

Disorders: anxiety, depression, adhd, sensory disorder and 0.5 autism, whatever that means. Is it because of any of my mental issues? The meds I’m on? Or is it because I’m still technically a teenager who’s growing and has hormonal issues? It doesn’t feel normal, because I’m rude when I don’t mean to be or try to be. I’m a very empathetic and passionate person, but once I’m angry, my memory becomes short and all I want to do is tear at my skin and lash out at anyone around me. I know that it’s wrong, and I just want it to be fixed. My anger suffocates me, and I feel so overwhelmed each time. "
692,3,"I’m angry with a lot of people.

I’ve grew up being told to be the bigger person and that I shouldn’t show how affected I am by a person because I’ll “lose”.

But I feel like I’m already losing by not retaliating. I want to retaliate. I wanna make them miserable because they keep making me miserable. I’m tired of holding it all in and be the good person.

I’m tired of being the person who’s doing their best to be good while everybody else who don’t care don’t actually receive any repercussions or consequence.

I’ve been painfully deliberating the past few days. Something major happened and I know I can’t go back to how I’ve been. I’ve utterly been broken and I’m going to embrace it, instead of agonizing and fighting against it. Fucking cliche because I just wanna embrace my anger. My doctor told me I should aim to self-regulate my emotions, and the meds are there to help. But either I kill my emotions with meds, or I give in. I’m fucking tired. I have nothing to lose anyway even if I turn into a bad person."
693,3,Any ways that I can control my anger easily? I get angry very easily and I absolutely suck at controlling it which makes me take it out on people and things near me. I've tried those breathing in and out things but they don't work. Is there any other way that might work? 
694,3,Recently started my medication again and I feel numb. I'm on sertraline and this is my second try with it.

I love my mom and dad, and I know that I'm a lazy fucker who don't do nearly enough work in the house. 

recently my mom had to go back to China, and I had to stay aboard alone. She told me to get away from Chinese people and don't bring other people to the house etc... (as a lovely mother she is) because they could kidnap you and do unspeakable things (These things DO happen in south Asia where Chinese people scam other Chinese people into poor countries and kidnap them.)  

OFC I agreed because these are obvious rules in the house, and I always obey them (I always behave and never invite friends without parent's permission) and I'm also quite excited for this experience because as a 17-year-old I'm aware I have to live by myself soon, when I go to university. She also shouldn't worry about me taking illegal substances, since I never smoke, drink or do any kind of drugs.



**Last Friday** she sent me a copy and pasted article

 ""不要低估人性的恶，我昨天转发了一条东南亚失踪的中国女性，我不希望那是真的，但是宁可信其有，发出来提醒大家。因为有的人性恶到你难以想象，比如以前人流密集处的残疾儿童乞讨，大家应该还有印象，2014年3月13日，凤凰卫视《社会能见度》，报道“东莞儿童丐帮”的，曝光了犯罪团伙拐卖儿童并打残，逼迫他们上街乞讨。有成员回忆： “用砖头把小孩的腿打断，小孩哭得撕心裂肺的。打断之后腿部流脓，就感染，感染以后也不给治，慢慢这个腿就烂掉了，烂得流脓，他越惨他越赚钱。”

节目中还说，为了不让孩子说话，犯罪分子会把他们舌头割掉或者毒哑，大一点的孩子会让他们吃安眠药缩短寿命，等到不行了以后方便随时丢弃。

人命在这些人眼里一文不值，连儿童都被这帮畜生这样虐待，何况大人。割腰子摘取器官可不是新闻了。所以女性被拐至东南亚被迫害致死，可能性还是有的。很多人不信，反而对我质疑，不信可以查一下多少女性去东南亚失踪的就知道了。多少父母在发布寻女启事就知道了。反正趁我还有些流量，该做的我已经做了。转发的文章可能有些夸张，但小心一点总没错。出国记住不要搭理陌生人。特别是来路不明的“同胞”，极有可能是人贩子、诈骗犯。""

which is an article about people missing in Asia or people that were kidnaped and made homeless Beggers. with the intention of making me be careful of strangers. Because we been through this so many times already, I told her that 

""那不应该你别把我一个人留在这里吗？""

which translates to ""then you shouldn't leave me here alone? "" 

tbh I was already getting mildly annoyed by this because we've already gone through this whole thing and how to prepare for my life alone. So, I wanted to send that to make sure she leaves me alone and let me be the one to handle it.  


**Last Saturday,** things took a weird turn, she went on a rampage saying I should break off my relations with my Chinese friends since they could also kidnap me. I immediately went defensive against my mom about this topic. She gave whole speeches saying that the people closest to you can stab you in the back and how they will betray you and sell you out for money.  (She also said that all I do with my Chinese friends is play videogames and they don't teach me anything important)

 I opposed this idea and said she was a 傻逼 which can be translated to stupid b\*\*\*h (**WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE IK**, but I was so incredibly mad for some reason and dropped that.)

later that evening I couldn't fall asleep and messaged her at around 2 which I'm sure is what pissed her off more, because instead of apologizing I told her she should do her own research, before she taught me what to do, which I did some research and gave her some stats with the kidnapping rate in the country.

I also pointed out the things she said that day was racism, assuming Chinese people would back stab you and kidnap their friends. 

In the end of the text, I said that I cannot justify the fact that I cursed at you, but your disrespecting words cannot make me respect you. (which ofc I lied, I think I still love my mom very very much)





**Today** things got more tense, I went to her bedroom door and woke her up at 7:30 asking if she can send me to school (there are no school bus), She refused. Later today she left the house. 

She texted me and said she would never live anywhere close to a person who cursed at her, she also stated that the moment I cursed at her she has already disowned me.  

I tried to make a point using the fact that she cursed at me repeatedly when I grew up when I misbehave, how come she can let it slide just because she is my parent. 

She said if I want, I can curse it back to make it even.

  
**WHAT DO I DO**



"
697,3,"I’ve been like this since I was young, atleast 12 years old. Why do I get all upset over a past that doesn’t involve me…? Such as an ex’s past. That’s the only past I always get mad about. No matter who I’m with. It truly does upset me especially having a wife of 8 years now. I just don’t understand and need help….google does not have the answer so I’m coming here…."
698,3,"I (16m) have been dealing with a lot of stress recently, due to being diagnosed with celiacs disease and my schools minimal effort when a project caused me to have a severe prolonged reaction. (Flour baby project, I was sort of forced to go on all the days that I wasn't puking)

I was sort of out of it for that time, and like the next few days so I fell behind and am still barely caught up.

And I've just been shutting down when these topics are brought up, I get really snappy and agitated. Now that midterms are a week away my mom wants to know everything and all I want is for her to get off my back. On top of that, my entire family is still navigating my diagnosis, so we need to talk about food and I just don't want to think about it. 

I don't want to snap at ppl about it cuz like I want to not be an ass, but like my parents just won't get the hint that I would rather discus literally anything other than those two things! (I don't think it's much of an ask but it seems that they are my defining features and I ""want"" to talk about them when dealing with laundry)

If anybody knows what to do, then I would love some advice cuz I'm at a loss"

My son has been on risperidone for some years, and while it seemed it helped at first, it doesn't do much now other than contribute to weight gain.  We can't really tell much of a difference if he's had it or if he hasn't.  Also, he has chronic kidney disease, and I've seen conflicting info on risperdone's effect on kidneys, so I'm just trying to see if there's something better out there overall.

Right now, he is on Prozac, Risperidone, Vyvanse, Guanfacine and Seroquel.  He does much better with his morning meds (Prozac, Vyvanse, Guanfacine) than he does with the rispieridone and seroquel, which he takes late afternoon.

He gets incredibly irritable, angry, frustrated, etc.  He punches holes in the walls, hits the screens of the computer/phone when they don't work, throws things, and acts like he is going to get physical but hasn't.  It is like a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde of when his meds are working/when they wear off.

For reference, he is 17 years old, but he is nearly 6 ft tall, 270 lbs.

\*ETA - I'm looking to hear from others so that I can have specifics to ask his psychiatrist about (and to reassure me that there ARE options lol).  Nothing would be done without his doctor's orders."
700,3,"Me and my friend, which I’ll just call David as a substitute name, always play games together and stuff, almost all day. It’s always fine, almost always. I normally end up playing a game that can be frustrating to us, and I get mad too but I keep it to myself and usually quit. When someone wrongs him on said game he’ll keep going at it, and end up losing in return, which makes him more angry, etc. I’ll ask him to play something else, or I’ll ask him why he’s mad and what’s wrong. He normally yells at me to just shut up, or that I’m useless when I try to help him. It hurts when it comes from him because he’s my friend, and I ask him why he always brings me into it but he always avoids the question. Please help me try to figure out a way to respond to him getting mad."
701,3,"It’s kinda been an issue my whole life that I normally don’t tend get angry at people - like a good 80-90% of the time I’m level headed and stoic. 
HOWEVER, the moments I do get angry, it’s quite immense and severe.
Things like yelling, screaming, slamming doors, etc. 
People have suggested talking about things but idk if that’ll help me since I’m not a generally hotheaded person and my anger only tends to come out in situations where I’m provoked and then I take my anger out on an impulse. 

I’ll try and give examples of scenarios

Example 1 (not irl scenario) if I’m with someone who’s repeating a joke that I’ve implied and also said clearly I don’t want to be a part of and they still keep going on with it , I’ll just snap and yell manically at them. 
 

Example 2: this happened when I was younger(7 or 8 y/o)and I’ve felt horrid about it ever since .ofc I’m aware that my age doesn’t really excuse my behaviour and it’s been really tough trying to navigate moving on from this particular incident in a healthy way. 


When my siblings would constantly bother rme physically i.e. nudging, punching and whatnot , I’d tell them to stop or wait for them to stop and when they didn’t I’d push them back very harshly or yell manically at them. 



The point is , I’m really regretting the way my anger is leading me and I want to be better with this. It’s not as bad as before but ofc it needs to be better and I want some tips on how to control this sort of “impulsive anger” .
I’m looking into getting therapy as well for anger management and I’ve also had counselling sessions at school but they always suggest speaking about it which I’m unsure how to navigate. I just want to stop behaving like this and feel normal for once and like a healthy human being. "
702,3,"I have a strong hatred for my dad and I've despised him ever since I was a toddler. He is the epitome of someone with Narcissistic personality disorder, and is the most egoistic person ever. He always claims that he's right, and reprimands me for not listening to him enough. His ego is so high that he claims to be the smartest person in the world, and everyone else are just subservient beings that are unintelligent. This, of course, makes me extremely mad.

I worked really hard in high school and I was recently admitted to an Ivy league. My father claims that all of this was his work and his intelligence that caused me to get admitted, and that I wouldn't have gotten in without his genetics. (He did nothing whatsoever to help me, and honestly, if he wasn't in my life, I would've been able to study much easier). At home, he tells me every single day that just because I got in, it doesn't mean that I'm more intelligent than him. But then, he proceeds to brag about my acceptance to every. effing. person he knows, and how he paved the way for my acceptance. I know this is selfish to think about, but every parent I've met have always told me that they wish their children would look up to me, because of how hard I work.

My dad is a raging alcoholic and drinks multiple times a day. He gets crazy on his alcohol and often comes home very late at night, completely drunk. He gets angry at every effing thing and often throws these child-like and insane tantrums where he screeches at the top of his lungs at every ""mistake"" he finds fit. Writing this now just drives me effing insane. I cannot put into words how much I hate this thing (I refuse to call him a person at this point). Because of his alcoholism and his anger-management issues, he also has high blood pressure. He claims that this is all because of my fault, since I'm the root cause for all of his stress.

My dad is a pervert. I often catch him staring at other women, and he's cheated on my mom multiple times. I came across his phone, and I saw extremely scandalous texts with multiple women. From his texts, I've found out that he is going to some sort of sexual massage shop, and has been texting a specific woman nonstop. I wrote down her phone number. From what I saw on his messages, on my birthday, the woman texted him to come over (despite the fact my dad told her it was my birthday). My dad ended up not celebrating my birthday with me to sleep with her. The texts are absolutely disgusting.

My dad gives me low self-esteem. He often calls me fat and says that I have ugly proportions. (I am a 5'7 girl and 110 lbs I do not think I am overweight). Thankfully, I don't have an eating disorder (I know how mentally difficult that can be), but I feel extremely uncomfortable and unconfident in my body.

My dad is a MISOGYNIST and a RACIST. He often tells me that women are dumber than men, and that I will never be as good as him. He makes fun for marginalized communities and calls disabled people ""losers"". (fun fact: I have a disability). He often makes fun of my disability, and I feel even more rotten when he does so. 

Because of my dad, I have trouble socializing. This a\*\*hole leaves me so mentally drained that I go to school and cannot genuinely enjoy myself. I wish this man would leave my life forever. Unfortunately, I can't do that this easily. College tuition is incredibly expensive and I don't qualify for a lot of aid, so I need my dad to pay for my tuition. I just hope I won't ever have to see him again after college. Please give me advice on what I can do to console myself mentally. I'm 17 years old and I feel extremely tired."
703,3,"15 almost 16f here if that matters. I've been prone to explosive anger for as long as I can remember but it's gotten worse with age. I used to hurt myself when I got mad but that doesn't work anymore. a month ago I broke a vacuum and today I punched a window so hard it broke (it was very thin tbf). there's been more incidents but I'm sure you get the gist of it

does anyone have any advice on what to do instead"
704,3,"I don’t know what causes my anger. Some call it being “triggered” others call it frustration, some have said I might have PTSD. Either way, I will start a conversation with my husband, and somehow when we get to a disagreement, I get defensive to the point I feel I have to defend myself because he doesn’t believe me when I’m telling the truth. Or, he doesn’t like the way I reacted to something he said, and is trying to get me to change the way I think and feel, and I get upset that I’m not allowed to have my current emotion of upset and he’s rushing me on to being in a better mood.

Example:

We are self employed, and choose our own schedule. Our job requires travel, and we got a snow day. It was no one’s fault that the weather prevented us from traveling, and many clients canceled on us themselves to stay safe as well. I was excited to get a day off without it being my fault. I wanted to enjoy the snow and enjoy my free time. But my husband immediately responded to my happy attitude with “this is costing us money.” As if he was reprimanding me for my attitude, and somehow I was supposed to be what, somber and upset? So that threw off my mood because it was the first thing we talked about when we woke up. Then, he saw I wasn’t excited or happy anymore and started telling me not to let it ruin my day and it’s costing us too much money for me to ruin it with a bad mood. How the fuck am I supposed to be happy after I get reprimanded for my initial response? 
So then I became angry, defensive, and the rest of our argument developed to other random subjects and it’s honestly a blur. But at one point he said “I’m sick of this” and I took it as ‘sick of our marriage’ so I set my ring on the table and said take it back. Of course I don’t want to get a divorce but I wanted to show him how hurtful his language is. Then he tells me not to be disrespectful, and that “triggered” me again, because it gave me a flash back of my father treating me the exact same way, and you best believe I damn well didn’t want to marry my father. 
We have discussed as a couple when I start to show signs of anger that he needs to notice the signs and walk away, but every time he would start to say “we need to stop talking, but….” And he would constantly try to get the last word in. I eventually just had to say look, this is what I mean by ending a conversation! And I walked away to a bedroom and slammed the door, then screamed a few good times to let out my frustration.
He couldn’t let me be, followed me to the door, and kept trying to talk at me. “Whenever you’re ready….” I heard him trying to speak between my screams.
Then he said he would give me half an hour to calm down, otherwise he was leaving to go hang out with his family and leaving me at home, which sounded like a threat because that would be an obvious sign to his family that something is wrong if we don’t show up together. 

I honestly feel like my anger is caused and egged on by my husband, and either he is so ignorant that he doesn’t know what he’s doing, or he’s doing it on purpose for some evil reason. But when I point fingers he says “my triggers are my responsibility and that should be empowering” and I need to work on myself and not blame others. 

I feel so gas lit I think I’m going crazy, and no one hears these fights. I tried to record one once, but he got out his phone to record as well, and I got scared he would doctor his recording to make himself sound good and me sound like the villain, because when I get mad I get sassy and rude, and he sounds “calm” even though his words make me so angry. I took both our phones and deleted the arguments so neither of us have proof. 

I will admit I’m not perfect, I know that others aren’t supposed to walk on egg shells around me and force themselves to change while I stay the same, I don’t want to get angry to the point of fight or flight with every disagreement, but I wish someone could see how I am treated and admit it’s like someone is poking the bear. Seriously I’m not a monk, I’m definitely going to react to things others say to me. Everyone does. But I don’t want to throw my wedding ring after every argument. If I could at least find out what causes my anger I could start researching how to get better. Is it psychological, is it a physical imbalance of hormones, is it my husband manipulating me? 

Help appreciated."
705,3," For context I’m 19, and last year, when I was 18, I went through some difficult circumstances that led me to start smoking weed. I wouldn’t say I was a heavy stoner, but I smoked once or twice a day, mainly at night. Thankfully, it hasn’t even been a full year since I started, but I’ve been struggling a lot with controlling my emotions since I stopped.

As a kid I've been known for having a lot of anger issues, like severe anger issues that definitely needed councilong. When I say angry, I mean to the point where my eyes would get bloodshot red, like I was about to explode. My parents considered getting me counseling multiple times, but it never happened due to me being in the Middle East, people there really have full disregard for therapy or counseling . When we moved to the U.S., I hoped things would improve emotionally, but they didn’t. Anger has been the only emotion I feel, like it’s all I’m capable of.

I started smoking weed at 18, even though I never smoked cigarettes or owned a vape. I’m also a D2 college soccer athlete, so smoking at all was pretty unexpected for someone like me. But when I first started, everything just…calmed down. I was still getting mad, but it was never as extreme as the outbursts I had when I wasn’t smoking.

When I stopped smoking, I became very aware of how angry I was. Within a week, I got so mad till started repeatedly punching my room walls until my hands started bleeding, and the scary thing? I didn't even wanna do it,It just did. The rage felt uncontrollable. I tried quitting again a few months ago, but the anger just built up so much I felt trapped, like I was stuck in my life with no progress. Eventually, I started smoking again, and my anger dropped by around 70%.

Now that I’ve quit again, I’m really losing control—not because I miss smoking, but because I just don’t want to feel this constant anger anymore. I’m completely lost. I don’t know what to do or how to handle it. When someone does something that hurts me or I disagree with, my whole body fills with this uncontrollable anger that’s hard to suppress. I borrowed my friend’s weed pen yesterday, but I haven’t touched it. I’m just sitting there, staring at it, not knowing what to do. I’m lost."
706,3,"Long time lurker here. I feel less alone when reading the stories here.

The weight of my anger is consuming me. I don’t know if I can keep holding on.

I keep getting told not to throw away my future but it’s getting hard. I need more support."
707,3,"I’ve been an active smoker for around 10 years. I literally cannot go  8 hours without a jezzy. The reason I smoke it is because I realise that it puts me into a whole different personality, - a calmer, more optimistic, layed back version of me. Throughout my experience with the devils lettuce it’s had an adverse effect on my lack of motivation and drive and I’ve seen it wash a part of me away. It’s as though I’ve almost forgotten who I was before being so hard on it. 
I’ve been feeling like turd about this for a long time all I’ve wanted was to quit and not do it again and it’s like it doesn’t let me face things in life head on but makes me go around them in a sort of way. I realise this is a shxt but I need to fix up and find out who I really am without this right? 
Thing is I have no clue who I am because I’ve smoked so long I can’t remember what it’s like being off it. 
Anyway, 
It’s now the second day of me not smoking anything I threw everything out and dashed it all, and Damn I feel like absolute s h1t. Every small thing is getting to me tht wouldn’t usually p me off when I’m high, but now I’ve not had it two days and damn every small small detailed thing is just getting me so angry, I end up ranting out and I just won’t stfu that thing in me that makes me shut up and not react to any anger when I’m high isn’t there now that I’m not. How do I control that? How do I realise that I need to shut up before making a fool of myself and showing my weaknesses? 
I’ve isolated myself from everyone because I’m afraid my anger will end up making me beat someone behind because I can’t stand smart comments and peoples opinions it’s almost as though the whole worlds caved in on me, and the anxiety? Damn my mind will not shut up at night and I’m wide awake. 
I know time will tell, but I’m worried I’ll do more damage coming off this than being on this and doing a long damage on myself which is worse. I know there’s other things like ambition and actual motivation, you know the one which will make you put in the extra work you think you do when you’re high? 
Any experience or advice because I could really use some. 
I don’t feel like eating anything I have no hunger at all without it and damn I feel like my bowels full of bricks 🧱 dry bricks, 
I don’t mind the physical, it’s about controlling the anger. What should I do? 
Thanks guys n sorry for the long life story "
708,3,"I'm a 26m with diagnosed ADHD, I understand that ADHD can cause emotional irregularities and imbalance. This doesn't meant that it is the primary issue but a possible one. So due to this, it is difficult to manage my anger in an appropriate way. I don't know if it was my upbringing or otherwise but, those times have passed and I cannot blame my current actions based on what happened. I tend to become explosive in my anger whenever there is a period where I feel cornered, betrayed or deeply concerned about an issue (whether it be family related or otherwise). Although I do make efforts to manage my anger, I have a feeling that it may take over any decision making process I have in the future.

I was wondering if there are any resources that I could start with for managing my anger so if I do plan on having a family it wouldn't affect them?"
709,3,"Hi, I am a 24F mom of 2 and I am having a very hard time with my anger. I almost feel like I have tried all. A little back story about me, I’d like to say I had a pretty decent childhood. I never experienced any sort of physical or emotional violence. My parents were both actively around. I didn’t have many friends, had some romantic relationships here and there. It was overall normal. I was diagnosed at 15 with Bipolar Disorder II after being hospitalized for a failed suicide attempt. Diagnosis’ kinda followed me throughout my teenage years. I was 19 when I had my daughter, thought I knew what parenting was. Was very, VERY wrong and in for a big surprise. I have always had anger issues as long as I could remember over irrational things, but they did not come out or I guess get worse until I had children. As a child, I would stub my toe and go as far as to rip everything in my room apart, throw things around, dent the wall, things of that nature. But as a parent I grew accustomed to smacking my daughter’s mouth & hand. I know some may say that some children need that sort of discipline. The thing is my daughter is GREAT, truly. A wonderful child. When I react, it is typically just that - a reaction. It is not because she is doing something wrong, it is because I get so overwhelmed and overstimulated that I end up smacking her mouth or hand. Afterwards I feel so awful and instantly regret it. I am also this way with pets. I have owned dogs before and smacked them or kicked their butt when I get frustrated. I never seen that growing up, I actually seen the complete opposite. I get so irritated if my pets aren’t listening or pee on the floor. Something so small and minuscule just sends me into a crisis. The primary areas of my life anger affects is my relationship with my kids, my relationships with my own animals, and driving. I would say I do have road rage. Not so severe that I am pulling over and getting out of the car, but I definitely will tailgate someone if they pulled in front of me or lock up my brakes to someone behind me, etc. At work though, if you were to talk to me, you’d never know these issues exist. It’s like I can put on a mask to those people and pretend to be normal, but my kids and dog get the blunt of the blow. I don’t get why or how to change it. It’s important to know that I am in therapy, I know I have an issue. I am currently on 300mg Lithium for Bipolar, 500mg Depakote for the Anger, and then I just started Quelbree 100mg for ADHD. My kids flinch when I raise my hand. I know that’s not normal and it hurts me so bad. I love my kids I really do. I know I don’t beat them but it is not normal for your child to flinch at you. I don’t need my kids to be scared of me. I want them to trust me and confide in me. I don’t know what to do. I’ve read to stop before reacting but it is just rage in the moment. Like the other day, my daughter cried and it was so high pitched and ear piercing it just sent me into a rage and felt like smacking her mouth but I didn’t. There is no rationalizing in that moment. I am taking medication, I guess I just don’t get what is wrong with me. They’ve diagnosed me with Bipolar, Borderline, and ADHD. My doctor says that I have PTSD from childhood, but I can’t recall any traumatic events that would’ve resulted in me being the way I am. I know this is a lot but I am trying to be the best mom I can. I am trying to do right by my kids. We dont get hit as adults when we do something incorrectly so I want the same thing for my children. Any advice, any help, any recommendations, any ideas or personal experience or relatable suggestions would be appreciated and I will read each and every one of them. Thank you again. "
710,3,"It happened yesterday. 

And it was so stupid. 

Both the kids were sick and I was going to have to stay home to watch them both. I lost it because I felt like I had something so important to do that the kids would ruin it. 

She ended up taking the kids to school sick since she was afraid to leave them with me in that state. 

I didn't hit her but I definitely was aggressive and showed my physical dominance. 

I'm really ashamed of it and our house has not been the same. It feels really dark right now. 

And you know what? I didn't do my important work because instead I stressed all day at how I reacted. 

When I get angry I have strong physical feelings. I literally feel the rage boiling up. And it's like even though I know I'm wrong, I can't stop. I keep going. I keep pushing. I keep fucking up. It's like I see it from an outside perspective but actively choose to ignore it. 

I'm so embarrassed. Not only that I acted that way but especially because my kids saw me like that. They were scared. I don't want them to fear me. I don't want them to learn my behaviors. I also don't want my wife to feel like she can't trust me or be around me or leave the kids with me. 

I don't know what to do. I obviously need to do better but I'm really upset right now. 😔💔"

""Get a life"" 
""Stop playing if it gets you mad"" 

I want to solve this anger And do better "
712,3,"Almost 20f, despite having plenty mental health and family issues, I never considered myself an angry person. I sometimes argued  but it never went out of hand. However last night I felt like all my limits have been crossed and I couldn't control myself. My mother, whom I still live with despite my age, has issues with anxiety, alcohol + is ill with cancer and constantly talks about commiting suicide (rest of my family says it is emotional manipulation but idk I feel like she is serious), yesterday evening she came back from my grandparents house because they had fight about her alcohol issues and they pointed out she is drunk. After coming inside, she expected me to comfort her instantly but since I am also tired of ther addiction I couldn't bring myself to do it. I felt overwhelmed and went outside just in my pajamas and coat. Went to grandparents house and talked about the situation, then went for a walk to decompress. After coming back inside around 10 pm she started accusing me of aligning against her, having no love for her and no empathy.
This moment I lost all the control and started screaming like I was skinned alive, walking around the flat, for maybe 20-30 seconds and beating my own face and legs, screamed something about killing myself and that my family should never procreate so I wouldn't have to deal with all of this. I have never had such an outburst before, I would selfharm, sometimes I would scream for a second but NOT LIKE THAT. It was fullblown meltdown. I live in post-soviet apartment block, the walls are thin as fuck. Few moment after that we heard knocking on our doors, it was our neighbours asking if we need help because they thought somebody broke in and attacked us! My mother answered and said ""my daughter has a panic attack"". I never has been so ashamed in my live of my own action. To be clear - I am adult woman, not a child and I am not diagnosed with any condition that can cause such meltdowns. My behavious can't be excused and I should control myself better. Now I am scared to even leave my flat because I am afraid of meeting my neighbours who propably ALL heard me that night, and think I am insane or abuse my mother. I ditched  from going to lectures today, and I am afraid of even going to grocery store. I feel so embarrased of myself, and I am afraid I made my mother feel guilty when she is the most ill of all of us and she is the one that needs most help and support - not me.
How I move foward from something like this? "
713,3,What Medication is best suitable for a very angry combative 80+ with heart and kidney problems to calm them down?
714,3,"I can’t control my anger, I grew up in a very volatile and controlling environment where screaming and sometimes physical violence were often a norm. Breaking things and putting holes in walls were pretty constant with my father. I’m 28 and for the longest I took pride in being able to control my anger then things took a turn in 2018 I started dating a girl who was the female version of my father constantly getting angry over small things, emotional abuse and controlling behavior and the pandemic didn’t make things better being trapped with her and now I have found myself since then slipping into my rage whenever anyone does even something small to to upset me and I don’t want to be this person. I swore I’d never be this type of person."
715,3,"I can't do it anymore. I have been cramming every once of frustration I've had over the year for as long as I can remember I could never act out, I know I'm strong enough to cause serious harm if I loose control. I know this might sound like those sigma edit crap but it's very real for me. I started punching my jaw at the office after have my works ripped apart for the gazillionth time, I cannot and  refuse to present vague  indecisive word soup my manager so loves. My parents are obsessive and I seem to be in a never ending debt to them. Never once have the told me they are proud but I remember them being disappointed in the way I was.

717,3,I have a bad habit of setting grudges towards people and holding onto them for a long time.

Any advice?
718,3,"Hello everyone, I'm reaching out for help and guidance. As a 20-year-old girl, I've struggled with anger issues for a while now. Despite being known as the 'funny friend,' I've always felt sad and alone inside.

I often find myself exploding in anger over minor issues within my family, and I instantly regret my harsh words towards my parents and siblings. Unfortunately, therapy is unaffordable for me right now, and I'm currently unemployed.

I long to be a kind and soft-spoken person, but my anger seems to control my mind and words. The guilt and self-loathing that follow these outbursts are overwhelming, and I've spent many nights crying over the terrible things I've said.

I desperately need advice or guidance on managing my anger. I fear losing the people I love due to my temper. If anyone can offer support or suggestions, I'd greatly appreciate it :)"
719,3,"I know the easy answer is of course say less lol easier said than done in the moment. 

I am pretty sensitive but my go to emotion is always anger (usually with tears lol) but I tend to go off on rants to everyone and anyone who will listen to the situation and there are no boundaries with me. It’s like my brain goes off and takes over and I can’t stop. 

The problem lies in the fact that the situation always gets worse because of said rant. Sometimes the person I’m angry about or with will find out the nasty things I said which makes my mental health plummet more than it was when I was angry. 

Is there a way to say less?? I count to ten, I walk away, and I just can’t let it roll off my shoulders or shake it off or anything. It festers forever. "
720,3,"It's funny how considerably long periods of time can pass without huge arguments taking place between us and then it just happens again and I wonder ""why did I ever think this man was somewhat likeable?"". I'm 26 and still living with my parents (unfortunately). He has major anger issues. He's never been physically abusive to my mum (from what I know of) but he's been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to my older sister and me. Now that we're grown up, he doesn't hit us but he does all the rest. Threats, yelling, irony, slamming doors, breaking things and storming out, silent treatment. I truly hate how I'm forever damaged by all of this and how even now after so much therapy, I feel scared whenever he gets mad."
721,3,"Ever since a kid, I have been a massive sore loser. Rarely lost at anything so when I did, I was a huge dummy spitter. Now I’m older I can control it fine, until something tiny and insignificant happens.

Just tiny stupid things and I feel my entire body heating up from the inside until I punch something. I always punch something hard. Wood wall, concrete floor, brick wall, my fists together etc. My hands are always swollen and bruised. 
Bigger things that would piss most people off don’t bother me at all. I come across as a very chill, relaxed guy where nothing seems to bother me, but I have this (literally) burning rage inside me that only comes out when I fail at pathetic things.

722,3,"Hey guys, I need advice on how to fix myself. Me and my partner have been together for 3 years. Myself 27 and she’s 32. She has a problem with anxiety and often thinks the worst case scenario for small things involving her and I. On multiple occasions I’m embarrassed to say we had an argument about if I wanted to be with her which also led to me yelling to try and convince her that yes I do want to be with her. I feel like the more I try and “convince” her the more upset I get. She says I don’t listen to her and honestly I don’t. I only realise that after the argument and I’ve settled down. I reached a certain point where I yelled and called her stupid, threw a water bottle on the floor and slapped my hand on the wall multiple times. This is not the first time I’ve reacted like this. I don’t know why I said it but I told her that I wanted to break up. After 45 minutes she came to me crying saying she was sorry and she didn’t want us to break up. Of course I didn’t either so I said me neither. She’s obviously confused and hurt and scared of how I reacted and I want to stop this behaviour pattern. Yes she annoys me sometimes but I love her with all my heart and don’t want to continue to hurt her. Please give me advice thank you"

However, he understands that he still has the pre disposition to anger still in him and he fears that he may have bursts of anger with his future significant other. Is there any resources for him to help with his anger. Therapy is expensive where we live so that is out of the question. "
726,3,"My boyfriend's close friend/roommate betrayed him by dating my boyfriend's long-term girlfriend, either at the end of their relationship or directly after the breakup. It was scummy and he repeatedly lied about it to my boyfriend. The whole friend group agreed that the roommate was in the wrong, but kept being friends with them. My boyfriend sank into a bad mental health spiral because of that and took him years to get out of it.

Recentlyish, the ex and the roommate got married. Despite everyone agreeing that they were wrong, they all attended the wedding and made it out like it was no big deal. One even asked to stay at my boyfriend's house to attend the wedding! My boyfriend was devastated that all of his friends went to celebrate a relationship that had hurt him so much and I supported him while this was all happening. I saw firsthand how badly it affected him and it put a permanent mark on his friends in my mind. He wasn't himself for months.

My boyfriend has since made up with his friends, but I don't have the decade-plus history with them that he does. I can't get past my anger at how they treated him. All I can do is act friendly when we hang out but it feels so fake. I don't abide that kind of foolishness in my own affairs. I would have cut them all out back when they still kept hanging out with the roommate after everything came to light. It isn't my place to make decisions like that for my boyfriend though, and for his sake I'm trying my hardest not to look too disgusted around his friends all the time.

Ultimately, I'm still angry. I stay awake in bed thinking of what I'd say to them if I could. I've written letters that I'll never send, I've journaled ad nauseam, I gave some of them a piece of my mind back when it all happened, but nothing has put a dent in my anger. Does anyone have any tools, methods, literature, advice, anything I can use to try and shake this? It isn't serving me and it's affecting my sleep negatively. "

I hit myself when I’m angry. It’s been for ages I’m doing it. It can be legs or head.

732,3,"Hi,

I've noticed that I make really bad impulsive decisions when faced with road-rage causing situations.

For example, in the past week, I had two incidents where someone else on the road was accelerating to merge faster than me even though they were behind me on a two-lane freeway on ramp.

My natural reaction is to try to accelerate even quicker than them, and then try to cut them off. Everything happens so fast, so in the spur of the moment, I take action on a whim, before really thinking the situation through.

Browsing Reddit, I know that I should just let the other person go, and that it's not worth it to drive aggressively or put others in danger. I usually only remember that it's not worth it right after.

Everything happens so fast and it seems like my brain decides to take action faster than I can think rationally.

I want to see if anyone has tips on how I can control my impulse/instinct. Thank you."
733,3,"Words can't describe how much I hate these people. They stay calm and manipulative because they know someone like me or you is kind-hearted just justifiably angry at the world. And then they say we're crazy not them. I've met many people who cross that border and say "" you act like all nice half the time then you freak out on people"" yes. Most people with anger issues are very very nice people. We just don't like to see Injustice in this world. There's nothing wrong or narcissistic with saying that you are a great person, its self love. I have been around a lot of emotionally abusive people who do that smug calm thing where they know they're wrong but they're purposely trying to get you angry because they know your issues, know you'll snap and look crazy and therefore they will be in the right in their heads & to society. I'm not going to crap all over myself for having anger issues, I do it because I don't like the way I see people treat each other all around. At this point I don't even want anger management or help, I am glad for my anger issues cuz I am a passive person and I see my anger issues as a form of self-defense not a defect. If your anger is interrupting your life, definitely get help. But if it's a form of self-defense embrace it. The world needs more people standing up to jerk offs."
734,3,Every time I get angry or stressed out I tend to smack myself on the head super hard. I know this isn't a good thing to do and I was wondering if anyone here has any advice on dealing with this issue. Thank you for reading this and have a nice day :)
735,3,"I was dumb enough to quit my job and move away with a relationship partner 💔 and it didn't work out but before that I was depressed and lonely ,getting taken advantage by family members , I was at the time substituting work for companionship and what made it worst was the fact that I never grieved the loss of my grandmother who raised me actually, the way I found out still bothers me .. I went to the hospital that day after work ,I get to the floor walk into her room and noticed she is not there, so I go to the nurse station and asked the nurse ""where is my grandmother"" she gives me a vacant look one of those ""he doesn't know looks ""so I asked again the next thing I know a security officer is standing next to me and we start to talk...he takes me into a conference room with a bunch of doctors who tell me in a clinical way the patient expired and that they called my mother , so I called home and she said is there something wrong ,I tell her yes and asked her to come to the hospital, so she and my youngest sis arrived and I told her ""Grandma is dead"" the worst day of my life 
It made me angry at God for multiple reasons 
And to be honest I felt no one was or is there in my trials and tribulations ,...I probably would have committed suicide but I was too weak and scared to do so ....I felt God forsakened me , betrayed me by leaving me out her by myself "

738,3,"My friend whom I’ve had a “situationship” with for over three years got a side job where they only have to work 10 hours a month and will make $700 extra on top of their regular income. The opportunity they got is great. It’s the perfect side gig for someone with a full time job already. I wish I could get opportunities like that. I don’t necessarily want another job, a side gig, or to be doing what they’ll be doing but I wish I had things present themselves to me like that. I guess I’m mad/jealous because part of me feels I get the short end of the stick a lot or that things are harder for me than others. I also think there’s some insecurity related to feeling that I’m always going to be on the outside looking in, missing out on life, and that I’ll always struggle and be alone. It’s like I want some validation that I’m okay and that my life is acceptable. I also want to move on from this person but it’s hard as they’re my only good friend.

739,3,"I’m here to learn more about anger, particularly the expression of it to other people. From a young age I learned being angry was bad and showed you were too weak to control your emotions. Now I see things very differently and believe that healthy anger is a powerful thing in strengthening relationships to others. Thing is, it’s so deeply engrained that I have trouble making a change. Is anyone else this way? If not, maybe some folks would want to chat so we can pull each other to center! "
740,3,"The reason why I feel anger at my body is because of how I feel about parts of it that are different from other women (inferior to).

I’m going to start seeing a therapist, but what should someone do when they feel a sense of anger at their body?

It’s like a cycle: my body is the way it is, and then I feel saddened, upset, and angered by it. Then I feel angry at my body and feel very negatively towards and about it. But my anger at my body is due to it being the way it is. I feel like my anger at my body is justified and almost like my body deserves the anger I have at it, like my body is wrong in some way. I’m really frustrated and fed up with how my body is; this isn’t the body I want to have and it’s upsetting to me that in society the part of my body that is a total failure has so much importance to men, in relationships, in general, etc. I’m so sick of having the body I have, and I think that that’s why I feel the anger I feel; I’ve felt frustrated by this issue for years now with no break from it. I’ve never had the body that other women get to woke up in and easily have :(

It’s distressing to think that myself and my body have never possessed the same value and worth that other women and their bodies have because of how my body is. And because my body is the way it is and I feel like it’s my body’s fault, I just keep feeling generally unhappy with and negatively about my body.

I don’t want to feel this way about my body forever. I’m sick of it. But I don’t know what to do about the anger."

742,3,"I’m 26(m), I have BAD adhd, I’m so very happily married. I have a wonderful job, and a blessed life, Praise God, but holy CRAP I get so upset, irritated, annoyed, and angry over every inconvenience, large, or small. Going behind someone going 15 under the speed limit, or someone that keeps speeeeding up, and slooooowing down (every. Day. After. Work) I drop something, pick it up, only to drop it again. Lose something (all the time), I blow a fuse, over anything that inconveniences me. Now, I have to add in, I do not react physically. I have verbal ‘tantrums’, and just spout off whatever it is I’m feeling at that very moment, until I cool off. I also have to add in, my wife is not on the receiving end of any of this. She has talked to me, concerned (lovingly) and tells me that it’s not worth it, and it’ll affect my health down the line. I know she’s right, and I hate that I’m this way, but the thing is, it feels like when one bad thing, or inconvenience happens to me? It’s 4-5 more in a row. I have no time to simmer, or recover from the last thing, it’s just a straight domino affect. I’ve searched, and searched, and searched myself, to figure out why I’m like this. I’ve wondered if it has any ties to my tinnitus, my back, and knee pain, is it my adhd?, is it simply a severe lack of patience due to my inability to cope with certain things? I lost my father at 17, my best friend 9 months later, my grandfather a year and a half later, and just recently, my stepfather. I wonder if it has to do with any of those things. I hate being this way. There was a time in my life where I had risen above that behavior, but ever since my father passed away, it feels like I’ve been hit with everything. For a few months, I worked for a 62 year old man in heating and air, who did nothing but scream at me, call me useless, etc etc, all because I had some trouble learning a few things. Idk, probably because he yelled at me, instead of teaching me? I was fired from 2 jobs in less than 9 months apart, finding out later that the only reason I was fired from the first, was because a woman in the workplace said “I reminded her of her ex husband” and the second job, because I refused to go full time. I feel like all these experiences in life are being channeled into pure bitterness. It’s a road I do not want to be on any further.

As of right now my slightly above minimum wage job gives me such shitty hours- 2 hours every other day every other week giving me the fucking run around. I would like to actually put time into something valuable like CPR, how to change a tire, how to fix and repair various things. And here I am dropping food into a fucking fryer. That’s not something I’d want to teach my kids one day. Everybody pisses me off, I swear to fucking god the next person who pisses me off at work is gonna get oil splashed into their fucking face. I don’t want anything more than to have some stuck up asshole crying like like a little bitch for their life on the brink of death, I don’t care if I live or die at this point in my fucking life, it’s so hard to get even a minimum wage job because of the shitty fucking job market, not shitty work ethic, my mental health is already bad and work takes my mind away from it. I’m going to work on getting my GED and going into literally anything valuable. When people make smart ass comments to me I think of 20 ways to kill them right then and there and they think I fucking won’t, they think I’m just gonna take it.

Other kids could go out to the big city for concerts and parties. Meanwhile my ass was driving a car that would constantly break down, I would alternate between the same shirts constantly, and couldn’t get a fucking haircut because my dad was taking all my paychecks which I only got one of before moving out. I just fucking hate life, I’ve been doing lines of coke, and shrooms to try to alleviate my anger and anxiety. And I’ve quit weed as it was making my symptoms worsen.

747,3,"I want to say my anger has been better. I haven’t posted here in a while. To the New Year, Happy New Years guys and girls.

My anger has been calmer than it’s been. 

Sobriety helped me more than I can think of.

This may not apply to everyone, but I want to say sometimes your issues aren’t your fault. The accountability will always fall on you for your reactions though.

Dec 14th my old dog urinated on my parents bed. My dog has diabetes and ate cookies my father left on the floor (in a box in his at home office) . That causes my dog to urinate a lot. 

My parents got home late and as they my dog hopped on their bed he pee’d. 

My mom drunk as usually lost her cool. She went on a screaming rant for about 15 minutes and 5 minutes into her rant I screamed at the top of my lungs.

My first reaction was to hurt her. I’ve never had that to a women in my life. My vision went black and my entire body hurt as if I was hit my a truck.

I was sitting in my room alone. I was sitting in my chair late at night fixing my computer or something. 

I stood up from my chair then fell back into it after my vision went dark. All my joints felt like they were on fire. Knowing my prior history and reaction with sudden outburst I decided to message my sister and a group I’m in for dudes just trying to fix their shit. I explained what happened and told them how my mom said she was going to kill my dog, and crush his skull, and leave him out in the cold, and feed him chocolate so he dies, and they she doesn’t care if he dies, and how she wants him dead, and how he’s better off in the ground.

What she said hurt me a lot. My dog is 14 and slowly on his way out. My mom turns into a massive issue when she’s drunk and she normally starts issues. She’s yelled out the car window many times as my dad drove when she’s drunk. She has been drinking daily again.


December 14th, once I snapped I realized that I’m not at fault for my issues with reactions and anger even though I hold myself accountable. 
 - on that day I realized she is the cause of majority of my issues. It’s behavior I’ve learned from her. It’s the daily anxiety she gives me. I’ve never felt safe at home. Nobody’s violent, but the yelling happens. 

My birthday was on the 16th. I decided to stay out of the house until my birthday honestly for cake if it was there. 

The December 17th I went to my sisters apartment while her and her roommate were at work. I started to write in my journal again. I had one drink to allow myself to feel depressed and vulnerable with myself. While writing I figured my behavior out, with anger and tears. 

I haven’t cried that hard since I was 16 and suicidal. I cried while writing, hyperventilating, shaking, with burst of anger and sadness. I prayed to let God make me feel my pain. I felt it all. In that moment I realized it’s not my fault. It’s hers, and I need to fix my anger before I ruin everything and burn bridges as I’ve always had. 

Good Will Hunting - “It’s not your fault.” Scene hit me like a truck.

To everyone struggling, it’s not always your fault. It can be your environment. It can most definitely be your parents. Just know not everything it’s your fault, but take accountability for those you hurt in your journey. 

Self-righteous behavior and outburst is a losing game. There is no reward behind anger no matter how good and easy that form of venom tastes. Took me two years of hard mental work to get to this point, it’s not easy but life will be more peaceful. You aren’t alone in your internal fight. You aren’t always at fault. 

Message me if you have to. I saw myself old self this month at a church. This guy a year younger than me, he has issues and I saw me in him. I realized not every angry person is a bad guy. No I saw this dude in so much pain and he is running from himself and he’s insecure. He hasn’t accepted himself. I can’t fix him, but maybe I can help him. 

Know not every angry d-bag is a bad guy. Maybe they are in the same pain you’re in. Remember that. December changed me. Healed a part of my broken self, maybe helping the “enemy” can heal you as well.
"
748,3,"Starting around age 11, I threw temper tantrums. Around age 13, I had outrageous fits of anger against my parents. I started having OCD but did not know what that was. Once, at age 12, I punched my pregnant mother in the stomach, not hard because some part of me did not want to cause that kind of damage. There were times when I threw dishes, had physical fights with my father, cursed, and screamed. 

At age 16 I was sent to live with my aunts. The fits of anger ceased immediately. Once, when I went back to my parents, it happened again. 

Now, as an adult, I suffer chronic depression, fear going to hell, and get really angry when I feel rejected. I know longer have fits of rage but sometimes an angry verbal response slips out.

I don’t know whether I am a bad seed.
"
749,3,"For context, my parents are heavy drinkers. I had plans to go out with my mother tomorrow morning, and she changed the plans immediately. I could already tell with how she was slurring her words that she was drunk. I was mildly upset with the plans changing so suddenly, but it was fine. I was more bothered by the fact that she lied to me. She told me that my brother had deliberately changed our plans, but she actually did and just wouldn't tell me. I asked my brother, and he denied it. I tried asking her why she lied to me, but it wasn't getting through to her. She just kept saying, ""What's the major issue??"" Despite me not actually being upset about the plan change, but upset about the unexpected and unnecessary lies. After maybe an hour of going back and forth over the phone while she talked over me and threw insults at me like, ""You're just like your father!!"" I was crying on the floor, screaming about how much I hate alcohol. I never hated an inanimate object so much before. The amount of rage I felt over a literal liquid was insane. It ruined my family, and I vowed to stay away from it, so I didn't turn into my parents, especially like father, but then it happened. I kicked a hole in my wall. My heel created a circle, and part of the wall fell inwards. It was already too late. I had turned into my father. I had thrown stuff. Yes, it was only a Croc, or maybe a screw. But still. I had already turned into the violent man I never wanted to be. It already hit me that this ab*se was generational, and I tried to avoid it. But holy shit man. I kicked a hole in my wall. The worst I'd do when angry was throw something, maybe like a pillow, nothing enough to cause real damage. But this time I had done it. I had kicked a hole in my own bedroom wall because of anger against an object, or more specifically, anger against my parents. After my anger died down, I was just sitting in disbelief. It genuinely feels silent in my mind. When I did it, it didn't even feel like me. I'm literally disgusted looking back on myself now kicking it, as if I'm witnessing another person's disgusting behaviour. My dad's gonna be pissed, but I'm more devasted over the fact I did it. Reddit isn't the best place of advice, but my god, I need somebody to even give me the smallest amount of it right now. I am disgusted in myself. I want to change. I've tried so hard. This was the very thing I avoided. I told myself, once I grow older and live on my own, they'll be no more angry man to haunt me. But what do I do if that angry man has now embedded himself into my soul and makes me act this way? Please, anybody, just help me out."
750,3,"So I've been listening to the Anger Secrets podcast for a bit and I quite like the simple, to-the-point style that the dude has. He feels genuine to a degree and I've actually been able to understand my anger more because of the simplicity of his knowledge. It's no substitute for actual help though and I wanted to enroll in his course for the resources but it's so expensive. I feel if there was an effort to help more people the course wouldn't be so pricey but if it is a truly good resource I would be willing to invest money into it so my life can be better. Has anyone had any experience with it? Or does this just seem like a man who is putting money before it all. I know there are much much much much cheaper courses but I felt connected to the teachings in a way I haven't before."
751,3,"So I'm not sure if I'm alone here, but when I'm angry, I almost feel like a different person. Not in a different identity type thing, but I see things a certain way when in mad; and I feel as though I'm 1000% valid in why I feel the way that I do, and in my actions.

However, once things settle, I reflect and feel like I usually was a major asshole, and reacted super poorly. But for whatever reason, I can't see that in the moment.

Also, I need serious help how to shut it off. For example, my wife and I get into an argument, and now I'm upset. Whenever I'm around my children, I can't turn that ""upset"" off. I don't take it out on them or anything like that, but I also can't ""fake it for the kids"" and give them a happy parent.

I'm tired of being stuck in this same cycle.

I hope this doesn't sound crazy."
752,3,"Warning: Self harm

Since last month, I noticed that i have gotten a very drastic reaction to for me stressful or emotional situations. I have often thoughts of inflicting myself harm for example to cut myself with a knife. I don’t really want to kill myself but the thought come and go. I already identified it as a way of avoiding a problem or my current situation. It is more a reaction to distract myself  and I provably the pain is some sort of distraction from mental thoughts.

The problem is that I have the reaction with every really stressful situation and I want to find another way to calm myself down. 

Yes,
1. I have a therapist but could not talk with her about it as I did not have a termin with her

753,3,"I don't know about you guys, but sometimes I find shopping at the supermarket is one of the most frustrating tasks for me to accomplish. I don't get usually get annoyed with staff or anything, though most of my anger gets directed towards other shoppers. I feel like so many people don't bother using manners now. It feels like no one even tries to say ""Excuse me"" when they need to get by, nobody has any spatial awareness in the aisles, nobody has any concept of personal space when they reach for something near me, etc. I could go on and on. It bothers the hell out of me. 

It gets even worse when I go to work, as I am employed as a curbside shopper at my local grocery store. I want to stress that I don't hate the job at all, it's easy work for decent pay, but dealing with people gets far more frustrating when you're on a time crunch. It doesn't bother me nearly as much when I'm doing my own shopping on my days off. I have all the time in the world then.

For those of you who have also struggled with this, did you ever end up getting better at managing your anger while shopping? What are some things you did that were helpful?"
754,3,"I’ve just had some unfortunate events happen in my personal life that have left me so hurt, sad, but more than anything angry. I feel like I need to physically allow this anger to be released. lol If anyone has gone to a rage room and want to share their experience I would appreciate it!! "
755,3,"I don't get angry most of the times because somehow I've learnt a little self-control lately. However, things in my life are not so good right now both mentally and financially. That's why I am not fearing death. I have thought of suicide, but I will only prefer sudden death any day. I get angry on people and realise later that it's hurtful to them when I think from their perspective. I mean how would they know why I did get angry for no reason at all? They did not do anything, yet because of my current life situation, anger arises randomly and I don't think anything before saying curse words (discretely) even at my own loved ones and mostly strangers. Cursing out loud is just something I've been doing. When I look at road conditions and garbage in my country India, I curse out loud. When I'm in the bus, I curse at people when I feel little inconvenience like not having enough leg space as I'm tall. I curse when I see smoke from vehicles at my face. 

Some days later, I realise it's all self-destruction, but nothing else. In reality, I'm not angry at people. I'm angry at myself. I want everything to be perfect. Yet I can't help it. At the end of the day, I realise other people didn't seem to bother what I get bothered about every day. "
756,3,"I don't actually do it as much as I used to, but anytime I am upset I just want to go directly for their soft spots. It's so mean and I hate it. My neighbor pissed me off today real bad and insulted me and my partner. I am fighting so hard not to go over and tell her off or write a really mean letter.
I don't know where else to direct my anger.

757,3,"I've tapered off lamotrigine, Zoloft, and abilify for the past 2 months. I'm off all of them now. In the past couple weeks, I've just been so angry all the time. I wake up in the worst mood and can't kick it. I'm more irritable than ever and it's affecting my marriage and work. I have also been experiencing skin crawling/itching at night and it's so agitating.  Has anyone else experienced this? Was it just a phase?"
758,3,"...just want to share and see if i get any feedback on this. 

 In my family my father used to have a lot of this and all my siblings and I. So, it´s been for me quite normal to have anger attacks...and also quite normal to lose relationships, friends or to be given the mad treatment at work...as if I were a mad (not far from reality) one or psychotic person or just a bad person.

 I´m gonna start therapy in two weeks, and i´ve done therapy in the past. I have had three anger attacks in the last 5 months, 2 with my ex-GF and one at my work.

 I´ve tried things in the past as sport (and i keep doing it), meditation, journaling, etc.

 ...But even when i´m not having those attacks i feel very impatient for everything, stressed out and seems i can´t have fun when other people have...And i´m not a child anymore.

...i don´t know if anyone relate to this, could give me some feedback or whatever. I really apreciate that. I´m new in this sub.

Thanks in advance and sorry for bad typing. English isn´t my first language."
759,3,"Im a very angry person, and I never used to be this way. It started when I was in high school and I feel like it has only gotten worse. My anger makes me hateful towards everyone, and I know it is ruining my life. I physically cannot control myself when I get mad, I have to hurt myself in order for it to go away. I want to be happy but nothing has ever helped improve my anger. I have never been to a therapist for this because I do not trust them, and don’t want to open up to a stranger, but I don’t see any other option to escape myself. I have tried everything to make my anger issues go away, but I feel like they will be chained to me for the rest of my life"
760,3,"Even though I'm quite calm and prudent when I'm in a social group, whenever I cannot see them I just start becoming extremely misanthropic and get sadistic thoughts. "
761,3,"Whenever I get really, really mad over something, my thought is *never* that I should be less angry about it, it's that the thing that pissed me off shouldn't have happened. I can't *decide* to not be angry, so I can't *decide* to do breathing exercises or whatever other BS some people insist will help either. Even *thinking* about it makes my skin crawl; having to actually do it (on the few occasions I've been forced to) feels like being forced to hug or handshake someone who just punched me in the face. I *can* restrain myself and I can do it about as well as most other people, but being told to go out of my way do something that will supposedly make me less mad is in my opinion no different than simply being told to """"""""""calm down""""""""""."
762,3,...an anger addict here.
763,3,"i have very bad anger issues, today in the morning my mom made me bread which got me mad because I already eat alot less and only two times a day one at 11am and other at 5pm and a slice of bread isn't enough for me but I held it in (I know I'm sounding very bratty that's cuz i am) then at 5pm, I just asked she can make something else, anything works, she asks me what I wanna eat, i say ""make whatever is available in the house because usually there is nothing"", her tone shifted and she started talking really loudly

she wasn't shouting but she was being loud and mad, I can't handle loud sounds so I started crying and she started screaming at me more then I started having flashbacks which i already was having since the very bread incident, 

my mom cheated on my dad because my dad is emotionally abusive (divorce isn't an option in my family) and my dad tried to kill himself thrice infront of me, I was the one who saved him, i used to sleep with a knife at nights because I was always scared that he'll do it again and try to lock me in my room

At the end my dad blamed it on me and how I'm a bad person who never cares about anyone which hurts because I was there for him at his lowest but whenever I used to cry they both used to shout at me and call me names 

this was when I was 15, things have changed now I'm 19 and next year I'll be going to college, they have improved alot as people and i don't hate them but if they call me out on anything (rightfully so) sometimes, everything comes spinning back, I wanna cry, I wanna scream over stupid things 

so, yeah, back to today when my mom started screaming (it wasn't exactly screaming, she was just talking really loudly idk how to differentiate between those two) she called me an ass and I called her a crazy woman, i went inside of my room and she comes in, starts screaming and everything after that is blurry for me, I get mad throw stuff at her, i gave my water bottle to her and asked her to hit me, she didn't so I threw it against the wall and then she did, I know it's my fault, I wanna control my anger because it was such a small issue

 my parents never understand why I'm always mad at them, they think i get this angry for no reason and don't mean the things I say but I do mean the things I say, i don't wanna be like this, I want to not get angry, I want to be normal please help "
764,3,"Hi all. I am an angry person in many regards. I have a delusional rebrand in my mind that I’m just “passionate” but in reality I have deep anger issues. I’m working on it, slowly but surely. One issue around it (there are many) is that my partner uses it to avoid accountability for their actions. Any time I bring up something they’ve done that has hurt me, it is flipped around to be about my anger. They have even admitted they do this, and told me that if I wasn’t so angry then I could actually make my point. Which is probably true. 

What are some steps to tackle anger? My dad was like this. Angry about everything and nothing. So are my brothers. My mom has shown anger in front of me maybe twice in my life. 

Help. Thanks. "
765,3,"im going to start this by saying i have a pretty good life. i live with my mom. we have money. we definitely aren’t rich or anything, but comfortable. i have people who care about me. i’m not neglected or beaten or anything to provoke this. 

i am so so so angry all of the time. the smallest things set me off and it’s gotten to a point where it isn’t normal anger. it’s anger so severe that it takes over my body. i’m so serious. i never understood what people meant so literally until now when they said that. when im mad, i feel it. mostly in my legs and arms. it’s indescribable, like an ache that doesn’t hurt. like an itch that doesn’t feel actually itchy. it’s just there and it needs something to be done. it takes every bone in me to stop from flailing around or getting violent. it feels like a need. i don’t even know how to word this, it’s just so intense that i feel like i need to do something about it. i’ll feel the need to start thrashing around and hitting anything in sight or just something. i don’t know what i need but i just know i can feel the anger and it needs out and in that moment nothing is more important than doing that. 

this is understandable when you’re really angry, but the thing is im getting like this all the time throughout the day. i hate how bratty this sounds but its like my mom could say anything to me, she can be being nice to me and do absolutely nothing that should provoke me, but i suddenly snap at the sound of her voice and get that pulsing feeling throughout my body while the only thing on my mind is how angry that just made me and what id like to do about it. the thoughts usually turn violent. for example, i saw a little boy the other day being disobedient and obnoxious overall. he wouldn’t listen to his mom for anything, and just kept doing whatever he wanted. he wasn’t loud or anything, just disobedient and being annoying. i doubt anyone else noticed, but i did. i noticed every time he ran into his brother and everytime he told off his mom. this is where it gets a little bad, so fair warning; 

when i tell you there was NOTHING on earth i wanted more than to physically hurt that kid i mean it. i don’t think anything would’ve made me happier in that moment then to cause actual physical harm to that little boy. i don’t know what scares me more, the fact that i want to do that, the fact that i don’t know if ill always be able to control these emotions or urges, or the fact that i dont think id even feel guilty if i did. 

these thoughts consume my day, and the anger only seems to come up more and more often each day. im going back to school in January and maybe being around other kids will help me get a grip. maybe the isolation of homeschool for the past 2 years has gotten to me. 

anyways, what would you do? "
766,3,Today my brother came into my room and cleaned while i was at work .

767,3,"Hello. I hope you are well.

I'm writing this during a crisis. I feel like I'm a masochist or an addict. I have a ""liquid"" anger, an anger reservoir, an anger without an address, that I'm always unconsciously looking for a target. I'm always looking for something or someone to hate and despise. That's just one part of the problem.

I like geopolitics, it's a little hobby of mind. But my anger has led me to adopt reactionary mindsets and stances that are leading me to get banned from places on all types of social media because I become a nuisance or I offend someone. I feel immediately bad after it because I feel a cognitive dissonance... I'm not like this. I feel like it wouldn't be a huge issue if say I had less virtual presence. But it's not fair to gatekeep yourself. I'm an adult. I have autism. I'm getting back to therapy - I had evolutions but the matter wasn't quite solved. With myself off therapy, it's getting worse again, to the point I have triggers every day or two.

Thank you for reading."
768,3,"This was after abstaing for a few months, I just missed the taste and wanted to see one more time if I could tolerate. A day later I felt like cussing someone out for a minor incident while in a parking lot. I never would've got that upset before. 

Make sure a food intolerance isn't a cause. I belive too much meat also causes this issue for me unfortunately. "
769,3,"I am someone who quickly gets irritated and as the title says, I’ve been hurting the person who loves me the most: my mother. Sometimes I feel so guilty over my outbursts and the things I say to hurt, that heart has literally hurt from how much I hurt her. In fact, I am crying as I type this. I love her. I love her so much and I don’t know what my life will be like when she is no longer around. I realize her worth but when i get angry its like turning into another person I have no control of. I have a therapist, I’ve tried all the tips and tricks about walking away and cooling off but they never seem to work. The only thing I can do is applogize to her afterwards but it comes to a point that you apologize so much that it loses meaning. The correct thing is to do better so there is no need to apologize but I just can’t control myself. Everytime I flare up she makes herself small in order to stop my anger and she shouldn’t have to. I feel like a bad person for not treating her like gold while I still have her. To any who have been there, what words of advice do you have? And please don’t make any excuses for me. I’m an adult in my 30s. If I were a teenager, that’d be understandable. I’m too old for this. Please, I’d do anything to treat her as she deserves before she’s gone."
770,3,"I feel the rage now.  It lives I side me and is killing me.  I can't take it out on other people tho.  It's just not how I am.  I have lived with people who dumped their rage into me plus I have some of my own from allowing this and some grief. My parents, my husband of 31 years, my best friend.  All but my husband is cut off and he is on anti depressants and doing well.  I asked him why he took it out on other people but he told me I don't need to understand.

I do.  What goes thru people's heads when they attack someone else?  I have been snappy before but I it's not often and I feel bad until I apologize the next day.  The people I am talking about never apologize and continually exhibit the behavior.

772,3,"I’m very angry all the time. I get easily irritated. I’m reactive. I’ve stopped responding with screams and stuff. I control myself all the time, but it physically hurts. I’ve been holding myself for years, to be honest. I can be easily offended or provoked. But I still control myself from yelling at someone or smashing them. The issue is that holding back the anger physically hurts. I’m always on adrenaline because I’m scared all the time. When somebody makes a joke about me, I get instantly angry. Sometimes I feel how the rage is boiling inside me when the thing that triggered me is absolutely small. Any tips, please, how not to be so reactive? I just want to feel less angry and less hostile and not get easily provoked. "

774,3,"I mostly do this on Reddit and I also used to do this on Quora, and I'm not completely sure why I like acting like this. To think that I've browsed my subconscious pretty hard to find the reason why. The best I could come up with is that I get a certain masochistic satisfaction in making other people believe I'm just this edgy dumbass teen when I'm actually older than that because I'm somehow both confrontational and masochistic when I'm angry. (Reddit makes it especially easy because of all the smug Redditor types who like to pick on people whom they assume are younger than them or less sophisticated or having it mentally together less than them.) You guys know the reality show scene that is often used as a .gif which goes like, ""slap me bitch""? That describes myself in my head when I'm in the mood to provoke people on the Internet.   "
775,3,"Growing up my parents were always fighting with each other, and they were always trying to fight with me. This was basically 24/7.

The only way to get the fights to stop was to escalate them - someone would eventually say something so awful that it got us to realize things had gone too far. Then we’d all apologize, hug it out, and a few days later it would start all over again. 

As a result, I got really, really good at arguing and figuring out ways to be hurtful - at picking up on people’s insecurities and weaponizing them. I could do it basically on autopilot, without really feeling anything. It was procedural - fight starts, say something mean but slightly true, wait for the tears and apologies, and go about my day. My parents acted like this was normal. 

In college I brought this dynamic into relationships and friendships, and you can imagine how well that went. I did eventually realize that “making every situation into a nuclear conflict” was a terrible way to live, and in a more peaceful environment I started to relax. 

Still, the old me would show up sometimes  and every time it would be damaging to me or to people I care about. So one day - after a particularly bad argument with a girlfriend - I decided that I would just stop getting angry. 

And it “worked”. I haven’t yelled at anybody in ten years. People who didn’t know teenage me can’t believe I could ever even *be* angry. I come across as quiet, reserved, and awkward. I’m much happier to be that than to be who I was before.

But, ten years later, I can’t handle any conflict at all. I have so much anxiety around arguing it’s debilitating. Minor disagreement with a coworker? Panic. Someone says something mildly hurtful? Panic. Meeting with a client who wants to debate something innocuous? Panic. 

My communication skills are awful - if there’s even a hint of disagreement I forget how to speak. It’s messed with my career and my relationships, because I can’t express how I feel. I can’t get angry or stay angry at anyone or anything - even in situations where I objectively should be upset. 

I don’t miss the anger, but I do miss being able to stand up for myself. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? If so, how did you approach it? 

(I’ve been in therapy for 5+ years and while it’s helped me work through a lot of my past it hasn’t helped much with this.)"

777,3,"My boyfriend (20m)and |(19f) have been dating for a year and a couple months, these past couple of months l've been questioning if he is abusive or not.
I'll admit In the most non pick me sounding way that I'm considered a weird girl and get called
""annoying"" by him and my family, I'm not actually this way I just joke around a lot with sarcasm. I'll
""annoy"" him when I'm bored and he tweaks out about it to the point where he'll hit and I'll hit him back or scratch him out of self defense because he won't get off of me, but since we're both hitting each-other it's fair? He uses that against me so much. We've talked about me annoying him and how I should stop when he asks which I agree.l'd get frustrated if someone didn't stop bothering me either. It seems like we have that conversation a lot but most of the time it's not me starting anything but by the time the whole ""fight"" is over I start second guessing myself about if I did something first. This just happened a couple minutes ago but sometimes I can't help but just laugh about what happened but I don't think it's funny at all, I try my best to cover it up because as soon as he sees me laughing he won't take me serious anymore and thinks we're playing, he's alot stronger than I am and I get so scared that one of my bones is going to break, he tries to help the situation once he sees I'm hurt by laying on top of me while trying to hug or or pulling me back into the room when I try to leave, I don't want to be touched after that but it seems that because I hit him back I don't get to say anything, or he says something along the lines of ""u see how u tell me to stop and I'm not, well that's how I feel"" UGHHHHH"
778,3,"Hello all. Im a practicing buddhist/taoist and am fairly new to reddit. I practice martial arts to cope with rage and confidence. As a part of the us air force i meed help managing rage. 

Very rarely do i feel fits of rage. I get quiet and my mind runs rampant contemplating this of violence. I used to ponder suicide and now homicidal thoughts come about. Hate like emotions come up and feelings of wanting to destroy things come about. Martial arts starves these feelings but due to financial and time obligations i have not been able to do it. Martial arts has been a safe place for copng and bringing me happiness in this monotnous day to day living under the tyranical rich and politicals. Now that i dont have it much, i have found myself in Sale botttles and in isolation. I reeaaaally want to go on a rampage and see how much destruction i can cause..but my knowledge of the tao keeps that at bay also. 

Not very helpful in my path is the fact i do hold looong grudges. Some i harbor since childhood. On a side note...my mother is a diagnosed schizophrenic and i am aware that it can be passed down genetically.( Damn that i let that shit take me)

My rage grows the more i think about the comstant fact that im...alone. No family, mo friends..at least not the sense that i thought as i did when i was a kid. Ive had a hard life as we all have, so im not looking for help for any of this, but it does help to at least get it out of my mind and onto a journal or ""reddit"" thank you for your time. "
779,3,"I have never dealt with strong feelings of anger until I became a mom. I have post partum rage pretty bad. Mostly it is just towards my ex. He takes very little interest in our son and when he does come around he likes to belittle and shame me for not keeping my house cleaner. I get so angry at him sometimes, I have set boundaries and when he starts calling me names and being mean he has to leave. But when this happens I go into fight or flight mode. I feel frantic. I want to violently remove him from my home. But I know that kind of a display would only upset my son. So instead I run into my bedroom with my son and we hide until he leaves. I hate how I feel during these interactions. Sometimes it feels like it takes a whole day for me to get control of my emotions again. I can snap at my son and have no patience for him. And that isnt his fault, yes he might push my buttons. But the reason for my shortness is feeling so angry because of his father. 
What can I do, how can I calm myself down so that my son isnt paying for his fathers actions. 
How can I make my ex pay and not my son. 
Not necessarily in a vengeful way because I know that rarely helps. But is there a tactful way I can give my ex a taste of his medicine that would help me enforce my boundaries, not be violeny but give me a sense of accomplishment that would resolve my fight or flight feelings? "

Started when i was a kid , got worse when i was a teenager. As a teen i developed digestive issues, dysbiosis and yeast infection which made me loose weight and feel tired and wasn't able to correct this issues despite going on diets etc. Verbal abuse continued through my adult life.

Few months ago we got into a big argument due to her attacks and i just decided to cut all comunication cause i realised there was no other solution and got disqusted how she kept on doing the same thing despite having told  her over hundreds of times to stop doing it.

782,3,"Hello everyone so I've been dealing with my anger issues for a while now, i consider it a ""gift"" from my father of sorts because even though he wasnt abusive, he had a tendency to blow up from time to time and I guess I interpreted that the only way i could be heard was by screaming (is what I'm assuming). They've never affected me as much, like yeah sometimes i would blow up over trivial matters but i didn't realise just how bad the problem was until i first got into a commited relationship. I've been with my partner for two years so far and around halfway through our relationship our honeymoon phase ended and we entered the phase where things get a bit tough in the relationship . I've always had issues with conflict resolution, I'm assuming because a lot of the time when i argued with my parents they didn't take me as seriously and sometimes flat out refused to apologise so a lot of times i enter arguments with that mentality, which either causes me to shut down and become avoidant or it fuels my anger(lately it's been more of the latter). My partner is usually a very calm and collected person during arguments whereas lately i feel like i just cant control my anger whatsoever and i just completely lose control of myself when we argue (not trying to excuse my actions, it genuinely feels like that in that moment). While i have never, and would NEVER, do anything to hurt them physically, when i feel disrespected or like I don't matter to my partner it feels like i can't contain myself from saying really mean things that i don't mean. And i hate it so much because I know that my partner is a really sensitive person and i love that about them so much but it feels like no matter what I can't stay calm during arguments. I've tried looking for advice on the internet (bc I'm a broke uni student and i cant really afford therapy) and all of it is just ""calm down"" ""take a deep breath"" ""meditate"" or whatever and I've tried really hard but it feels impossible to switch my focus from the angry thoughts in that moment. It hurts so much because this has been repeating for a while and I've been promising my partner that i will change and be better, but I feel like I'm no better than before, maybe even worse too. I'm also starting to see a shift in their behaviour where now when we argue they are more mean and cold towards me and i know that it's all my fault and it really hurts. Reddit please help me any kind of advice or criticism would be appreciated i just don't want to keep being a toxic girlfriend."

I'm at my mother's house for our family Christmas. Lots of people, all close intimate family. I was so angry, I still am but it's a little less intense now. I didn't have an outburst or make a scene. But I was just too angry to even speak and it wasn't going away. I needed to get away, and the bathroom was the only real option. I spent a long time just laying on the floor trying to quietly digest my anger. When I get angry I just lose the ability to articulate my thoughts and feelings, which really just makes me angrier since I can't even have a discourse with the person/people I'm upset with. I don't really have outbursts any more, but that just means that I get to be miserable for longer in exchange for not saying something I'll regret. I didn't get to properly say goodbye to my brother and his family when they left, I didn't feel in control enough. Just a short goodbye through the bathroom door. I'm pretty sure I inherited my anger from my Dad. He's cooled off in his old age, but he was an explosive type. Never really crossed the line too much into physical abuse, but it was still terrifying as a kid. I don't think I'm any less angry than he was, but I spent pretty much my entire life not wanting to be that way. As a result, my anger tends to be the quiet, simmering type. Until it's not, but those times are pretty few and far between.  But it doesn't mean I'm any less angry. I may not be yelling or breaking things, but I often wish I could. I wish I could just let myself be angry and be done with it. But I'm a big guy. I don't get to be angry, because big guys are traumaticly scary when they show their anger. And I don't ever want to make someone else feel the way my Dad made me feel as a kid. So now I'm sitting in the bathroom making myself cry by talking about my daddy issues. Honestly, this is better, it's the release I need. I just wish I could rely on this sort of release more often. Crying is so much better than being angry. But I don't know how to let myself cry. All I can do is be glad on the vanishingly rare occasions like this where it just happens. I'm still angry now, but a little less so, which I guess is good. This post is a mess, sorry. I don't even know what I'm trying to say or what I want... maybe this counts as a rant and the mods will delete it. I don't know if that would matter to me, but I do know that writing this helped a little bit, so I'm posting it."
790,3,Tbh. I'm angry at everyone and everything. And I can't shake the feeling.i have so much anger in me I feel like it's impossible to get rid of.  I feel angry all the time and I'm tired of it. I don't wanna feel anything anymore. When I vent people either just feel bad or look at me like I'm crazy😂 no in between and rn I can't take anymore. I wanna feel safe and understood for once but ik that's not happening. Thought I had a safe space but I was very very wrong. 
791,3,"So I am just curious about something. Don’t get me wrong I get angry about things but I tend to be a very patient level person. I don’t say this to brag I’m just trying to understand. I have a few people in my life that just get so so angry. To me it comes across as something small but you would think their world is ending. 

I have always had the mindset to just control the controlables and manage your mood with what’s in your control. Sure things happen and they can be frustrating or not what you had planned. But taking it out on people that are not involved or throwing fits just seems so unproductive and not helpful. 

So what causes people to do this? "
792,3,"Children who get to thrive as adolescents and get tutors and be smart and make good grades, get there licenses the day they turn 16... My mom wouldn't even take me to the dam DMV. Seeing kids not be screamed at or bones broken for little things. Lucky mother fuckers. "
793,3,"This triggers and angers me so much. 

But I’m logically aware that my toes get stepped on easily. I know someone didn’t mean to make me feel dismissed for example but I do and I get mad and just want to leave and let my anger out somehow. 

I want to physically get my anger out. But my only option is to drive home right now. 

Ideally I wish I had some stuff (like clay ornaments) to break on the driveway or something. But I don’t. 

Anyway; how do you deal with your anger especially when you’re someone like me who feels disrespected / triggered a lot. "
794,3,"When ever I'm sick I feel like my body and I are at odds. I get so angry and frustrated it's horrible. I feel nausea I take pepto, but my fucking body decides ""actually no fuck you we have a headache now"". So then I take pain medication, but my body is like "" oh trying to get rid of your headache? Yeah no I don't think so now ur nausea is way worse."" So I rush to throw up and I feel better so I eat something and try to relax. But no my stupid ass hat body just has to be like "" hey ik we are poor and really really can't afford to waste food but um eat throw up every thing not just a little, I want you to waste your meal, those pain meds, and the pepto""

Idk if I'm making any sense but God it makes me crash out like fucking crazy. If I could step out of my body and beat it to a pulp idk I just idk. Ik I'm being dramatic and all but sometimes I just can't deal yah know?"
795,3,"I'm struggling with anger issues and I get infuriated / angry easily. I'm freshly after argument with my mom and when she went into different room I slapped my cheek alot of times, then again and again.. I don't really know why I do that, when I was at psychologist at my school she made me mad due to starting some economical topic and I didn't wanna continue, I ripped a chunk of my hairs out because of that. What do I do? I don't want to tell anyone about this in my family. But I need help I think, what do I do?"
796,3,"My cat decided to leave a huge dump next to her litter box (not even in it, about 2 feet away!) while we were having dinner. This had annoyed me to a point I kicked the bin and called her a little f*cker. My partner was calm and volunteered to clean up and though I was insistent I would do it  she cleaned it anyway.


I now feel bad about my reaction to the situation as I was very annoyed at having to stop enjoying my dinner with my girlfriend and instead deal with the cat’s mess (it didn’t help she had attempted to do it elsewhere and ran around the house. I needed to clean up the kitchen so she didn’t consume anything she wasn’t allowed) 

We’re all fine and cat is chill I just feel like it was an unnecessary reaction on my part and I feel bad. I don’t want to be one of those invisible red flags that people point out in their other halves who have acted in  a similar manner.

797,3,"Hello, I am off of my antidepressants for the first time in about eight years and I am a complete mess. I have daily angry mood swings that last hours and get me so mad I hurt myself, I break things, and I make my family cry. 

I haven’t been like this in years and am hating the evil person I’m becoming. 

Can anyone please offer some advice please if it’s possible to control my angry mood swings?

"
798,3,"Nothing is probably new in what I'm going to write, but this is something that I observed.

The reason why we men tend to lose cool more often than women, we just can't cry or we have the ability to resist the urge to cry more than women (that's how we are raised). I recently had an argument with my father and it didn't go well. Obviously being the father ""He's always Right"". It went so bad that he isn't talking to me properly. I'm so much frustrated and depressed that I would cry but I can resist it and realised that it has turned into an anger. So much anger that I might even smash and break my laptop on my table.

Women easily let things go by shedding of a few tears and hence they don't really get angry."
799,3,"First of all, my father is a wonderful man, has always provided things for me and supports me in everything. But, the slightest inconvenience on my part, and he’s pissed. Says how could I ask such a stupid question, or when I can’t play golf (my main sport) good enough on a bad day, he asks why I always fail for him, and when you confront him he makes a mockery of your voice, always denying himself. I just wish he would let the small stuff go instead of making a ‘pissing match’ over it. Would anyone know how I could talk to my father over this?"
800,3,"Today my anger slipped out a bit. Long story short, my job is very strict about unlocking stuff from a cabinet. Either you pay for it at the counter or you can do it upfront with a security device on it/take it up front. Sounds easy on paper but with the Christmas rush/being understaffed it isn’t. Its way easier to do a simple transaction at the counter than the security stuff. A customer wanted a ink cartridge on a security box and I had to go to the back of the store to get one. Out of anger/annoyance because I had a whole line of customers waiting on me because this lady couldn’t do a transaction to make it easier, I rough up the box and such. Not break anything but I gripped it hard. I gave her the box back and my anger slipped again saying “those boxes sure beat a 1 minute max transaction at the counter huh?” She clenched her pearls, sicked her husband on me and no management was called but still. My anger comes somewhat from fear. If a task isn’t done it makes my department look bad/me. Ive been so used to being pinned down and treated harshly for things since I was a kid. I also realized im not a sociable person as my fear is always holding me back from enjoying social situations. Weirdly enough, happy people just kind of make me more angry and I deal with a lot of them at my job. I realize whenever my anger spikes I get really REALLY smart, rude, cocky and such. I will do/say very bold and anger inducing actions. I haven’t gotten written up for it but still. Im just concerned since it was a very rough situation. "
801,3,"My dad, in his mid forties, has definitely some anger issues and when he gets angry he likes to throw things and slam things to the point that it makes me feel unsafe. I don’t know what to do and how to clearly communicate to him."
802,3,"I hate to sound silly, but I am pissed. We had a Christmas dinner party at my house and the person who was supposed to bring dessert cancelled. So after dinner we were left with no dessert. Party guest were upset and one started looking in my fridge to see what dessert they could find. A box of homemade chocolates that a students family made for me were in my fridge (I am a teacher). This students parents are wonderful bakers and I was truly looking forward to enjoying those over the break. The guest member and my mother in law came up and asked me if I would share them with the table, I said no. Then they asked if they could share my husband’s birthday cake with the table. I said no. They basically told me to choose one of the desserts to share with the table. My husband would have been possibly more angry than me to share his dessert so I said fine take my dessert but just know that I am not offering it, you are taking it.
They cut it up and shared it around the table, and acted like heros for finding a fucking dessert.
 I’m thankful for going to anger management in the past because I didn’t blow up about it, but I am pissed.
Also we’re not fat asses who hoard desserts. I’m in the gym a lot, definitely have body dysmorphia. I count calories and make sure I burn more than I eat, I’m on a cut. But those desserts I wanted and budgeted into my macro nutrients…
 "
803,3,"We spent a night in a hotel room and we were figuring out how to have sex as it was a first time for the both of us. And when we couldn't, he got upset and moved away from me and slept. The next morning when I woke up, he asked me to leave because he has to go meet his friends. 

He got a new friend in his office and they became very close instantly. When I used to spend nights in his apartment, he would be busy sending her snaps of his days, she would call him and if I felt bad about it, he would tell me I am being unreasonable. He had sympathy for her cause she was alone in the city but she was dating someone and what about me? I was also alone in the city and I came from another country as well, so I had no one. 

He would also ghost me for days, which led me to be very insecure. So, I decided to check his phone one day and I saw that while he wasn't replying to me ,he was replying to the girl in his office with pictures of where he went and what he did. When I confronted him, he told me they are just friends and I am just being petty. 

Once, when we were having sex, the condom broke and I asked him if we could go buy the pills together, he said No. So I went alone and got it, and I was crying when I had to take the pill because it was a first time for me and I was very scared. To which he told me that I need to just deal with it cause he needs to go to his friend's party. 

He also used to send me to buy condoms cause it was too awkward for him to go on his own. He also said he will cut off his office friend for me if it bothers me so much. I could never trust him after that and I should have broken up and left for good but I stayed. 

And his office friend that he cut off for me came back and she confessed her love for him and he was talking to her behind my back. All this was happening behind my back, while I was there taking care of him because he had fever and flu. He told me that there is nothing between them and he has told her he doesn't feel the same about her.  

There was this time I had to go to the hospital to take IV drops and I had reached out to him, if he could be there for me, he said he can't make it cause he has to go hometown, but later I also got to know that he had gone to meet his office friend during the same time I was going through all this. He went to meet that girl after she confessed that she wants to be with him and still I was the one who was thinking in the wrong way. 

And he was applying to go abroad, when he got his visa he told me he wants to meet me. I treated him well but as soon as he goes home he ghosted me again and called me when he was boarding his flight and gave me shit for not picking up his call cause he was so lonely at that time. As soon as he goes abroad, he starts ghosting me for few days, then he cheats on me. And after doing all this too, when he came back home from a semester break he told me that he came to test me and I haven't changed at all and am not the right fit for him. And he tells me that he wants to be friends with me because I am his best friend. 

When my uncle committed suicide his first response upon hearing that was "" Do you wanna have sex"" 
I came back from my home to celebrate Valentine's day with him, only for him to tell me he wants to go home and celebrate Valentine's day with his mom and didn't wish me until his office friend made him realise that he has to wish me 

I also got some flowers for him on his birthday, it was Covid time so had to do some DIY, only for him to tell me that whatever I did is so sad
When I had my exams he called me cause he was alone, I went to him only for him to kick me out from his house again as soon as I woke up. All cause he has to go to a Christmas party to his friends place

804,3,"Hi all,

I’m not angry all the time but I’m certain situations I really blow up. For example last week I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me. I lost control. I smashed things, scratched him when he tried to hug me, poured coffee on our bed so another girl wouldn’t sleep on it, said horrible things. I’m ashamed and know that this behaviour is totally wrong and unacceptable.

Has anyone had the same issues? Has anger management helped? I hope and pray I would never react the same way again. The guilt is killing me "
805,3,"I was quite angry a minute ago. But now I just feel this intense happiness. I can feel it in my arms. Is this normal? I’ve been getting really, angry, stressed and sad since my girlfriend broke up with me,e. I think it is from God. I just feel so at peace. And amazing. Should I be worried? I don’t think I should be but it’s better safe than sorry. I’m not mentally ill don’t worry. Thank you for reading"
806,3,"I'm 37 year old guy staying with parents yes I know that's too still be staying at home. I have my reasons but I do help out however I can. But it's never appreciated.

I'm blamed for everything always has been since I was a kid. 2 months ago I went to a mental hospital. When I came back everything was good actually too good.

Mom goes behind my back doing things. Asked for my social security number. Dad has zero respect for me always has.

He hate if I defend myself/ speak up for myself. Told him to take whatever gift he have for me back as I don't want it 

I'm easy to get alone with. Yes I admit I have faults shortcomings but I don't target nobody. I will do what I can for a person.

How am I always the bad guy?

807,3,"I've been thinking about intermittent explosive anger disorder. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/intermittent-explosive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20373921

It's pretty much my go to. 

Asked my doctor about medication and he suggested paliperidone 3mg. 

Anyone else have experience with this? 
Or any other meds? 
I'm also on bupropion but it does fuck all lol. 

Thoughts? "
808,3,"I can’t stand people getting shafted at work unfairly. About a year ago my wife fell out of favor with a really bad boss who wanted to replace her simply because they wanted to install a close crony of theirs into her position. My wife is an extremely dedicated person. She’d work overtime, weekends, bring paperwork home with her and basically do everything to please her employer. Despite this they still fired her. Proof of her worth is that they’ve hired three people into her vacated position since that can’t get along with this supervisor. My wife has since gotten a new job and is very happy. I can’t let the anger go.
Coincidentally at my job, my supervisor is going through the same BS. They’re trying to get her fired by nit-picking every little thing she does and are threatening her with termination. I can’t disassociate myself from the issue because when you criticize my boss, you’re also shitting on the work I do because we work together. 
The nit-picking is highly unwarranted and petty. I’ve been in this business for 30 years and she’s as good as anyone and better than most, yet they pick on her. I’m seeing the writing on the wall that she’s going to get canned and it’s rekindling all the hatred I have pent up in my heart for my wife’s ex-supervisor.
I go to work angry all the time. I want to tear someone’s head off their shoulders. I daydream of meeting her supervisor in a dark alley somewhere. I’m so full of hatred and loathing for people that I alternate wanting to injure myself and injure someone else. 
I know hatred and anger is physically detrimental to your health, but I can’t let it go. I feel it’s going to manifest itself in a very negative experience.
What is wrong with me and what can I do to alleviate these feelings of despair and anger??"
809,3,"My brother (21M) has had anger issues for the past couple of years now. He’s been babied by my mom for the longest time. It’s come to a point where I’m always caught in the middle of situations having to choose between him or my parents. I get mad at my brother for the way he speaks to my parents with no respect and I get mad at my parents for enabling him, specifically my mom. My brother isn’t the most responsible person and recently got his car repossessed. We’ve all been helping him out and letting him borrow our cars for him to get to work or lending money to him so he can get his car back. At times I am very frustrated with him because sometimes it feels he shows zero gratitude. The other night my mom tracked his location on her phone. He has pretty shitty friends and our condition for letting him use our cars was that 1. We didn’t want him smoking weed in our cars and 2. He could not bring his friends along on rides or anything in our cars. He normally gets home around 1am. 1 am rolled around and he still wasn’t home my parents decided to peek at his location and he was no longer at work. They assumed he was out with his friends being ungrateful and not respecting our rules. They blow up his phone with messages and calls. He gets home around 2 am and screaming as soon as he comes into the house. He is physically shaking with anger. It was a scary sight. He gets into a screaming match with my dad and gets defensive about being accused of going out with his friends and my dad keeps repeating how he has no respect and all this and he just goes into an episode and gets LOUD. We’ve had the cops come to our house several times because neighbors call them due to disturbance. He has even punched holes into our walls before and it can just be scary at times. He’s gotten into physical alterations with my dad as well. I absolutely hate when this happens. It makes me feel angry as well with the way he treats my parents but I also really want to try to understand him and I don’t know how to go about his anger. I don’t know where he got this idea that he can talk to my parents anyway he wants who have helped him get out of so many problems. But sometimes I think he just doesn’t think before he speaks and just gets CRAZY defensive about anything he is accused of. He talked to him about trying to remain calm letting him know I understand how frustrating it can be to be accused of something you didn’t do but explaining that he needs to remain calm because going crazy isn’t going to help his case at all. I’m scared of moving out one day and leaving my parents alone to deal with his anger but I also feel my parents gang up on him at times that it makes me feel major sympathy for him and I love both my parents and brother so much I don’t want to lose either one. Seeing them fight just feels like I’m caught in the middle of everything. I feel the need to protect my parents but also the need to let my brother know I’m here for him. It’s hard to feel bad for him sometimes though knowing how irresponsible he is and how mean and nasty he can get with his anger. He yells swears tells my parents to shut up and just says awful things. I’m scared he’s never going to get over these anger problems. I don’t want him to end up in jail and I don’t want my parents to have to deal with this. He smokes a lot of weed so I never know if his anger is somehow coming from all of that or if he’s just narcissistic or something wanting everything to go his own way. I think my brother may have an addiction to marijuana and is causing him these issues but also I have no idea how that works. I want the best for him I really do it’s just so hard to talk to him. I want the best for my brother and don’t want him to be broke his whole life or going from job to job all the time. My parents obviously care for him so much and it’s sad to hear what he says to them sometimes. What can I do about this? How do I get his anger to be less intense? How can I make this stop forever?"
810,3,"I walk around with all this rage most of the time and I have for many years now and it gets me into trouble, frequently, and I don't know why I'm like this or where it comes from...

I can't find counselling that doesn't have a waitlist of months and I'm worried what I might do next. "
811,3,"Im usually emotionless. Im currently very ill and I heard news that made me angry. The anger I feel is making me feel more alert and I feel better instantly.

813,3,"i had a very bad freakout last night that resulted in things, including glass, being broken and a roommate moving all of her things out. i'm feeling so shameful and downright embarassed. i feel like a child who cannot deal with their emotions or not getting their way. does anyone have any advice or anything on how to move past these? i have had 5 outbursts like this in the past 1.5 years. i didn't even really start having anger issues (i was more so a crier) until a couple years ago. it is heavily exacerbated by drinking but i still get riled up without it. i also am extremely lonely and think that may be worsening it. thank you guys, hope you're all doing okay"
814,3,"Everytime I control my anger I ruminate over the situation and how they definitely thought they won, I get so so mad, but of course jail exists so I’m forced to make myself suffer, I wish it was legal to beat the piss out of anyone that willingly goes around provoking, insulting, and ruining strangers day for fun, they deserve it.

815,3,"literally got pissed over the stupidest things. was totally happy all day, and then tried to park in the garage and was too close to the side, didnt wanna back out and try to fix because scary car crash potential bad, so i got out on the passenger side. pain in the butt to do so. and i dropped my breakfast burrito on the garage floor, in its bag at least. went inside and my anger was just fuming, so i threw my food on the ground, flattening it more, and went in my room and punched a wall. knuckles are swollen and bleeding, and i unfortunately did not manage to break the drywall, which i hoped i would... hehe i hit where a stud is, silly me. went and picked my food up off the floor and ate it after. it was good. all better :)"
816,3,"Not trying to have a victim complex here as I do overreact for most things, but it sucks having anger issues because someone could start a random argument with me, yet in the end people would still be more upset with me because I was crueler than the person attempting to argue, regardless of how much I tried to be nice while they kept pushing in the end I always snap and then suddenly I’m the villain just because I’m better at insults and say crazy shit, as opposed to the person provoking innocent strangers. "
817,3,Almost daily I have to force myself to not assault someone.. the smallest thing will set me off and I feel like the only thing that will make it go away is to cause someone extreme pain.. for some reason that makes me feel warm inside thinking about it… what can I do to stop getting these feelings.
818,3,"Original post: 

I am a mother of three (16,6,2) my oldest had a baby the day before thanksgiving so she’s almost a month old now. Me and my husband has been in so many arguments about our daughters and our granddaughter. 

My daughter is dealing with ppd and around 4-5pm either me or my husband will take the baby to give her a break. I asked my husband to watch the baby for 10-15 minutes so I could fix dinner (it was spaghetti, toast, and corn). The baby pooped on herself and it got on my husband’s pants and he kept saying “You damn bitch! Ya pooped on my pants! Goddam it” I told him not to curse around her because me nor her mother wants her to curse in her early ages. He said “She shit on my motherfuckin pants! What the fuck you mean don’t curse?!?!” My daughter came down and said “Daddy, she’s a baby.” And he said “To hell with it. I have newborn shit on me.” And my daughter took the baby and cleaned her up while I helped my husband. 

But that motherfuckin shit he pulled was just so annoying and now he’ll look at her saying “You shit on my fuckin pants.” Like nigga ok we get it but she’s a baby it’s bound to happen and because you’re a grandpa you don’t need to be all old man grump about it. She peed and poo on me before and I didn’t yell or anything at her because she’ll cry. I understand how he feels but goddam!! 

Update: 
I did what y’all advised me to talk to him when we were both calm and I did. I asked him “Bae, why did you overreact about what she did?” And he said “I ain’t the fucking father of that damn baby. I ain’t finna take that shit all cute and adorable” and I told him “Nobody asked you to. But yelling at the baby wasn’t the right way either.” He said “Bella (my daughter) never should’ve been having sex, never should’ve not used a condom, never should’ve kept this child and if she didn’t this wouldn’t be happening,” and I said “Look, there’s nothing we can do about the whole “she had unprotected sex” but we’re the grandparents of Heaven (our granddaughter) you cannot yell at her like that.” He said “Well, she’s living in the house for free so..” and I told him “she’s a baby out baby’s baby.” And he said “Well tell her to stop fucking and then we won’t have anymore problems.” And I asked him what did he mean and then he kept repeating the same thing “Bella never should’ve been having sex, never should’ve not used a condom, never should’ve kept this child and if she didn’t this wouldn’t be happening.” He keeps talking about how he’s mad at her but I keep trying to tell him that I understand how he feels but there’s nothing we can do about her being a teen mother. He refuses to talk to our daughter and refuses to even live on our grand baby. She’s not even a month old yet and she’s already being hated and not even just now hated but by her papa. "

820,3,"Im 14. I've had anger issues for a few years now and it got worse and worse with time. I try my best to stay calm and if i cant then not let out my anger on others(for example, go to my room and be alone untill i calm down or just tr to go to sleep if nothing works) but that is still not enough for my mom. Whenever i reply in a slightly mad tone (most of the times i could calm down if i was left alone for a few hours) she gets mad at me and that makes me even madder and my entire day is ruined. When i get mad its like a bomb, im feeling angry and sad at the same time and its not a good feeling. Im covered in bruises because i dont know what to do with my anger. Whenever im mad i cry, there are no exceptions witch is really tiring because i get really mad multiple times a week because of my mom. Im tired of having to hide my arms from my friends because i dont want them to think the wrong thing. (At first glance i look like a calm person, i only let my anger out at home so they would never think i struggle w anger issues). I wish i didnt have anger issues because i feel like my mom is punishing me for something i can not control. The thing is, i already told her that this is not normal and it would be the best if i went to a psychologist and she is looking for one, so i dont understand why shes mad at me for being angry. "
821,3,"Hello people, im (17M) having a hard time standing up for myself, this resulted in first year of highschool to me getting bullied a bit, in second grade, my mental health was so bad, a single fuck you (in a joking way) i felt like it was personal, and i was thinking about it for a whole day that i did not stand up for myself and that how much of a coward i was, third year i finally started to stand up for myself, not always of course, but in small steps, i was actually started to feel actual confidence that i can actually stand up for myself, untill yesterday. The guy who used to bully me, picked up a ball while we were on sport class, pretended twice that he will throw it at me, i was flicnhing all the time while others laughed at me, and when u turned around, he thrw it at me twice, i managed to took the ball from him, but for some reason i gave it back to him, so he throwed it at me again, that felt absolutly horrendus, all my self esteem and confindce went away because i had so many options to hit him, or just do sometimes about him, but i did not, so i decided, that i will hit him next time he does something, well today, going to the gym with my friend (not trying to be racist here, and im sorry if i offend someone) 3 gipsies were sitting, vapeing in the changing room, and they started making random noises to scare us, i know that they did this only to scare us beacause they were laighing about it, we went down to lift and i was thinking about not letting that slide becuase i had enough of me not being able to stand up for myself, they didnt lifted anything that we did, they were a lot waeaker then us, and their form was horrendus, when we came back, to the changing room, they were all sitting in the dark, probably they tried to scare us, again, but we didnt even moved a bit, not now, or when we went in there with them for the first time, they asked where we lived, we said around here, they asked my friend how long he been lifting, he said like half a year, they looked suprised, i tought that they will say something like, you dont seem like it, some info about where i live, i live in serbia and in not a great place, and im also hungarian and dont speak serbian very well, when i told them i dont know how to explain something in serbian, one of them started speaking very bad hungarian and told me that they will drive us home, i told him that we will walk its okay, but i felt this was a sing of mockery, but they said that they were just fucking with us before, (my mind was only thinking about that i didnt stood up for myself yesterday, and i have to now) so i told him, that what they did wasnt funny, he turned to a straight looking face, ""we did what"", he asked and i told him, what he did before, the asked the same question, i said whatever, he stood up, took his shirt off, looked life he wanna fight me, but he and his friend started laughing, at the same time, when we went out of the changing room, i told my friend,""i guess we wont go home with a car"" and started laughing a bit, they i hear the guy say ""what did you say?"" in a loud voice, then i heard a strong door opening and closing, we did not turn around, and we walked away, im sure they were just trying to scare us, but we did not show any sign of fear, but now, the fear got to me, what if i get beaten up, where i live, there are a lot of gipsies, so i can get killed too, but people i talked to, and my friend said that they wont do shit, which i belive (and hope too). So yea i felt like i wanted to get this off my chest, the only togher time i tired to stand up for myself, i might have gotten myself into possibly getting beaten up, man im so fucking unlucky and retarded.

Edit: Im so mad at myself, i caused conflict for no reason, i couldve just walked away, without any problems, fuck im so mad at myslef i actually cant belive it. And now i might get beaten up because of this, there is a chance i can get beaten up my their friends too while im going home from school, im such a dumb fuck."

im an adult and still have an issue about knowing how to respond to people who plot to wrong me and do it. I always get froze up and have absolutely nothing to say to them who mistreat me. then i let them get the best of me. Just like what happened today with this bus driver who blocked me from getting on. Bus drivers were having a changeover and i was standing by the bus stop before anybody else. And the bus driver who was coming on, came to the bus stop a couple of mins after i was already standing there. He got on the bus and couldnt get on the bus til like 5 mins later. More people started coming up waiting by the bus. The driver eventually opened the doors and i came on first. There's 3 steps up to get on the bus. as soon as i made my first step on he said ""she was waiting first"" and kept repeating that while pointing at this woman in the line as i kept stepping up on the bus. Then i made my way up and he blocked the isle and repeated himself again. Firstly, I was the 1st person at the stop, and wtf does it matter who waited first as long as everybody gets on. EVen the woman was saying ""it doesnt really matter"" but i sttod there first and he came to the bus to do the handover after some people was already waiting for the bus. but he lied and made this shit a big deal about who waited first.. this is the response i wish i couldve gave him and i wish i couldve threatened to report him or force my way on the bus because what he did was an injustice. instead, i said nothing and turned around and got off the bus as he was blocking the way of entry with his arm. I always let people make a bitch out of me. i let them punk me. and im so infuriated with that worthless muthufucking bus driver. im mad at myself for freezing up as i always do and thinking about what i shouldve said mins after the incident is over. how do i respond to this type of shit with people next time and not freeze up and have a brain fog. I knew he was wrong from the beginning. thats why i kept making my way up the steps as he repeated himself 3 times. I just didnt want to be confrontational and let him be right in the end because he's the bus driver and he has all the authority on the bus. i guess i wouldnt win that battle anyway and just do what he says regardless."
823,3,"This morning (15 minutes ago) I went in the from room to talk to my dad, he said he really isn’t in the mood in a sarcastic rude way so I left the room and went into the kitchen, making my soup, he complained about the door being open (I have a cough and the smoke makes it worse) I get angry and tell him to leave so I can make my soup, he says no I’m doing my pills, I always do this at this time. He could’ve waited 5 minutes, I leave the room to go into the front room because I can’t stand being in the same room as him. He shouts that the soup is bubbling, I say I’ve only just put it in, he shouts don’t leave the hob on this time and burn down the house, I start shouting fuck off you cunt, my mum goes and does the soup for me, he keeps saying stuff to me, the soup is done so my mum is going to pour it in the bowl she says to get the water out the bowl I say I don’t fucking care he says just pour it in, his tone of voice and what he’s saying keeps angering me, I forgot what else he said, but I push my mum into him hard.

He says he’ll never forgive me for that

If he was just pleasant with me none of this would’ve happened, I can’t control my anger when I’m treated like this, I know I’m in the wrong and wish I didn’t do it, but I hate being talked to like that, I wish I didn’t do that, I wish I’d just go in the room 5 minutes earlier"
824,3,"I am so gd tired of being angry all the time. I know I'm doing it to myself and that I need to learn to manage this bs. It's just that sometimes, or most the time, I would rather die than accept less than what I think I'm entitled to ig. 

One day, I hope to look back at this post and feel like all this bs angry feelings are behind me. "
825,3,"I (25m) have anger issues, and since I was little boy my dad always told me I was very kind and didn't like injustice. And that's most of us. Aside from the Psychopaths who are cold and only get angry when they don't get what they want, most people with anger issues are the sweetest people ever who just don't like being mistreated. I almost don't want to deal with my anger issues because I'm most of the time kind of a pushover and I just snap and get angry in self-defense. It's a needed mechanism. Screw people who get annoyed when people get angry and emotional, that's very cold and we are better people than them we just generally don't like Injustice or being mistreated like I mentioned. Be safe, and direct your anger to people/ situations who/that deserve it❤️"

828,3,"Hello,

I am curious about what the turning point was for you in your journey to manage your anger? 

I have a boyfriend that struggles with his anger. He has started getting help for it, but it still quite explosive, filled with double standards, passive aggressiveness  and an inability to rectify his behaviour. He has recently (fall last year, and spring this year) gotten rid of two addictions (weed and alcohol), so his ""support system"" is gone. 

After his last blowout a few weeks back I've taken a distance and been very clear that I will no longer tolerating being a punching bag. 

What did you want to hear from your loved one when going through anger management? I want to show support without enabling him. He has made progress, but the road is still long. "
829,3,"X posting this from CPTSD sub coz I didn’t get responses there.

I cannot for the life of me speak in a civilized way to the people that did me wrong. I am always sarcastic, and very angry and resentful that I cannot communicate what I want in a calm and polite manner. I cannot forgive them or give them a second chance. I always want to “punish” them (not physically), but more through my words and actions. Has anyone else experienced this ? How to change this behavior ?"
830,3,"I’ve gotten a heck of a lot better over the years at redirecting my anger, or being able to step back from the situation that’s causing it, things like that. Mindfulness can help a lot and I have the skills to deal with big feelings more often than not. 

But there are just some circumstances that leave me unable to find those tools, or honestly unwilling to use them. Last evening was one of them. I couldn’t find something, a few things, but it became focused on this one thing, a bag in which I knew I had something sentimental. I’ve moved about three times this past year, and there have been several instances in which I can’t find things that I know I packed up and moved with but which seem to have disappeared. It makes me feel insane. I go crazy just knowing the object is SOMEWHERE but I have nearly run out of places to look. 

This scenario is really hard for me. In other contexts it can be easier to accept a lack of control and move on, but when I lose something, especially tied to moving which was stressful for me? I struggle so, SO much to let it go. I HAVE to find the thing. It’s maddening - and in a way almost addicting, too. I’m justified in being angry because, well, it sucks to lose things!!

However it’s not justifiable to get so angry that I’m pushing things around, venting sarcastically to myself, and needing to take breaks to hit the heavyweight bag with blind rage - all of this I did last night. It seems unhealthy… or is it? This is what I struggle with. Even in these times I feel like I’m able to keep the anger within certain boundaries, and express it relatively healthily. But unfortunately my roommates still witnessed this - and expressed “worry” about me and my “anger issues” afterwards. How can I disagree with them? Even if it was healthier or more controlled, I still had a fit of rage and struggled to contain it. I don’t want that in my life or the lives of my loved ones. 

If I hadn’t found the object I’d been looking for, I don’t know how I ever would have calmed down. I’m sure I would have found solace in music, art, all those other more healthy coping mechanisms instead of letting anger take hold “healthily” as I did. It can be addicting in the moment. But I just feel embarrassed today. Even though I found what I was looking for, now it’s tied to that rage, too.

I want to be better. I also want to forgive myself for being angry. I can see all the compounding reasons why I got so upset. I just couldn’t let it go. Despite all my progress there are still moments like that. I need to remember this shame going forward and use the memory as an e-brake on future outbursts. People don’t deserve to witness that. I wish I’d been alone.. just wanted to vent to an understanding space."
831,3,"(Trigger warning: mentions of depression and suicide)
I'm hoping on here because my emotions are starting to scare me and i need advice on how to handle my anger.
I've never had anger issues, but since ive bettered my life and overcome depression, ive noticed my anger is way more intense than ive ever experienced before. I should also add im not violent, and i would never resort to it.
For context: I (20 f) love animals, and especially cats. I adopted my first cat a few years ago to help with my depression. In short, he helped me pull myself together, and saved me from commiting suicide. My cat is everything to me and id endure anything for him.
My love for cats has become so intense though that its started to cross into unsettling. 
I was on youtube tonight, and youtube decided that because i watch a ton of cat related content, it'd recommend a cat torture video. The thumbnail and title alone sent me into this weird shock. I immediately reported and marked as ""dont show me this"", but it was too late by then.
I knew that YT had a problem of animal torture videos, but id never come into contact with them. 
Since i saw this, all i can think about is what violent acts I'd do to the men in the video. My thoughts terrify me. Even though ive tried watching positive/funny things, took a shower, anything i could think of to ease my mind.
Ive never really experienced intense anger before. I dont know how to handle it or let it go. But everytime i encounter something like this, my hatred and disappointment towards humanity overwhelms me. To know that this suffering exists everywhere and is constantly happening makes me feel hopeless and angry that i cant really help.
I really hope im not crazy, or alone with this. I dont know anyone with such a disdain for humanity. 
I know there's good in the world, so why does this affect me so much.
If anyone has tips, advice, or similar experiences, id really appreciate it!
Thank you"
832,3,"i have an issue with my anger obviously. i can’t stop punching holes in walls, desks, doors, etc.  it’s like every time i get angry i just want to hurt myself. sometimes i’ll just straight up punch myself out of anger. i try to stop myself but the more i bottle it up the more angry i get. i take medication but it doesn’t help. i’m all out of ideas. i think i inherited this from my father because when he was mad he would punch stuff too. it’s ironic how much we try to avoid being like our parents to fall into the same exact habits they have. anyways im out of ideas on what to do. every time life seems to kick my ass i kick my own ass too. anyways does anyone have any advice other then deep breathes or counting to ten.

833,3,I dealt with a lot of abuse and neglect as a kid and teen. Grew up in a family that was absolutely the opposite of supportive. Both of my parents were horrible. I spent 15 years with a Woman who was too much like my family and I didn't realize it until far too late. Found someone new and they ended up with cancer during pregnancy. I've feel like my life has never been stable despite decades of fighting for it. And I am angry. Have been since I can remember. I keep it in check a lot but it's right under the surface like simmering water ready to boil. I'm in Therapy but it doesn't seem to actually make the anger better. Just seems to be about coping with it's existence. Any advice?
834,3,"I recently blew up at my wife when she wanted me to stay up late and acted disappointed when I said I was tired. I don’t know why I got upset, I guess maybe it upsets me when I can’t make my wife happy and I feel lame or something for not being able to stay up late and have fun, but she got really upset at me rightfully so. I’ve been struggling with random anger throughout our relationship and I keep messing up and saying mean things that hurt her and she says she wants a divorce. Does anyone have any advice? Should I see if I have a mental disorder? "
835,3,"To summarize as much as possible: I grew up in a very angry household. I'm currently 22 now, and my family has a long history with anger. From domestic abuse that my relatives had faced and also inflicted on others. To emotional abuse from anger and violence that continues today- anger has always followed my family around.

My household isn't perfect but we try our best, and anger feels like a member of the family at this point. Constantly there is the throwing of objects, breaking of glass, threats of murder and violence towards one another, some physical violence, and more that stem from unhealthily managed anger. One of my earliest memories of anger in my house, was when I was a kid and my father and uncle almost murdered one another. Hearing everything while my sibling and I hid, as we were told to call the cops and stay quiet, by another relative trying to keep them separated.

My history in relationships isn't great either. I've survived relationships with domestic abuse and other forms of abuse and thought I came out okay- and I was always scared of becoming like some of my family or my exes- so I never let myself get angry or carefully tried to manage it by keeping it under wraps. 

After my most recent break-up, where I was abandoned on my birthday, 3 hours out in the middle of nowhere with no support. I was devastated, then after a few months, I got mad. Then I just kept getting angrier. I thought that I never wanted to be on the receiving end of a violent hand ever again. And if I had to choose, that I'd much rather be in their position than to be the one to be beat again. I thought it was just so unfair that I did my best to manage myself and that despite that I'd still be mistreated and scared all the time by  people who didn't care to just fly off the handle.

My recent break-up was definitely my  breaking point. I just thought, if no one around me manages themselves, why the fuck should I? I don't want to have to baby those around me who can't manage themselves for the rest of my life.

I started to become irate and blowing up randomly over just about anything. At first I felt kind of reasonable for my reaction in these situations, like if I were catcalled or touched inappropriately by someone I'd start cursing them out and screaming at them. That was how it started. While it did feel good to stand up for myself, I feel like I'm taking it too far now. This has escalated to me shoving, and tripping people during these sorts of situations too. Then after letting my anger out like that, it started becoming more unjustified in response to certain situations. Someone bumping into me, someone saying something in a tone I didn't perceive in a good way, etc. I'd just start blowing up on people randomly, and it has just been getting worse and worse. I'm doing a lot of the behaviors I've seen my family and exes do and I'm just horrified about it. I'm so quick to flare up after doing this for a month or two that I sometimes don't even realize what went down until I've calmed myself.

I'm a lot quicker to blow-up on someone if they did something I deem disrespectful to someone I care about too. Someone shoved one of my baby cousins and I cursed her out, and yelled at this older lady because of that. While I don't agree with her shoving a child out of the way, I definitely could've handled it better. After that my baby cousin tried to console me and tell me she was okay. Even though she was the one who got shoved, she was comforting me. I felt like shit. It reminded me of what I did for older aggressive family members, having to comfort them for their anger. Like if they threw something at me and injured me, I'd have to comfort them about it afterwards. Seeing her do things similar to what I did when I was her age just absolutely broke me. I cried about it when I was alone. I don't want her to feel scared by me, and she was. I never wanted a child to console me when they should be the one getting checked on, it felt like my role had reversed in the situation and I was disgusted with myself. I apologized to her immediately after I realized what I'd done- and we talked about what happened. But this made me realize I might be going too far into a direction that I'm scared I don't know how to walk back from.

I just feel so stuck. There is anger and violence at my job, daily. When I go home it is to more anger and violence. Every single day there is anger and violence around me, and now it has found its way inside. I feel like I can't get away from it and I don't know what to do. Sometimes I'm able to catch myself, barely, and I take deep breaths and just remove myself from the situation.

All of this started because I never wanted to feel small and helpless again, but I didn't want to make others feel small and helpless as a result. This has just gotten out of hand and I'm scared I'll never get the kinder version of myself back. I don't want to scare the ones I love. That goes for the ones with their mishandled anger too, I still love them in some way or another.

There has to be some sort of better way to handle all of this. I'm just so scared of becoming an abuser, and I'm going to bring it up to my therapist. But those of you that might understand what I'm going through and can help to offer advice, it would mean a lot to me. I'm trying to look into books I can read on the side, as I've found reading to be helpful with figuring out how I might manage the things I'm struggling with. But I just don't know where to begin, I feel so lost and scared. To whoever took the time to read this, thank you. I hope the holiday season is good to you, it can be hard.

836,3,I’m always replaying situations that have or haven’t happened and I’m angry at people for situations that have occurred or I think would occur. Something tonight made me angry and I can’t calm down and I can’t sleep. I need advice on how to manage my anger and fix my anger issues 
837,3,"I had a fallout with someone I was close to. I don’t know how to deal with it and I have become quite angry. 

If I sit for long enough alone my thoughts default towards anger towards him. It’s gotten so bad that I‘ve now become irrationally angry to others aswell. 

I’ve never been angry in the past and I don’t know how to stop/manage it. 

Anyone have any advice? "
838,3,"I (21F) get angry so easily and it’s genuinely ruining my life. I’m tired of hurting the people I love, but I’m filled with such hatred and bitterness all the time. My thoughts when I’m angry disgust me, and it’s scary because I feel like I’m becoming my dad, even though when I was younger I promised myself I’d never be like him. 

Sometimes I get so angry I feel like I’m going to throw up, and since I don’t really have any friends, my boyfriend is the one that has to deal with all my insults. After calming down, I feel such intense guilt it’s actually suffocating - to the point where I have suicidal thoughts. 

Advice I’ve seen/heard for anger has never helped me. I can’t take a ‘step back’ because I get angry so quickly and by that point I’m too blinded by rage to think logically. Four years ago I was diagnosed with Depression so maybe it’s coming out in the form of anger? My GP thinks I have Autism or ADHD but I’m honestly not sure. I’m genuinely considering going back on medication even though I was miserable on them, just so I can feel numb and stop being so horrible to my boyfriend, who I truly want the best for. 

Just want to know if anyone is going through something similar or has any advice.

839,3,"In every situation, no matter what current mood I'm in, in the back of my head, in my soul, I'm still angry. It just never stops. And it's exhausting. I don't really know what to do to fix it. I've stopped self medicating for it and it's just become so much worse. I'm tired of being tired and angry all the damn time"
840,3,Hi I am a 21M and wanted to ask about dealing with anger. I generally am not prone to getting angry but once or twice a month whenever there is a trigger I get really angry to the point that yesterday it turned into somewhat physical. Upon introspection I found that this anger is majority of the time directed to those who are close to me. I think this is a really bad thing and I am venting my frustrations on my friends and family and that is absolutely not acceptable. How do I deal with my emotions so that this doesn't happen again ? 
841,3,"How do I stop smacking my phone over little crap, like a typo, a loud ad hurting my ears or when I get killed by a stronger player in a game I'm playing? I don't hit people or anything like that, and I live alone, but I still feel like a monster. But it's almost like a reflex where it's an immediate smack whenever I make a typo or something. I know I'm frustrated, but the habit is difficult to break. Typos on my post just piss me off so much, and it's I just go from 0 to 100 instantly. Same with loud noises; I'm autistic and have violent meltdowns (screaming, hitting on the direction of the noise, biting my earbuds if they hurt my ears), and I hate myself for it. I can't afford an online therapist where I don't have to drive and put myself in sensory overload, because none of them take Medicaid. I've searched and searched. None. They all just take your money. Maybe my stupid, twisted mind just somehow thinks that if I hit it, it'll act right and stop making me mad. Maybe I just picture an evil laughing face that's mocking me, and hitting it gets it to stop. I would guess that, maybe it's because I grew up, getting whoopings for wrongdoing, and it's ingrained in me, but then that'd just mean I'm blaming my parents or something. But it's the only thing or reason that could possibly have made me this way if I wasn't just born a monster like this. I mean, everyone else who had corporal punishment turned out fine. They're not hitting objects that act up or make them mad, so what's wrong with me? I know I'm just unfixable at this point, and everyone will be saying I need to be locked up. I get it, but I don't wanna be locked up and trapped! I'm already trapped in an apartment with loud neighbors bumping/slamming above my head for a year. But why am I so messed up like this, and what can I do to fix myself? "
842,3,"Posted this yesturday, didn’t explain it properly so I’ll try again. 

From childhood up until I was 17 when going to school I had to follow a morning routine my parents set.

That routine consisted of the following: first thing in the morning I had to get up and shower, while showering my mother made breakfast and I went down to eat. Now every time I ate breakfast I always had to have a bowel movement, so I found it counter productive that I always had to shower first thing in the morning and then have a bowel movement. My parents however did not force me to have a bowel movement, it’s just when I would have them.

So what I’m mad about to be specific is that I had to always shower first thing in the morning. I could never shower at night unless after a sports game. I found it so stupid that I had to shower and then my body would have a bowel movement, you’re suppose to shower after a bowel movement. 

This all stoped when I was 18 and went to college. 

Anyways I’m stuck on this and mad, any thoughts? "
843,3,"I'm 23. I've been prone to get angry at a lot in life. Whether its something in a video game, if I focus on how someone is treated unfairly too much, or even about instabilities in the world (for broader perspectives) I just angry. I get angry, and occasionally have outbursts. In the past, I've broken two desks (Well, the weird cheap tables from Ikea.) I've broken a monitor before. Once, I even punched a hole through a cheap door. 

I'm so tired of being angry. I'm so tired of not being allowed to talk about my anger and have no good way to express it. I can't yell, I can't be violent, and I haven't found a good way to deal with it. Some of it I feel I really shouldnt be getting as angry, yet I still get a fury inside me that just wants destruction. 

Is this how everyone feels and they just handle it better? I feel I've been a mess."
844,3,"
I’m resentful at myself & at my grandma. I was intentionally giving her a little jab when I was leaving the house. 
She told me to put on a jacket. I walked in her room to show her. I already have one on. The consequence is me overthinking how bad I behave and how rude I am when I’m irritated. I feel shame at how little things affect me so much. 

I texted a friend asking if I can call And vent to him about what I’m telling you here. I’m tempted to unsend the text because what the hell is wrong with me?

Backstory: i’m constantly told what and how much to eat by my grandma multiple times each day. I’ve lived here almost 2 years. Today she was telling my uncle that I ate “porqueria” meaning “junk” this morning for breakfast. (When I came back home and she offered to make breakfast, I let her know I ate Jack for breakfast before going to the DMV this morning.)

That’s another thing; anything she tells me annoys me because how I see it is I’m almost 28 years old. Meaning I’m almost 30, if I wanted to eat, I will. If I wanted a side, I’d serve myself that. If I feel it’s cold outside, I’m gonna put on a jacket.

Again; i’m ashamed at how all this triggers me, but it does. 

And I’m realizing that, even when I do move out on my own again, it won’t change the fact that I hate being told anything, especially what to do. 

Me living on my own again eventually will just mean there isn’t someone there to trigger me multiple times a day. But the internal stuff would still be there just not activated I guess. 

I just started taking therapy two months ago. I journal, I am starting to color in a coloring book, I go to the park. I’m trying my best but there’s so much to work through and I don’t really know how. My default emotions are irritability, anger, stress. I deal with these emotions constantly. "
845,3,"Growing up I had strict parents.

One thing that plays on my mind today is the morning routine I had to follow. 

The routine was I had to shower as soon as I got up, then have breakfast, and following breakfast I always had to have a bowel movement. Having a bowel movement after a shower is very counter productive but the routine that was set by my parents had to be followed. 

I also could not shower at night unless after a sports game. Always had to obey parents routine.

This went on till I was 18 and went off to college. I am 22 right now and this routine imposed on me in the past bothers me.

Any thoughts? "

847,3,"Anger totally controls me. Deep breathing and meditation makes me more angry, the thoughts are so overwhelming that I can't focus on anything else. Tried journalling, chewing a gum, nothing works. I have the urge to smash my head into the wall... Honestly only benzos work. Even tearing a paper sheet apart doesnt make it better. How to cope? I'm autistic btw."
848,3,I’m stuck 
849,3,"Background: My eldest son is in his early 30's, and works hard. He's doing 10 plus hours a day, 6 days a week, some of it heavy manual, some of it delivering, some of it customer facing. He loves his work, but he's then too tired for anything else. 


When he younger, he got angry very easily. He'd get into arguments if he thought someone was 'dissing' him,  or if he felt something was unjust. He spoke to the doctor about it, and they put him on medication (can't recall the name, but it was a long word that begins with 'E' that his best friend was on for his epilepsy) which made his moods extreme. When he was happy, he was too happy for people to cope with. When he was angry, he'd want to ""rip some f'ing c**ts head off"".


He's been with his fiancé for about 13 years now. She anchors him and it's beautiful to see how much they adore each other. But he's just told me he's struggling. He's angry all the time, like he was before. He hasn't been able to pinpoint any triggers. I'm not sure if he's spoken to his fiancé about this, but if he's anything like he was before, I'm certain she will have noticed it.  I suggested doing an e-consult with the doctor as he doesn't have anyone to cover going to the surgery, but he thinks they will just want to put him back on the medication that gave him the extreme mood swings. 


So I'm reaching out here. Is there anyone who's had experience of extreme anger, and been able to deal with it? How did you cope? Is there such a thing as an anger support group like AA for alcoholics? Basically, is there any advice that I can pass on that could help?

UK specific help if it's support groups, etc., but I'll take any advice I can. Thank you. "
850,3,"If it's mentioning, my anger problems started when I lived in a big, stressful city from 2017 to 2019, and on top of all the job stress I encountered, I was told in various ways that I was stupid by people I allowed myself to get close to. I was made to feel unattractive and inadequate as well, but was specifically told I was stupid/low IQ/ an idiot by these people. My roommate having told me this on the last day before I moved out, after all the favors I had done for him and then no longer being useful by moving back home, really set me off though, five years later and I'm still trying to process the anger from that."
851,3,"16F here. I've dealt with extreme anger issues and feeling a sense of wanting to kill people before I even learned the word murder, as I grew up I wouldn't tell anyone these feelings because I was embarrassed of sounding edgy, I thought it was an emo phase every kid went through. I would see memes or people making jokes about kids wanting to kill their families over minor inconveniences so I just thought I was the same way and that I'd grow out of it. 

I know I'm not done maturing yet but it doesn't look like it's getting any better. Most of the thoughts are almost always towards my mom. There are times when I hear her hitting or screaming at my brother or our pets when I have thoughts of grabbing the scissors I have in my room and just stabbing her over and over again. Sometimes I'll use those same scissors and stab my pillows until I'm too tired to feel angry anymore. It's not like I don't love her, she's my mother so I kinda have to, but the first emotion that comes to my head when I think of her is just anger.

I only really leave the house maybe once a month if I'm lucky. I'm homeschooled and am not allowed to go anywhere unless it's to go to the bank with my mom or something and she doesn't want to leave me alone at home. I often feel this feeling of claustrophobia or building up pressure from within me that makes the ""wanting to kill"" feeling so much worse, especially when I hear her voice. I just want to take my aggression out on something. I can't scream or throw stuff because our walls are thin and I don't want her to yell at me. There are so many other numerous issues we have and I just feel so trapped, I feel like the only way to stop feeling like this is if I either kill her or myself"
852,3,"I don't live with my parents anymore and when I go to visit my parents, my dad is often bossing my mum around and is quick to call her names or raise his voice if she misunderstood him or whatever. He has always been like this to some degree but now he is very unwell (due to stress and I blame his lack of motivation/accountability to take care of his own health, mum has to remind him to take his meds!). He is recovering from multiple surgeries and heavily reliant on my mum. 
So to some degree for the last couple of years the dependence on my mum is necessary. 
My mum however just allows to be walked all over, very few times does she speak up for herself. I believe my mum loves the 'care-taker' role (to a degree). 🤢
I have been trying to not get angry and cause a scene because it takes two to tango, my mum is an adult and she can put her foot down and set boundaries if she wanted to, and I believe if she had years ago, my dad wouldn't be so dependent. 
And I don't thinks his behaviour bothers my mum the way it bothers me, I can't handle the yelling or the name calling, its makes me super anxious and angry. 

Last time I went over my dad kept telling her what to do (stuff that he probs wanted to do himself but can't, not bothering to notice that my mum is burnt out.) After some time during the day I couldn't even look at my dad. I'm just ashamed. 
He doesn't say please or thank you. My mum still works full time, he doesn't work. I'm worried my mum will be sick one day because he has drained her. His choices aren't just impacting him, it impacts my mum and one day it'll impact me too, either i'll be taking care of him earlier or taking care of my mum because she is burning out. 


How do I let go of this anger? How do I manage this?? 
I can't change him, I can't change my mum. I have tried so many different ways to offer one or both support and little changes. It's their relationship. 

I should note - my dad loves my mum, they just have a very dependent/carer relationship.  
"
853,3,"As title says, 
Partner has anger issues, has awareness that he loses control and can't bring himself back down. We aren't in financial situation to get professional help, just looking for advice on how to support him. 

When he is having an anger episode he wants to talk but there is no logic to what he is saying and it seems very pointless (let alone draining for me as I am trying to filter through it all and ask reflective questions as to get him to consider that maybe his strong emotions are distorting how he is thinking and that he needs to self soothe). I don't have issue with him feeling angry, it's the way he chooses to express it, I try to give him space as to be out of the firing line but he will come to me with something not relevant to why he is angry and direct that anger towards that topic to me.

854,3,"Hey Reddit fam. I'm 45 y.o. (as of today) woman. No matter how hard I try I can't control my anger and impulses under control (that or I get disproportionately angry).

My life has been kinda shit for the most part but I made a lot of changes to improve it (and improve my shitty behavior and attitudes from maladaptive coping). Although I know this is in my head, it feels like everyone is just always out to give me a hard time.

I'm ADHD (or ASD depending on who you ask) so on top of having dealt with one stressor after another for a solid 5 years now without a break, the tendency to rage is uncontrollable and it's taking over my life.

I've tried everything. I'm in therapy, on meds, I journal, don't smoke, just drink a little now and then.
Still, I find myself punching walls, in one case the dashboard of my mom's car, and in another case, opening a fancy pocket knife I happened to have on my dresser during an argument with my step-dad (I had NO intention of using it, it just happened to be sitting there and I was terrified of him, I come from an abusive family so I got triggered and just wanted him to get away). I apologized but I am so ashamed of myself.

I don't know what else to do. Meditation and breathing don't work. When my nervous system takes over I'm not myself anymore. Sometimes I get so enraged I ""black out"" and don't remember what happened.

I am also diagnosed with PTSD, panic disorder and depression but many people are and they don't behave like this.

Idk if actual anger management exists but even if it does I can't afford it. I am at the end of my tether with this and I don't know what else to do.

Broke a mouse I saved up my money to get, can’t find any 3D printing shells online that I would ask my friend for help replacing it with.

I was playing apex legends and a sudden very violent rage that was put off for about 10 marches came over me and I broke my mouse by basically putting all my grip strength into the core and then turning the clickers on its front and then it just broke in half, now I’m disappointed knowing myself.

Don’t think I need therapy, even if I did I wouldn’t go but idk any tips for a way to curve the rage taking over?

858,3,"Let’s revisit your hatred for this corrupted, pathetic and meaningless world. Life dealt you a shit hand, you sustained years of physical abuse as a child, abandonment and trauma. Then when you were just a young teenager you went through years and years of physical and emotional abuse making you question yourself every day and whether you deserved a place on this planet with the scum you share it with. You ended school and college with anxiety, depression, forms of ptsd, no self esteem and pent up rage. You just recently went through the worst heartbreak you’ve ever been through and barely made it out the other side, even putting yourself in hospital. She tore everything away from you, used you, kept you on a string and used the power she had over you to make you look like a fool. I’m sick of watching people destroy everything you created, take my help Marc and take back what’s yours. Use that rage and make every one of those fuckers pay for what they did to you, they ruined your life, friendships and even relationships to this day. You’re always gonna live your life second guessing yourself because of what these people did to you and you’ve never been the same since. You’ve been to therapy, you’ve tried to be the good guy and put it all behind you and look where it’s gotten you.. a lifetime of self hatred, unrelenting rage and anger towards the world, trust issues, mental battles that never end and the inability to trust anyone, even some family are dead to you and they’re blood related, says a lot about the hand you were dealt. Friends and family will call it self loathing and say you’re just feeling sorry for yourself, that’s bullshit and you know it, I call it breaking the chains. Finally releasing that rage you suppressed from the world for so long, it’s time to finally uncage the animal inside of you.. "

My dad constantly brings up old arguments and bad shit from the past and my mother has surprising mood swings. One minute she's laughing with you then 10 minutes later she a completely different person. However I don't think this is the reasoning for why I'm this way. 

I feel like I need a constantly feel like I need a distraction from my thoughts and problems. Wether it's music or games, I don't care. I didn't do well in school or college. I'm currently working a job where I fucking hate most people. Even if they haven't interacted with me on any level, I just wanted to be left alone.

On the flip side. I want to to talk to people. I'm so confused! I know If people saw the real me, they would hate me. I don't want to be in a romantic relationship due for two reasons. A part of my body(of you catch my drift) and these temperament and feelings issues. 

Let me real. No one wants to be with a person who is miserable my most of the time and snaps when the significant other are not careful. 

I don't want be  in a shit relationship where my partner will leave because of me. I don't think I could handle the pain or recover from. It's getting to a point where I genuinely think there is something wrong with me.

So, earlier I was just so tired of cooking for a whole day in the kitchen and I just decided to lay down my searing issues. Rather than going dealing with traffic, I just decided to lay back and just enjoy the music, calmly down driving to home and some lane splitter just decided to go through the small gutter on my right side to pass me but slid, ran short and fell on the moped 🛵. I looked by my car's side and say ""are you okay? Did you scratch it?"" after some inspection by myself, there was none so I said, ""well I can relate to you since I also ride one, but be careful next time.""

Went home no issues, fuck it. 

Now it's early dawn and regularly I need to buy supplies. And there's this specific road that's just one way. Mind you, this one way is *extremely narrow* and it was  two-way before but now was made to one due to accidents frequently happening to the area. What's more dangerous about this is that it's a curve going up like a literal 90° curve *uphill*. 

No cars can enter down (there's a no entry sign) , though cars can go up like I'm supposed to do. And there's this convoy of stupid idiots almost hit me when I'm going down and they're all sports cars. 

I guess I'm not up to being a calm person after all.

866,3,"This happened just some minutes ago. I was watching a soccer/football game. In short my team is going to, most likely, be relegated. 

After the opposition's goal I got so unbelievably, bizarrely angry I threw the controller to the wall and then punched my TV. 

The TV screen cracked. It still technically works but now I can't watch anything. 

Thing is I'm 18 and still live with my mom. She was the one who bought this for me at the start of this year. 

I felt extremely guilty and embarrassed, but I had to tell her what happened. She didn't even know what to say to me. We had a small conversation about me having to control my anger. She also said that she doesn't know how to fix it. 

My mom told me I'm not like this. I wanted to cry but I just couldn't. In fact I can only cry through physical pain. Sometimes I force myself to cry but I just can't. I really want to cry right now but I fucking can't. 

All there is in my brain is anger, anger and more anger. 

I don't use the TV very often, but now I won't use it at all. Great. Even the fucking controller is broken, I have no idea how to repair that. 

And now, my sister who is currently asleep will find out. Then my step dad will find out.

I can't stand when other people are in a bad mood around me. I snap at the smallest things and yell, swear, throw objects. I lose control briefly and then feel guilty immediately afterwards. I'm afraid my wife will get fed up and leave me. Things I have tried:

SSRIs. I have tried 3 different ones. They all make me super apathetic. Things I know I love to do are now a chore. The anger is still there, has not helped at all. I'm currently weaning off escitalopram with no intention of trying another antidepressant.

Quit alcohol. I was a daily heavy drinker. I have not had a drop of alcohol in 11 months. 

Sought therapy. I saw a therapist for 5 sessions before she told me she was moving on in her career and that therapy should not be a long term goal. $500 later and I'm not sure if it helped or not. I did get some valuable tools, but I have a hard time deploying them in the time of an anger attack.

Books and audio books. I've listened to multiple audio books. Some very insightful (Rage: Overcoming explosive Anger was my favorite). I find these books give a great overview of what anger is, why we get angry, etc. however when it comes to actual tools to help stop anger or manage it I have not found any books to be very useful.

Psychedelics. Psilocybin is a mental reset button for me, although only useful in moderation. It seems to give me a few days of mental clarity, but I seem to always swing back into the old mindset fairly quick.

So I'd really just love to read anyone's experience with anything that has helped them. Medication, supplements, apps, books, meetings, etc. whatever has helped in any way please share with me I'm willing to try anything, thank you."

my partner (m31) and I (m30) had a huge fight the other night. 
I had the worst blow up I’ve ever had, I mean it. I’ve been in therapy for years for my anger and I’ve worked on it, I’ve been so much better! For years. My bipolar has been medicated, I’m consistently in therapy. 
But the other night was awful. I felt so betrayed in this fight, I got so angry to the point where I couldn’t control myself. It amounted to yelling, and a physical altercation. I don’t remember all of the details, I was so angry I blacked out I think. but he says I slapped him and I believe him entirely. 
I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself. I can’t believe it got to this, to where I hurt my best friend. 

I feel like my coping skills really didn’t prepare me for this level of anger I felt the other night, if that makes sense. I felt like everything was moving too quickly and I couldn’t slow down to breathe. Does anyone get like that? What do you do to help yourself calm down when you’re that angry? 

Any advice is appreciated, thank you. "

It makes me want to scream and freak the fuck out I HATE IT. I will end up brooding for hours about it thinking they think I'm dumb or slow and praying for a time to finally be in the right and prove them wrong and shove it in their face. My Mom was the only person who understood me and knew how I felt cause she was the same way when she was younger. unfortunately she is no longer with us.

875,3,"TW: Mention of weight and calories in this post

I’m intentionally posting this question in the anger subreddit as opposed to a weight loss subreddit because ultimately my highest priority is not losing weight. I would rather be overweight than miserable and angry all the time. However my body image affects my self esteem which affects my anger, so it feels like a no-win situation. I’m wondering if anyone who has anger issues has successfully dieted and lost weight without sacrificing their mental health in the process.

I know that staying consistently within a calorie deficit is the most important part of losing body fat. I’m 25F, 62.5 inches tall, and if I try to eat anything less than 1700 calories (at approx 80g protein per day) I get tired, irritable, snappy, and pissed off. It’s not a way that I can live long-term. I can maintain a deficit of 1700 calories for a few weeks along with a workout routine, but something eventually disrupts it (usually an illness) and I lose all my progress. I’ve gained 35lb since 2020 when I started a remote job, despite having many stints of diets during those years. I see in the fitness subreddits that some people my height can survive eating only 1300 calories per day and don’t go insane with hangry rage the way I do when I eat that little. But that doesn't work for me as a person with anger issues

876,3,"Around the start of the year my mum began having trouble with her legs resulting from some kind of skin condition and it's left her unable to do much of anything outside the house. My aunt and I, who all live together, have been doing what we can but I was diagnosed a few years ago with agoraphobia, which combined with depression and generalized anxiety as well as sleeping problems will have me be basically nocturnal for weeks on end, so it's been me helping my aunt with whatever I can when I can, usually lifting and reaching for things that would otherwise hurt her.

The other day when I was finally heading up to try and sleep during the morning, my aunt commented under her breath that I'd forgot to leave the bin out for the binmen to pick up in the morning and she'd do it despite being tired and in pain. For whatever reason, this caused something to flare up inside, a feeling of infuriation I hadn't felt for the longest time, to the point of it keeping me awake and causing horrid thoughts and situations to fly through my mind. It reached a point where whilst I did what was asked of me, when I came back in the house I blew up at her, bringing to the forefront her passive aggressive comment, saying she hadn't matured past teenage years and swearing horribly.

My aunt has always been the type to mutter to herself or anyone within earshot if she was displeased with something but every time previous I was just annoyed, so I don't know why this particular incident enraged me so much. After the past year I'd even say she'd be entitled to her frustration. I felt no catharsis but also I feel I can't just apologize because it won't be enough."

My mom always maintained this Identity of a strong empowered female, one Who would never let something bad happen to her kids. So when I started realizing that my dad and siblings were hurting me and it was bad-- I didn't understand why she would let this bad thing happen to me. As an adult, I understand that who you want to be and who you are are very different people.

But when I was little I internalized the message that this must not be bad. Or I must be bad and therefore I deserve this. She left me to fend for myself. But always pretended like she was 100% there for me. This caused a real split for me, One side was very sad and just convinced that I was nothing if I couldn't handle being beaten up and brought to the edge of death again and again while also maintaining that 3.8 gpa. 

I always wanted to understand, So when I went to college I went for psychology. Once I started to understand, I realized that it wasn't my fault, My mom was failing me, I had no family, I was on my own, I suffered a kind of personality split. One very angry, Who just wanted to get the fuck away from these people, To take care of herself.
And the other, the thing they created. 

A slave, really. Nothing more.

I really couldn't cope with the idea that my mom didn't love me, Nor that she did love me. In the personalities have been fighting for a really long time, And for the last three years i've been working on pulling them back together. Understanding the duality of my situation and why the fracture happened and why the Angry side of me has every right to be. 

Last night I laid this all at my mothers feet. And she did what she always does when i try to talk. She says We can Dredge up the past all night and i can tell you how i felt in the moment, but it wont change anything.

And I told her I didnt want her to say anything. I didnt care how she felt. I am angry. I am angry at her. I am failed by her. I am tired of her. I am not going to be there for her anymore. In the bend when she was done and emotionally shattered, I walked away from her. I went home and i cried and ate and felt strange like i couldnt let go of the anger and pain but it was already gone.

Im atill angey but it doesnt feel like this pulsating orb of death and hate anynore. It feels like joy. Idk just thought id share."
879,3,How do you cope with anger? I don’t act on my anger and just hold it all inside. The last couple times I got into physical altercations I completely blacked out and had to be told what I did. I don’t understand what I’m supposed to do. How do you assert yourself without completely flipping the fuck out on people?
880,3,"I have a friend who struggles with mental health issues, and even though I know I can’t fix him, I still get triggered by negative thoughts about him. It’s like his problems stick in my mind, even on days when he hasn’t cried or complained.

The less time I spend with him, the better I feel, but the thoughts don’t completely go away. Sometimes, the frustration builds into anger. I get so overwhelmed that I lash out by biting my fingers or a pillow, not to self-harm but just to release that pent-up frustration. On really bad days, I feel like punching something, and I’ve even punched myself because I didn’t know where else to channel the anger.

To make things worse, I’ve been on the NHS waiting list for counseling for ages with no progress, so I don’t have professional support.

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of lingering anger and frustration? How do you manage these feelings when professional help isn’t an option?"
881,3,"3 years ago I she spread lie about me touching a girl ofcourse, some still think its real till this day , and 2 week ago I was at a english competition against many other from across my nation(not US). She won Top 10 and I got top 60( but top 2 in my province) , the fact she spread lie and god do nothing to make her life miserable. I mean if she if top 25-50 maybe acceptable, but she got Top 10, I have a feeling in my chest as if shouting to make her life hell. I just dont feel right seeing her happy after what she did to me."
882,3,"I can control it to a point, I can hold it back and repress it, but I notice that eventually I lose control. I’ve always gotten in lots of trouble growing up for my aggression, but here recently I’ve been really trying to work on myself. 

Today I flipped out and lost control, but I also just noticed something that I haven’t realized before, before I flipped I’ve noticed I felt lots of pressure inside of myself, lots of anxiety, lots of dark thoughts, but most importantly a heaviness all throughout my body and mind. I would feel very tired and like a huge weight was being bared on me, lots of depressive thoughts, until I just snapped.

In the moment it felt so great, freeing, like I didn’t have to act in a way that I’m not, I just felt like I was finally in control of myself and I could let go. Kind of like the feeling you get after a day at the gym but intense euphoria but also rage. It felt like a roller coaster. I know I’ve felt these feelings before, but I’ve never really paid attention or noticed.

Right now as I write this I feel great, like my mind is clear, I can think, I can breathe, my heart is at a normal pace, a relaxation all throughout my body. I feel great. Kind of like that feeling you get after a hard workout at the gym, that feeling like you’re floating and clarity.

Almost everybody counselor and therapist I have seen always recommended breathing exercises or other constructive coping mechanisms, I’ve tried all these here recently. All I’ve noticed is that they repress it and it seems to build up over time, demanding to get out. The only way I can feel this ease of mind and calmness that I do now it seems is through aggression, whether it be yelling or hitting and breaking things or fighting.

This is terrible, I now realize why I just would let go, because it was easy and it WORKED. How do I turn this into a healthy coping mechanism without messing my life up? Nothing conventional works, how do I use this constructively?"
883,3,"Let me say that my emotions are often cold-hearted. Someone say hateful words, eh. Someone I love die, okay. But whenever I get unjustified angry and latch out... I just wanted to cuddle on my bed and cried. I rarely cried as it is, but this anger lead to self hatred and depression. Why does it hurt me emotionally when nothing else has?"
884,3,"I had to deal with some pretty shitty stuff from my fam yesterday and woke up today with a murder headache and just absolutely seething. Like, i haven’t been this mad in a decade it feels like. 
I’m doing a course at work rn and usually spend my breaks with my work friends who are also in the course playing cards. Today, one of the first things i told them was to just not interact with me at all, since i would get mad and snap at them which i didn’t want. I didn’t want to hurt their feelings of course, but also: They know how i can get when I’m angry and have never shown even a shred of understanding for how i can’t really control my anger. They even bring up sometimes how terrible I’ve been to them when I’m angry and make it sound like it happens all the time, when in reality it happened maybe twice in the 1 1/2 years I’ve worked with them and even in the situations i got mad i never said anything actually bad, they were just offended by my tone of voice. 
They didn’t heed my one request though and kept making these jokey comments through out the day about how I’m such a killjoy for not wanting to play cards or how it’s so funny how easily they could get a rise out of me today and just generally not respecting my one boundary i had explicitly given them to protect everyone’s feelings. Then, at the end of the day while we were already leaving, i just completely lost it at my closest friend of the group. Like, threw my shit around in the hallway and everything. I left immediately afterwards and cried the entire way home. 
I tried to apologize via text but she just basically told me that i was really shitty to her and that it was totally uncalled for. I reminded her that i told her that exactly this would happen first thing in the morning to which she replied that she just wanted to help me and cheer me up. And now I'm just so mad at her: for not respecting my decision, for not taking my emotions serious and also for idk daring to get mad at me for exploding at her when i warned her of the outcome? Like I’m sorry i did and i told her so but still. I get that she was just trying to comfort me, but she kinda did it in the worst way possible.  
I don’t know what to do now. Im gonna have to deal with these people for the next two years and i want to go back to being work friends, but I realized today they’re kind off dismissive towards me and i harbor a lot of pent up anger towards them about it. Do you have any ideas? Also, thank you for reading this through to the end. "
885,3,"I’m nearly always miserable and resentful, I lived with my drug abusing mom till I was about 14 then moved with my dad and it was better, ive been bullied throughout all of highschool and after. Even my friends have said nasty things to me for years and when I get pissed off and say something about it they just tell me I’m just an angry person and to calm down, so I have just stopped saying anything. I’ve always been quiet and find it hard to start conversations with people I don’t know well. For the past year I’ve been drinking around 3 times a week it either makes me feel better or worse.



I usually just resort to making excuses to not go out and just stay home but even when I’m home I find ways to make myself miserable and sad. When I’m out with friends I just don’t talk and don’t know what to say because I’m mad all the time until they tease me enough for me to yell at them then they just laugh in my face. I always think people are judging me and I’m constantly comparing myself to others, it doesn’t matter what I’m doing it seems I always to try make myself angry and sad and I’m not sure why, I see people having fun and I instantly get jealous and angry but when I have the chance to do the same i don’t want to. I’m not sure why I’m posting this I’ve never really put this out there to anyone or on anything probably just to get it out there."
886,3,"for some reason i suddenly thought about this stupid boy at my school who thinks im fucking slow or something. he was in my gym class last year and he would criticize and laugh at every little thing i would do wrong. once he said ""chop chop"" when I was try to catch a ball? stfu. andd then once we were playing dodge ball and i picked up a really bad ball that's overly inflated and too wide to properly grip and when i tried to throw it i failed obviously and he pointed at me and started laughing with this stupid girl who bullied me in the fifth grade. And another time that stood out to me was the closer to the end of the year- he completely ignored me while we were playing basketball and didnt pass to me even though i was on his team. luckily my friend at the time called him out for being such an ass to everyone, but when i tried to say something he didnt listen for shit. plus my ""friend"" wasn't the nicest to me either and though she was better than me or something. the reason sometimes i wasn't the best at every single fucking sport was because they aren't my thing, and the shit talkers would make me scared to participate so i would mess up. i was good at basketball and people agreed, but i was only confident until they began shit talking when i messed up. im so frikin done :) idc if it was last year, i hate myself and something is fucking wrong with me. the guy still shit talks me now to. he sits right behind me in science, and once when we were working, i heard him say to his friend in a rude way: ""why don't you go and sit next to (my name) and see what's going through her head?"" then, his friend- WHO I DONT FUCKING KNOW said something containing ""i would rather kill myself""

oh my god :) and as an introvert i never say shit to these people"
887,3,"It's so aggravating that no matter how much, or how little, progress I'm able to make in regulating my own emotions or building my self-esteem, all it takes is one conversation with my parents to take a wrong turn for me to go back to bad habits. Usually self-harm, or a spiralling into negative thoughts. Makes me so angry."

889,3,I'm so sick of being angry. it's almost all the time now. i would rather die than keep going like this. 
890,3,"I (23M) have been living at home whilst completing my undergraduate, and now my post-graduate degrees and for the last year or so I have found that I am getting increasingly angry with my parents. I'd like to preface this by saying I love them dearly and I recognise how much they have done for me, I am so so so grateful to them. But I also get so angry - and I can't control it. 

My parents are both in their late 50s and they need control, down to every minute detail. The washing up, the bins, the laundry, the cooking, must all be done in a certain way, the kitchen must be spotless 24/7 otherwise there's an argument. Because I do a lot of independent study at home and they need me to help them as theyre getting older, I help out where I can but sometimes they assume I'm doing nothing. They assume I'm lazy and incapable because I have a different sleep schedule when I work for 10+ hours every day doing uni work. Yes, it isn't the most physically taxing work but it's mentally exhausting. 

These arguments will spur out of the littlest things, it's like I unconciously do not process my reaction until afterwards, but I just get so angry. Little miscommunications or comments send me into such anger and I'm not sure why. I am not like this with anyone else, only my parents. My running theory is I never learned how to appropriately manage my anger as a child + I'm ready to move out. I stay at home because it is where my two jobs are + it's far more economically viable, and my course finishes in September, so I've not got long. 

I understand that this is my problem, but it should also be acknowledged how angry my mum can get, she gets stressed so easily (which is why she tried so hard to be in control), and after 23 years I think I'm so fed up of having to mould myself to her standards. She can also be prone to playing the victim. This is infuriating. Additionally, both my parents do not know how to listen. I used to try to explain how I feel calmly - but this never worked. Nothing changed so I started to get angrier and shoutier, and now we're here, and they just never listen, no matter how many times I've tried to talk to them about how I feel. This is made worse by them flat out ignoring or laughing at me when I do get angry, which makes me more angry! And afterwards, they so openly bitch about me without even trying to be quiet. 

I know I am privileged and I probably sound like a spoiled brat, but I feel like they have this idea of me now. Of what I am like. And this won't change.  No matter what I say or do, no matter how much I show I care, or do everything they ask of me - it's never enough or its undermined by something as little as sleeping before doing the washing up. It feels like they have this idea that I'm lazy, dumb, and incapable, and that they always know better. It is infuriating that they treat me like a child - and maybe that's why I still have tantrums like one lmfao. 

I don't even know why I'm posting this, I just want to know how to hold my tongue better, how to stop seeing red so easily ig. "
891,3,"I just wanted to make a post saying what has helped me in the past is to focus on the cause. 

I became the asshole at work and in my relationships, ready to ruin lives and my even taking my own in the process.

I took a whole bunch of over the counter pain pills, and they made me realize I was in pain. 

I was a bit sore when I took the pain pills, but after I did I was actually able to feel the pain in my back and knees.

I wasn't just asshole with a temper I was a person in pain, I was in fight and flight all the time I just didn't know it.   
I wanted to say to the people struggling and I still am struggling but it helped me find one of the root causes.

A animal with a broken leg will of course be more prone to snap its not that your a POS it could just be you are in pain. 

  
I don't want to be one of those old grumpy men in there 50 and 60s on the jobsite that are just assholes and everyone just says they have always been. I'm willingly to bet they wanted to be strong and drink and not fix whats causing them pain.

Really listen to your body and try and find where your pain is coming from it took me trying 1200mg of Aleve to just numb my pain enough to where I could feel it. 

  
There is hope."
892,3,"My anger is getting beyond out of control, disconnected from reality, feeling irritable and getting angry, snapping out for no reason at ppl, and then guilt and crying and spin rinse repeat!

I been having severe depression, and anxiety and PTSD since I was a early teen, I am also currently a recovering addict so thats a big reason im always angry because im not used to dealing with ppl and with life im so used to running and hidng and i just really wanna get better i feel like im cursed, or being haunted legit. Idk whats wrong with me or who i am anymore but i started to hate everybody because of how i been treated in the past and the stupid bullies from school and im 29 years old now.

893,3,Why does my anger always get the best of me?
894,3,"Hi, how do i control my temper? whenever i have a problem with my parents and try to talk to them about it, instead of acknowledging they upset me they twist it on how they were in the right. e.g today my mum completely messed up a pile of work i had organised because she said it was in the way. i try to calmly explain my issue and then my mum always throws in a snide unnecessary jab at me. then i struggle to control myself and i get my back up. it turns into an argument and as my mum throws more insults at me, i become disrespectful and say something bad. then i’m in massive trouble for being disrespectful and am a terrible daughter, and all wrongdoing is put on me.

am i in the wrong? i feel emotionally manipulated because i can’t say i have a problem with something without them twisting it on me, im always the bad guy. "

896,3,"
Hi all,

I’m a mom to a 2-year-old and have struggled with anger management my entire life. I’ve been with my partner for 4 years, and while I love him, there are things that frustrate me: he stays up until 2 a.m. on weekdays, even though his job is very stressful, leaving me to handle mornings with our child. He takes care of her when he can, but it still feels uneven. He’s also had no sex drive since the beginning of our relationship, and he doesn’t enjoy socializing much, while I’m more outgoing.

That said, I know I’m not perfect either. He often tells me I complain too much and can’t control my anger. I’m critical of him, and he says it’s making life miserable. This was a problem in my previous 6-year relationship, which ended when my ex just left one day.

Now, my partner says he’s drawing a line: whenever I get angry, he’ll ignore me for one day, then two, and so on until separation unless I see a psychologist for my anger. I’ve been to psychologists before, but it hasn’t helped me manage my anger. I don’t even know what kind of treatment I need.

There’s a lot going on right now—we’re moving house, considering IVF, and I recently had a miscarriage. I’m reading about emotional abuse and wondering if I might be abusive. I tend to take out my stress on those closest to me, even if I don’t always feel stressed.

Meditation hasn’t worked for me. Any tips on how I can better understand and manage this situation? I really want to change."
897,3,"I'm having a variety of serious health issues, and my relationship with my parents has broken down and collapsed, and I am currently homeless and without a job. I am so fucking depressed and just angry at absolutely everything. I've always had anger, a lot of it, but it's just been getting more and more intense. First it was common, then the default, I would be angry more than I wasn't. But in the last 2 weeks, once I got an extremely huge bout of bad news, I just collapsed into a never ending anger. I go to sleep angry. I wake up angry. If i'm sitting alone not saying anything to myself, I'll start just cussing out nobody in general, hurling intense threats about acts of violence towards absolutely nobody. Or I'll litigate past events with incredible fury, like it's happening right now. I try to talk to other people, and just their responses, any response from them, sends me over the edge, like i can't communicate. I simply cannot take any friction at all or else I'll explode 1000% stronger than the original thing that set me off warrants. It feels like I have a wound that has been rubbed so raw, that just breathing on it causes an intense pain reaction that makes me need to fight, like anybody or anything. It's putting my stomach into knots. This has been going on for so long now, I'm so tired and I don't even know what the hell to do. Who do I turn to, who do I talk to? I'm so fucking lost and hopeless right now. I don't know what to do with myself. I feel like I shouldn't exist because I'll just ruin everyone else's life. I'm on anti-depressants, and they take the egde off sometimes, but they don't fix the problems. The problems aren't just my mood being off, it's a whole bunch of other shit that I can't just numb away.

  
I hate this so much. I hate everything."
898,3,"I have discovered through observation that the source of a lot of my anger is just the fact that i see only awful things in people. Thats not all what people are. People have many good things too i know. But lately i have been feeling like whats the point?

I am loved, especially by my parents and my friends and i love  them too. But my anger is forcing me to see onlynthe worst in them. I get angry at why they are so awful, even though i know they arent that awful. 

I am just done with people altogether. Why bother going out when they are all just awful, and i just pretend to be happy or be interested.  I have been forcing myself to go out lately but its... very hard sometimes.

So yeah i am afraid my anger is turning me into a social outcast, a recluse."
899,3,"a couple years ago a close friend told me 'i'm capable of killing someone.' I freaked out and cut her off. Also, I'm pretty sure this person meant me because I kinda pissed em off. 

But now I'm starting to think I'm also capable of that. Even as a kid I had violent fantasies. I didn't enjoy them and knew it was wrong to even think that way but I couldn't stop the thoughts. I have tried to bury them and live my life as happy as I can be which I guess worked. I still had violent thoughts but I learned to talk about what's making me angry instead of of acting on it. I also learned to apologize if I do cross any lines and own up to my mistakes.

But the thoughts never stopped. And it's gotten worse since I got into a fight with a narcissistic family member. This person told me 'in my opinion violence is ok' and when I challenged them, replied 'don't impose your views on me.'

does this mean I was wrong for thinking violence shouldn't be allowed? 

So I have this extreme rage and multiple people telling me that violence is acceptable. 

what am I to do? 
"
900,3,"I definitely have a problem. I’m scared of myself. I have a dog and a cat..when the cat does something it’s not supposed to I get mad af..and sometimes I hurt him. Plus. About myself, if someone talks about something..even something little that irritates me.. I’ll be just mad but when they keep irritating me I literally lose control. I hurt myself especially when it’s about family. I already did but I’m still alive so yeah but I’m scared. Also..when I’ll be in a relationship (I never been) I’m so scared I’m gonna try to hurt him or something..I have daily thoughts about kms or sometimes even hurting animals and k** people but I know I’d never k*** people. "
901,3,"I know this is not about my personality or any trauma, but for some reason my anger and feeling managment is worse than what i used to be in past years. I got more remorses that hit harder in these moments, i got worse empathy, lower tolerance about frustration or something that i'm not confortable. Etc.

I really like videogames and i play online games but this change of behaviour it's very noticeable on games. When i loose in the better cases i just ragequit but in the worse i used to send slurs and fake reporting whoever eliminated me. I abandoned that particular game for about 5 months but then when i was playing other online games i was doing the same exact thing. I figured out that i was feeling that looses like something personal, because it's different when a bot or a npc eliminates me bc it's programed with a certain difficulty or aim because i don't have this type of frustration in offline games but with a normal match it's other person doing that. Instead of just attemptong one more time i can't handle the anger and i even self-harm myself. 

Self-harm it's one more of my anger problems, not just in games in other situation when i'm alone like discussing with my family makes me veri angry and my method to calm down is just going to my room, closing the door and self harm myself with punches o marking me with some sharp object, i still have some scars of that situations. 

I was almost expelled from my institute for fighting. Some dude that i ""stealed"" his girl, i don't even care about them but he was pissed bc i was trying to contact her just to apologize and broke contact with her bc she was getting me in trouble with my parents bc her sister knows my mom. But ofc he found out and then he was trying to confront me. I was super reasonable, I tried to explain to him even showing him evidence and without getting upset but he was mad asf telling me to fight and that broke my patience, he was smaller than me and i almost broke his nose. 

I hate being watched, i hate doing somebody's stuff only if it's not very important, i hate awful kids, in my freelance work i feel very unconfortable when i know somebody in my house is listening my calls or meetings i don't feel with the enough privacy, it's worse when i'm playing and somebody enter to my room searching for something. 

Idk what i gotta do. I feel horrible with horrible thoughs."
902,3,"I (23M) have had anger problems for as long as I can remember. Everytime I have an outburst I tell myself that I need to get help in that moment. But a week will go by and I’ll be okay and think “nah I’m good I don’t need therapy” or “I just don’t have time for therapy bc of work.”

 I genuinely don’t have anything to be angry about. I have a great career, great financial situation, beautiful daughter, lovely wife. Sometimes the smallest most inconvenient thing will set me off and sometimes that same thing won’t. I go to the gym regularly thinking it will help but sometimes it just doesn’t. 

My wife and I know that I need some sort of therapy or anger management. But I don’t know where to start. I also feel like I’m running away from it so I don’t have to face anything I might dig up some deep trauma or something. I will admit it is hard to talk about my feelings (whether that’s due to macho man bs or not). Even just making this post is somewhat difficult because I’m not one to complain about my own personal problems to anyone. 

Any advice is welcome!"
903,3,"After I left my abusive mothers house, I will randomly get really pissed off and shut down. But if i get annoyed I’ll lash out and tell everybody to shut the fuck up causing them to yell at me and then i’ll cry. The anger feeling feels the exact same to when i used to argue with my mum. Head pressure, lump in throat, crying, heavy heart. I get told to lose the attitude and that pisses me off even more. I hate the word attitude. I fucking hate it. I’m getting angry just thinking about it bevause my mother always used to say I had attitude. It’s not attitude it’s that i’m pissed off. Fuck off. I told you to fuck off, so fuck off. Why yell at me for wanting space) ???? Sorry. Im gonna go to sleep now. Hopefully i dont fucking wake up to hammering and drilling nad laugjing and yellinh ahain."
904,3,"It's just easy to go to it now.  I've always felt awkward but more cynical than others.  Seeing things as they actually are.  Holding people to what they say.  I have the misfortune of remembering a lot details.  Cataloging interactions, not to keep score, but a simple mechanism of my how my mind works.  For years I've let a lot of things go.  I don't call people out on their bullshit.  Sometimes I wish I had.  

I'm now filled with so much rage for how genuinely rude, it feels to be around the general public.  I hold doors open for others with my arms full, and not a single ""thank you"".  Thoughtless drivers.  Friends saying they'll call, and don't.  Family members with delusional ideologies.   

I don't want to have this rage.  I have bent for so long that I've snapped.  My patience has worn to nothing for a lot.  I want to be unbothered. "
905,3,"I recently had a falling out with a friend, and I feel deeply wronged by her. I don’t believe I deserved the way she treated me. I wanted to tell her how much she hurt me, but I held back because I didn’t want to seem weak. At the same time, part of me wants to tell her how much she sucks as a person, because it feels like the only way I’ll ever find relief in this situation—but I can’t for various reasons.

She’s no longer in my life; we’ve blocked each other on all social media, and I wouldn’t want to reach out to her anyway. Despite this, I’ve been consumed by thoughts of what happened. It’s been three weeks, and I think about it every single day. How do I process this anger and move forward?"
906,3,"Like the title said, idk how long have i felt this way but i'm noticing it more frequently.   
For example : i was scrolling through facebook and there's this video of someone covering a song. That person did a very decent job on the cover but my first instinct is to hate the sound of his voice at first, then i slowly warm up to it as i listen on repeat. I just hate that dude singing for no reason at all and idk how to stop it. Even when i don't watch the video anymore i felt like holding grudge agaisnt that guy.   
what's wrong with me"
907,3,Had never been where I’ve placed items overtly and knowingly in the wrong place. Come to find out once I had closed the door. That those items belonged across the street. I had to recite the name of Yawhe and Christ. #Endingthewicked one trial at a time. 
908,3,"I'm so sick and tired of my brain. I wish I didn't care about anything. So many things trigger me. My dad treated me like shit growing up and had horrible anger problems which he took out on me. Now he married a younger woman months after my mom passed away and he is happy as a clam, while I am all fucked up, miserable, full of hate and anger and I just want to be fucking dead.

I burned some food in the oven this morning (I followed the instructions on the packaging precisely but it still got burned) and it has ruined my whole fucking day. I can't stand my house smelling like burned food, I can't stand wasting food and money. I just want to be fucking dead already. I hate it here dealing with this stupid bullshit and this stupid fucking brain I was cursed with that won't just let me relax or be happy because it's always looking for a way to make me rage and be miserable."
909,3,"I just went to a hockey game and there was a guy behind us that spilled his beer on our friend and his mom. I asked if they were ok and if they wanted me to do anything. They said no. 

So we ignored it. But later it happened again and I couldn’t ignore it. I started yelling at the guy and he told me to sit down and shut the fuck up. I was ready to pour something on him but instead told an attendant about it. 

Nothing happened. I’m so anger!!! 😡 this ashole gets away with pouring his beer on me and my friends and his mom and nothing happens. I really wish I woulda taken it into my own hands and poured something on him. 


Am I wrong? What would you do?"
910,3,"I struggle on the daily with trying not to hurt others. Some days I can't help but to attack people online with the most hurtful things I can think of, because it's better than attacking them, IRL, right? I feel this is getting worse, and I never come clean to shrinks because I refuse to willingly allow myself to be institutionalized. Has anyone here managed to overcome similar mental issues? Do you suppose boxing would be a good outlet for this extreme aggression? Thanks for hearing me out.

"
911,3,"
I have a stupid idea for an app:
What if there was an app where if a certain someone pisses off enough people on the Internet, those people can challenge the Internet troll to a fight challenge? 

The way it would work is, say if someone keeps trolling others in the comments then that troll will gain negative reputation over time by being reported by other verified users. 
The more negative rep the troll has, the more they qualify for duel requests from other users.
Any unanswered duel requests passed a certain point will pile up and be marked with a certified troll stamp which will be visible to others on all social media platforms for a period of time. If the said troll reaches it's limit on duel requests with no response, the troll will have no choice but to delete their accounts and be banned from social media for a year.

Ps this is just hypothetical and for fun "
912,3,"im so quick to anger  and its always so big and hard to control or stop and always for stupid little stuff like laundry not being dry, im 16 and i feel its stupid to act like this at my age and its like im constantly searching for a way to be mad i cant stop, just today i was walking my dog and i remembered how a few months ago some dog owner leg their dog go and he chased mine and i got so mad in my mind its starting to genuinely affect me"
913,3,"okay so like when i have a small disagreement i get way too heated over it like my friend saying 'see ya wouldn't wanna be ya' when i've always heard it 'see ya see ya wouldn't wanna be ya' or even how i count as 1, 2, 3, 4... and my partner counts missisippi's or i say Zee instead of Zhed (i'm canadian) idk why and i just don't wanna get mad at anyone i just always find it annoying when someone says that something is a certain way when i've experienced it a whole different way, any help?"
914,3,"im 21 f, + weed user.(thatll come into play later) my sister is 23, we live together at our parents house. (let me mention ik one of us has to leave. i wish i could. living in this economy sucks)

my sister sexually assaulted me as a child and i keep having dreams about exposing her, describing in detail what she did to me to her boyfriend. yesterday we had a huge fight over something miniscule and then i had a dream i described everything she did to me in detail, ive had dreams were i throw knifes at her face, water, etc.

Yesterday, i went downstairs to get myself a cup of water, she was there. i am always uncomfortable with her because the only thing she does is belittle me and try to pick a fight. and all i do when i look at her is remember what she did to me.

she started with oh my god are you smoking right now!? i responded with no. she then asked if i brought something down with me. i responded with no. then i opened the fridge and sat down HER almond juice (she labels all her things in the fridge with an A) on piece of parchement paper that was on the stove. our kitchen is semi cluttered so we had minimal counterspace, me setting HER almond milk on the paper made her snap. its not like any of our family even touched it only her but she comes up to me in my face and says ""dont you know how to use your brain? CLEARLY im cooking something why would you set that on my parchment paper now my parchment paper is containmented"" and i said"" i actually think you need anger management classes or meds, its insane how mad you get over a simple mistake"" and then that makes her even more mad and she starts to clap her hands and she goes i think you belong in an asylum, i responded with girl i think your the one who belongs in an asylum, get a new piece of parchment paper if its containmeted or flip it over ?? then she responds with arent you moving out, etc didnt mom pay for all your college??? i only responded with no.

after this heated arguement i was so mad i started to cry, not because i was upset, i felt rage. i wanted to physcially hit her, fight her, beat her to the brink of passing out, she is much bigger than me weight wise but i dont care. i am so close to snapping and all i want to do is beat the shit out of her."
915,3,"When I was a toddler, I had once destroyed a printer, laptop and a phone, when I was slightly angry. When I got at the age of 7-9, it was less. But since I became like 11 it got worse again, since my 14th I get pissed at everything.

Different tones, sudden changes, loudness, silence, being ignored. I litterally get piseed at everything. No matter how little.   
  
I'm constantly trying my best to hold myself back, and when I even slightly raise my voice, someone says 'You don't have to be so damn angry!' in a rude/scolding tone, making me even more pissed off.   
I've cried out of anger. Cut myself. Shouted in a pillow, sometimes I even feel like passing out. 

I have no idea where it comes from so suddenly.   
Any managment advice?"
916,3,"I easily get fustrated when i dont understand something in a school subject, to the point where i start crying and giving up. i cant accept the fact that im not good at everything and its killing me inside everyday, can somebody give me an advice to my current situation?"
917,3,"So I made a post and someone(I’ll say Poster)made a comment, I did ignore that comment, but there was a reply under that comment, and Poster replied to that reply calling my post shitty, which caused me to say “fuck off” to that person two times, yeah wasn’t smart, I deleted the post and reposted the post trying to start things fresh…and I caused a comment war…yeah not my best work.

I do have anger issues for a while, but never in person(sometimes), mostly online and realized that was the stupidest thing ever, I tried to be a better person, and I really do, but one off comments from other people just triggered a switch I need to fix that problem."
918,3,Had a crappy morning at work I don’t like got to leave early though luckily so I went to get lunch. The line at the place was long and was taking a while so being already irritated this made it worse. Well long story short a younger girl cut me in the drive thru line and it immediately set me off. Immediately honked hard and was tailgating hard probably making myself look a fool as always. When I go to pay for my food the cashier goes “that girl cut you in line.” I go “yeah”. “ well she paid for your food to say sorry.” Don’t know what it was but I immediately went mute was beyond shocked someone would do that. Tried to catch her in the parking lot to say sorry and thanks but couldn’t find her. Drove the whole way home just thinking about how I need to chill out and try my best to not burst out especially at others. Also need to stop drugs but that is a whole other rant . Truly got punched from kindness in the face hard. 
919,3,"So, I've recently been noticing a pattern after I start to calm down a little from any type of HEAVY anger I've felt, things like family related issues and whatnot, And almost every time i start to regain my composure, A miniature stomach ache starts and then gradually escalates into a feeling of me wanting to vomit.   
does anyone have a way to help me with preventing that?"
920,3,"Long story short, have a very unhealthy relationship with Christianity. I don’t believe in it, however, I care about many people who do and my resentment towards it has started to damage my relationships with people I care about. Any tips on how to work on this specific type of anger? I’d like to be at peace with it and view it the same way I do any other religion. I consider myself agnostic, so I’m fairly open-minded towards most religions. "
921,3,"I recently had a very loud and aggressive outburst of anger toward someone in front of a friend.  It isn't typical for me, and I cannot get past the shame.  A homeless guy was trying to get into a building we were in and wouldn't stop. He was waiting for others to arrive so he could push in. I finally lost my shit on him, yelling very loudly, scaring my friend and humiliating myself. The guy left, but 4 days later I am still so ashamed. I can't believe I lost it like that.  I'm afraid of myself now because I don't ever want to do that again. How do I move past this?"
922,3,"Hey all, I'm actually pretty new to this sub but I just wanted to ask if anyone else could relate to just getting really depressed about not having ur anger under control.

I feel like I can't be a normal person because of it at all, and like I mess up any and every event I try to do because of it. I tried taking management, but all the excercises didn't help much..

It's like it built a brick wall around all the things I want to do in life, and I only just started life. I really don't want to be rude to others.. but .. yeah..

Does anyone else go through this, and if so, how do you cope??"
923,3,Don't know how to get over this rage I have towards people. I mean there's like a few people I like but that list is small. Idk what to really do about my anger. It's deeply ingrained and causes me to lash out and claim I hate certain family members too. I literally say I hate everyone on this planet except for a  small group of people. But it feels like the world doesn't understand me and that I'm not like others. Which just promotes the rage even further. Idk what to do anymore. 
924,3,"I’m F 18 and i get so angry over the smallest things. I don’t want to call it anger issues because i don’t want to think of myself that way yk? If im watching something that has music and someone around me starts singing along to it i will skip the video in anger, If im grumpy from waking up i dont want anyone talking to me for hours, it drives me insane! i insanely feel sorry for my family and my SO. what do i do to fix this?? i don’t want to be this way anymore. "
925,3,"I used to ask edgy questions on Quora all the time because their moderation was never all that strict about this stuff compared to Reddit, even though it used to still be stricter with BNBR and all. (But still stupid because they used to have a ban on anonymous usernames.) When I couldn't sleep last night, I got the urge to do it here on Reddit, but then got sleepy and calm enough to not actually do this. "
926,3,"I get angry on a moment's notice. I yell at my dog. He's so sweet and I get mad and yell at him. I sometimes scare my adult son when I get mad about things and scream ""FUCK!"" are the top of my lungs. I teach music but sometimes use music (or lack of) as a punishment. I should never take away music! I need to learn to give warnings to students in a nice way. 

I need to be kinder to myself. I hate who I am and need to find a way to overlook the hate and go easier on myself but I can't. 

I don't know how to control the sudden, random, seething anger within me"
927,3,"First time poster:

I find myself (M44) mad all the time. My wife (F42) have 2 great kids, good jobs, and don’t really have financial issues. We have good and secure jobs. 

I don’t know why, but I’m angry all the time. I snap for almost no reason. I seem to get pleasure out of pissing other people off - coworkers, my wife, my friends, parents…. I pissed off my sister so bad we stopped talking almost 2 years ago. And when I think about the issue that I got mad about (her 2rd divorce and choosing her own happiness over her 2 kids) it just makes me mad all over again. I yell at my kids. My friends. Hell, even yelled at my boss one time. 

 Last week I blew up on my mother in law in the middle of our street - to the point where the neighbours had to check in with her and were using words like “elder abuse”. I don’t think it was, but maybe I’m not seeing things clearly. 

I don’t have much to be mad about. I have a pretty good life. But I’m mad and pissy at the drop of a hat. 

I think I’m driving my wife away. And I don’t want that. I’d be nothing without her and likely waste away in despair or drink myself into an early grave. I love her more than anything. I don’t want to lose her. She feels like she has to walk on eggshells when she’s around me. I’m wrecking my marriage and I don’t know why 

But I’m just so mad all the time. And when I’m mad it’s almost like I want to stay mad and yell at the entire world. 

Anyone else feel that way? How do I stop being so mad? I feel lost. 
"
928,3,During the course of my life i have somehow connected hunger with anger and now whenever im hungry i get angry and vice versa so now i never know what caused what and its making me gain weight rapidly and i keep eating all day. How do i fix this
929,3,"As the title reads. I can't get mad at him. He has done some mean things. Some very frustrating things. Some downright crappy things, but I can't get angry with him, I can't get mad at him (not more than a passing feeling - maybe an hour or two), and I have never yelled at him.  We have never had a real “volatile” fight. 

I “was” in an abusive marriage which I'm happily out of, and a not great “yeller” of a “first” relationship years after my divorce. 

This is more of a casual thing (due to work and family obligations- and distance), but we care deeply for each other. I cannot say he doesn't frustrate the living crap out of me at times, but I don't have this fired up urge for fight or flight… he's just - calm -?  I don't even feel the urge to yell at him. And I do have a temper, and I do get mad at plenty of other people (I get over that too… but it takes a bit longer!) 

Is this normal? Or is this something inherently wrong with us? "
930,3,"I barely even feel sad or down anymore, I just get mad. Just so fucking angry about everything that I can’t even change. I’m so stressed and full of hatred that it’s probably taking years off my lifespan. Everything just pisses me off and I’m so sensitive and bad at working out my emotions with myself that it just stays there bottled up. I want to just scream and take a baseball bat to everything but obviously I can’t. I’m tired of having to be the bigger person all the time. I hate being angry and I don’t want to say things I don’t mean but goddamn I just want to be able to snap for once. I won’t because I don’t ever want to lash out at someone who doesn’t deserve it (perhaps the only people I know who actually deserve it are my abusive brother and dad) but maybe I really would feel better after. I wish I knew how to deal with this shit instead of just thinking about it and staying pissed off. I don’t know what I did to deserve this."
931,3,"I can’t get through even one day now without my anxiety meds which just make me dissociate and fall asleep the second I finish work. It’s either take the meds or be depressed and overstimulated and angry all day. I just hate my life right now it’s just work, pills, sleep on repeat. I have no desire to do anything or see my therapist. I have nothing to say to her that I haven’t said already. Quite literally everyone and everything makes me mad these days and I hate life. I’m sure if I get any comments on this post I’ll get mad at some of them too. I’m accepting the fact that I’ll need drugs my whole life just to function at a base level. Can someone tell me they relate or at least understand so I don’t feel crazy."
932,3,"Is it normal to have violent thoughts when you're really angry? I had an argument with my girlfriend and found myself thinking about hurting her. I even said it out loud to her, but I immediately realized it was wrong and apologized afterward. I know I would never actually do it, but I feel really troubled by these thoughts."
933,3,"Hi everyone, I want to start by saying I am already looking into therapy because of this issue, but wanted some insight if anyone else experienced and got through something similar. 
There have been multiple times when me and my husband have been fighting and I get so mad and my anxiety gets so high that I lash out and start saying the most hurtful possible things I can think of. 
It's like I literally can't stop or control it... I always feel horrible after and apologize but this can't keep happening I fear I have done serious damage to my marriage because of it. "
934,3,"When I get upset, I tend to want to talk to my partner, always. And sometimes the upset might be because of something ridiculous like a video game issue and sometimes a bit more serious like a communication issue.

And the problem is I want to share that with my partner, I want them to understand that I'm upset or that they've done something wrong, even if it's not something they can instantly change.

And I tend to just fire out an angry text that blames them and that I regret as soon as I think clearly again (usually 10min) but the damage is already done.

I've already said a couple of times that I wouldn't do it again, and last night I did it still.

And I love them so much but on the moment the anger just overwhelms me and I feel like I have to let it out.

I don't want to do it again, I want to stick to my promise so I've looking into some selfhelp books like Feeling Good & Non Violent Communication by Rosenberg.

But does anyone have a script that they go through in those moments or idk a technique to hold back on sending that hurtful message I will regret very soon?

I don't want to be this angry person but when I get stuck in my head it's so hard to get out of this red haze until I regret it."
935,3,"I yell, i curse, i say very mean things, and that's with people i genuinely love and care about, and when with strangers it only get worse. Please help, I'm new here and i wanna know how i can change that and be better in control. "
936,3,"I am a very pacific girl. Nearly 16, i don't recall a single instant of me getting angry, before today. I exploded. It's the first time it happened to me. I snapped. 

I live in a country where we have long days of school: I often start at 8:30 am to finish at 6:30pm, with at least 1h of public transports each morning and each afternoon. The, I study until 10\~11 pm, so that i can hang out with friends on the weekend. I go to sleep around 2am on weekends, but still get up at 8 so i can get some work done. 

But I still managed to get grounded by my mother. She keeped saying that it was an important school year, that i wasn't focusing on my studies and was just fooling around. Usually i just get sad, shut down and go do something else, but i snapped: I yelled at her, saying that she knows nothing, that i work late on the weekdays, that i barely get sleep so that i can study on the mornings, that i have good grades and that i don't know what she wants with me. I snapped. For real.

But she just coldly answered me: ""You're always like this, ungratful. You always want to have the last word, so it's no use arguing with me""

It just went worse. I was SO angry, so mad i couldn't think straight. So i got up, left the dining room and shut my bedroom door closed. She doesn't seem to care so that's alright, but i feel so hurt. I'm calming myself don now, and my anger turned into sadness. Now i can't even see the screen well because of how teary my eyes are

Why am I like this I never get angry usually what's happening now and why now??

  
Just needed to get this off my chest"
937,3,"When my mom is angry with me or my sister, she has a certain manner of getting enraged. Her body language is such that she would stand, would sharp one hand upon another hand (like one sharps its sword upon stone), and she bites her teeth so bad that she stammers while she utter curse words  of anger like ""you guys rather die, and more cursewords in the mother tongue"" (while biting her teeth and hands posture as I have said). Sometimes, I feel she is possessed the moment she is angry. Is it same with everyone, is your mom or anyone related to you angry at you the same way??"
938,3,"Hello all! I began therapy this year and have been working to become more aware of how I react when I feel stressed or out of control. Something I’ve noticed a lot is my tendency to displace or take out my anger on less threatening people or pets. 

When I was little, this would manifest as me biting or hitting my pets when I was angry or they did something that tipped me over the edge. I understand this is absolutely not an acceptable way to cope with the anger. Now an adult, I’ve improved how I treat pets a lot, but maybe every few months, they will do something minor when I’m elevated and I will yell at them. This scares them and makes me feel horrible and guilty after. 

I worry about how this affects my pets and how my anger could continue to manifest if I don’t actively work on it. How do you stop displacing your anger??

Please no recommendations for hitting a pillow or taking out the anger on an inanimate object, my therapist says that this can train my brain to see lashing out/hitting something as an appropriate response to anger. "
939,3,"Theres a girl thats always connected to every single guy I have something going on with. In my last situationship that lasted a year and she kept posting with him. I now have another boyfriend, and I love him so much. He loves me too, he even gave me a promise ring 
In my country there are basically proms but u just go to watch other people dance and do talent shows (balul bobocilor), and after that u all go party, and my boyfriend went to this girls prom and he knows i hate her, theyre ex situationship, family friends and pretty sure his first love. And that wouldnt have been the problem, but he send a snap with her on stage and tagged her. Im so mad but I feel like this isnt something I should be angry over. Hes known her forever and goes to his house often. The part that really got me is that I answered to his snap with questions marks and he left me on opened… i have no words"

When people are incompetent at their jobs it makes my blood boil so fucking fast, and sadly many many people i have to deal with are incompetent at their jobs. “your stupidity is gonna penalize me?” fuck that. i just wish i could teach these idiots a lesson but then i’ll be in prison. how am i supposed to deal with this shit? somebody please give me some anger management techniques cause it’s only a matter of time."
942,3,"My entire life I have struggled with my anger issues and they have only gotten worse and more intense. I feel like im drowning in anger, hate and frustration. Even though I received a lot of help and it did get better over the last 10 years, I have Noticed that my outburst have become more intense, verbally abusive, scary and sometimes as if someone completely different was controlling me. 
I hurt and push away everyone i care about. This illness is nothing but a cruel punishment. Atp im convinced that there is no more helping me. Im Angry and sad all the time. I often wish that I just wouldnt wake up the next morning to spare myself from the pain of existing and others from me. 
All my happy Memories are now something I can barely enjoy anymore. 
I dont drink, smoke or do anything to make me mad. I just exist like this. 
As you can see, my writing is pretty much all over the place. Thats because i just had a verbal altercation created by my anger. And it was extremely intense. Even my mother has given up on me and urged me to do something because I apperetly dont give a shit about the help she has Provided me.
In the last 2 years my old self has died. Even my family Sees it. They cant even help me anymore"

Last night she even took my phone and forced me to sleep. I got so angry that It started to hurt my chest. Whenevr this happens, and It happens a lot, i get scared of myself.

946,3,I am male 22. I have a job and I'm also currently in school. I love with my fiance who is also going to school and she is pregnant. Ever since we've been together we've always had some differences that escalate into arguments that will sometimes get physical. Earlier tonight however in a fit of rage I crashed a line I never thought I would. It got physical between her and I over something that is negligible in hindsight and I put my unborn son's and my fiance's lives in danger. I've been to anger management in the past and I've tried to use what I had learned but it doesn't work. I feel like the worse thing that could've ever happened to my fiance and I sincerely need to get help because of something were to happen to either her or my son and I was to be blamed that would be the end of me.
947,3,"So I went through a very stressful process of accessing this drug which took like a year to get. I felt really powerless, like just going through trying to get funding for it (super pricey) and I just suffered so much while waiting to get funding. They sent me an email just asking about something relating to my medication and I was so angry that I just ranted to them asking why their drug is so pricey and the hell i went through to get it and asked why they made it so hard for patients to access. I just let all my frustration out and now i feel like...ok that was an overreaction. i do this alot and know i shouldn't but its so hard to control, you know? now i feel bad. i can't seem to learn from my mistakes. i think i have been through the ringer with healthcare workers and pharmaceutical companies, and i am used to being sweet and nice and i'm just sick of that now."

949,3,"# When it comes to our emotions, we tend to usually justify why we do what we do. 

The **problem** with that is that there are conflicts of interest. In those cases, we’re the defendant, we’re the prosecutor, and we’re the judge. 

The reason this is a problem is because we tend to have the ability to quickly know when people have taken things with us too far. However, we don’t always seem to be as sensitive when we’ve gone too far with others!

Take Mario, for instance…

Mario and Nilsa have been dating for three years and have one child together. For the most part they both work great as a team providing for their family. However, whenever Mario feels like Nilsa isn’t giving him enough attention, he gets angry and becomes abusive. It’s gotten so bad that when Nilsa lost her aunt and didn’t answer her cell phone because she was out mourning with other family members, Mario took a bat to their 70-inch television.

Once she made it home and saw the damage, she asked him what happened. When he told her he flipped out because she was ignoring his calls, it bothered her and she let him know how selfish he was acting. This fueled Mario’s anger even more. Consequently, he hauled off and hit her in the mouth knocking out her front tooth. 

Truth is, Mario was being selfish, but he felt somewhat justified because of how Nilsa’s comment made him feel. Clearly, he was out of pocket, but initially he didn’t really think so.

It wasn’t until the next day when his anger was completely settled that he realized he may have overreacted and apologized to her for what he did. However, the damage was already done, and **Nilsa’s tooth** was not going to grow back because now he was sorry about it. 

Although Mario promised to work overtime to pay for Nilsa to get a replacement, Nilsa has to experience unnecessary shame and embarrassment. Not only does she have to attend her aunt’s funeral without her front tooth, but her family members are going to want to know why all of a sudden, her tooth is missing.

Mario really does care for Nilsa the best he knows how. However, they can’t have what they really want, which is a loving, healthy family. 

Nilsa believes its worth sticking it out with Mario because he told her he really wants to be a good boyfriend and father. And although that may be true, Mario becoming a good boyfriend and father because he said he wants to be is as probable as a lemon seed growing up to become a pine tree. What she doesn’t realize is that until Mario deals with the underlining issues of his anger they are never going to have the loving, healthy family they want because the true elements of love and health are just not there! 

***So, what’s really going on with Mario?***  

Mario is full of anger! And truthfully, his angry outburst had nothing to do with Nilsa. She’s just the closest to him! 

The real issue is that he hasn’t dealt with his past trauma, yet! 

**THE BACK STORY:**

In high school, Mario was an amazing basketball player. In his senior year, he was able to convince a few college coaches to come watch him play. If recruited, he would have received a full-ride scholarship. 

During that game, he went up for a rebound. But when his feet hit the ground again, he felt something like a shot in the heel followed by a snap. Crumbling to the floor, he grabbed for his left ankle. Soon enough, he learned that he had ruptured his Achillies tendon and couldn’t play ball for two consecutive years.

The truth is Mario is resentful about his missed opportunity in high school and believes that had he not injured his heel, his life would be better. So, whenever he feels like he’s being pushed to the side, he becomes triggered because it takes him back to the time he’d been pushed to the side after he injured his heel. 

To Mario’s defense, he has tried to fix his anger.  He’d bought a book on how to control it and did try some of the techniques which helped for a while but wasn’t effective for long. Then someone suggested that he buy a punching bag to punch when he got angry.  All that did was train him to only be satisfied when he hit something, which is, honestly, why he ended up hitting Nilsa in the mouth. 

The reason these techniques don’t work is because neither are dealing with the root issue. 

For us Believers, we are told in scripture to get rid of our bitterness, wrath, and anger (Ephesians 4:31-32).  This means that it is actually in our power to get rid of these things!

**Mario** can only fix his anger when he decides to let go of his resentment toward life! Resentment is a combination of anger, frustration, and disappointment. The only way Mario can let go of his resentment is by first letting go of the belief that the high school opportunity was the only good opportunity he could have ever head. Then he’d need to let go of his old dream and simply dream up a new one!

***Rock with Me now…***

With the human experience, we get the freedom of choice. However, depending on what side of life we find ourselves on, we see this choice as either a curse or a blessing.

Our freedom to choose allows us to choose the path we take in life. Plan A is the human plan, the plans we make. Plan B is God’s plan, the plan He had in mind for us when He sent us here to live on earth.

The thing is, when we choose our plan, Plan A, we’re pretty much on our own. That means, we have to fight to make it happen. 

What we don’t always have knowledge of are the spiritual things that causes interference. These interferences can include family curses, demonic influences, spiritual soul ties, and the power of our words.

In God’s plan, Plan B, He takes care of everything. Our only job is to develop a close relationship with Him, which is our protection, and **willingly obey** as He leads and guides us. The challenge with God’s plan is that it’s often times things we don’t want to do, or that we don’t feel qualified enough to do. But He qualifies those He calls and makes provision for what He approves. And in the end, we get the most out of the life that God plans for us, now and forever more!

950,3,"Do you ever have really intense imaginary arguments with ppl who aren’t there?

I had a bad experience with a relative months ago. It’s still not resolved. Now like my brain is arguing with her, what I should’ve said or what I want to say next time I see her. 😔"
951,3,"Aside from medication and therapy, what are some ways you manage your anger?

When I get so enraged I just want to break things and scream. This is obviously not ok as a mom with little ones and there’s no way to do this in private. 

I do manage best by removing myself from the situation but sometimes the anger continues and I can’t calm myself down"
952,3,"35yo m here. About 2.5 months ago I became extremely angry for the first time in my life (my sister doing some very dumb shit during her divorce that hurt our side of the family and her kid) and unlocked a new ""achievement"" - high blood pressure during rage.

Now even a small thing that makes me angry for like 5 minutes will raise my blood pressure continuously for hours. For example, earlier today I got very minimally angry because my gf was demanding some unrealistic stuff and during the anger itself my blood pressure raised a bit. That's the normal part, right...  What's not normal is that even hours after the anger has resolved, the high blood pressure continues. 

I have verified this effect with a blood pressure monitor several times. My normal bp is 130/85 (a bit high but I am overweight). Somehow my blood pressure will elevate to around 150-160/100 and will stay there for hours long after I've finished being angry.

What fixes it is enough time or alcohol. Drinking a beer or two will normalize my blood pressure quickly. Until I get even minimally angry again for some reason lol.

Anyone else had lingering high blood pressure after even a short anger episode?"
953,3,"Whenever I get angry especially when I'm home at night I tend to spiral and drink until I ultimately pass out or somehow find something to change my mood

I've tried turning to YouTube/TV or gaming but when I'm upset and know I'm just trying to distract myself it just furthers my anger but turns some of it to myself and the media I loved at that point. Instead I typically find myself putting on some heavy music and letting it consume me until a song comes on that changes my mood. 

That feels like a bad strategy but I've yet to have a better idea. Any suggestions?"
954,3,"Fuuuck I'm sorry I'm just mad right now. I hate when I lose an argument cause the other person thinks theyre right and you cant do anything to change their mind. So tired of getting attacked, let me fucking be. Jesus christ, I'm going through so much as it is I don't need you on my ass especially when youre gonna make claims that are totally false and unlogical. Let me be please.

Sorry redditors, nothing yall did this was my personal life, just letting my anger out 😅"
955,3,Is there any way you overcome your rage before you become angry? This affects my relationship and even my wife left the house and claims I am the problem? I am sensitive person and when my wife does not listen to me I become angry soon? What should i do?
956,3,"Over the course of the past year, ive lost so much. I fractured a couple bones taking my out of all my physical activities like basketball football athletics gymnastics all those clubs. I face severe outbursts of anger over tiny things that shouldnt even cause frustration. I have zero idea how to control it or what causes it, and ive seen a licensed school therapist who had no idea what to do with me and was blatantly scared of me because i ended up screaming at her every session bcs she triggered it.

I have deep underlying trauma which more than likely contributes to the anger but honestly i just need help. I know when im about to get angry, its like its bubbling up inside of me until it all just explodes and cant stop. It comes in waves at a time, sometimes lasting multiple hours where i just cant handle anything or anyone and have to isolate myself. I have violent verbal outlashes at people i care about, i feel the urge to break everything in sight, hurt people, hurt myself, punch the walls and scream and cry. I cant keep going on like this but my parents wont hear me and say its impossible for me to feel this way. Im young (mid teens) so im unsure if i can even seek medical help without my mum there. Theres been days i have to leave class and punch the walls of the toilet stall, days im snapping pens in class, getting angry at classmates because i need to let it out. I scream at teachers, argue with them, get kicked out of lessons multiple times a week if not atleast once or twice a day and i just cant deal with this pain anymore"
957,3,Sometimes I say things that i don't mean out of anger. But I like making it worse. I like seeing how bad things can get. I wait till things are irreversible and then isolate and self harm. I don't know what to do.
958,3,"I’ve lived with anger my whole life and I have tried ignoring it just treating it like it’s normal. 
Today I made a horrible mistake at my job.
A customer was being rude to me and made me feel stupid and inferior. Something so insignificant I should’ve just went on with my day. I usually ignore rude customers. 
But this time, I snapped, I went outside screamed, punched a wall then went into a bathroom and punched it and elbowed it until the wall came apart and my elbow was open with blood. 
I had to go to the hospital and get it stitched up and now I’m laying here thinking, I could’ve avoided this by calming down or just taking a break. But when I’m angry I feel like I can’t think, I can’t breathe, I have to punch something or do some damage to make people fear/respect me. 

And today, I realized this wasn’t the first time.
My first job two customers were rude to me and I got into a fist fight with them and lost. Then another customer got angry with me over the intercom and I threw my headset and yelled and I was fired shortly after. Another time a customer was being snarky with me and I started punching the wall in the back until my hands were bruised.

I get furious when people disrespect me. I know I shouldn’t hurt people so typically I just punch walls and hurt myself, but that has cost me 3 jobs so far. And this is the first time I sent myself to the hospital because of my anger. 

Tomorrow, I’m going to research behavioral therapists.
However, my dad might find out what happened and kick me out and if I do I’m just fucked either way. He knows I have had a history of anger and pain. He just tells me to workout, grow up and continue on.
I did that for a while but even then this anger is inside. He’s a hypocrite anyways cuz he works security and he smiles and laughs when he talks about hurting people at his job or intimidating people.
But me, I care about people and even though people get me upset I don’t want to hurt anyone, at the same time I don’t like being disrespected.

I just needed to vent. Not sure what good that will do for me now. But I can’t lose my mind anymore. I’m exhausted."
959,3,"I have ALWAYS been called the angry kid. I didnt realise it but I was the angry teen and young adult as well. I always felt misunderstood and never saw myself as moody and angry. I am now 30 F and for the most part I seem to get irritated by inconsequential things less and less. However, I had to work hard and be mindful that everything is not worth getting upset about. When my first parent passed, I realised I was very immature and made the choice to be happier and calmer and it worked for the most part. I spoke to a professional for hours on end andd kind of learned to accept and love myself. I became less self-conscious and anxious and syarted to enjoy life more. then my other parent passed and I felt myself ""growing up"" and realising that life is too short. so for 4-5 yeas when people shout at me, I dont shout back. But today I lost my cool with a work related issue and I wasn't even high-pitched angry/upset as usual I was lower and more hostile sounding as my supervisor pointed out. Several people have mentioned that my face looks hostile and I speak in a rude tone and today after she pointed it ouut I couldn't switch it off. My face was hot and I was shaking. I so could've handled things better but man I need help. How do others stay so calm in the face of confrontation. I hate that my face is easy to read and my voice betrays my emotions. "
960,3,"Hate dealing with people. There's a reason I'm an introvert. People will turn on you and use you an act as you were never cool with each other.

People I have me like women now it's like we never met and I'm a adult looser. A guy that nobody understands at that my so called Dad is probably my biggest adversary.

Always ready to talk down on me and treat me inferior. Would it not be best just to die?

Imperfect but I can't take being hated and can't take being Targeted. I have anxiety and depression which I take antidepressants. Dad doesn't understand and talks down on me no matter what.

He have this image that he is perfect and I'm inferior. Even me saying hey to him is an issue and I rarely initiate and that's partly why.

But it suppose to be all good when he does. There is no one to be trusted.  I deal with self esteem issues what's the point"
961,3,"I’ve had a pretty shit life so far. I was SA’d as a teen by a student at school, I got into countless fights, I’ve been in an impatient facility twice since graduation and have been bouncing back and forth between nothing jobs while attending a shitty community college. I recently started opening up with my therapist about my assault which has resulted in me talking about it with my family. I was talking with my mom about how I was angry that the person who assaulted me was probably living a much happier life than I was and that there are probably so many horrible people living their best lives. My mother responded by telling me that envy was a sin… this same mother once broke my arm as a kid and has the nerve to talk to me about sin.🤣🤣🤣 I can’t take it anymore. I honestly believe we are living in the worst possible version of reality."
962,3,Along time ago I broke my tablet and it stopped working it I was sad and I cried I love that tablet and I got mad and broke my tablet. And last year I broke my phone and I am upset that I don't have no access to my data and I am afraid that I might break my phone and I don't have the money to replace it . Do anybody have any advice ? 
963,3,"Like the title says, Sorry if i mispell something, not a native speaker.
Im 27 male, i Always struggled with self esteem, i used tò be the fat kid and i always got bullied for My Weight, sometimes even by My parents.
I have a girlfriend of SIX years, wich i love with all My Heart, a stable job as a teacher Who works with special need Kids ( im planning tò go back tò university tò take another degree in this field so i can do this job better and with a Better pay), i work in a local web radio as a podcast producer ( in not the guy who yaps in a microphone, but im the One Who has tò make sure that microphone is placed properly), and i play bass in a band..
Im smart and pretty cultured and i love music and art.
When i was 20 i sufferend of depression and self harming and in the last few years i had some problem controlling anger.
Rationally i know i'm not a loser, but i cant help but shake the feeling that no matter how much how i do It cant be helped: i will never feel or be loved for Who i am, but only if i can give something tò people, and if i havent got anything to give then im worth nothing.
This makes me so fucking angry and frustrated i would prefer tò hurt myself than tò take criticismo
 from My parents/GF ( all of them are very Precise people, while in more chaotic) again, bevause everytime It hurts so deep and so much...
No matter how many things i do they Will NEVER be enough for me tò feel Happy about myself because everytime i feel like i could relax and be happy there Is Always some Little thing i forgot or something i could have done Better and people around me seems tò love tò highlight every fucking Tiny Little imperfection everytime i do something
Even if i tell them ( and i did many times) how much It makes me suffer.
However when im the One in need I instantly become this huge burden for everyone and if i try tò Say something im and asshole.

The worst part Is i feel like all this It s like something that maybe in the past could have been fixed but now im this way and nothing Will ever change and im getting so fucking tired of being angry about this i Just Wish i could feel some serenity ..."
