1,3,"Last December, I was laid off *two weeks before Christmas*, Ebeneezer Scrooge style. Why? The HR lady told me the company didn't have enough money to keep multiple senior editors on the payroll. They kept someone who had been at the company longer than me, and the junior editor I trained. I was upset, but I left on good terms with almost everyone. I went to the holiday party, let everyone else pay for my drinks, and peaced out.

They barely gave me any severance. I was unemployed for six months, and not for lack of trying. I just signed a contract with a new company.

Tonight, I received a text from an old coworker, asking if I'm available to re-record and update parts of an award-winning project I edited while I worked there. Not even an email. A text.

Now, this person and I did not part on good terms. About a month before I was laid off, he took over a project from me after too many rounds of his notes had us two weeks behind schedule. He didn't communicate clearly with me about what he wanted, and just did it himself over the weekend. I told my manager about his communication issues and bad time management, and brought it up at the next team meeting. This coworker responded by getting defensive, doubling down, and pulling from the old misogynist's playbook: manplaining to me about how to do my job, speaking to my male manager as if I weren't there, and calling my work ""emotional"" instead of ""technical."" I called him out on it in person and in a written performance review, but obviously, he still works there and I don't.

I don't have proof that it was a retaliatory firing, but the timing is very sus. The silver lining was that I didn't have to work with him anymore.

My new contract doesn't prevent me from taking other freelance gigs and redoing my work on that project, and the extra money would be nice. But here's where I need your help, Reddit:

Do I say no, and leave them to fend for themselves? Or do I say yes? If I say yes, what is the coldest, pettiest way of speaking to this guy and getting what I can from a company that screwed me over?"
2,3,"""Make no mistake: executives are not okay. These aren’t just long days — they’re relentless marathons of damage control. Internal briefings. Legal prep. Media strategy calls. Board pressure. Shareholder updates. Rehearsals for testimonies that can’t afford a single misstep.

Many of the executives aren’t going home. I’ve seen it — corner offices become crash pads; power naps under fluorescent lights; anxiety meds discreetly popped between meetings. One eye on Slack, one eye on CNBC, praying the share price doesn't dip another 5% before bagels and veggie cream cheese arrive in the conference room.

And unlike past crises, UnitedHealth just can’t wait this news cycle out."""
3,3,"Hear me out, 

Companies already cheat, use auto reject filters, post ghost jobs, make applicants lives hell with 7 rounds of interviews and cause depression because of the lack of empathy for job seekers experience.

My advice is to switch off your ethics filter and fight fire with fire.

Lacking a skill? Mention you have basic understanding, worst case you'll learn before the interview

Tweak your job titles, call yourself ""senior X"" in the latest position

They need leadership skills? Mention you mentored some people ever if you didn't.

Seriously, all you can do to up your interview invite rate by a few percent is 100% worth it. This approach and handing the resume in person scored me my current job.
"
4,3,"I manage a small office of 12 people. Everyone struggles with the work load. They keep adding on time commitments to our processes. I’ve been begging for one additional trained person for years. We are far above the national average for case count for each person. We just can’t handle it. I finally got so far behind I had to turn in my notice. I’m one week into my two weeks notice and they just put the add out. I’m so fucking furious. If I had that one more person I could have made this place work. Fuck corporate. Fuck this place. Tempted to walk out the door right now and not finish my two weeks. 

Edit: My position has been filled and they have added an additional position that I had requested for years. When I asked why they were doing it now I was told it was just a coincidence. Even though head count talks usually happen in November. "
5,3,"So yesterday I get called into a conference room with my manager and my chief exec of my department. I work in IT and my company is severely understaffed in this department so they usually over work us to the bone. 

I work at one of our corporate offices with a senior tech and we had a third guy but they let him go because he never came to work, which is understandable. once I get into the conference room my exec tells me that I’m not in trouble that they just want to put me on a pip for some performance issues, I was a little stunned because I’m my company’s golden boy of IT I’m technically advanced and very personable to the point that people usually just go around looking for me when ever we they have an issue. 
So when they start reading off what I’m in trouble for it made no sense at all only one made sense and it was not even a big issue since I usually just make a sop about the issue.

The four points was : closing all off boarding tickets properly (something I’ve never once got spoken to about because… my senior tech handles all off boardings. In my 3000 tickets done I have not one off boarding ticket resolved) 
The second point was, hehehe this is so funny. onboarding and off boarding tickets which I’m like okay off boarding was in the first point this time they just added on boarding to the second point but kept off boarding too. ( I helped with on boarding so I took that half but the rush to hire people is so unorganized but me and my senior tech cleaned up that issue so I was still confused) 
Third was inventory ( which I have no say so what so ever my manager himself gave my senior full responsibility of inventory since he controlled ordering as well)
Fourth was… my tickets sometimes lack a deep resolution and I told them that’s true and I took that one on the chin because I usually don’t really document anything in the ticket unless it’s an actual technical fix, because I usually just make an sop for the problem if it’s reoccurring anyway. 

My senior tech got the same pip as I but he decided to quit. And they literally just copied and pasted our pips which made no sense but I’m so over it. I’m going to look for a job these next upcoming weeks."
6,3,"Basically been working there for almost 2 years now and how it turns out I've been overpaid all this time. Had talk with an accountant and hr yesterday. They told me that my salary is not what we initially agreed upon and they messed it up somehow BUT they sounded like it's my fault for not telling them about that issue. NOW they want to ""garnish"" my pay untill the overpayment is clear and told me that if im to quit they will seek legal action against me?!? Guys wtf"
7,3,"So my co-worker came back from visiting family in a stupid state (Missouri) and was not feeling well.. called out sick two days in a row. However the new monthly all-hands-in-the-office meeting came up (so we can chat face to face, it'll be fun, we'll have pizza!) he tried to get permission to zoom in because he thought he might have come back with covid.

Absolutely not. This was planned for weeks. Besides everyone should be vaccinated. It's not like it's a different covid all the time!

So.. three days later he's quite sick, positive covid tests in hand, and all 28 people who were in the meeting are nervous.

But, hey, who needs an IT dep't anyway -right?"
8,3,"Seriously, what's the deal? I've worked at 4 different places and every single one had managers who acted like total jerks to anyone below them on the org chart.

They'll be all buddy buddy with their peers and kiss up to higher ups, but then turn around and micromanage, dismiss ideas, or just be straight up rude to their own team members.

Is it a power thing? Insecurity? Bad training? I'm genuinely curious because it seems so widespread.

Anyone else notice this pattern or is it just my bad luck with jobs?"
9,3,"My boss says we’re a “family” every other meeting. I asked for a day off to attend a funeral and got told, “We’re short-staffed, can someone else go instead?” So much for family, huh?"
10,3,"Over the past month, my wife and I have had to take one of our dogs to the emergency vet on several occasions. The amount of medical bills racked up over that span has costed us about $8,500.

Meanwhile, my wife and I are just barely scrapping by living paycheck to paycheck. I’m making $20 an hour as an IT professional getting no benefits at all because I’m under contract, and she’s a commission hairstylist that only gets paid by the amount of services and sales she makes. Combining both of our incomes, we can almost barely afford rent and food for the month.

I’m at the point where that I might have to either look for a new job that pays better and gives me benefits or find a second job to counteract this.

I’m not looking for any advice, I just needed to rant and get this off my chest.

Thanks for listening.

EDIT: I just got a call from the emergency vet and it turns out our dog has pancreatitis, which means our medical bills overall from the last month are now at $12,500… I hate this.

Also, just for clarification because people are wondering how old my dog is, he is two years old."
11,3,"My workplace is so toxic that our client called me after a meeting to ask me if I was being thrown under the bus by my own company. Our client said they felt like my leaders were trying to place blame on me and the client knows it’s not my fault. I guess I’m so used to the toxicity that I didn’t even notice. 

If this happened to you, what would you do?"
12,3,"I was hired less than 2 months ago for a remote medical transcription role. Since then, my role has expanded massively. I now handle referrals, prior authorizations, insurance verifications, fax inboxes, patient scheduling, coordination emails, and a bunch of weekly administrative tasks…all in addition to transcription.

Well, I just found out they hired someone new just to do transcription and they’re paying that person nearly 30% more than me.

So let’s break this down:
- I am doing multiple roles across different clinics.
- I am consistently logging full-time hours (plus OT).
- I am tracking results, flagging scheduling problems, sending weekly follow-up and treatment emails, verifying Medicaid/Medicare insurance, requesting cardiac clearances and outside records …the list goes on.

Meanwhile, someone was just brought in to do only the job I was hired to do… for significantly more money.

I’m debating whether to bring it up now or wait for my 90-day review (which is about a month away), but the resentment is already creeping in. This is just another reminder of how companies quietly burn out their capable workers by stretching roles without adjusting compensation and then undervalue them when they bring it up."
13,3,"I've quit every job I have started. The only job I actually ever liked was teaching- and that too because I had full autonomy on how I taught as long as I covered the syllabus. I used to be hard core capitalist, but living in Europe for 2 years, speaking and living with socialists in Berlin for a while, I realized the capitalist system is designed to make us give up our life simply to make money for CXOs and organizations, in exchange for ""value we add"" as is decided by the top level management. In return we get money, social validation and approval based on what society believes is virtuous: working as hard as possible, doing something prestigious and respectable and making lots of money. I swear, people forgive the most vile humans just because they are financially successful. 

As the most intelligent life form on this planet, it is ridiculous that we're the only ones who demand permission and validation to live. 

Either I am delusional and lazy or part of the small % who truly see the stink and aren't afraid to call it out. And honestly, I can't play this game any longer. There's got to be a better way to do life. "
14,3,"Can’t stand the people that post on there

15,3,"Try googling ""make paid leave mandatory in US"" or ""why is paid leave not mandatory in the US like everywhere else?""

Do you get thoughtful articles by that title? Maybe, meaningful scholarly debates or peer edited papers? NOPE! jack shit

Paid leave is so downtrodden in the US you can't even find 10th page Google articles or duckduckgo pages on it. I can't even get a rando NYT author writing an opinion piece on it.

Id be willing to be a good chunk of change the reason isn't because nobody is talking aboot it...."
16,3,"It took the company five promised years. And we all are required to watch a video about hoe it works.

And it kinda already feels illegal.

Let's say, you start at 7am. You clock in at 6:50. According to the clock system, you will be paid starting at 7am. If you come at 7:08, according to the system, you will be paid starting 7:08.

Same thing when you leave (let's say, at 1pm). You clock out six minutes after your shift, because you had minor duties to do, you will be paid until 13:00. Not a second longer.

There is the option to clock in/out ""with reason"", which is reserved for when your schedule changes though."
17,3,"So I'm currently job hunting and I can say it's the worst experience in the world. My job sucked but at least after work I forgot about it and did stuff I enjoyed. Now all I do is think about getting a job, work on my CV, apply to jobs I don't even want to do, work on my CV (again) turn myself into a clown for the hiring manager's amusement, worry about getting a job....

I have a lot of free time, and all of it is taken by job hunting. It's the most miserable unpaid job in the world. I want to use my time to study things I enjoy, enjoy the summer weather while it lasts, hang out with friends, and focus on my deteriorating mental health. But nope. Got to job hunt. 
The thing is I don't think I'm in a condition to even perform well at job hunting. I don't get much sleep. I can't use enough energy to apply because I hate it so much. I can't be bubbly and happy and excited for the job at my interviews. I think it anyone looks at me it's clear in dead inside. 
I've also isolated from all my friends because I'm ashamed to tell them what's happening.

Please make it end."
18,3,"I’m sitting here, thinking about all the gaslighting I’ve endured at this job and I’m over it. This kind of work? It’s not sustainable. The constant pressure. The fake coaching. The impossible expectations. The way they make you feel like you’re failing even when you’re doing everything you can to help the customer.

And no, I don’t want to be a manager. I don’t want to be promoted into more stress, more fake positivity, and more responsibility to gaslight others ‘for the good of the team.’ I couldn’t imagine doing 20+ years of this. I’m exhausted already.
I want peace, not performance reviews. I want freedom, not metrics. And I deserve that! "
19,3,"My office just sent out RTO survey.  They have questions like ""what are you most looking forward to, when you RTO?""  And ""how can we make RTO better?""  Side question, is it possible to sprain your middle finger?"
20,3,"How many of you stay up way too late after work just to enjoy having time to yourself in the evenings? If so, how late do you stay up and what do you do?"
21,3,"I posted about it before but basically I really couldn't handle how much I hated my job (senior swe at very early stage company), to the point that I quit with nothing lined up. I'm just going to go travel and chill. Apparently it takes 6-8 months or whatever to find a job. I even thought I  wanted to go back because the job market is so bad, but I've well and truly burned my bridges here.
I thought I had ""eff you money"" so I took it and said ""eff you"". In reality I'm not rich, I wasn't born into money, everything I have I earned through working. I know I'm super privileged to be able to survive long enough that I can afford to just walk out. So now I guess I'm just putting myself first"
22,3,"It sure seems like it, because it's unbelievable how out of touch some of these people are. They constantly complain about how much they struggle financially while portraying themselves as ""working class"". I honestly wonder how they think the vast majority of people working manual labor jobs survive, whether it's in the service industry, on a farm, or in a warehouse.

Then they have the nerve to tell you to ""just get a skill,"" when in reality, 90% of all skilled jobs are severely underpaid, especially when you consider inflation and the rising cost of living.

I have to say some unpleasant things about corporate workers who make 200k, because they are privileged. A lot of them landed those jobs through connections, and many don't work nearly as hard as the people under them, which they themselves have admitted thousands of times online. Their positions pay that much because the corporate elite enrich themselves, just like CEOs making millions.

At least when you start a business, there's actual struggle involved in getting the operation running. Meanwhile, many of these corporate types look down on the workers beneath them and can’t wait for those jobs to be replaced by robots.

I honestly don’t know what the vast majority of people are supposed to do for a living if everything gets automated. We can’t all work corporate leadership jobs replying to emails all day.

I’m going to say something controversial: most of the jobs in America that are at risk of being replaced by automation are done by non-white people. What kind of future are we heading toward in this country, where we welcomed immigrants to pick our fruit and do our hard labor, and now suddenly those jobs vanish, leaving only white people in corporate roles?

It seems like that could lead to some serious racial tensions."
23,3,"I have worked at this job for two years, was railroaded on a raise and a position change for over a year while other less productive employees were favored and there was a lot, a lot, a lot of resentment from me and I spoke out many times about how I felt, and how I had to pick up the slack of others and I just got tired of it after being screamed at by one of the owners, and put in a two weeks.

My mental health has began to decline because of this and having to work out my two week notice. I'm on the last week and this is like pulling teeth. I absolutely hate every minute that I'm here.

Am I  the asshole for saying fuck you on my last day and calling out?"
24,3,"I just started a new job last Monday. I was excited and worried but my first week went okay. Few hiccups along the way but made it through. 

Well today I’ve been informed that someone in a different role is leaving and they are expecting me to absorb the job responsibilities from that position. I am so pissed off and really am trying to find the best way to navigate this. The job market is already rough and quitting terrifies me but staying and being responsible for two different jobs infuriates me. 

I feel like looking back on last week they were soft launching this b.s 💣 “you’ll find many people within the organization wear multiple hats”. Then the individual who’s leaving giving me an overly detailed description about what they do, “you’re new so it’s always good to learn about the different roles in this department.” There were other signs, I see them now. I was bam-f-ing-boozled. *cue horror movie scream*. "
25,3,"I’m not sure how many people were impacted, but my company did large layoffs today to “focus on AI.” It appears I’ve still got a job, but my manager was fired. He was a decent manager who recently left a 10 year gig to come here.

Good reminder to work a little less today, take things a little less serious, and remember that your company doesn’t care about you no matter what. Put yourself first, always, because they’ll kick you out the first second it benefits them."
26,3,"Wondering if anyone else has had this experience. In my last job, I always used to feel like I got more rest when my boss took a vacation than when I took my own vacation. 

When I took my own vacation, I had to do a bunch of prep ahead of time. I had to do extra work the week ahead of time so that the people covering for me could feel adequately prepared. Still had to answer a bunch of emails and sit in on a few meetings while I was away. And the whole time I was aware that there would be extra to do when I came back. 

When my boss took a vacation - all of the BS that they always worried about was off my plate for a week. I was able to do my job without their interference. Didn't have to answer a bunch of questions about why I was doing my job the way I was doing it - it was the only time when getting results was good enough to answer all questions. Didn't have to answer a bunch of BS emails from my boss. Skipped a few meetings that the team didn't really need to be having, and since that time was available to do work, I got done early most days. And, since there was no one there to monitor, I could come late, leave early, and as long as my work got done, no one cared. 

All to say, I always looked forward much more to my boss taking a vacation than my own PTO days (especially since I usually couldn't afford a true vacation anyway). It feels super messed up, but it's true. Did anyone else ever have that experience?"
27,3,"I already wrote in some subreddits about my work and how I ended up there: M30 from southern Europe, after studies I was constantly between unemployment, short term contracts and shitty jobs. Finally, I moved abroad for a paid internship that seems a good bridge to a career in a sector I like.

No matter what, my superior and her lacchè are constantly abusive, demeaning and never losing a chance to rain on me all their frustrations, worst duties and true mobbing practices*.

After few months, with no career perspectives, no savings as the salary is ridiculously low and a deteriorating mental health, I finally choose: I'm gonna quit.
It's not a happy ending: I'm 30, I'm broke and suffering depression, and I'm always wandering if these problems are my fault or destiny or else... But my own health is paramount, and nothing is worth depending or developing mental issues, losing serenity and happiness.
I don't know what I'll do after, but I know I'll keep fighting for finding my place and I wanna start again doing activism because as Fanon said, rebellion is the therapy of the oppressed.

Antiworkers of the world, unite!

*Today, after I worked under oppressing heat and disgusting dirt for hours, the Lacchè: 
""Have you watered the plants, Friday?""
""Yup""
""You didn't done it well enough. They're suffering (sic)""
""We're in summer, they need to be watered one day yes and one no.""
(Realising that yesterday I was in the other office since the Senior Partners were visiting and every time they ""hide"" me to avoid contact, but she was there) ""yeah, whatever. Today water them a lot""
""But they're gonna drown""
- Lacchè leaves the room furious without answering, leaving work two hours earlier after giving me some demeaning activities just to keep me busy -

28,3,"I work in the UK and have worked at this company for 3.5 years.

Today I was pulled in to a meeting and informed that due to work drying up recently they can no longer fulfil the 40 hours I’m currently contracted to.

Therefore they have ‘proposed’ that I sign a new zero hour contract and work whenever required. 

They’ve given me a week to ‘think about it’ and give my decision on Monday.  (I clearly don’t have a choice in this )

So, what are my options? What if I reject the proposal? Where do I stand with this?

 "
29,3,"So last week a group message sent to my entire team said that we should check our schedules for changes, so I did. My schedule looked the same, my hours were the same, everything looked fine.

So imagine my surprise when I log in and check my schedule yesterday, and it says MTO. And I've never seen this code before, so I have no idea what it even means. So I message one manager, they're offline. So I message another one, offline too. Finally I get a hold of someone and they tell me that it's something that the company is doing due to business needs.

So of course in a panic I look at my schedule for the next day, and breathe a sigh of relief because I am still scheduled to work that day. I checked the schedule less than 24 hours before my shift was supposed to start today and it still had me down as working my shift. 

So imagine my surprise today when I log in and check my schedule and it says MTO again. 

I have a disability, I cannot afford to lose 50% of my hours for the week. Is this even legal? I'm Canadian if that helps. But I'm literally in a tailspin right now. I was already paycheck to paycheck and now I don't even know how I'm going to afford my rent."
30,3,"For the longest time i thought ”burnouts” happen to those who are mentally weak, jokes on me my doctor told me i am clearly burnt out which makes a lot of sense.

It has recently gotten so bad that i would rather wrap my car around a light pole than go to work, ive been overworked to hell and neglected for years on end, it is starting to affect my social life to the point my friends are calling me late at nights if i was doing ok

I have become very cynical towards everything and everyone, i have sudden verbal outbursts and i verbally lash out from the slightest things, it is affecting my relationship too, 

I am mentally, physically and emotionally tired 24/7 and it truly is getting hard to live out my life

I tried to bring it up at work but my boss basically just told me to fuck off and that my summer vacay starts in a month so suck it up

What should i do"
31,3,"I am a 23 y/o working a hybrid office job (emails and contract management for digital advertising) and just hit 1.5 years. I have been paid $23/hr this whole time and my team is me, 1 other person my age, and our millennial boss. We are very close-knit and our boss is truly great and does so much for us given her position; she is just as overworked as us and we have a mutual understanding that she doesn't call the shots seeing as the company consists of 5k people. Our team is 3 people handling a ridiculous amount of work that brings in an absurd amount of revenue and the salespeople we support are ungrateful and stupid, so needless to say, we are miserable. 

My coworker and I brought up these concerns in our respective 1-on-1s and she was very receptive and passed along our feedback to upper management. A proper raise is basically impossible because of budget and having to adjust the whole department's pay accordingly--which the company should be able to do considering they are ""the best in the business"" and every quarterly sales call they boast about revenue. Anyways, we have seen a big change in reduction of workload by passing off 1 type of task to the sales team directly, but we are still barely keeping our heads above water. 

Official word is that management is now pushing for a new position that would offload about 15-25% of our work to a new person, but it needs to be formally approved and that could take 90+ days AND because we have tribal knowledge (there is no formal training), we will need to take time out of our days for no extra pay to train the new person because, of course, our boss will not always be free to do so and she is not as ingrained into that aspect of the job as my coworker and I are. Honestly, and I kind of all but outright said this to my boss, I would rather be paid more to have nothing about the process change rather than get a 4th team member and get paid the same, because either way we will be stressed out of our minds--so at LEAST I can pay my debts and expenses more comfortably. 

I understand but despise the capitalistic logic of it being easier to hire 1 more underpaid person ($47,840/yr gross, assuming they negotiate for $23/hr) rather than giving the 2 underpaid people with 1+ year of experience at JUST this company (first job out of college for both of us) $1 - $4 more per hour ($4,160 - $16,640).

On that note, our raises are ""company-wide merit increases."" Basically, when they randomly decide to drop a raise (usually mid-year), *if* you have been working for 1+ year, you will get a % increase--and the increase is the same for *every hourly employee.* One of our coworkers in another department who started 2 weeks before me makes $22/hr and she just got a 55c raise...appalling. My boss suddenly scheduled I  1:1 for tomorrow morning (right before my 4-day (PTO) weekend which I feel horrible taking because the workload is crazy right now), so using that math, I expect to get a 60c increase tomorrow--$1,248/year gross. After taxes and deductions (\~22%), that comes out to $52 more every 2 weeks. I. Am. So. Fed. Up. 

Also, not to mention--my coworker started last July so she's missing the window; going off of past experience from other employees, she will have to go out of her way once her 1-year hits in order to ASK FOR the 60c. It's even worse for other employees--for example, I started January 2024 and am getting my first raise after \~15 months. Someone who started in August 2024 probably won't get a raise until June 2026 (\~22 months) unless they explicitly ask for it, and even then it's not guaranteed, nor is this bullshit merit increase.

I could go on for forever and I want to output my feelings without this taking too much out of me, but my main reason for writing this is the title (believe it or not after all that preamble)--**how can I bump the breaks and ""work my wage"" if working less/putting in less effort makes things ultimately more stressful? I can't really just ignore things, at least not without them coming back to bite me. We are a tiny team and I especially don't want to make things harder on myself, or the other 2, especially not my coworker since we are basically in the same boat.** 

I am not worried about getting fired/laid off right now but I think that is a possibility if I start slacking. I have applied to 307 jobs and counting in the past 3 months to no avail so I don't have that to fall back on or even to use as leverage. When in office my coworker + a girl from another department and I take about 3 \~15 minute walks daily and debrief, gossip, etc. While WFH when I first started and used to be *underworked* if anything, I had windows of time where I could play video games for 2 hours straight and only have to send a few emails during that bit. Now I feel like I can't get up to grab lunch and even once I get lunch it tends to get cold because I'm so ""locked in."" We obviously don't get paid lunch so we are incentivized to eat while working and I personally prefer finishing 30 mins earlier especially while in-office. If we use PTO (whether it be a holiday or personal leave), we cannot exceed 40 hours worked. I have recently started using sick time for doctors' appts instead of making up the time, so most of my weeks have been 40hrs max, so I could maliciously comply and have an ""appointment"" every week, but I dunno. Without PTO we are not to exceed 42 hours and it is also worth mentioning that our boss asks us not to get too crazy with getting caught up in work and she has never asked us to stay late, let alone over 40/42.

  
Sidenote--my coworker and I sincerely love our boss as she supports us so much and even helps with the workload more than she is expected to, we even all hang out sometimes in small groups with other depts off the clock but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel some resentment/envy for her considering she is better off than us. She's been here for 4 years (supervisor for 2) so she put the work in to get her position (still underpaid) and I don't want to feel anything negative towards her because she is delightful through and through but this all makes me feel so cynical. I know that getting close with your boss is a no-no but this is sort of a special case since she is a great mentor, doesn't call the shots, and is only a few years older than us."
32,3,"Essentially my eyes were so dry my eyelids would scratch my eyes when blinking so my body decided to make it extremely painful to look into light. 

Well I found out that when I am stressed my body releases histamines making allergies worse. 

I was working a full time job and running my own business and was in the middle of my bussiness's busy season. After finding out it was stress related I knew I couldn't continue and needed to make a decision. I decided this was my sign to take my business full time and quit my main job. 

After chatting with an old coworker I found out two co-workers had heart attacks and a third had quite a serious panic/anxiety attack. 

I always thought my stress/allergy was because I of my business, but now I am thinking it was because of the first job because I was definitely struggling. "
33,3,"Hello Antiwork gang,

It has become increasingly frustrating seeing how many American companies outsource customer service to foreign workers so they can pay them minimal. These are American companies that could be opening up many more jobs for Americans instead of profits profits profits. Especially when you can barely understand the Representative with a thick Indian, Philippine, or Central American accent. These companies should be called out on that, and I’ll start with Bob’s furniture and T-Mobil. Shame on them "

35,3,"This is one of the most stupid things ever. When I was hired, it was written ""Go in as needed for data center support."" About 2 years ago, when asked during the department meeting if we'd have to go back, the CIO said ""Since a majority of the company don't even live in this state, it would be unfair to ask IT to come back to the office."" I thought I was in the clear to stay mostly remote. 


My job requires the occasional data center support and I've been the one doing most of it because my only other coworker for the past 3 years lives too far for small issues. That was fine with me. I leave when I want to, do the work, then head back home. 


Last month, my manager tells me that I'm expected to be in the new office 3 days per week. I explained all of the above details to him, but he ignored them. I said ""I have written documentation from the HR recruiter that the job is 'On site as needed for data center support'"" but again he ignored it. 


My coworker gave me the heads up about that and I spoke to both my psychiatrist and therapist about getting ADA accommodations letters, which they both wrote up. During the same conversation with my boss, I told him about that and he immediately stops, then tells me he has to start the process with HR. Then he asked me if 1 day per week was ok. I said that would be fine, since I already do 1 day a week for the ""on site support as needed."" 


HR emailed me after a week and offered 2 days. I told her ""Can we make it 1? I already go in once a week and the manager and I agreed to that anyway."" but no response since. 

Today he calls me about this with basically 0 new info. I asked him ""Why are we being forced back to the office?"" and I got the bullshit excuse ""For better team work and collaboration."" I asked him ""Then what was the point of rolling out apps to let people collaborate better online?"" but no actual answer. He either doesn't know or refuses to tell me.


Yesterday, I had to get an MRI for my shoulder and waiting results. If I have to get surgery, I'm thinking of asking the doctor to write a letter that I need to stay fully remote to recover."
36,3,"Our current work week is a hybrid one where we work from home two days a week and are ‘required’ to go in three days a week. Here’s the thing, our company is headquartered in a different state; we work out of a small 5 person office in a different state. Today the controller brought up this new policy where if we can’t come in on one our in office days for whatever reason, we have to make up for it by going in on a remote day. This feels so petty and unnecessary; we work in an office with 5 people. Would anyone even know if someone came in on a ‘remote day’? The office would be empty because the 4 other people would be working from home. It feels so petty and I’m so frustrated by it. I’ve even literally quit before because the pay was so bad it wasn’t worth it for me anymore as a new parent. They pulled me back in with a raise; they’ve always been good about pediatricians appointments or working from home when my child can’t attend daycare. Now I have to go in a remote day because my child was too sick to attend daycare? Did I also mention that I’m everyone’s ’go to’ person and they’ve been very vocal about it; I appreciate the recognition and them being good about the challenges that come with having a toddler. Now this new policy is just bothering me. The pay is still very low compared to the cost of living in my area; my husband makes almost quadruple what I make and it feels bad to not be able to equally support him with our utterly insane mortgage payment. It’s so weird they would be this petty when they know everyone is close to leaving. I do need a job right now…but this shit is so petty. Literally feeling down because they felt the need to impose this petty policy to our 5 person office when HQ is like 600+ employees so maybe it makes sense for them but here? Really? Thank you for listening to my rant. "
37,3,"My housemate started getting body aches and chills Friday night and tested positive for coronavirus Saturday morning. He’s spent all weekend feeling like shit and isolating in his room.

He works as a technical writer and can do about 98% of his job remotely, and works a few days of the week from the house. He’s doing better now that he’s on a steady diet of paxlovid and dayquil, but is obviously still extremely infectious. Problem is, he’s also out of sick hours.

In a normal, sane universe, a hybrid remote worker who can do their job remotely would probably be allowed to just…. work remote an additional few days?

Instead, his boss cheerfully lets him know that there are no more “restrictions” around covid anymore, so he can come right back into the office as soon as he’s feeling up to it. And no, working remotely is not an option.

The devil on my shoulder says he should report to duty at his boss’s office tomorrow maskless and see how he likes it. He’s out of sick leave… what is he honestly supposed to do otherwise?"
38,3,"My former friends bought a new car, while I ride a bicycle. They took weekend vacations, then asked, *""*Where have you been?*""*, knowing full well I hadn’t gone anywhere. Their flex wasn’t just casual boasting, it was a performance of superiority, a desperate assertion that their choices were the right ones. When I refused to react, their resentment grew. It wasn’t my indifference that disturbed them, it was the unspoken realization that I wasn’t playing the same game.  
  
I cut ties because their bitterness became unbearable. Beneath their consumerist coping and hollow achievements lurked a quiet fury, directed at me, as if my lack of participation was an indictment of their lives.  
  
I feel like there's everywhere this silent pressure to conform to the script, like if you're not suffering like them there's immediately a sense of resentment and silent pressure to break you into their ways, a silent demand to suffer like everyone else.  
This is something that manifests subtly, they are always judging everything about you, and some thing are not spoken but you can clearly feel the sentiment, something that's been pushed into the shadow.

You will often notice when you meet someone new, among the first questions is ""what do you do?"", because you have to be doing something right? 😂  We haven't seen this ""doing nothing"", it scares us, it's terrifying. We also ask because we immediately have to know of what utility you are to us. Are you a good connection, what's your monetary status? Can you provide for us? **What ""value"" can we extract from you, and personally benefit from?** This is a narcissistic mindset in corporate world. *Yes you are here now, but what's in it for me, how can I utilize you*? It's disgusting isn't it...but that's how things are, for most people driven by ambition.  
  
Someone once told me they've been to a party and they found a list of all participants, and in brackets of each one there was a ""function"". This is how most people today operate, they don't like you for being you, they only see of what utility you are to them, how ""useful"" you are to them, and if you can only ameliorate how they see themselves, even then you are ""useful"". They especially like if you're higher status, because then they can namedrop you at conversations with other random people they are trying to impress, now you've become their asset. 😂 Aren't you a lucky one?!

We live in a world where success is measured in promotions, possessions, and curated Instagram lives. Yet beneath the glossy surface of modern achievement, there’s an undercurrent of quiet desperation, a growing sense that the system we’ve built doesn’t serve us, but ensnares us.

At the heart of this disillusionment is a simple but uncomfortable truth: much of what we consider ""normal"" life, the 9 to 5 grind, the debt-fueled consumption, the relentless pursuit of status isn’t a natural order, but a carefully constructed bureaucracy designed to keep us compliant. And those who dare to step off this treadmill often face something worse than hardship: the silent, seething resentment of those still trapped inside.

If you're in any way privileged to not work, others who aren't as privileged will act as if they are Jesus Christ crucified with their 9-5 jobs, it breeds resentment towards you if you aren't ""pulling the weight"" of society as they are, and this is completely irrational but they aren't aware of these impulses where they come from. It's almost as if ""you are at fault"" for their situation, is what is being projected. But this is something unspoken. This resentment isn’t logical, it’s primal. Those trapped in the system perceive your freedom as a threat.   
  
But the funny thing about ""being lazy"" as how they see it, is the ultimate goal of capitalism, earn enough money so you don't have to work, so the billionaire on the top of the pyramid doesn't have to work a 9-5 anymore, he has achieved the ultimate goal, and yet more often then not he can't do it, if he's trapped in workaholic mindset. The workaholic subconsciously dreams of being lazy, and yet he can't do it, he becomes restless if he tries. He’s been conditioned to equate labor with worth, exhaustion with honor. Retirement terrifies him, not because he’ll go broke, but because he’ll have to face himself.  
  
If he stops working he feels lost, as if meaning has been sucked out of his life. The same thing is when people retire, and they can't stop working, they always find something to do, as if it's a distraction from facing themselves, distraction from facing the existential dread.

You can see this sentiment toward laziness everywhere in corporate word, ""laziness as a wet dream of capitalism"" from development of AI, and failed attempts to create self-driving cars and dreaming about a personal robot assistants which is also slowly coming to fruition, and yet the workaholic mindset still can't stop, it just keeps going and going and going. It leaves the impression when they won't have nothing to do they will go absolutely insane (or they already are insane but they just don't know it).

We have to address the elephant in the room: The Workaholic who can't have a rest without feeling shame and guilt, and then projecting these onto everybody who isn't a workaholic.  
Is he just like a wild animal that's been broken down, domesticated into unconditional obedience, even working for crumbs, conditioned by the pain.   
The workaholic is not a free man. He is a broken beast, conditioned to believe that pain equals virtue, that exhaustion equals worth. He has been domesticated, not by chains, but by something far more insidious: **the illusion of purpose**.  
  
As they say ""more pain, more gain"", and if you ""don't pain and no gain"" then you're less then? The workaholic has weaponized his suffering, he's proud of it, it is a raft he will never leave, because it gives him illusory sense of meaning, when it's nothing but. It gives him a momentary relief of the ""illusion of becoming"", but it's all for naught in the end. He's just trapped in his programming and he doesn't realize it, he can't see beyond production, because without it, he feels worthless. His identity is built on productivity, so rest feels like death.

The workaholic doesn’t just endure his suffering, he brandishes it like a badge of honor. He flexes his suffering on non-workaholics: *""I haven’t taken a vacation in five years."",* ""*I work 80-hour weeks.*""*,""I haven’t slept properly in months.""*  
  
Modern society runs on paperwork, permissions, and perpetual obligations. Want to build a home? Prepare for zoning laws, permits, and inspections. Want to work for yourself? Navigate tax codes, licensing, and healthcare tied to employment. Even basic survival: food, shelter, mobility is gatekept by layers of institutional red tape.

This isn’t inefficiency it’s control. The more hoops we jump through, the harder it becomes to imagine alternatives. We’ve created a system where opting out feels impossible, not because it is, but because we’ve been conditioned to believe it is.

For those who play by the rules, the rewards often feel hollow. The ""successful"" executive with the luxury car, the suburban parent with the Pinterest-perfect home, many aren’t thriving, but coping. They trade their hours for paychecks, their paychecks for distractions, and their distractions for fleeting relief from the gnawing question: *Is this all there is?*

Consumerism thrives on this cycle. Ads don’t sell products; they sell identities. A new phone isn’t just a tool, it’s a badge of relevance. A vacation isn’t just a break, it’s proof you’ve earned your exhaustion. But like any addiction, the high wears off, leaving only the need for the next fix.

Those who reject this script, whether by circumstance or choice, often face more than confusion. They provoke resentment. This resentment isn’t just envy, it’s cognitive dissonance. The non-conformist is a living reminder that the script isn’t mandatory. And that’s terrifying to those who’ve invested everything in following it.

Escaping the trap doesn’t require revolution, just recalibration. It starts with asking: What do I actually need? What am I willing to trade for freedom? Whose approval am I really chasing?

For some, the answer is minimalism, owning less to owe less. For others, it’s geographic arbitrage, earning in strong currencies while living where costs are low. For a growing few, it’s outright rejection of the hustle culture, choosing time over trophies.

The most radical act in a society built on consumption and compliance isn’t rebellion, it’s contentment. To look at the world’s endless chase and say, *""No, thanks,""* is to undermine the entire game.

Those who do so often find something unexpected: the people who pitied or resented them eventually start asking, *""How did you get out?""*

The answer is simple, but not easy: You just stop playing.  
  
The system isn’t broken. It’s working exactly as designed, to keep us busy, dependent, and distracted. But every day, more people are waking up to the fact that the doors aren’t locked. They’re just heavy.

And once you push them open, you realize: the world outside is wider than you were led to believe."
39,3,"When our team started getting overwhelmed, management decided to bring someone new in. I’ve been here a few years, so they asked me to train him. Said I “knew the job inside and out.”
So I walked him through everything how to handle the software quirks, which clients need hand-holding, where all the unwritten rules are. I basically handed him a cheat code for the job.
A few days in, we were chatting during lunch and he casually said, “I was honestly surprised the pay was this good for an entry-level gig.”
I paused. Asked what he meant.
He told me his hourly rate. It was almost three bucks more than mine.
I didn’t say much after that. Just smiled, nodded, and finished my lunch.
But yeah. I guess loyalty just means doing more work for less money while someone else gets a better deal out of the gate."
40,3,"Hi, quick question for the community: anyone know how to go about finding employee-owned or cooperative companies in a relatively reliable way?

After taking a year to lie flat and learn to allocate my ""give a fucks"" in a more efficient way, my partners impending health decline forces me back into *sweeps arms* ...this situation. I would really rather stop working for corporations who's owners, the shareholders everyone's always thinking of, don't lift a finger. I can't possibly paste a smile on my face and plow through working for a publicly traded company again.

Thank you in advance!

EDIT: I am in the US, but am only able to work remotely. Would be very interested in European companies willing to hire a US contractor who will work *any* time zone."
41,3,"My boss really lucked into a small business that was successful enough for him to make a multi-million dollar nest egg for himself and his family. At its height we had 11 people (including the owner) working here, and since 2020 our industry has reduced a lot in size and scope. Rather than make shifts to follow demand, he just kept downsizing and downsizing until Feb of this year when there were 4 people left (again, including him). That entire time only 1 person was fired, and a couple others quit. Everyone else was laid off and received unemployment.

Then in February he tells the 3 of us that he's going to close the company and sell the building. The only other office worker immediately finds another job and leaves, while myself and the other warehouse worker are still here. We ask for updates. Suddenly he decides he doesn't want to sell the building, he wants to rent it. He tells us to prepare to be closed/out of a job at the end of June. Then he tells us he's going to keep the company running and just do drop-shipping for our suppliers once we no longer have inventory and he lays us off.

Here's my predicament. Suddenly I'm losing my apartment too when my lease is up at the end of July. I decide I'm going to move to a different state, and I'll have the month of July to prepare once I'm laid off. Well, my boss is dragging his feet actually getting this place shut down. He asks if I can work up until I move at the end of July (and I doubt he's actually gonna pull the plug once that happens either). I know the one rule is ""if you leave voluntarily you don't qualify for unemployment"" so I tell him that while I'm unavailable for the week after the 4th because I'm out of town apartment hunting, I can work for two more weeks after that if he needs me to.

So now instead of getting laid off in June, while I happened to be moving one month later, I *may* be losing my job sometime between July 3rd and July 25th and moving days later. Qualifying for unemployment is going to make a huge difference for my plans post move. If he claims I left voluntarily because I was moving am I just fucked? Does it matter at all that even if I stayed right where I am in IL, the job in question has been dangling a ""you're getting laid off"" in front of me and only didn't do it because it was convenient to the owner?"
42,3,"I did a try out for a job last week and ended up not staying. While I was there a situation came up that really gave me weird vibes and I’m just interested in hearing from other people about it because this type of situation always seems to come up in jobs. 

When we were leaving work on my second day, the manager came over to my car to tell me I had parked in a spot where employees are not supposed to park. 

I said, “I’m sorry, I didn’t know, I won’t park there again.” 

So the manager reiterated, “Ok, but we’re not supposed to park there.” 

And I repeated, “Ok, I didn’t know, I won’t park there again.”

And she reiterated again that we aren’t supposed to park there and gave me some reasons why, and I again repeated that I won’t park there in future. And she repeated herself again, “Yes, but you know, we are not supposed to park there.” And I repeated myself. 

This continued for ten minutes with her just repeating back to me over and over that “Ok, but, we are not allowed to park there” (literally the same exact sentence over and over) and me telling her I won’t park there in future and that I didn’t know we couldn’t park there. 

My question is, what was she looking for? Is there any way I could have ended this sooner? Was I supposed to grovel in some specific way or something? 

Stuff like this happens at every job. What do these people want? 

I definitely dodged a bullet not staying at this place. "
43,3,"Truly a clock-in system of nightmares. Start your shift at 7:01? System rounds it to 7:15. End your shift at 11:59? Rounded to 11:45. The system won't let you clock in until 14 minutes before your scheduled shift. I thought it was weird that it was 14 minutes but didn't think anything of it until I went to look at my pay stubs after noticing all of the deposits were in perfect unchanging increments. Had to search for the breakdown of my payments and I found this rounding down system. Told all of my coworkers about it, nobody had any idea. Most of the people working with me were also 18-24, great use of naivety, isn't it? "
44,3,"I am 23 years old and have been working a full-time office job for over 1.5 years. I assist salespeople with marketing campaigns in all sorts of ways. My coworkers that I sit with in-office and work with, including my supervisor, are great, but the people that we work *for*, i.e., upper management, sellers and their clients, are unbearable. It is common for us to have to do more work because of a client/seller error or oversight, and we of course are not paid more for more work--naturally, we are overworked and underpaid and raises are embarrassing if we even get them to begin with. I know that this is unfortunately the standard for this sort of job, especially in America, and neither me, my coworkers, or are company are special, but it doesn't make it suck any less.

On the flipside, coworkers and I blow off steam together by ranting and joking around during work, so we have a good support system and can always lean on our boss for help if need be; since she is lenient, our little Gen Z squad can go on 2-3 \~15 min walks around the building each day together without being scrutinized for leaving our desks, so I do see the silver lining--but this doesn't change that we are undervalued to an immeasurable degree and people outside of our team walk all over us, making our jobs unnecessarily harder. Before you ask, I have been looking for other jobs--300+ apps in the past 3 months and nothing notable has come out of it. :')

On especially rough days, I cannot *not* be mad. I try to compartmentalize as best as I can but I also want to feel my feelings and not ignore them because that isn't healthy--but I don't want to let them take up too much headspace because work is just work. I drive home angry (and traffic doesn't help either) because I know I will have to go back in the next day and clean up someone's mess for no good reason. I often rant to my roommate when I get home from work about tough days and sometimes this goes on for an hour (with other stuff and some back-and-forth sprinkled in, but an hour debrief nonetheless).

To put it simply, how the hell can I let go and reduce the time and energy this takes from me off the clock?"
45,3,"sorry in advance if this isn't the right place to post. i'm looking for some advice. i was recently working for a tax office but have since been let go as the season is over. i was invited back to join next season and am looking for a job to tide me over till next december. 

i applied to a job and interviewed with them mid april. we will call this place simply Location. before my interview i looked up their reviews on indeed and glassdoor. most were negative. there was a few positive, but those were older ones. the most recent reviews in the past 1-3 years were negative. for example, they said things like:

* not a company i would work for. no support in training, managers don't know what they're doing. 
* minimum wage, no benefits, no raises. (i later confirmed this at my interview)
* if you want to waste your time, go to this company. the pay is way too little (this got 4 upvotes)
* need improvement. great hours but poor management, leadership is greedy and careless.
* tyrannical owner. said they are emotionally abusive, and that they are the hardest people to work with. 

along with those there was about 3-5 good ones. but... it's hard for them to not stand out. i went into the interview, and i thought it went well. they confirmed no benefits. they would want me to work overtime. they require me to go to the locations i'd be renting out (Location is a vacation rental receptionist job) so transportation would be on me. i might get bonuses if someone leaves a review and mentions me by name. i asked about training, and they didn't have an answer. it was pretty much a 'throw you in and see how you do' situation. 

i went home after the interview feeling decent, despite the bad reviews. then i heard nothing, for two months. they contacted me the other day, they're hiring again already, and they want me to come in for a second interview. this concerns me because it's a small company, it's off season, and they're rehiring again already? it screams high turnover rate to me, idk. 

on top of that, my day would look like: get up at 6 am. get ready and be at the bus by 7:30. get to work by 9, since it's an hour and a half commute. get off at 5:30 pm. get home by 7 pm. that's so long as there's no issues with the bus, no delays or anything like that.... and if i don't work overtime, which i think is more likely than not based off of one review i read saying overtime is required there. 

along with it all.... i'm in a bad space right now mentally. my dad has a cancer scare. we're each other's only family member. i just got done being his caretaker for 3 years following a car accident that disabled him. we're waiting to hear back if it is cancer. his doctor is really worried because he has had multiple tests come back that make it look like colon cancer is a real possibility... i feel like doctors wouldn't use the c word unless they actually think it's possible. 

all these red flags for the job on top of my dad's health issues, which in worse case scenario i'd have to be his caretaker for again, makes me think that taking this job isn't a good idea. i'm also on unemployment right now so i'm worried if they do offer me a job, i have to take it. if i do and it sucks (13 hour day just isn't sustainable for me) then i'm screwed out of the rest of my unemployment. 

tried to talk to my dad about it, and he thinks i should just go and do it... but i don't think he's seeing the whole picture. spoke with some friends and they agreed with me. i need an unbaised opinion now. "
46,3,"
Many stupid people will not read his thread and wrongly assume I am referring to itemized deductions of the self employed or the standard deduction credit. 

No, I mean your living expenses are deducted. 

You are the company. Your labor is your product. Your being is the machine that produces the product. 

In order to bring your product of labor to market you must pay expenses to keep your body machine running and in optimal condition. 

Your body machine is an asset of your company. An asset that has expenses associated with its upkeep. 

Anything associated with the upkeep of your person which has an impact on your labor quality and quantity must be considered a deductible business expense. 

- Your food expenses. 

- Your body care expenses. 

- Insurance expenses. 

- Your shelter and household expenses. 

- Medical expenses. 

- Health supplements and physical fitness expenses. 

- Your clothing expenses. 

- Your transportation expenses. 

- Your communications expenses. 

- Expenses related to personal growth, educational, and development. 

- Expenses related to mental health, relaxation, personal entertainment, and time off work. 

- Expenses related to investing in the future of your company and your retirement plan (all expenses related to raising your children). 

This is no different than how a corporation is treated when it gets to deduct all expenses related to producing a product output and is only taxed on its net profit. 

Employees are unfairly taxed on their gross profit. 

“But then there won’t be anything left after expenses to tax!”, you whine.

Precisely. 

The only people who really deserve the be taxed are those who earn more than they can reasonably spend on themselves. Many people have more than they know what to do with. Those who just horde it without purpose. 

The government then has incentive to make sure companies are paying employees good wages if it wants to be able to collect any taxes off them. 

And if the government finds this situation still to be intolerable then the solution is simple: change the tax laws so that corporations don’t get special treatment to blow all their money on expenses in order to avoid taxable net profit. 

But until then, you are required to treat individual people the same as you would treat a corporate person with regards to taxes."

If they refuse to help us transfer to a new company, or refuse to provide references, it severely hurts our ability to go get another job immediately. Labor laws here in China are actually quite good, but they are often not followed by companies and to fight them on it is a long and difficult process, especially for foreigners. 

My HR called me into the office and suddenly told me they dont want me to stay after summer, and asked me to sign all these forms agreeing not to sue them etc. (which i definitely didnt have to sign) They were saying they will help me transfer to a new school as long as i complete my duties until July 11th and complete the handover and give back company property etc. 

They didn't expect me to say that im actually happy to leave, because i feel very unsupported in this school, and i wont be transferring directly to a new school. I will take a year off, as im about to get married to a Chinese local I can get a spouse visa, and study/relax for a year and look for a new school post in a better school in the next year.

I could see that they didnt expect this as they expected to have more power over me until I finish here. The only power they still have is that i do want to get some references, but im going to write them myself and get them signed and stamped by the school, in return for me finishing my work and handover. Im so excited to take a break from working. I have so many stories of unprofessionality going on at this school, and the HR manager is one of the most manipulative and disgusting people i have ever met.

Anyway, about 3 weeks to go until my paid month of summer severance, and then no more salary but i have enough savings to support myself for a long while. Going to get my masters in education and teaching license sorted out, as well as take some well earned holidays and a break."
53,3,"**As the title suggests, I’ve been sticking to the bare minimum at work lately.**  
This is largely due to having a toxic manager who consistently fails to follow through on her promises. I was told I’d receive a raise, but it never happened—instead, I was given more responsibilities.

Despite this, I’ve still been taking on extra projects outside my core duties. However, when I complete a project and don’t immediately ask what else I should do, she gets upset.

My plan is to wait for her to give me ""extra projects"" 

Should I keep doing what I’m doing, or change my approach?"
54,3,So far it’s been two for me because I have beyond shoulder length hair. I even went to great lengths to ensure my hair looked cleaned well combed and kept out of my face. I offered to tie it back or put it up in a hat at both places and they both said I’d have to cut it. Any recommendations on how to explain that I can’t cut my hair for uuuh religious reasons.
55,3,"I feel like most of my colleagues, friends and society as a whole is living in some kind of ""Political Stockholm Syndrom"" and it's driving me nuts. Everywhere I go, everywhere I look - complacency. The common adage ""we are living in good times, have a good life, what do you want, why are you so negative?""

I like to imagine that no ordinary farmer in the European Feudal Age would have spoken like this privately, amongst friends. At least they knew they were getting screwed by the barons, counts and dukes, were sticking together. And, as some research shows, pre-industrial workers even had a shorter workweek than today's modern corporate slavery. Yeah sure they were working ""from sunset until dawn"", but with several massive breaks in between. And we are talking about peak harvesting season, people had tons of holidays in between. As has been discussed here several times, peasant families only worked about 150-180 days a year for their lord. 

To avoid misunderstandings and misdirection: I do not want to discuss the working conditions and accuracy of these reports (again) as it is if course much more complex than comparing simple hours. What baffles me is the way that so, so many people \*still\* seem to joyfully accept todays' working conditions and working hours. Even though it is extremely clear for anyone with two functioning brain cells that our high efficiency of industry and services would easily allow for, say, a 20 hour work week for everyone. It would just mean less income/wealth inequality.

Hence, my denomination ""Political Stockholm Syndrom"". It seems to me as if it's the same psychological principle in play. Your brain protects you from constantly facing the extreme unfairness of todays' work life, subconsciously brings us to embrace the oppressive economic culture, where the very vast majority spends their whole working life to enrich so very few. I honestly don't see a lot that we can do at this point except continuing to numb ourselves with the drug of cheap entertainment - more or less exactly as Aldous Huxley has depicted."
56,3,"I hate the way my manager makes me feel. The company is undergoing a rough spot. I see other managers listening to the concerns of their subordinates and acknowledge them and make them feel like they’re being heard. Mine doesn’t acknowledge anything, says that they haven’t had any issues and then tell me that I’m so angry at all times.

I tell them about the ongoing concerns I have with my work and their solution is always a form of I’ll just do it for you to help out. Then doesn’t help out or only complete half of it. Then tell me it’s my fault for dropping the ball. Any concern I bring up is just made into me being a sensitive angry woman. My coworker brought up a concern regarding their work and got a similar response, “idk how they are but I can tell you I get along with them. No issues with me” Any issue that comes up is always a “now is not the time”. But god forbid an email pops up and I don’t immediately read and acknowledge it on their time 😭 

They keep talking over me and finishing my sentences. They don’t respond to when I keep talking, they don’t respond when I stop talking. And even when mentioning it, they tell me that I’m so angry and that they don’t do any of what we’re bringing up. 


Yay. Anyone know how to handle a person like this?

57,3,"Hi. I don't know what to do. 

So after getting fired from my last job for coming in for an in person meeting my accommodations wouldn't let me miss even though im disabled, I had to park half a mile away and walk in 20s weather, threw up downstairs (here's my first mistake I sent a message to the group telling them I would be a moment because with no parking I was forced to walk a half mile and I was throwing up currently), then came in to the meeting and did my best though I was quieter and silently crying from pain. Long story short without speaking to me at all they decided I was horribly disrespectful (this is the first time these higher ups had met me in person) and that I not only needed to be fired immediately with no further questions but that I was also banned with working for that part of the company entirely. I have been beyond devastated as I loved that job and have spent 4 months trying to find something new. 

Well I did. I'm a manager at a swim school. Only problem? Being in the water constantly and around all those children has been brutal. They said there's no way even though alot of my work is out of the water that they can accommodate less/no water time and  that everyone must teach sometimes(not true 2 other managers don't go in and that really upsets me honestly i get like vomiting/ diarrhea sick, one of the girls is allergic to chlorine what is that different!). I'm also just generally not feeling super confident after a month at teaching and it still really scares me especially the youngest classes.

I got a job offer 2 weeks ago to do basically exactly my old job remotely for a 6 month contract for $2.50 more than I make now. I put in my two weeks(said it was for health reasons which it also is) and then last week suddenly they said they were having difficulties with equipment and training resources and they needed to push my start date back. They haven't said yet when I will start or IF I will end up starting they will tell me sometime this week I believe. 

This is the dilemma. I need to choose today whether to beg my job I have that is so hard on me to let me stay or leave and hope they have me start soon and the rug isn't pulled out from under me? I have also had 2 interviews this week 1 said by the end they are definitely moving me to the next stage of interviews but it's scheduled for the week after this one which again is my last week. So I won't know about that one in time. The other one I have only done the preliminary yesterday so I also have no idea. If I beg to keep my job currently I'm kinda committing to at least 10 weeks due to how our schedules work. I have fully signed all the contracts and everything for the 6 month role. I really want that job but I'm so scared I'm going to commit to it and then lose it. My boss needs an answer by end of today. What do I do?? I had basically only one other legit bite on a job other than my current one these past 4 months and even then after 2 rounds of interview they went with someone else. I genuinely have always felt really unemployable so I'm really scared I won't get another job. I hate the job market. "
58,3,"Been with a federal contractor doing business development for a year and last Friday I asked the CEO if my retired, but experienced dad could come help train us how to win more business, since we haven’t won anything in a year.  Today I got the call about getting laid off.  Coincidence, or did I shoot myself in the foot?"
59,3,"My job (multi country company) started implementing time sheets with the reassurance there’s no imminent danger they just *want to see* where resources are being allocated. My antennae went up but everyone else seems to buy in that everything’s fine.

Now transfer positions are no longer being back filled. The head count is being transferred to the new department/position and nobody is filling the old position. 

A friend who works in HR at a similar industry multi country company is saying they are seeing the same buckling down with hiring and tightening personnel expenditures. They are actually planning for lay offs soon and consolidation but they are not allowed to tell the staff until they basically pull them in to let them know they are being let go. 

It’s alarming how much goes on at a higher level that the employees don’t know about until they are being let go. 

Anyone else sniffing out similar vibes at their company? "
60,3,"I work in the medical field in the State of Oregon. My position is answering phones for multiple specialty departments, scheduling, registering new patients, insurance verification, coding appointments, liaison between patient and provider. They now want us to rotate on front desk, train front desk to do our job and vice versa. I asked for 3-6 months to figure out a non-healing fracture in my foot that my CRPS seems to be effecting the healing time on. They said no due to the effect this would have on communications, cross training, etc we are  required to be there 5 days/wk, even days where we are just assigned to phones. They would try to provide accommodations in office only.

Thing is I can barely walk, I cannot use mobility aids due to shoulder issues unfortunately too. Since I broke my foot I’ve honestly just been trying to stay afloat in my personal life too. I work in a big department, walking is going to be a lot each way, they want us covering multiple depts front desks and phones. They denied all others on my team that work remote who have serious disabilities as well, all medical information necessary provided my doctors. We have a union but have found them unhelpful, contacting them again Monday.

I have a feeling once they see me waddle in painstakingly slow they’re gonna question their decision. They treated my supervisor all caps HORRIBLE, fired her since our team would just be front desk now and under the authority of the front desk manager, no longer a separate team for phones. She tried to get another job at the same medical institution, was offered the job and then for some reason HR took it away citing an error in the posting, and as of last week cut her severance package they offered 2 months ago when we all got notice of this. Sweetest manager and person EVER, that would lead like a real leader with us, help answer phones and do work in the trenches with us.

So I feel like for some reason unbeknownst to us the gloves are off with my team and upper leadership. They let us know 60 days ago about the restructure per union contract. But since being denied the accommodation, with no chance of even remote work, I have woken up all weekend in shock and deep sense of dread of, how will I do this when I can hardly walk?

Do you have any tips on how to handle this? Do I potentially have a legal case? Should I try to go on FMLA? I can’t just quit at this time as I don’t have the finances, and I frankly love my job and helping the patients we do. I fear getting a job that pays me 15-20% less than the one I have now which is not financially feasible for me. 

This post will be limited in time before I delete. I was told posting on Reddit could definitely have negative consequences and I’ve shared a lot of details here. Probably leaving up an hour or two. Thank you for all for any words of encouragement and any help you can offer. "
61,3,"# Things to fit in:

**Health: \~4 hours end-to-end**

Reasonable and non-negotiable.

Weights 2x per week, cardio 2x per week and mobility 1x per week seems like the recommended minimum. Any beginner program actually recommends 3x per week of weights and at least 3x per week of cardio.

Gym (1h 15m session but 3 hours end-to-end including commute, dinner and shower):

* Putting on clothes before gym
* 7–10 minutes commute each way
* 1:15 in the gym for warmup, stretching, upper-lower split
* 15 min to prepare food
* 30 min eating + downtime/rest
* Optional additional downtime
* 20–30 min to shower, dry sufficiently, get dressed

Other health stuff:

* 30 min walk or so
* A few minutes meditation

**Personal development:**

* E.g. piano practice
* E.g. studying for a career

**Recreation:**

* Leisure/recreation hobbies, social activities, etc.

**Work**

**Misc (maintenance, decompression, downtime):**

* Maintenance includes things like chores, house fixes, renewing car insurance, etc.
* Decompression = doing literally nothing to recover after work. This doesn't count as leisure time because it's not a state of mind where you're enjoying things. It's also not a state of mind where you're capable of doing anything else effectively.
* Downtime = wasted time in-between activities. E.g. needing to leave in 15 minutes so there's no time to meaningfully get anything done.

**Kids?**

* Kids are a major lifestyle shift.
* Realistically require at least 4+ hours daily in the evenings.
* For a viable routine, it requires a stay-at-home partner or significantly reduced work hours.
* Ideally, the stay-at-home partner also handles most maintenance tasks during the day, allowing both partners to focus on childcare and other important parts of the routine in the evening.

# Weekends:

* There often isn't enough time during work days.
* Weekends are used to catch up on what couldn’t fit in during the week.
* But it's still not enough.
* Important things still fall behind and burnout accumulates.

# Full-time job routine:

Notes:

* My personal experience is that this is extremely demanding, burnout-inducing, and depressing.
* Impossible to have sufficient focus on health and personal development.
* Maybe it works if you only care about recreation after work.
* Free time on weekends is nowhere near enough.

Rough schedule:

* Work: 9–6 (including commute and unpaid lunch)
* Misc: As needed
   * From 6–7 I often need to decompress — doomscrolling or just feeling down.
   * Other times there is maintenance like chores, house fixes or other tasks.
* Evening (fit in what you can):
   * Health
   * Personal development
   * Recreation
* 7–9: Either personal development (if I feel up to it) or chilling.
* 9–12: Gym, preparing and eating dinner, showering and preparing for bed.

Basically no recreation time if I do some personal development. And that's if I don't have a depressive episode and waste that whole time.

# 4-hour job:

Notes:

* This seems like it would be okay.
* Allows \~5 hours free to allocate to recreation and personal development.
* Might be enough to stave off burnout and enjoy life.

Routine:

* Work: 4 hours
* Health: 4 hours (including gym, commute from gym, preparing and eating dinner, showering and drying. Also including daily walking for a bit.)
* Misc: As needed
* Then choose between:
   * Recreation
   * Personal development

This feels much more appropriate.

An 8-hour workday just doesn't leave room for a healthy, balanced life.

Retirement isn’t a real solution — you might not live that long, your health might fail before then, and the welfare system isn’t built to support everyone indefinitely.

It makes more sense to reform work now so people can enjoy life while they're living it, instead of gambling everything on a retirement they might never reach.

Edit: Clarified on the time gym takes."

64,3,"My job started a bonus program last year. 
This year in March I was out for 6 weeks on paternity leave for my son. 
Apparently one of the new criteria this year is hours worked like on the premises I guess and they deducted 50% of my max bonus off the top because I missed the minimum work hrs by 100 basically 2.5 weeks. 
Basically punishing me and the other employee who also had paternity this past year. 
Beings that it’s a performance bonus I don’t know if I can file a complaint or if they are within there legal wheel house.

65,3,"He said my scoffing at him because he told me to do something was a bad attitude. And then he went on to ask what do I do here, and kinda making threats towards me (ex. Me being on my phone (which btw, I barely even get a signal in our building) even though everybody else is as well). 

So why did I scoff at him? Because I was already in the middle of doing something that required my immediate attention (my main job which has a deadline that we have to meet by), and the thing he asked me to do was so small and trivial, but he made it sound like I had to drop my main task at that exact moment to handle this (I also never said that I wouldn’t do it, either. I was just busy in my main task, and I wanted to get it done). Never mind the fact that there were so many other people sitting around who weren’t doing anything, and I actually even helped do more than what was originally asked of me (which happens all the time). I’m just tired of the double-standard that’s set on me, while others get to sit around on their phones and nobody rails against them for their “bad attitude”."

67,3,"I got lucky and landed a part time job at a small business paying minimum.

First week in and I'm regretting everything that has led me to this moment.

My boss is a horrible micro manager, first say I met her she tells me I smell of BO, ok... Next day I come in freshly showered and lift my arm up and she jerks back and says I smell of sweat.

I immediately go home to ask everyone and they all say I smell good.

Then first day of work she tells me that I need to be a better multitasker, and that I need to be faster and that all I have been doing is sitting on my ass not doing anything. (I had finished everything that was asked of me and was on the final form fill ups).

Then when I try to explain to her that this is the stuff I've been doing, she snaps and tells me off for 'arguing' with her. Then she goes in the other room and I don't hear when she calls me so she stomps over, smacks the items in her hand on the table really close to my hand and starts yelling about how she likes to be heard when she's speaking.

I went home crying that day icl, a bit embarrassing but I could not contain myself.

I just need some advice on how to be a robot that always says yes, without letting what she says to me affect my self esteem, this week has made me shrink into myself if I hear even the slightest of disappointment from people.

I'm scared I'll be fired before I've even signed the contract, they have yet to make me a contract so I'm just scared they won't pay me for the hours worked.

So, how do I stop letting her affect me?


Edit: adding a bit more info.

I was told that the contract would be drafted up next week.

I need the job since I need to support my family which is why quitting is not an option for me.

it's a permanent contract from what they've told me, the lady is apparently selling her business in the next 6 months since she's reaching her retirement age but I'm not sure how reliable that information is."
68,3,My boss literally just told me that taking a consecutive week off is weird and he's been told to try and stop people from doing so. I get 3 weeks paid vacation 2 sick days and 3 personal days. You better believe I'm taking every single over if those lol.

I can't enjoy my hobbies anymore, I never spend time with my family anymore, I never go out anymore. I wanna quit but I need money to survive. I don't know what to do.

73,3,"I’m 36y , 15y in sales tech, 10Y in channel sales and 6 in actual company. I live in Spain and work for a global company HQ’d US.
Loved working for this company for 5 years, last December reorganization: they moved me from a team where I was team lead and had chances to evolve + great chances to achieve target + great team and great accounts, to a crappy team, no chances to evolve, no team lead position, 250 accounts (others in my team have 10 each) and they used my language skills and seniority to explain the choice of work load. 
I’ve asked mu direct manager, my director and our VP last weeks what were me options to evolve. No one could tell me much. 
I’ve hit rock bottom, hate my job, want to cry every day looking at this massive step back I took with this job, applied for 30 jobs when I have a minute free (not much cause overworked) and I’m ready to quit. 
Thing is, I’m told by friends colleagues and partner that I’m nuts, after almost 6 years I should go to Hr explain the whole situation and tell them rather than using the system and going off sick for undetery amount of time I would rather propose a settlement. 
Now here are my thoughts 
-settlements means I leave with some money, happy with it and it allows me to focus on finding another job making me happier . But , when applying , saying you are jobless is not an asset to negotiate on new job/salary 
-if I stay and wait, I’m worried I’ll end up in a burnout or worse, I’ll not be able to perform and they will find a way themselves in a few months to get rid of me without any settlement. 

I’m looking for advise
Should I wait and quit when a new job pops up? 
Should I just go off sick and take time to breath ? 
Should I go to HR and tell them I want a settlement , leave on good terms and take time to get back to work later ?

But then i was asked to train them specifically on everything i do. not team tasks, my tasks. every detail. my workflows, my process, everything I’ve built up over time. i asked if this was just cross-training and got a vague answer like “it’s just good to have backup in case anyone’s out.” no real explanation. It just feels off.

Now i’m stuck. i don’t want to sound paranoid, but it’s hard not to feel like i’m being quietly replaced. what’s worse is i’m not in a position to push back my partner was recently laid off and we’re scraping by. i need this job, but now i’m showing someone else how to do it? trying not to spiral but I feel like the writing's on the wall.

He also mentioned that sometimes when you counter, they can renege on the entire offer altogether because the state I’m in does not require a severance package. 

I don’t really have the money for an employment lawyer, so before I go down that road, does anyone have any advice if I actually have a shot or not? 

Additional information: my team was told on multiple occasions that nobody from our team was getting laid off and our team was safe. "
79,3,"For a little context: 
So my brother has been a heavy equipment repo agent for several years. He was quiet fired & screwed over with wage theft. He's pursuing legal action with the former employer. As a result, he doesn't really know what his experience, time & skills are worth. 
Cut to present tense: he has a business opportunity with a person who wants to start a tow company. He's acting as the brains & she is the bank. He's the first employee & for his consulting, she's offering a stake in the company. Which is great! But since he's also going to be putting all of his time & energy into making this thing work, I think he should be getting paid a consulting fee, as well as a percentage of every tow (as partial owner). I don't think it's too much to say he should be getting a salary as well, since he'll be managing the entire workforce of this company. This is a breakdown of when I think he should be getting paid: consulting=any time they need advice on who/what/when/how/why things should be run. Salary=since he'll be managing all workers & basically on-call 24/7 for their needs. Commission=each tow he gets a percentage (just like most tow or repo companies he's worked with before) can anyone help me out here? 

So my question is to ask the almighty professional antiworkers of reddit- if you were in this position, how would you negotiate your pay/contract? I've seen some really great insights into consulting fees on here before & I know my brother is worth so much more than what he's willing to settle for. 

TLDR: my brother underestimates his worth in the tow business & has been screwed royally before because of it. How much should he be paid for consulting, managing & working for a new tow company? "

Well obviously that didn’t last long and he started taking me off the schedule here too. Im black(Hispanic) and he’s Hispanic if that matters. I was the only black person there at that point because the other two quit weeks before me. I quit back in November. I got a new job in February away from this toxic company. But I signed back up for a new location farther away from these because they do pay decent for starting pay and I have all the experience needed. You would think I would get even an interview but no.

82,3,"Edit 2: I just checked, and I am now allowed in MyInsite again, after previously being locked out.  I checked on the HR case I submitted last night, and there is no record of it listed.  I submitted it again just now, and there is still no record of it, and the link to the case number leads me to an “invalid page.”  Macy’s, what the fuck is going on.

Edit/Side Note/Update:  I was just informed by my people leader that I should be allowed 48 hours to file a claim with HR via MyInsite.  I left the incident at approximately 7:30PM on 6/13, and I filed a claim yesterday, 6/14, at approximately 11:55PM.  This morning when I tried logging into MyInsite, they had already removed my login access, despite still being within 48 hours, at that time.  This also seems very suspicious to me. 

———-

I posted this on the Macy’s subreddit and have been getting harassed or gaslit by AP, so I’m posting it here too, lol.  If anyone has worked for Macy’s before I’d appreciate any tales of similar experiences or insight on the situation.

I was hired at Macy’s in the beauty department a little over a month ago, and things were going very well - I was getting good feedback.  However, yesterday, half an hour after I clocked in, I was asked to come up to the office, and not given an explanation why.  I didn’t think it was going to be anything serious - I had called out sick a few days last week, and assumed it was related to that.  However, when I got upstairs, I was introduced to an asset protection guy, and he ushered me into his office with one of the HR people sitting in the room.  At this point I assumed I was about to be accused of theft or something, but I was not told what was going on by these people even when I asked.  This is where it started to get weird.  I was placed in front of a computer and another asset protection guy came on video chat.  He introduced himself, and one of the first questions he asked me is what my interests outside of work are.  I didn’t answer that question and asked what was going on.  He still did not tell me what I was there for.  He then proceeded to ask me very vague and somewhat leading questions like “would you say you have an interest in cosmetics?”  “Can you explain to me what asset protection is and why it’s important?”  “What is your role as an employee to assist with asset protection?” “What was your date of hire?” and things like that.  I remained polite but confused, and answered as best I could.  He then asked “have you given anyone your employee login credentials?” I said no, and he asked “do you think someone could have gotten them?” I said it’s possible but how would I know if they did.  After a bit more of this, I ask again what this is even about.  At that point the guy on video chat has another guy come on the call, and he finally clues me in about what’s going on.  They claimed I made an “egregious discount.”  I said I have never done that deliberately.  They show me the receipt, and there is an item that was marked down from $26 to $1.  I said it is certainly an error but I don’t remember why or how it happened.  They clearly do not believe me.  The whole time, they’re effectively doing the cop interrogation technique where they are making subtly accusatory statements and pressuring me to confirm, which I don’t.  What I assume I did wrong is manually enter 25 into the bar with the dollar amount, instead of the percentage.  I remembered that customer having an email sign-up coupon that wouldn’t scan, so I had to enter it manually.  The guys seem to not believe me.  They log off the call to sort some things out, and tell me to hang tight.  So I’m sitting in the room with the two other employees, in complete silence, for literally half an hour.  I asked them a couple of questions and they said I had to wait for the guys on the call to ask them.  When they finally come back on the call, I am presented with a printed statement that I am supposed to sign.  They told me they’re going to walk through it with me, and I say no, I’m going to read it first, and then we can walk through it.  They’re getting pretty pissed at me and kind of aggressive by this point, and very pushy for me to do what they say.  The statement they had printed for me was a suspension notice, and it stated that I believed another employee had used my credentials to log in and make the egregious discount, along with other statements that were IN NO WAY what I said, some statements even being effectively fabricated.  I fought back on this -  I said I’m not signing what is effectively a false confession because these are not my words or a reflection of my defense.  The guys are getting very aggressive and clearly aggravated, one of the guys literally says “yes, you ARE going to sign it.”  I said “you wrote this without any inclusivity or recognition of the fact that it was an error and not a deliberate action, and with a complete misrepresentation of my words to the point of it being fictional.”  One of the guys says “that doesn’t matter, it’s just policy.”  I reply “I want you to explain to me how that makes sense to you.”  They pause for a moment (lol) and then one of them says, in an almost imperious and petulant tone “you’re not going to sign it?” and the other one goes “if you’re not willing to have a reasonable conversation with us…” and I didn’t hear the rest of what he said, because at that point I got up, left the room, took off my badge, theatro and brush belt, and when the in-store asset protection guy followed me out, I said “here’s all your stuff, fuck you.”  He started to say “hey, I didn’t do any of this” I cut him off and said “fuck off.”  He replied “just make sure you clock out before you leave.”  I walked downstairs, got my stuff, and left. (After clocking out, of course, lol.)

Anyway, my main question is, what the hell was that about?  It’s hard to explain in words, but the whole vibe of the interaction was very weird, suspicious and insidious.  The attitude of the asset protection guys was bordering on hostile at times - the leading questions, the attempts to twist my words/trap me into saying something incriminating, the fact that they had absolutely no willingness to consider that it was an error (they also expected me to pay the $25), and the fact that they wrote up a statement for me to sign that claimed I had said things that never came out of my mouth, is all just so wild to me.  Plus, the employees in the office being dead silent, and having an almost shamed/guilty look on their faces was so bizarre.  Is it normal for this kind of thing to get escalated to this degree, so quickly, for a first time error and for such a low dollar amount?  I’m almost wondering if there’s another reason they wanted me gone that would not have been grounds for suspension or termination.  I’m also wondering (given that Macy’s has a borderline draconian policy regarding the Macy’s card signup quota and docking you any time you process a return) if Asset Protection has some sort of quota they need to meet, and they squeeze it out of employees whenever possible?

My last question/source of confusion, is that I’m still able to log in to MyInsite and I’m still scheduled through the 28th, so did they interpret my “fuck you” as “I’m giving my two weeks notice”?  Because…I feel like “fuck you” is a pretty clear translation.  I have also heard nothing from anyone in leadership or management - no emails, messages, anything, regarding the situation.  I reached out the the rep for the beauty brand I worked for at Macy’s and told her what happened, and she said “oh nooo!  They didn’t even tell me.”  What the fuck?  Granted, it was only last night when it happened, but it still strikes me as odd.

Anyway, thanks for any input on this, I’m pretty flabbergasted.

Edit:  Also, if anybody has any suggestions or tips on if pursuing legal action is a possibility and how to go about it, please share."
83,3,"Yes, I am still working on finding an ""actual"" job bc money

The amount of work I do on my own usually amounts to more hours of productivity every week than any job I ever had, though. I don't just sit there and no *nothing*. I don't think any of us really do. Besides, if jobs can have unpaid interns and people who don't get paid enough to survive, why tf should it matter *who* I'm doing the work for?? Fuck it 🤷‍♀️ self-employed seems **far** more accurate.

I'm doing lots of leather work and clothing design atm 🖤 plus interior design, landscaping, detailing, handyman work, and a whole bunch of other shit.

Love to hear what kinda stuff you guys are working on 🖤"
84,3,"This applies mainly to australians but can apply to other countries.

Another reason not to work hard now. GenZ are growing up. They were NOT made for the 9-5 grind. They're the most flaky and misinformed generation of all time. Give it 10 years, the old bosses would've quit and died off and the new generation will still be STRUGGLING in the workplace.

Then will be the perfect opportunity to get back into a ""career"" or traditionally hard job. The jobs will become much easier themselves. There will be better safety laws in place (australia) and stuff will be catered to this GenZ by then, so you'll be putting in less effort as nobody will be ""working hard"" by then. Lookup 996 work culture. 

So don't work now, work in 10 years time."
85,3,"After being let go from my remote job in 2024 and experiencing domestic violence, I landed a new job last year and they requested I work remote, then move cities for them as they wanted hybrid work. I had just left a bad relationship and secured a protective order.

The company lied to me during the interview process, stole my work (breaching a contract saying they wouldn't use my work sample for client work), and laid me off six months after I moved cities for the company. Turns out its because they're losing so much money due to unethical spending by the principal that the founder has sued him. I filed a small claims suit against them as they wouldn't remove my image from the website knowing i had a protective order and didn't want my name or image anyhwhere, and for the breach of my agreement on my work sample.

I'm now in a city i don't want to be in for a job i don't have anymore. I took this job for financial reasons as I was denied unemployment due to misclassification in 2024. Yes, my remote job misclassified me. I have now used legal aid to help with my case against the Texas Workforce Commission. I can barely get out of bed in the morning. When I apply for jobs, it makes me angry and more depressed, and gets me thinking ""how is this one going to try to screw me?""

Prior to my remote job I was misclassified at, I was sexually harassed. They tried to manage me out.

I don't know how to stop the anger and pain all of this has caused. I don't know how to stop hating the people I worked with that just stay quiet and spineless and especially the older female managers who said nothing to me when I brought up all of the ethical violations the company committed. I don't know how to have faith that I can continue a professional career. Unethical employers have robbed me of money, hope and a stable future.

I got into law school but it's still so hard to even move everyday"
86,3,"
I, M 16–18, ex-IHG employee in the UK, 1 month of absolute hell (was still on probation)

I’m between 16–18 (not saying for obvious reasons), and this is something I need to get off my chest.

Only lasted one month, And I genuinely have never felt so invisible, dismissed, and mentally kicked about by grown adults in my life.

No, I won’t name names. But I will describe them so you get the idea.

(Bear in mind Fiona and Lucy have always been like that since I started working there)

⸻

The cast (not real names):

Fiona – Duty Manager 1

Gremlin energy; Mid 50s I’d say, Short, stubby, constantly pissed off, Always has a go at you but never actually listens to your side.

———
Lucy – My-age co-worker

Thinks she’s royalty. Refuses to do simple 2-minute tasks, and then complains when I try to cover it myself to stop guests from moaning.

———
Michael – Night Shift Leader (never met him before)

You’ll meet him at 11pm.

⸻

Now here’s how Friday the 13th went down.
My final shift, My breaking point.

⸻

3:00 PM – Clock In

Arrive shattered. Barely 4 hours of sleep. Walked almost 2 miles to get there.
No one says hi. No welcome. I log in, check the bookings, start check-ins. No issue, Just tired.

⸻

7:00 PM – Break

I go on break; finally, Nothing unusual. Fiona gives me a grunt when I ask if she still needs me in the kitchen.

“Mhm.”

Right back into the dishes and chaos it is.

⸻

8:00 PM – Hostility begins

Out of nowhere, Fiona’s energy shifts. She’s cold, short-tempered, and I start to feel that stormy vibe building.
You know the one, Where anything you do will be wrong one way or another.

⸻

9:00 PM – The Fan

Lucy asks me to bring a fan up to a guest room. I sigh — literally just a burnt-out “aghhhh” under my breath, not shouting, but loud enough, she was behind me if i remember correctly.

I do it anyway. Carry it upstairs, come back down. Start wiping tables.

Suddenly Fiona calls me over:

“Apologise”

Me: “For what?”

“For shouting at Lucy”

Me: “I never shouted at her at all?”

“Well yes you did she’s shooken up so apologise”

And I did so,

I walked away saying nothing, back to the kitchen to do the dishes, Just swallow it and move on.

⸻

9:30 PM – Helping the bar staff

I ask the bar guy:

“Want me to take your bins out for you?”

He lights up; says “that’d be amazing.” 


So I do. I’m trying to be helpful.


But Fiona walks outside:

“What are you doing?”

Me: “Helping out,” I say. “He’s been busy.”

“He can do it himself.”

Me: “I don’t understand why you’re being like this.”

“Don’t give me cheek!” she snaps.

“Stay in that kitchen and get the dishes done.”

Her voice? Loud, Angry, Accusatory, Like a child who didn’t get what they wanted at Christmas

⸻

10:00 PM – Demanding of my phone (not the first time)

I’m unblocking the drain filled with food and shit while the dishes are in the dishwasher when she comes in again.

“Do you have your phone on you?”

Me: Yeah

“Yeah, can I have it please?”

Me: Why?

(Instantly): “Because you shouldn’t have it”

Then immediately thereafter: “Don’t answer me back”

Me: So why are you being like this?

(Dismissive): “Right, can I have your phone please?”

Me: No, it’s mine, I’m waiting for a call from my mum (which i actually was and important)

“Right, well you tell me these things and don’t take it upon yourself.”

Me: it’s my phone and I’m not on it (which I wasn’t throughout the whole shift)

“Doesn’t matter, Phones stay in the back office, If you did your job properly then there wouldn’t be a problem.”

This was after doing everything she threw at me. Dishes, Tables, Check In, Helping the bar man with the bins, yet she acts like I’m in Year 7

⸻

10:45 PM – Forks

I’m nearly done, and apparently I put a few forks the wrong way round in the holder

Fiona?
She doesn’t say a word.

She just pulls out her phone and takes a picture. No comment. Just to have it for… whatever purpose, Probably to report it to my manager or show the other colleagues lol

⸻

11:00 PM – Verbal Abuse 

I’ve got barely a minute left before freedom. Almost there.

But Michael; Night Shift Leader, Mid 20s I’d say, steps in when I’m at the iPad to clock out, I’m visibly tired and irritated and I haven’t said a single word to him until I hear:

“Don’t give me cheek/attitude and stop acting like a fucking idiot, I haven’t done anything to you.”

Deadass, Said to my face, I didn’t even say anything to that fucking prick, I’d just been quiet, doing my job, worn the fuck out. No guests were around.

I just stared at him like I was about to go right through him.

And that? That was it.

———

11:03 PM – Clock Out

Clocked out,
Didn’t breathe a word,
Didn’t say goodbye,
Threw my name badge in the bushes and walked home,

Never returned.
———

I have the voice note, but I won’t share it, because honestly, it would feel wrong.

Michael’s words, his tone; everything is in there. And Fiona asking for my phone? That too.

Unfortunately, I didn’t have anything recording before 9PM. But knowing I’ve got that one moment saved?
That’s mine. For my own protection. For truth.

⸻

I know people will have mixed opinions, and that’s okay.
I want to hear them, all of them, from your perspective.

I wrote this as accurately as I could. If you have any questions, I’ll answer them.
Thanks in advance if you read all the way.

⸻

PS: There’s way more I could share, so much more from that month.
Things said. Things done. Things witnessed.

But for now, I just needed to get last night off my chest.

87,3,"I've been working for this small local business for about a year and a half now doing machine operation. It's one of those ""like a family"" businesses (a toxic ass family). The boss is a complete narcissist and has been so terrible and verbally abusive to everyone who isn't in her list of favorites. There's no HR, no union, and the place is literally a sweatshop. It's a tin roofed warehouse with no A/C in 110+F degrees with hot machinery turning the place into an oven during the summer. They also have employees working in a warehouse without a fire suppression system, which they would be majorly fined for if someone reported them to the city, what a shame it'd be if that happened..

  
Any way, I had an interview with another company that had a lot more to offer - opportunity for career growth, great benefits, air conditioning, and higher pay. They offered me the job yesterday so I decided to put in my notice today. I had to put in a 1 week notice because the new job needed me there that soon for a scheduled training. 

I was very professional about how I went about my notice. I told my boss I needed to have a private chat with her. I said I was very sorry but I accepted another job offer and was going to take it because of the higher pay and benefits. Her initial response was basically ""You are really fucking us over"" then she stormed off, started texting me (which I ignored), then came back to demand that I give her a longer notice and tried to guilt trip me by saying she has done ""so much"" for me (allowing me to take a little *unpaid* time off to take care of my sick mother). 

I told her sorry, but I had to give a 1 week notice and I reminded her that her company was an at-will employer so technically I didn't need to put in any notice at all. She then said, ""Ok well pack your shit and get the fuck out"" to which I cheerfully said ""ok!"" and as she was walking away she said ""I'm at-will too"" lmao. 

My coworker witnessed the whole ordeal and walked out with me in solidarity. It was amazing. I blocked my boss' number and we went out for drinks. I am proud of myself for standing up for myself and not backing down to her crazy bitch behavior. Plus, now I get a weeklong vacation before I start my new, better job! 

This is the first time I have ever been fired, but I'm feeling great about it. Happy Friday everyone!"
88,3,"As history often repeats itself, I'm curious about the the uber wealthy who fight everyday, by philosophy and effort, to control everything and to squeeze every last dime from every viable resources to continue to grow their wealth. Leaving in their wake growing poverty, homelessness, and a huge expanding population fueled by resentment. Historically, that comes back and bites them hard. Down with the bourgeois. Off with their heads and all that. Do they not read the same history books? Do they not understand what's coming? It seems to me that if they peeled off a small fraction of their extraordinary wealth and took care of ""the people"" they continue to be stupid rich and there would be fewer people ready to chase them down with pitchforks and torches. Do they not see what is coming?"
89,3,"I left the pest control industry! (3 years) I am really proud of myself I was commuting  3 hours a day then working 7-10 hours of actual work. Made the decision at the start of this month to calculate how much I was making an hour because I'm on salary. 19$ an hour CAD (Minimum wage here is basically 18$ 😭 I have been missing my one year old son so much. I only got a 1.5% raise in two years (yay 100$ more a month ☠️), I trained a new guy with no experience who made more than me, I put myself in harm way and all for what? Nothing. I hate these corporations so much. I always knew at the end of the day I was just another number. These places aren't worth our existence."
90,3,"I’ve been working at my new job a month ago, it was THE perfect work place as it was near my home and had a high wage. However, during my first week, there was a male co worker constantly eyeing me from the distance and he rubs his belly(? He got a giant beer belly btw) whenever he looks at me. I just assumed he was curious about me since I’m relatively new until I overheard from my co workers that he found me attractive and plans to date me. 

Now, keep in mind, he is middle aged, around 30-40. I’m not even an adult yet!!! And it’s been established too. I just did my job as per normal while avoiding him as this is a relatively good job and I wish to keep it. However, he started touching my hand subtly whenever I do something “wrong”, would grab my hips to move past me (his belly against my back too yuck), etc. I told him to stop as it’s uncomfortable, and informed my co workers too, to remind him to not do that however, it continued AND got worse. 

He’d wait for me after work or in isolated areas my manager or other co workers send me to, attempting to chat with me while looking at me up and down 💔 I’d just stay quiet and either avoid/ignore him, or say I’m in a rush. Decided to report to my manager about this, to which he said “this isn’t a call for concern as he poses no harm, besides, he’s an excellent worker in our company”.

Each time I reported him, I get a similar response. I got frustrated and tried reporting straight to hr via email but the manager stopped me, saying to not make it such a big deal. (!?) overtime, that dude started getting more bold, touching me more and EVEN TRIED TO FIND MY PHONE NUMBER VIA THE WORKER’S FILE (caught him in the act).
Reported to my manager AND HE SAID “he could just want to contact you for work related stuff”. I feel like it is too late to mention but yes, my manager and co worker are best friends. 

I was just at my wits end, tired and absolutely hated this job, going as far as to avoid shifts that clashes with that co worker but he’d somehow always be there. I just crashed out, stopped going to work and messaged my manager, begging bro to just help me out but he FIRED ME. “I’m not compatible for this kind of work”. HE SAID THAT TO ME!!!!

I’m so done bro this isn’t the first time I had this shit happen……. needed to let this out because what the hellee….🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥

Edit: GRAHH THANK FOR THE ADVICE IN THE COMMENTS BTW!!! I’ve informed my parents and they intend to confront the company first. If no action is done to fire the creep, they might take it to court with their legal team 🔥🔥 I still won’t go back to work there even if the creep is gone dw, but all is well I suppose!!!! 

Edit 2: mom told me not to post updates about the situation as she says its a legal matter, also sorry for not responding to the comments I’ll respond soon!! Ish,, I’m seeking therapy now about this interaction and I’m gonna just focus on that. Once when the final outcome of the situation is out, I’ll update!! If I remember 💔"

92,3,"As the title describes, I was asked to help train an AI. She claims it's not to replace anyone, but to help streamline processes and cut down on ""tedious tasks."" Which of course long-term, I'm not buying whatsoever.

The difficult part is that we literally just moved into a new house 2 weeks ago. Our finances are wiped and we really cannot afford to lose an income right now. The timing is absolutely brutal. I wish I was in a position to just walk away but the unfortunate truth is I'm not.

I don't **think** this meeting will be letting me go on the spot. I'm the only one that handles a lot of these tasks and if they're looking to train the AI I don't think they have anything to fall back on just yet. Of course I could be wrong. We'll see.

I am not planning on having any friends as I will be there to just work and keep my nose clean. I don’t want any difficulties. I just want to show up to my job and not have any difficulties. Also, it is so hard to get a job after being fired it seems. I need to catch a break, I’ve been through a year of hell as is. One of my friends actually asked me why I expect to not have any friends in the workplace , and I simply put it as it’ll keep my job safe because they’re my coworkers first. Coworkers will be the biggest snakes to ever exist if it means some gain.  Also who tf makes someone work a full day, BEFORE a 3 day weekend, and terminates them? That’s super effin shitty because what do you mean you get to surprise me on Friday at the end of the day? Why couldn’t you have just done it earlier in the day?? Like thanks for wasting my time. 


Also, I really hope my spouse gets this job they’re interviewing for soon so that we can really get back on track. So y’all, please keep your fingers crossed for the people that need to catch a big ass break."
94,3,"I had worked there for 2.2 years, ended up being the most experienced in my team, mostly because of extremely high employee turnover. 

I was offered 2 promotions, I refused both bc the sacrifice would've been too much. I could make decent money even in the position I had, but then team managers changed, and then bosses changed and I kept getting low balled. 

My personal TM is younger, would stifle me because I didn't have kiss ass tendencies and it would hurt her feelings. Everyone argued, environment humorless and stressful, my own health would degrade at a rapid pace, etc. 

I just kept skipping work and being late (I was going to all sorts of hospitals too, after all), kept shirking my duties, etc. TM would still be an absolute dickwad about it, but I stopped caring. They couldn't fire me because the company was straight up sinking and it costs so much more to bring in new and untrained people. 

Obviously I had  enough, I silently interviewed somewhere else, successfully. Quit last Friday right after the shift ended and my entire salary was paid, handed my TM my key with the ""I gave a sh$t yesterday, you must have missed it!'"" and walked out without telling anyone else about my plans. 

Started on Monday, and even though the job is stressful, the environment is so calm. I truly didn't realize how much I was drained, to the point where a logistics job feels like going on vacation. 

"
95,3,"Someone shared their experience of encountering the same unsettling patterns at several different workplaces — usually through staffing agencies. At first, everything seems fine. But over time, a familiar dynamic appears: there’s always an informal “leader,” someone who sets the tone, scolds others for not working fast enough, and influences the group’s behavior.

At one previous job, this person was bullied daily by two coworkers. When they reported it to a manager, nothing was done — the bullies were seen as “nice guys” by leadership. Another colleague had even filed a complaint after one of the bullies made a vulgar, inappropriate comment to her, but that too was swept under the rug.

Now, at a new workplace, the same dynamics are starting to show. There’s a tightly knit group, a new guy who’s trying to prove he’s the best, and someone positioning themselves as the “pack leader,” calling out others for minor things. To make matters more unsettling, someone from the previous toxic workplace is now working here too. It’s starting to feel like a loop — and the person can’t help but wonder if they’re being intentionally sent to workplaces that already have a problematic atmosphere.

This isn’t about a single bad experience. It’s about a recurring sense of being excluded, working in environments where silent bullying is tolerated, and social power plays matter more than the actual job.

Has anyone else experienced something like this — especially in temp or warehouse jobs? How do you deal with these kinds of group dynamics?"
96,3,"Going to give some context on the situation. 

I've been at my employer for a year,about 2 months ago, I was given an offer from another company for a bit more money, and a small step up in position. I ended up declining this offer after speaking to a few higher ups at my job. I was told I was their star employee, hardest worker,etc etc. They also told me I was next in line for promotional opportunities, as I come from an employer where I was in a supervisory role. 

A few weeks later our lead role is fired, and interviews are opened for the position. I obviously interview for the role. I'm told by higher ups I did great,keep doing what I'm doing, I'm a top candidate etc. Today they tell everyone on the team that I was not given the promotion. In private they tell me I'm simply too new and don't have the knowledge. However, I am a frequent point of contact for EVERYONE else on my team who has questions. I am also the first to sign up for overtime shifts, and always go the extra mile.

I feel pissed off. I feel like I bust my ass every day, for nothing. To watch people who are half as good as I am be moved into roles with more benefits and higher pay. All day at work I've been pissed, and can't bring myself to even give a fuck about my job now. I should have just taken the offer I was given elsewhere for a bit more money. Has anyone else experienced this sort of frustration? "

So I asked  in the team chat “how do I offer wireless to someone who is currently unhappy with their AT&T wireless service?”

No response.

Just silence.

This job isn’t about providing real solutions. It’s about meeting numbers even if the ask makes no sense and just pisses off customers. And then when you get coached later, they’ll say you “missed an opportunity.”

Anyway, I have a strict rule about not working above my pay grade, setting boundaries, and just generally having self-respect.  I was talking to my dad about how my boss wants me to take on more responsibilities, and use my car to transport things and to *always* have my phone on me for calls.

Those responsibilities are literally above my pay grade and I feel like I’m stepping on the toes of people who *are* in that bracket.  I’m also still fairly new and learning what to do.  I am unqualified to do what he wants.  My boundaries are about not using my car to store and transport stuff.  From one location to another all during work hours?  Sure.  Holding things overnight/for a week?  No.  That takes up my car’s space, I’d have to remove it for groceries or friends, and then remember to put it back and there’d be hell to pay if I forgot.  I’m not getting paid enough for that.  And the phone thing?  I will get distracted if I have it on me and he really breathes down our necks if we check it during work.  I was on it for a few seconds during a slow period and he was like ‘go find something to do’.  It was the first and last time I did that because now I leave it with my stuff in a different room away from working with people.  Also, my phone has shit charge and if I forget its cables then I turn it off during work entirely except for my breaks.  He told me clients may need to call me during work, but like 1) I did not agree to give out my phone number and 2) it’s not a work phone.  If it was provided by him then totally.  But, like, ??? No????  I choose when to have my *personal* phone on me.  

Anyway, I was telling my dad about this and he was like ‘sometimes you have to do more for nonprofits’ and I’m losing my mind y’all.  He works for a nonprofit and loves it, he’s his own boss and makes next to nothing cause my mom has the real job.  I don’t have a wife with a job of her own so I can hangout and do extra work for peanuts.  And I cannot get it through his thick head that I respect myself enough to not take on extra stress for as little as I’m paid.  I’m hourly.  I don’t even get benefits.  It’s clear he’s not considering a raise for the amount of responsibilities he wants me to take on.  Like why the fuck would I ever stress myself out over poverty wages?????  It enrages me so much when he says I should let myself be exploited cause they’re a nonprofit.

104,3,"# The Great Heist: How Employers Have Stolen Over $50 Trillion From Workers Since 1975

The largest theft in American history isn’t happening in banks or jewelry stores. It’s happening in offices, factories, restaurants, and construction sites across the country, where employers have systematically stolen over $50 trillion from workers since 1975. This isn’t hyperbole — it’s the documented result of decades of wage suppression, productivity theft, and the deliberate transfer of wealth from workers to corporate owners.

# The $50 Trillion Theft: Breaking Down the Numbers

The scale of this theft becomes clear when examining multiple forms of wage suppression that have operated simultaneously for nearly five decades:

# The Productivity-Wage Gap: $2.2 Trillion Stolen Annually

The most dramatic evidence comes from the productivity-wage gap documented by the [Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/). From 1979 to 2021, worker productivity grew by 64.6% while hourly compensation grew by only 17.3%. This means workers are producing nearly twice as much value per hour as they did in 1979, but seeing almost none of that increase in their paychecks.

If wages had kept pace with productivity, the average worker would earn approximately $42 per hour today instead of around $23. The [Economic Policy Institute estimates](https://www.epi.org/blog/growing-inequalities-reflecting-growing-employer-power-have-generated-a-productivity-pay-gap-since-1979/) this gap costs workers $2.2 trillion per year in lost wages. Cumulatively since 1975, this amounts to well over $50 trillion in stolen productivity gains.

# Labor’s Shrinking Share: Trillions Redistributed to Capital

[Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/labor-share-decline-causes-consequences-policy-responses-20210916.htm) and [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2011/01/art3full.pdf) data reveal another dimension of this theft. Labor’s share of national income has declined from approximately 63% in the mid-20th century to just 56% today, while corporate profits have soared. This 7-percentage-point shift in a multi-trillion-dollar economy represents trillions of dollars redirected from workers’ paychecks to corporate shareholders and executives.

# The RAND Corporation’s Smoking Gun

A [2020 RAND Corporation study](https://www.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/WRA516-1.html) provided perhaps the most damning evidence of systematic wealth theft. Researchers found that if income growth since 1975 had been as equitable as in previous decades, the median full-time worker would earn approximately $92,000 annually instead of around $50,000. The cumulative gap for all workers exceeds $50 trillion in suppressed wages.

# Direct Wage Theft: The Tip of the Iceberg

While the productivity-wage gap represents the largest component of theft, direct wage theft — employers literally stealing wages already earned — adds billions more to the total. This includes:

**$15 billion stolen annually** through minimum wage violations, unpaid overtime, off-the-clock work, and tip theft. At least 4 million workers are illegally underpaid each year, losing an average of $3,000-$3,500 annually.

In Los Angeles fast food restaurants alone, 1 in 4 workers are illegally paid below minimum wage, costing each victim an average of $3,500 annually. In Western New York, 1,900 employers withheld $17.1 million from 23,613 workers over a single decade.

[**$50+ billion in total wage theft annually**](https://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-paychecks-each-year/) when including all forms of wage violations, according to Economic Policy Institute estimates. This direct theft adds over $2 trillion to the cumulative total since 1975.

# The Mechanisms of Theft

This massive wealth transfer didn’t happen by accident. It resulted from deliberate policy choices and corporate strategies:

# Union Busting and Wage Suppression

Research from [Harvard and the University of Washington](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/farber/files/unions_wages_benefits.pdf) shows that declining unionization accounts for one-third of the rise in wage inequality. Union membership fell from 35% in the 1950s to just 10% today, eliminating workers’ primary tool for capturing productivity gains.

# Corporate Profit Maximization

Corporate profits as a share of GDP have doubled since the 1970s while worker wages stagnated. Companies that once shared productivity gains with workers through higher wages now capture those gains entirely as profits for shareholders and executives.

# Regulatory Capture and Weak Enforcement

[Labor investigator staffing has hit a 52-year low](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/05/new-report-labor-investigator-staffing-hits-52-year-low-raising-the-risk-of-wage-theft/), with just 611 investigators for 165 million workers — one investigator per 278,000 workers. This deliberate understaffing ensures that wage theft goes unpunished and employers face minimal consequences for violations.

# The Real-World Impact

This isn’t just an abstract economic debate — it’s about millions of families struggling to survive while corporate profits soar:

* **Housing Crisis**: If wages had kept pace with productivity, median workers would earn $84,000 annually instead of $42,000, making housing affordable for millions more families.
* **Healthcare Bankruptcy**: The $42,000 in annual income stolen from the median worker would cover health insurance premiums and medical expenses for most families.
* **Education Debt**: Workers losing $3,000-$3,500 annually to direct wage theft could pay for college tuition or vocational training instead of going into debt.
* **Retirement Security**: The $50 trillion stolen from workers since 1975 would have provided retirement security for an entire generation.

# The Enforcement Charade

The current enforcement system is designed to enable theft, not prevent it. While property crimes worth millions receive massive law enforcement attention, wage theft worth tens of billions goes largely ignored:

* **Understaffed Agencies**: Some states have just one investigator for every 500,000 workers; four states have no investigators based in-state.
* **Weak Penalties**: Employers often face penalties less than what they saved by stealing wages, making theft profitable.
* **Retaliation**: Up to 98% of low-wage workers subject to forced arbitration never pursue stolen wages, knowing they’ll face job loss and legal costs they can’t afford.
* **Minimal Recovery**: Only $1.5 billion in stolen wages were recovered between 2021–2023, representing less than 1% of the estimated $150+ billion stolen during that period.

# Corporate Criminals

Major corporations appear repeatedly on wage violation lists, treating theft as a business strategy:

* [**AT&T**](https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/violation-tracker): 34 different wage and hour violations totaling $140 million in penalties since 2000
* [**Walmart**](https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-026942): Hundreds of millions in wage theft settlements
* [**Amazon**](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-to-pay-61-7-million-to-settle-ftc-charges-that-it-withheld-tips-from-drivers/): Systematic wage theft affecting hundreds of thousands of workers

For these companies, wage theft penalties are simply a cost of doing business — a small price to pay for stealing billions from workers.

# The Bigger Picture: Class Warfare

The $50 trillion theft represents the largest upward transfer of wealth in American history. It’s not a bug in the system — it’s a feature. Corporate America has successfully:

1. **Decoupled wages from productivity** through union busting and political influence
2. **Captured regulatory agencies** to ensure minimal enforcement
3. **Shifted national income** from workers to capital owners
4. **Normalized wage theft** as acceptable business practice

This systematic theft has created unprecedented inequality, with the top 1% capturing nearly all productivity gains while working families struggle with stagnant wages despite producing more value than ever.

# Reclaiming What Was Stolen

The $50 trillion theft isn’t inevitable — it’s the result of policy choices that can be reversed:

**Strengthen Labor Enforcement**: Hire thousands of investigators, impose criminal penalties for wage theft, and protect workers who report violations.

**Restore Collective Bargaining**: Make union organizing easier and require employers to negotiate in good faith.

**Link Wages to Productivity**: Implement policies ensuring workers share in the value they create.

**Criminal Penalties**: Treat wage theft like the grand larceny it is, with prison sentences for repeat offenders.

**Wealth Redistribution**: Use progressive taxation to reclaim some of the stolen wealth and invest in public services that benefit workers.

# The Crime of the Century

The theft of $50 trillion from American workers since 1975 represents the largest property crime in world history. It has impoverished millions, destroyed communities, and created a feudal economy where workers produce enormous wealth but receive subsistence wages.

This isn’t a natural economic phenomenon — it’s organized theft enabled by corrupt politicians, captured regulators, and a legal system that prioritizes corporate profits over worker rights.

The evidence is overwhelming: productivity gains that should have gone to workers have been systematically stolen by employers for nearly five decades.

The time for polite economic debate is over. American workers have been robbed of $50 trillion, and it’s time to treat this theft with the seriousness it deserves.

Nothing less than a complete restructuring of economic power will restore what has been stolen and prevent future theft on this scale.

105,3,"My boss asked me if I was ok to take on more tasks as I recently started to take on new roles. Obviously the only expected answer from me is to say yes, but I purposely told her that no, I was still taking time to get used to my new role.

I hate it here. "
106,3,"Every website on any topic allows you to comment. But not a single job search website allows you to do this. Why? Because employers don't want people sharing the truth about the job actually is, or that it's a fake posting, or how abusive the boss is.

110,3,"I have been working at UPS for several years. Previously, I was part of a small sort/d bag team, but I have recently moved back to the unload area because my local warehouse is downsizing its small sort staff due to the introduction of automation and robots. They're currently dismantling that part of the building. I've been told that unload is now the only position available, as many individuals and supervisors from small sort are transitioning to the loading area. For months, there have been talks about shutting down small sort. I've often heard that jobs in the warehouse are becoming outdated, with many UPS warehouse workers facing layoffs, firings, and terminations as robots take over these roles. My managers have suggested that it won’t be long before the entire warehouse shifts to automation, leading to layoffs in all departments, including unloading. When I took this warehouse job, I made the choice to join the union, but I now regret that decision due to the low pay and high union dues that are deducted from my paycheck each month. In my view, this warehouse job isn’t a sustainable living, and I am only getting part-time hours while feeling overworked and underpaid. Each week, I earn just a few hundred dollars for the limited hours I work, with the peak season being the only time I managed to get about 20 hours. I dislike this job and want to quit, but my parents believe it's a good position with great benefits. However, with rising costs for car insurance, my phone bill, rent, and other living expenses, it’s becoming increasingly challenging to make ends meet on the pay I receive as a UPS warehouse employee."

113,3,"I felt that I needed to address a few things since my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1kx56xi/got_a_text_from_someone_who_forgot_i_retired_and/).

When I made this post about the lady who reached out to me about a fundraiser, I did my best to explain what happened. It backfired and something unexpected happened; the post blew up and a few things stood out.

I was asked: *Why’d you donate if you didn’t want to be involved?*

I also read that y*ou could’ve just said no,* and *this makes no sense,* and *you created your own problem.*

I think that's what a lot of people have wrong: that our identity is tied to what we do. I never thought retirement meant I was going to stop caring. In fact, retirement meant I could be more involved with the things I care about because I'd no longer be exchanging my time for money.

Sure, I could have just said no, but that also would have meant that my career made me jaded and there's no way I'd ever allow something like money to change me.

But regardless, as I continue this journey both as a person and writer, I'm trying my best to navigate this new chapter in my life by empowering others in the workforce and the workplace.

He also said that I had basically done zero preparations for this project, and he would also have liked to put as many hours as I did to have nothing done. 


After that interchange I came back to the office and reported him to HR. For now, they said they’ll change me to a new manager, however, my old boss is basically in charge of everything and everyone. He’s so embedded in this company, and he’s involved in every department. Not to mention, all of upper management is basically family, or friends of the family. So I’m fucked regardless. I want to quit so bad, but they pay me well, I’m the breadwinner, and I have follow up appointments with the doctor, and I need the health insurance.

119,3,"Update: I QUIT!

First thanks to everyone for reading and commenting. I found this thread to be so helpful in working through my emotions and helping me find a path forward. I ended up deciding to resign, making today my last day of ""work"". I also resigned from the religious school and from my synagogue membership as well. There really needs to be some healthy space between me and them, so completely separating from the synagogue was really the only option. Y'all were right, and I really appreciated all of the comments, even the sometimes brutally honest ones haha

I spent today packing up the belongings I'd brought into the office (I will never ever do that again!) and thanking the people who came in to comfort me. The two EDs were extremely supportive of my decision to just quietly leave without training them and didn't pester me at all while I gathered up my stuff. I left my letter of resignation on the rabbi's desk (he is out of the office for today and tomorrow so ... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ) and I left my keys and the company credit card on my desk and even though it's been hard, it still feels like a happy ending somehow lol.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I was the administrative assistant at a small-ish synagogue (the synagogue I attend as a member). The Executive board ended up cutting my position out of the budget for the upcoming FY due to financial issues (membership is down, and dues in general are down, they have a budget deficit going into the new FY) and have decided to go a different direction for office management. They are keeping the engagement director, and are hiring an education director for the religious school. The cantor is giving up their educational duties to the new person and taking a salary cut. Basically all of my duties will now be handled by the two EDs and the Exec Board expects me to show them the ropes them. (They mentioned at the meeting that a lot of administrative tasks can now be handled by AI.)

Obviously I am having feelings. I loved this job. The synagogue is my spiritual home and it just felt GOOD to be a part of the team running it. I was planning for this to be my last job now that I'm solidly middle-old. But the thing that is really sticking in my craw is they want me to teach the two EDs. It feels like a betrayal, especially on the part of the incoming educational director, another congregant who's been wanting to work here for ages, came in as a ""volunteer"" and carved herself a position in the budget out of my salary.

Anyway, my last day is supposed to be June 30th (a Monday lol), but I have a day of PTO left so I could def make the last day the friday before. I wanted to leave on good terms so I can remain a member there, and also still teach in the religious school, but right now I'm just ... upset. I feel very checked out and tempted to call in sick, never to be seen again.

I'd love to hear what y'all would do."
120,3,"I hate this so much. I work in a production warehouse where there's various jobs to do that involve lifting heavy boxes, packing, labelling, sorting, and many other things. There's many work lines, where each line has a leader along others under the leader working there being responsible to manage the line and work through it to complete orders. Each work line has different jobs to do.

My job is to work off those lines handling other stuff. When it's very slow at work, then I work on any of those lines, but otherwise, I'm supposed to do my job at not to anything on those lines. I hate these so called people named ""leaders"" that it's unfair they can get away with everyone their way because they are the ""leader"" and people under that line have to listen to them to get the order done.

One time I was working off the line in the middle of the warehouse because I had to cover a bunch of machines with plastic wraps. A leader called me half way from the warehouse while I was doing my work. I went half way across the warehouse to see what's up. She called me just because they finished the stuff on a white pallet and she wanted me to take out the empty called. YOU CALLED ME HALF WAY ACROSS THE WAREHOUSE JUST TO TAKE OUT AN EMPTY WHITE PALLET WHILE I WAS DOING A PART OF MY JOB BECAUSE OF YOUR LAZINESS SINCE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT. The 2nd time she called again after some time and I pretended not to hear since I assumed another thing like that will happen. 

Another time I was walking by and doing my job off the line and one of the leaders on the line told me if I could quickly help her lift some of those heavy boxes from the pallet and put it on the table for her. Yeah right it's not because you need ""help"". It's because of your laziness you're telling someone else to do something at your convenience because you don't want to do it and since you're leader of the line, nothing will happen to you because you're at the highest level on the line.

One time when my work was slow, I was working on the line opening the stuff on the table, and the leader told me, ""don't open the stuff on the table, I'll open it and instead you put the boxes on the table for me."" I know that you're only saying that because you don't want to continuosly bend and lift the heavy boxes from the pallet to put on the table to open. At your convenience, you didn't want to bend and lift due to your laziness, so instead you instructed me to put some of the heavy boxes on the table for you while you stood there to open because that was convenient for you.

This is the problem at work. Leaders will always disguise things as ""help"" for things they don't want to do at their convenience to put it on someone else instead and act like they need ""help"" instead of admitting laziness to wanting to do it.

These leaders will always want things to get done at their convenience in a way where everything is the easiest for them whenever possible since they know they can get away with all that. Your lazy to lift the boxes hmmmm ok let's tell that person to put them on then table for me while I just open. Now I'm lazy to lift the empty pallets so I have a solution to call the other guy to do it instead. Oh wait I have to urgently call someone at the otherwise of the warehouse since I'm lazy to, I'll just tell the other person to do it for me.


I wonder if any of you experience the same stuff from people at higher positions in your workplace. This is the problem of being in a more higher position at work to take advantage of things at your convenience.

My plan is to, when 18, get into a part time job and save up for a van so I can live in that instead of being in an apartment and living the stressful life of constantly needing to pay rent. 

My parents are poor and living off of benefits and financial aid. I've seen the crap the financial system does. 

I've already built up skills such as hand washing my own clothes, cleaning myself without using a shower, etc etc. I also have pretty decent street smarts.

I would appreciate knowing, what other skills should I build?  May I have some tips? I ask with humility "
125,3,"I have a job doing office work that requires me to be able to lift 50lbs, to load a product that we sell onto people’s vehicles. On my first day I dislocated my shoulder lifting that product. I’m familiar with dislocations so I sort of twisted it back and I kept it quiet as long as I could and continued to try and lift product but my shoulder hasn’t healed properly (I didn’t have insurance of course, nor did I have the money to just go to the doctor). Yes, it really hurt and continues to hurt very badly still. I do not have full movement of my arm, it’s more than mildly frustrating. 


Eventually I saw a doctor who has informed me that due to a disease I have, I’ll never be able to safely lift that kind of weight and that frankly it was pretty surprising I’d never dislocated my shoulders earlier in my life. I now have a doctor’s note to limit the weight I lift in to my management. The problem is when I was hired it was listed as a requirement that I be able to do this lifting. I honestly thought I could, none of my previous doctors had warned me about lifting weight, because at the time I was so sick that it was inconceivable that I’d ever even try. In the years between being sick / diagnosed and now, I got a lot better and did a lot to improve my body’s capabilities. Since I’d gotten so much better, and had been doing regular exercise, I thought I’d be able to lift weight. I knew it would be hard at first, but I thought I’d just get stronger until it was easy, like all the other work I’d put into my body. 


Now I’m about to have my 90-day review. Should I be concerned with losing my job for this? I suppose they can get rid of me for any reason they choose, right? I didn’t lie because I really didn’t know, but I can tell this is hugely inconvenient to them and that they’re disappointed. 


*Adding my familiarity with dislocations is because my hips dislocate and have all my life. I also dislocated my thumb once.  Every time, I have just moved in such a way that I fix it myself. I’ve since (since I started exercising) strengthened my hips so much that they haven’t dislocated in a couple of years. Nobody ever told me what exercises I should focus on or avoid. I haven’t been monitored by a doctor since 2021 due to a variety of reasons, mostly because I hadn’t had insurance coverage until now. No doctors ever actually explained why my hips dislocate, I just knew it as a fact of life for my body. When I was younger I thought everybody’s hips did that. 



I live in Minnesota. "
126,3,"Thinking about my previous position I held for a few months before I couldn’t tolerate it, why are people in jobs they don’t enjoy?

I’ll share the story: I was hired for a smaller company, still quite large nationally but the office/warehouse I was apart of was relatively new (maybe 2-3 years) and a smaller team than our next closest base of operations.

My hiring manager contacted me after the person she hired flaked after 2 days and said it wasn’t for them, I was a second choice.

Granted I wasn’t in a position to decline and I genuinely liked the job, I learned fast and I had a good understanding of the role a month in.

In this workplace there was a couple in a relationship, while they were in different “areas” they still had a lot of communication about their work as she was the purchasing “manager” and he was the warehousing “manager” - both not fit to do either job imo and I’ll share why.

She was hired because the branch manager (the 1 person overseeing everything) knew her family, she was a hairdresser before being given that job. She had also expressed how much she hated her trainer who was stationed at the next closest base of operations.

Her boyfriend the warehouse manager, wasn’t terrible at his job but lacked people skills and would get frustrated and angry at the smallest inconvenience. I believe they got together and met while working there, they had just got a puppy and were living together when I was hired.

The warehouse manager had someone fired for “sexual misconduct” and I found that really difficult to believe, it wasn’t my business but apparently they had video of this driver being inappropriate? I never saw the video but in all my interactions with the drivers.. this one in particular was a grandfather and always super pleasant, he would buy cookies for his grandkids from us. I remember a few brief conversations about dealings with the warehouse manager and he would just say his name like this: “let me guess.. him?” And I would just nod. It’s like everyone KNEW his behaviour was awful and treated everyone terribly but no one would speak up about it.

My hiring manager (customer service manager and QA) hired me, trained me and told me she was leaving 4 months into me working there. I was devastated because deep down I knew it would turn to shit with her gone. She had told me she had some beef with the purchasing and warehouse manager previously, it was awkward at times. 

The branch manager hired a replacement for her (after me raising my hand saying I would take over the QA role since I had been training in it and we just had the big audit) — the replacement was a wife of someone who used to work there. She was given zero direction, spent a week at the closest branch but I felt like she didn’t learn anything at all. She sat there at her desk while I and the other customer service person handled everything.

She used to be a business owner (cafe) and had worked at the hospital as a receptionist so I thought maybe she would pick it up quickly but it became evident no one was giving her any direction. She would sit at her desk all day drawing in a notebook, on her phone when the boss wasn’t looking, not answering the phone or emails.

I took it upon myself to give her some direction, I had created a manual of basic commands for the system but she was a 1 finger typer, terrible at typing and zero awareness.

I left shortly after she was hired, not only was I met with utter disgust every time I interacted with the purchasing and warehouse manager, the new manager who was supposed to be managing me was.. talking behind my back? I had overheard her talking with the purchasing manager about me and that was the final straw.

It took such a toll on my mental health that I’m still suffering nearly a year later. 

They were miserable, they clearly hated their jobs but were there to get paid.. zero enjoyment zero happiness nothing. I was hated for no reason, I still can’t understand it, I was always nice and friendly towards everyone but I think it was because of their previous beef with my hiring manager that they had a dislike for me, guilty by association kind of deal.

TLDR; miserable couple made people quit, everyone knew they were awful, high turnover, branch manager turned a blind eye to it all, mental health suffered couldn’t work there any longer, 1 year later still suffering. 




"
127,3,"So, a few hours ago a 15 minute meeting popped onto my calendar for tomorrow. I think that's what they in the business call foreshadowing. 

A little back story, I've been on a PIP for the last several months. Why so long, a requirement was a class that I couldn't get into for a month. And the other major requirement was to pass a certification.

Add the second time taking the test... and failing. I should have taken the day off. Got pulled into a meeting.

I've finally passed the certification on the third try.

So, tomorrow I'll find out if the PIP is completed,  extended or I'm gone.

FYI
 I work for one team but I report to a different manager. And there's a new guy. Probably my replacement. Knows several of the older employees. 

I'm chronically sick for a medical condition. Because of the PIP requiring me to move out of one office to another, I injured myself. Still have abdominal issues. WC has been denied. So I can't just walk away.

I've been looking for work, but damn is it rough out there.

Wish me luck tomorrow. 

I should have left last year. The year before that.
Two years before that.

I'm ready for this to be over.


Update: not fired. But I don't have the paperwork from HR that they want signed either. So I'm not sure I'm out of the woods."
128,3,"I'm only 21, first year in Uni. Lately I've felt like I've been working too much and living less. I want to enjoy life, travel, make friends, focus on Uni, but it's hard when you're working every fucking day. But that's what life is all about isn't it? I feel like I've signed my life away to my dickhead boss and miserable workplace when I should be out pursuing entrepreneurship and experiencing being young. But money is the main concern. Anyway, if I do chase this magical life will I be alright? I do have rent to pay, only 460 a fortnight though"
129,3,"Yep had him drop me off at home in the middle of the day. Shitty working conditions shitty pay, shitty job. "
130,3,"I think I posted semi-recently about the shit show at my job and turns out we both agreed that I didn’t want to be there and they fired me by phone and mailed me a termination letter. If I’ve earned termination I can be honest about it but it feels like this has been scheming in the background for months.

My actual direct manager went to another location to help with their program and her boss filled in. For the first two months at the job I received stellar feedback, no complaints, and praise from clients and leadership. But suddenly I was not meeting standards and disappointing.

I was called into a random meeting where I was given a “memo of concern” with some vague bullshit that couldn’t be quantified and I asked them too, they were unable to. The boss brought in one of his close friends to “help” and take over some of the duties and a week after, I was out.

I worked adults with disabilities and worked hard to build relationships with them and provide the support they needed. It’s indicative of the rot within this whole system that nepotism and backhanded scheming comes before the good of the clients who rely on programs like this.

Good riddance I guess but I’m out of work for the time being."
131,3,"First they overwork you...which makes you not have energy to do things you enjoy like hobbies/relationships and makes you overrely on cheap instant gratification, which makes you spend more. "
132,3,"I worked at my job for the last 10 years and the level of incompetence in handling the last month is really stunning.  A couple weeks ago they let go about 21 people, citing that there wasn't enough work to keep the staff we had.  This is despite sales being up and the stock price going up.  The executives told the rest of the company they were going to get a new contract to generate new work and had plans for an entire new division of the company.

Fast forward to yesterday.  In the morning I was given the heads up that the contract didn't happen and everyone (including me) who was going to move to the new division is being let go today.  This morning an email was sent out to those that are being cut telling them that today is their last day.  The kicker?  I didn't even get the email to let me know I'm being let go.  Fired by email but not even important enough to actually send me the email.  I called my boss and she said she wasn't sure why I didn't get the email but to just assume I've been terminated.  Between the first round a couple weeks ago and this round (I think today was about 30 people) that is about 25% of the entire company.

I logged off and took my son to the park.  Now to try to pick up the pieces of my life."
133,3,"My coworker and I rant to each other multiple times a week about how aggravating our situation currently is. In the last 2 years, our team size was cut in half so the company could reduce costs, and we’ve absorbed all of the work without more than a basic COL raise each year. 

Things also changed over a year ago when someone on our team was promoted and became our manager, because our other manager got promoted too. We miss that old manager, because the new one has changed things so much. 

We are fully remote, and used to have weekly meetings and he switched us to daily. DAILY. He spends time compiling a report every morning of stats we all have access to, because he wants to read them out loud to us.

But 70% of our meetings are usually spent with him talking at us about things that don’t affect us, trying to make small talk about our personal lives/weekend plans, and the rest is him trying to make us laugh and waiting for any kind of reaction while we just stare at him.

He’s trying way too hard to force that “family” feeling, while knowing we are fed up with being overworked, underpaid and all the other things that are unfairly expected of us. He’s trying to mask how shitty things are with humor and forced positivity. I can’t stand it.

We’re being forced to work over Fourth of July weekend because of some event happening he wants us to be online for. We’re prob the only people in corporate America working over a federal holiday weekend so that’s killed my enthusiasm even more. 

He also messages me randomly throughout the day to talk about things completely unrelated to work and I feel like it’s because he knows I’m checked out. Like he literally messages me about the weather. I just one-word him every time. 

I really want to ask for a 1:1 with my old manager and tell them that our daily meetings are not a productive use of my time when we have so much other stuff to do, and I want to tell my current manager that I don’t care to engage with him about the weather or his dog or house or anything that doesn’t have to do with work.

134,3,"Hello all. I think I just want to vent. I need help. I'm not considering anything drastic but I am the lowest I have ever been and it's because of my job. I'm not in a position to quit, financially and or because of the world rn. I'm a marketing manager who was suckered into this job and I'm doing all the things I don't want to do. And I'm so effing capable to do more, but I'm doing the same things over and over for 5 years, and NO ONE wants to hire me to do what I'm passionate about (account management). Maybe I'm being picky by not taking entry level somewhere but damn it already did that. And I just missed out on an EASY job because I was too proud and didn't want to compromise stagnancy. I'm crushed and don't know what you do. I don't have one of those graphs but I've eaily applied to 400 jobs in the last 3 months and got one phone interview. I'm a proficient property manager of 5 years. I just can't do this anymore. Any advice I know that was spiraling.

I’m looking for suggestions on how to make the split as professional on my part as possible as I have never actually quit a job before. 

Note, none of the communication occurs through email. Only text and phone call. "
139,3,"TL;DR at the bottom.

I've been fuming about this for a few days now. I work in product development at a small-ish sized company (BARELY triple digits, only a literal handful in my department, most others are manufacturing/packaging).

I've been heading the development of a new product for our company. I've done 90% of the work so far; this involves literally all of the designing, prototyping, testing, working with outside vendors to have parts made, documentation including spec sheets, instructions, BOM's, etc etc. To say that I have some stake & responsibility over in this product is an understatement. The other day, my boss hosted a huge customer- inustry defining in our country even, and wanted to have a presentation on this product. The product takes 4 people to operate- well, he explicitly excluded me and had three coworkers in my department (who all have a a comparatively imited understanding of the product) give the full presentation, along with a random guy temporarily pulled from another department. None of this was communicated to me- I had to freaking overhear my coworkers talking about it, and when I asked why I wasn't being included in this and they were instead pulling some random dude to fill my spot, my coworkers didn't know.

Before I continue I need to explain some roles. There's my manager who's pretty chill, and then there's my boss- who's also the CEO. Let me frame this for you: he's your stereotypical rich guy who goes off on island vacations for weeks at a time, and then struts back in barking orders like he hasn't been gone a day. He mico manages the literal smallest of details for like 1-2 days, and then disappears for another month. He does this constantly- I reckon out of 260 work days in a year, he's here maybe 30-40 of them, and only for a few hours each day usually. He's also a huge narcissist with raging ADHD, and has been known to punch holes in walls or throw chairs if you challenge him on anything. Quite the character.

So I spoke to my manager beforehand and asked why I wasn't being included- and he didn't even know, the list of people to give the presentation came from the boss with no explanation. A day later he pulled me into his office and gave me a light ""talking to,"" where he described how best to interact with the boss. Essentially, something about me triggers the boss's ADHD and makes it hard for him to focus, so he didn't want me around.

I find this all very disrespectful towards me. The issue with me triggering his ADHD is one thing- he could TALK to me about that so we're on the same page, or at least fill my manager in so he could talk to me. But no, instead nobody says a thing to me at all and I need to overhear my coworkers to learn that I'm the only one being explicitly left out on my own freaking projects presentation? I get that it's his company so what he says goes, but the complete and utter lack of communication surrounding my own project is so rude. Even better, after interacting with the product again (the design of which he has already personally looked at and approved), he called several small hiccups ""massive fucking failures"" and had my coworker start creating new tasks in the project folder of our task management software- without ever talking to me about that, either.

Have any of you experienced stuff like this? He and I have never fought, and actually have some pretty nice conversations when we talk. I thought we got a long pretty well, and he's seemed normal & nice since the presentation, although we only exchanged a few sentences about mundane stuff like the weather. 

TL;DR My boss had everybody in my department except me give a presentation to a massive customer on the project I'm in charge of and have been almost exclusively (90% of work done by me) working on for 3 years now, explicitly excluding me with no communication whatsoever. I learned about it by overhearing my coworkers."
140,3,"I was hired exactly 3 years ago to launch a project that has still not started, due to intense micro management. In the interim, I have received 4 projects that had not yet been started well into the no-cost extension period which I have somehow successfully completed for the team.

I received my annual review last week. My supervisor let me know that he had concerns about “pot stirring” and accused me of “people coming to him telling him I said things that were not true.” I have no idea what he’s talking about so I ask him to explain and he gestures vaguely at the empty desk of a former coworker who left last October. He said 1) he’s comfortable sharing now that she no longer works here, 2) cannot remember any examples off the top of his head, 3) left his notebook with examples in his office, and 4) was intentionally being vague to protect people’s identities. 

After 15 minutes he references one meeting two weeks ago where I made small talk at the beginning of the meeting and he sent me a slack message saying “this meeting is more business fyi.” I was asking a dude about his grandkids. I told him I went back to watch the recording because I was surprised I misinterpreted so differently. He responded, “Oh good, what did you think? Self-reflection is the best form of feedback.”

He’s told the entire office (including 65 year old office coordinator) three times that we need to be quiet. We sit silently in the office. He did praise me for being better with my volume and for being more concise. In general it feels like he just wants me to be quiet, seen and not heard.

Don’t worry! He ended the review telling me we are still friends outside of work (idk why he thinks this) and I should still be myself.

I have a conflict-intensive job, where corrective feedback is frequently given to partners we work with. I am somehow given latitude to continue giving corrective feedback to partners when he isn’t not present, yet incapable of making small talk in meetings where he is present. 

I’m losing my mind. My husband is trying to help us figure out our finances so I can leave. I’ve applied to 5 jobs in the last week."
141,3,"I am an electrical student at a trade school, and am anticipated for graduation this September. But due to perosnal goals and circumstances, I want to get a job sooner to get a headstart and move to Philadelphia near the job. 

So I had an interview for apprenticeship! After taking a few quizzes associated with the field, I finally got to talk to the boss. He was a total jerk and very loud! When I told him about my desire to live in Philadelphia, he tried to scare me, saying 700 people died last year, and tried to get me to do the math on how many died per day! Worst of all, he told me the pay is $14 an hour, not much different from my current dead-end job!

I feel sad, because I always thought this kind of job would pay $23+ an hour, and the major reason I presued electrical was to get a good paying job that will allow me to move into my own place away from abusive family!"
142,3,"Quitting my cheap coffee job if they didnt already fire me. Poor management. Im new, and I've already been shit talked behind my back by my managers for not knowing how to do something I havent done (grown adults, btw).

My manager has gaslit and emotionally manipulated me into believing everything is my fault when I have other coworkers with the same responsibilities. I do as they say and what I'm not explicitly told, and I was still getting the hang of it.

They give ZERO real training and then get pissed when you aren't 100% in a total of a week.

Today, I was told that I was ""wasting hours"" and got sent home. No idea what I did besides be used as the scapegoat, again, and have a worse day than usual. Don't forget the favortism! My coworkers didnt like me from the start. Attitudes, all day. It costs 0 dollars to not be a piece of shit, but it's difficult for lots of people.

143,3,"I posted this in another subreddit but I am not sure if it belongs here. 

After about 8 years in, I think I am completely checked out of working! I am completely burnt out! I have been calling in sick one or two days a month and I just don't really care anymore.

The daily meetings. The projects after projects after projects and the micromanaging is killing me. I'm at a point where I am about to throw in the towel, sell my house and live life on the road. Perhaps create a YouTube channel and document my travels, who knows.

My debts are the only thing that's preventing me from doing so. I have a huge $130k student loan that is killing me.

I also have Autism and have a tendency to get overstimulated by certain sensory input.

I’m currently working underneath a speaker which is really annoying because they turned it up while I was off. I was getting overstimulated so I said I was going on break.

Our new manager (NM) is definitely a corporate type. I don’t think I need to explain what I mean by that here.

So she cut me off and said “you’ll do x task before you go right?” And I said “No, I’m going on break” and she said she hadn’t taken a break or lunch and that she’d love to since she’s been here since 5 in the morning and that I will do the task before I go. This would’ve taken 10 minutes and pushed me overboard into meltdown/shutdown territory btw.

Then someone mentioned that the speaker was loud and she said she felt bad because I am standing right under it. And I said “That’s actually why I’m going on break.” and walked off.

148,3,"Hello all!

I quit a job (company A) in March due to the company being extremely unorganized and my boss being out for a few months due to a major surgery. Everything was chaotic and we received no help from corporate. I'd been there for a year. It was great when I started, but the company grew exponentially in that time and they were NOT prepared in any way for it. Several of us left at the same time. 

In April, I started a new job (Company B) that I was excited about. However, the training was AWFUL and they just threw us on the phones AT A BANK CALL CENTER. I did not feel comfortable with it - began having anxiety attacks and was not the only one that left due to the lack of training. This was not good for me and threw me into some type of depression and burnout. I then was finally diagnosed with autism and it's been quite rough. I was there for just a few weeks.

I just got a referral for a WFH position. My friends are telling me to just say I still currently work for Company A. However, Company B uses The Work Number. 

Should I instead make something up for the gap? Should I even put Company B? I'm so confused at what to do. This year has been awful, and I feel like these two jobs are really going to screw me over on getting a new job that is actually stable and organized.

Does anyone have any advice?"
149,3,"I worked for a clinic making orthopedic lower limb orthotic braces for a year, I have 13 years of experience in the field, mostly making scoliosis braces. My direct supervisor told me I was the best tech he had ever had. That the wall of braces had never been so clear because he usually has to do more touch up work after the techs make them. I even had parents tell me they never had braces so nice before.

I loved this job! I love helping kids! It was 4/10s, no schedule changes, they bought us lunch almost every week, but the pay sucked. Its one of the largest companies that is constantly absorbing smaller ones.

I have severe mental illness, PTSD, depression, and anxiety/panic attacks. I started only working 32 hours a week because I was really bad off and would have to leave early. My supervisor had not a care in the world because the work was being done to high standards, I kept everything stocked, did basic building maintenance. Some days I would ask to leave early or was told to leave early because I literally was so far ahead I had nothing to do. The volume of work was half of what I was used to at my previous company.

Then his supervisor starts making a fuss that I dont work a full 40, so I apply for FMLA. They basically pushed me out of the door, so I went to my old company I hate for a pretty decent raise of $23 to $27.50. The clinicians never worked a full 8 hours but they were salary so its not tracked when they leave for the day.

In what world do we live in that ""the best tech we've had"" gets reprimanded for working the needed amount of hours? The position has sat open for 18 months now, it was open for 2 years before me, because they dropped the pay back to $15/hr (LMAO). I was denied a raise based solely on my hours worked. Why do that to themselves over 8 hours that isn't needed and there is no work to fill the time?"

151,3,"Every day, from Monday to Saturday, I wake up, I attend work, get bossed around, borderline verbal and psychological abuse and all. It isn't like I'm just saying that to elicit sympathy either. My boss takes people from my division into her office and intimidates them with the threat of reduced hours and pay. This has happened to me and others on innumerable occasions. 

We are forced to stay behind after hours in order to attend meeting which can sometimes range from 2-3 hours, making the 8-5 an 8-8. We don't get paid for those hours, and stupid as it seems, the company contracts state that we will only be paid for trading hours. I am driven out of my mind, because I can't even do anything to prevent this. The first time I tried going home because I wasn't being paid for these meetings, and I was almost firing on the spot.

The worst but is: it is a manual labouring job. As far as I'm concerned, no man, dead or alive wants to be held up after work and be forced to listen to the insessent yapping of a woman who lives the sound of her own voice.

What's your advice?"
152,3,"So, we've been having a slow season at the hotel I work at, and the AGM who originally took our chairs away (due to them being a fire hazard among other random reasons she gave us) was kind enough to let me start sitting again during my shift. This was very kind of her, and I even told her ""Thanks, this is so nice."". Well, apparently, she wasn't letting any other employees sit, and others found out. The other employees themselves didn't care, but another MANAGER argued with the AGM because second shift isn't allowed to sit. Again, I had no clue she wasn't letting anyone else sit, I thought she was trying to phase the chairs back in for everyone.

Well, yesterday morning, I come in and the AGM starts yelling at me about the chair situation, she doesn't take me into the office, she does this at the front desk, in front of guests. This AGM is younger than me, and the whole situation was embarrassing, so I had to step away for a while as I truthfully was in tears, I really hate being yelled at, especially in front of others. This AGM said that I was bragging about the chair and that now no one can sit at all anymore at the desk because of me. She said I also grabbed a chair on a day when she herself wasn't there and no one had given me permission, I corrected her and said I had asked Manager B for the chair and that Manager B had said sure, no prob. AGM says ""Fine."". I told her I had no idea I was the only one allowed to sit, and she shut it all down with ""Well now the chairs are gone across the board.""

She also fussed at me for dealing with a guest who was basically a no show the first night. The guest called, I answered, she told me she'd be arriving the next morning and if she'd be charged for the night. I told her when she got here her room would still be ready for her, and if she talked to management they might be chill enough to see what could be done about the first night's charge, I didn't guarantee ANYTHING, and then transferred her to Manager B. AGM fusses at me for modifying the reservation because it was a red rate, I did NOT modify the reservation, you can check the OPERA change logs and see that clearly. I tried to explain this to her, as well as how I transferred the guest to Manager B, but the AGM interrupted with ""Let me finish."" and continued to berate me. Manager B had put in her notes everything about this guest interaction, and it all backs up everything I'm saying.

Now, while AGM is getting on me, the lobby has guests, and I know they can hear it all, and they had their phones up and out. I am so very embarrassed, not even about what she said, but how she said it. I know they'd (AGM and GM) had just gotten done talking to a problem overnight manager in the office and that she had left, so the office was empty, AGM could've had this talk with me in the office, or in a conference room, anywhere but in front of guests. And at this point, there's a review on our google page mentioning the reprimanding.

I'm just really...humiliated by the whole thing. I'm an adult and don't need to be talked to that way to understand my mistakes. I'm really starting to hate working at the Shmoliday Shminn. "
153,3,"So I hate my job mostly due to the management and lack of structure/guidance. I genuinely feel like the boss is trying to get rid of me because they nitpick everything I do. There is obvious favoritism and my boss is so bitchy that I can’t stand them and they give me massive anxiety. I literally am anxious to go to work every day, because I literally think, what’s gonna happen today mentality. One day I was venting to a coworker about another rude coworker and someone heard me bitching and essentially reported me. I was asked to write a statement of what was said, sign it/notarize it, and send to hr. I’m like wtf I have no advocate because everyone has complained about this coworker and their attitude, and nothings been done. They are incredibly rude and hard to work with. 

I interviewed at my friends job and was offered the job. I just don’t have a start date yet, but it’s mostly likely going to be early July according to my future boss. I’m am also trying to burn off all my pto before I submit my resignation. 

My question is, should I write the letter or say eff it and quit? No one has asked for the letter yet.  Thanks! "
154,3,"I hate the way bosses terminate employees so dramatically, scheduling humiliating meeting with far too many unnecessary third parties that are delayed at the end of your work day so youre on edge all day long thinking about it. I honestly feel it’s done this way intentionally to pressure employees to crack and quit first so they don’t have to offer severance or deal with the other related costs of termination. It feels like a weird psychological game to weaken and degrade our personal fortitude and make a show of frightening and shaming us to our coworkers. I hate it. If they want us to leave calmly and quietly, they don’t need to be so fucking dramatic with the in person meetings and nonsense. Especially in my state where it is at will. Why make me come in at all. Fucking stupid "
155,3,"I wish I knew this before I joined, but my job that pays me 1 salary, is the job of 3-4 different roles. And I’m expected to just take it all on the chin with a smile on my face. 

Project Manager, Sales Director, Executive Admin and Taxes/Bookkeeper all in 1. I took this job because I was in a tough place both mentally and financially and was promised that I would make 6 figures and would get commission. Guess what, I’m not! I’ve made pennies in commission since joining last year. 

I am working multiple roles at once and it’s actually exhausting. I never receive praise or bonuses, I just get more work put on me. I also don’t have any more vacation time for this year because I was given a week and I already took it for a family trip. 

My boss has a nasty attitude and overreacts to everything and anything that comes his way. I am constantly walking on eggshells and have so much anxiety when I’m in the office. 

This company consists of me, my boss, his daughter, and 3 other employees that my boss actively talks shit about. I truly wonder what he says about me when I’m not there. But based on what I hear about my coworkers, it’s probably really mean. 

I guess I don’t know why I’m writing this but to express that I feel so stuck. I have so much potential and I feel like I’m wasting my life at this job. I’ve been applying to other jobs but nothing has stuck, this market is horrible.

Looking for advice from people who understand my perspective❣️"
156,3,"My team's interview process is insane. Recently a candidate flew in from Turkey to interview for a position (not even a senior or exec level), the interview was scheduled the day after they landed, which was today. It was an ENTIRE day long interview. First, a 6-person panel presenting their project which took them a week to make, that lasted for about 4 hours, an hour lunch with our team manager, then two, back-to-back hour-long interviews with other members of the team.

Like what the hell, and then to hear my manager say, ""oh wow they must be soo tired from the jet lag today"".  Like??? a virtual interview wasn't enough and you're putting this candidate through a 7-hour long interview process for a DAY and then they are supposedly leaving tonight on another 13-hr flight back to turkey that the company is probably not paying for, so exploitative even on day 1."
157,3,"I know this subreddit is against working but I have a more positive post this time around. I'm glad to be losing my current job. The reason being, the manager is a total psychopath is getting violent and harassing ""bad employees"" about their ""poor performance."" If you want context, people being forgetful at like 8 hours and forgetting to add a drink to an order or something, that's enough to make him flip his shiz. I'm glad I'm not gonna be working there for much longer cause he's trying to get me fired. I'm going to be moving on with my life and his whack ass will still be working there when I am miles away and much happier. Hope you all have as good of a day as I am, and take care of yourself."
158,3,"I went in for an interview today for a job I have 6-7 years of experience in. The job listing said the minimum pay was 50k, which I’d have been fine with starting out. 

These absolute douche-canoes offer me 30k a year with shit-eating smiles on their faces like they’re Moses parting the Red Sea for me.

What a massive waste of time and gigantic red flag. Wonder why you all are looking for employees? 🤦‍♂️ 

Would love to hear any stories you all have to share regarding similar experiences.

159,3,"So Monday, I was throwing up at 2am until 5am, messaged my work to try and put in a sick request that my state made a law this year, but it was denied because two people put in PTO. I showed up clearly unable to do anything so I was sent home with a writeup. I get home and rest, then put in another PTO request for the next day, knowing I will need it, and it gets approved a few hours later. My car broke down on the way to work, so I called my supervisor to inform them. Then, I was told HR needed to discuss my employment because of my write-up and was a ""no call no show"" on the day my PTO was approved. When I told them about my PTO they said it's company policy to approve no shows if their request was submitted. There was no indication I wasn't going to show up other than my time off being approved, nobody tried to contact me, it was approved the day prior. So now I'm completely unaware of my employment status I've already contacted three employment law attorneys to see what I can do. I desperately want to put these fuckers if you look at my previous posts in the past year you'll see the horse shit I've been putting up with but I'd rather have legal council before I pull the trigger."
160,3,"The anger over this has been building, so might be a long one, apologies.

In my job, we have certain targets we're supposed to reach for certain things. Sending a certain number of emails each day is the main one we focus on as that's the main part of our job. I currently have reduced targets due to migraines, which I've suffered with my entire life. It means I can take more breaks away from the screen and then not stress and panic about catching up with everyone else.

However, our workplace has been the quietest I've ever seen it this year. Tax year end is usually the busiest time of year, but people were being sent home early this year, which is insane. It's just never picked up again since. Because of this, there isn't much for everyone to do, and the targets of so many emails per day is really hard to reach.

Originally our managers stated that the quiet period wouldn't affect us and no one would be negatively impacted by the lower number of emails being sent. But then, the next week, I had a meeting scheduled to discuss my low number of emails being sent. I was so mad and spoke to some colleagues about it. Other colleagues also had low numbers but weren't having meetings with their managers so I tried to figure out why I was going through this process but was just told 'you haven't reached targets for a few weeks, and records say you should have been able to' over and over.

The system we use means we have to ask for emails, then someone else gives them to us to complete. Currently, if they're with us for more than 2 hours and it's really quiet, the emails then get moved to someone else as the theory is, they'll be able to sort them right away (even though we might just be getting to them so it makes no difference).

I hate this method because
1. People who start earlier are able to do more emails due to the fact that our clients send most emails in the evenings and overnight when we're closed. By the time the later shift starts, the boxes are at a third of their starting number and there's 5 times as many people asking for work to do.
2. It means that, if I get an email that requires a bit of investigation or talking with other teams, that takes up more time and then suddenly the rest of my allocation gets moved to someone else and I'm at the back of the queue again.
3. Colleagues who usually work on the phones are being given time on emails due to how quiet it is. We've all complained about this, but they're sticking to it. Phone colleagues aren't always fully trained on email queries, so a lot of the time, we end up cleaning up their messes where they've sent the wrong information or ignored clients specific questions to just send general information because it's easier. We used to send any second queries from clients back to the original handler of the email, but we can't do that with phone colleagues as they might be on the phones, so now we're just dealing with more annoyed clients for no real reason.

A fair few people have complained about the handling of all this and it's just kind of being shrugged off as 'bitterness' due to not being able to reach targets themselves, but the only people I've seen that are able to consistently reach targets are part of a specific team that has managed to stay busy. I'm trained in a few different departments, so luckily I'm able to float between what emails I'm answering, but even then it's hard to reach target, so the colleagues only trained in one area are really not doing well. 

I managed to get my numbers back on track and received a little 'thanks for getting back to target' message from a manager, but the only reason I was able to sort it out was because the person in charge of emails remembered I was trained in a certain area which happened to be busy.

Since then, everywhere has gotten quiet again and numbers have gone down. It's basically been a repeat of the above, our manager stated last week 'numbers are down, but we're not getting many emails so it is what it is' and then today, my manager messaged me to state that I haven't been reaching target and need to fix it. It just pisses me off because they admit it's quiet but then ask what WE can do to bring numbers up?! I can't make our clients send in more emails, and I'm not gonna do a shitty job so that we get more responses.

And another thing, it feels like before this year, our managers were begging us to get all our inboxes to 0 or as low as possible, but now because we've done that, we're being punished because there's nothing for us to do? Can't have it both ways bud, be careful what you wish for i guess!

The really annoying thing is, this is stressing me out so much during the week that most weekends I'm not doing much because I have a migraine, so I'm resting! I just hate that it's taking over like this and I wanted to rant to people that will hopefully understand🫠"
161,3,"Update: He fired me on Friday the 13th. Lmao. Just in time for the busy season. I said, ""Good luck,"" and my unemployment claim is on the way. 

-----------

In the last few months, I've been getting increasingly frustrated with my work situation. Most of the people who work there have been there for 5+ years and they do everything they can to push any problem along so they don't have to deal with it. It's the most ""that's not my job"" kind of place I've ever worked.

For example, in my role, our main goal is to complete contracts (simplifying for post). There were about 45 when I started today (8a) and more came in through the day. There were 3 employees on shift.

One of the employees prefers a different task that is very busy at this time of year and she's been there for 15+ years, so she typically spends her time on that. I would be willing to help (and I am trained), but she's weirdly territorial about it. So she is effectively not there. The other employee mostly just sits on their phone all day.

Today, I completed 48 contracts. When I left, the other employee had completed 6. Maybe an hour before I left, my supervisor sent a message that he was disappointed that some contracts had yet to be completed and implied that I was slacking.

I feel like I did more than my share of work and now it's the other employee's turn, but I'm told that it's the main goal of my position and it needs to be finished first. So, basically I'm hearing that I should just complete everything and let them fuck around for the whole day.

There is an element of customer service and almost every one of our customers are angry. I'm so tired of feeling defeated every day. It's even more depressing that this pay is better than I was making while licensed in the medical field. So, I guess I'll just do everyone's work and stay mad. 🙃"
162,3,"Title. I don't really feel the desire to go into too much detail, but basically I love the work I'm doing and the company I work for has been really good to me. A handful of months ago I changed shifts and since then going to work has become a nightmare, when I used to genuinely look forward to it.

My supervisor is a massive asshole who treats everyone like morons and seems to have singled me out in particular, when even now I'm still pretty new (less than a year). He frequently makes racist, misogynistic and derogatory comments about people, as well. It's at the point where I've started drinking heavily and falling into a depression. My concern is that where I haven't gone to HR about this yet, if he makes enough of a stink, I'll get fired before I can do anything.

I've come up with a plan and could use some input:

Apply for new jobs. Line something up with a start date, giving me time for a 2 week notice. Go to HR with my concerns, requesting the discussion in writing to cover my ass. If they refuse to give me anything in writing, I know they won't investigate it and to jump ship, so I'll put my 2 weeks in and start the new job. If I get something in writing, stay but continue applying for other jobs just in case, until the issue is resolved.

Thoughts?"
163,3,"I was just browsing in another sub (petty revenge, I think), and there was a brief discussion about being irreplaceable at work, thus when you remove yourself and/or your extra effort, you make a statement about your worth (I am absolutely paraphrasing). 

Over the years, I've changed my mind a few times on this question. For awhile, I loved being irreplaceable, knowing that people relied on me, that I could get this project done, then that one. I put my hand up for new tasks all the time, too challenge myself. Then, I embraced being replaceable. Knowing (Hoping?) that I could leave and not create any waves. 

What do you folks think? Where are you at?"
164,3,"I started a job at a company that contacted me months after I interviewed. I began thinking they picked someone else, and that person quit so fast that they went with me after. But I wanted the job and took it and worked for about a week before quitting it was so bad. They didn't put me on the system yet, so the manager was keeping track of my hours. After quitting 2 weeks later, I received a check for just 1 day of work. I've been emailing and calling since to try to get the rest of my pay, but they don't respond or answer the phone. Am I not gonna receive money for the rest of the time I worked? Since I wasn't on the system yet, what can I do? Or is this all I'm getting? "
165,3,"I started a new job 4 months ago. I’ve kept my head down and watched how things work. For 4 months I’ve eaten at my desk and worked through lunch. While watching everyone else, I noted that most people take a 1-2 hour lunch roughly 3 days a week. They also use the company card from the conversations I’ve heard. In hindsight most people doing this are in higher positions than me. 

Well I finally decided to treat myself and go to lunch one day. Just across the street, by myself, something simple to get out of the office. I was gone from the office in total, for 1 hour and 18 minutes (I checked, as this was my first time doing this I wanted to feel it out) 

When I returned my superior asked me where I had been for so long and seemed irritated but not mad. Well, a few hours later he called me into his office and told me I took time off on company time and there would be discipline to follow. 

Fast forward to this morning, I received an email that I will be losing 2 days of PTO. This job has a probationary period where I can’t take time off for the first year anyways. Once I can, I get 5 days of PTO for the first 10 years, 10 days PTO after that. 

They let me know the first PTO day being deducted is to recoup the time the company lost on me, the second day is a disciplinary measure. They will be deducted starting next year, meaning for the next two years I only have 3 days of PTO.

I suppose I’m just venting cus there’s probably nothing I can do about this. 

Edit: for everyone telling me to clarify my allotted lunch time, I have. I asked for it when I started and after the disciplinary incident I asked profusely, as I just wanted a guideline or rule so I knew what to do. 

Their answer was that there is no specific lunch break time. It’s based on the needs of the team that day. Which explains why some days the higher ups take 2 hour lunches, and apparently the team needed me the day I took my first lunch and I was gone for too long causing others to pick up my slack. 

Edit #2: since it’s a common question, I make 80k at this job. I am a civil engineer with a masters in concrete engineering, a very specific and niche degree. After the one year probation period I have the opportunity to negotiate a possible raise. "
166,3,"We are just associates and he was complaining about scheduling saying it's all this other managers fault because she ""just has to have her THERAPY appointment on Monday evenings"" and saying he can't see why she doesn't reschedule. I think he wanted a reaction from us but we didn't say anything. 

I think this is a violation of ADA because she did not disclose this information with us and we work under her. She presents symptoms of a disability/has some visible communication difficulties which all the managers have made fun of or complained about to us. I feel I should let her know or report him because honestly if he is talking to us about this, he is probably telling others too."
167,3,"Today I started what's on paper a very chill job with relatively decent salary and friendly coworkers.

And yet I still don't want to be there.
And this pattern keeps happening to me with all the jobs I had.

I'm starting to accept that maybe some people aren't meant to make money in traditional jobs, maybe I'm suppose to live as a starving artist, a bum hippie or a basement dweller.

But the issue is I'm socially engineered to feel immense shame when I'm not doing something, or when I'm not bringing in a salary.

So it's really a sticky situation to be in."
168,3,"This happened last December, but it's still makes my blood boil thinking about it.

I was out shopping for Christmas presents when my former director accidentally sent a message to a Teams group chat that included me and another manager. It clearly wasn’t meant for me to see.

The next day was supposed to be the company Christmas party, and I had been asked to help out with planning and running some of the events. Even though I didn’t normally work in the office on Fridays, I wanted to make the effort. I had only started the job a couple months earlier and was looking forward to bonding with my new coworkers since we were all never really in the office at the same times.

This all came after I had already helped them automate a lot of their CRM processes and clean up a massive database. In hindsight, that probably led to me automating myself out of a job. I had just left a company I’d been with for nine years, and now this?

I went straight home, drafted an email to HR, and thankfully managed to hold onto the job for another week while they tried to sort things out.

Shortly after I was fired. There was huge layoff, with around 800 people across different departments losing their jobs. The company ended up outsourcing all of those positions to a firm in India

In the end, I only had about a week of downtime before a contracting agency helped me land another job. Still, the whole experience made it really hard to trust the people I work with.

Stay safe and stay sane out there. Wishing you all the best in this messed up world."
169,3,"I'm very pro-worker, and think we have some serious issues in modern day capitalism.

However, conceptually, I'm having trouble grappling with the idea that profits are stolen surplus value.

See, I understand that the argument is that the value that the employee creates minus the cost of their labor is surplus value that is created by them, and thus stolen by investors. However, part of that surplus originates from increased leverage/production from capital investments. The surplus is partially created by the worker, but also greatly increased by investments in equipment, facilities, patents, etc. These investments don't always create a net surplus, and can often lead to losses, but we wouldn't argue that those losses should then be cut from the employees wages.

My thinking is basically that surplus value being stolen labor doesn't account for risk investments have to increase surplus labor. Many businesses incur losses on their capital investments and don't create surplus value, yet still have pay market rate for labor.

I work as a server, and the business is relatively new. The owners were telling me how they've been unprofitable for the past year. That just made me think about how I'm actually currently making more per month than the business owners are just because the money I make is wages. They invested capital in the rent, POS systems, marketing, and equipment costs and are seeing no return on their money. Yet those investments bring in customers that allows me to make hourly wages + tips, and I see none of the risk/downside of that capital. 

What do you think?"

I left 17 days prior to my original notice period. Earlier it was discussed that there is no project impact and I’ll not have to pay anything, but later on, they said that they will not give me the salary for 13 days. I would plus I’ll have to pay some amount to them (13 days salary - 17 days salary) which is over 10000rs for me.

I know this is a common phenomena that happens, but I didn’t knew this, and I discussed this with my manager .

They were discussions going on and then one day I got my experience letter and a letter saying that there are no dues left from my end.

Note - This was from darwinbox but had a pdf attached for experience letter and no dues which had company logo, director’s sign and everything !!

It’s been one month since that, and now they’re calling me back to pay the whole amount. 
Literally called me 16 to 17 times today and threatening me for legal actions. 

Am I legally in danger if I don’t pay? 
Because I have the certificate, which companies should give ideally once the employee doesn’t have any due left.

I’m not being financially, well right now. That’s why I don’t want to pay plus I already have nondues and experience letter in my hand.

I was excited at first — it seemed like a good opportunity, a change from my last role, and I really wanted to settle into something with structure. But since starting, it’s become clear that structure is the one thing this place is seriously lacking.

The training I received was minimal at best. The person who was supposed to train me quit shortly after I started, and no one else really knows how to do her job. The girl “training” me is in 3/5 days and will be on maternity leave in 3 months. So it’s been a lot of guessing, figuring things out on my own, and just doing my best to get invoices processed and keep things moving. I made this clear in my interview that I’m super entry level when it comes to accounting, and they assured me that they would be there to train me. My boss (the owner) is barely around, and the other person who works in the office isn’t involved in what I do. There’s no formal clocking in, no daily oversight, no one really watching what time anyone starts or leaves.

Because of that, I’ve been putting 8 hours on my timecard even though I usually only work around 7 — sometimes less if it’s a slow day. A lot of that time is me waiting for invoices to come in or for someone to respond to my emails so I can move forward. I’ll end up watching YouTube videos or doing non-work stuff on my computer to pass the time. But I still put 8 hours because… no one really checks or cares.

I know it’s dishonest. And I don’t want to be that person. But I also feel like I’m in this weird limbo — undertrained, underutilized, and just trying to make this job work without any direction. I want to do a good job. I want to be busy. But when no one gives you enough to do and no one is holding you accountable, it’s hard not to fall into this “do what everyone else does and coast” kind of mindset.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? I don’t know if I should feel guilty or if this is just the reality in some small companies. Would appreciate any advice or perspective.

179,3,"I applied to a bunch of places near me. The only one that responded was a fast food restaurant who set up an interview. Went there at the agreed upon time, and there was another interview finishing up, so I waited a few minutes. Afterward the manager came up to me and rescheduled the interview (5 minutes after it was supposed to start) because they ran out of stock or something. Got there at the new time, only for the employees to tell me the manager wasn't there at the time and I had to wait. After waiting in the restaurant for an hour, the manager never came out, so I went back to speak to the employees. I stood by the counter for 20 minutes, but no one ever talked to me, so I just went home with no interview. I wonder why they're short staffed?"
180,3,"This article discusses the Reorganizing Government Act of 2025 legislation and, unusually, how activists can respond all out. [MSN](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/gop-bill-would-legalize-doge-and-let-trump-dismantle-everything/ar-AA1G5jwC) and [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/gop-bill-legalize-doge-let-142938489.html) posted paywall-free versions of this *Rolling Stone* article; [extra material](https://douglaslucas.com/blog/2025/06/04/extra-material-rollingstone-reorganizing-government-act/) on the author's blog.

Curious what this subreddit makes of the article's call to action: ""we have to build alternative community and governance structures to replace the rapidly collapsing ones. The neo-fascist-monarchist ideologues think they have a replacement ready, but they are just lazily recycling ideas we already fought against and won. If we beat them to implementation, we can create a new system that works for everyone. We must accelerate and diversify opposition actions quickly - while ensuring it is them who are paralyzed with shock and dread.""

I like the acknowledgment of *everyone* as the participants in good governance, including people who don't, or don't want to, fit into the financial/employment system. Curious what this sub thinks."
181,3,"About 9 months ago I took a crane stabilizer bar to the head at work due to a known issue with the safety interlocks on overhead cranes. It resulted in a trip to the ER and 5 staples in my skull. Everyone on site knew this was a long-standing hazard. The fix was known, cheap, and straightforward, but the company refused to spend the money or authorize overtime to get it done.

That same equipment is still in use across over 20 presses. Nothing changed.

Fast forward to now. After they laid off several people and shuffled the remaining staff around, I got stuck with a 12-hour overnight shift that I had explicitly told them I couldn’t do as a single parent. It felt like they were trying to force me out, so I decided if I was going out, I wasn’t going quietly.

I filed an OSHA complaint and started handing out flyers off the clock in break areas with info about working conditions, pay stagnation, layoffs, and safety concerns. Management completely lost it. My supervisor yelled at me in front of coworkers, threatened to send me home, and started pulling the flyers from break tables. Other workers were making their own copies because they knew the info was getting buried.

I finished my shift like normal, and hours later HR called and fired me. They said it was for “attendance” and “handing out literature,” even though I was under the threshold for termination and flyer distribution like that is federally protected.

I’ve submitted charges to the NLRB and updated OSHA. I'm also speaking with attorneys. If nothing else, I hope this leaves a paper trail that holds someone accountable. If you’re stuck in a place like this, document everything. Don’t assume they’ll do the right thing. They won’t."
182,3,"I was let go from my almost 11 year job today while on leave for taking care of my 3.5 year old dying on hospice.

I have a 3 year old on home hospice (told weeks or months to live only but now has survived a year while slowly declining more and more) and they put a hard deadline on how much more accommodation they would give me as a 10 year employee with a dying kid.  I thought it was rediculous to put a timeline on my kid dying as even unpaid time to spend with her was all I ever asked for and took whatever else was offered when I could.

I vented a Luigi meme to a long time friend at the company who turned out to be a bootlicker who screenshotted the meme and got me fired taking away my insurance and state disability payments I was getting for taking care of my dying child.  Company decided their profits were more valuable than a dying child of a 10 year top award winning employee and used a meme to a friend as reason to stop covering anything to help as I go through toughest time of my life.   Anyone looking for more about a big 3 wireless company firing an employee with a child on hospice they know is soon to die-  hit me up, seems like a nice media story to spread  thoughts on family and sick kids being a burden on companies with record high profits.

183,3,"When it comes to performance reviews, why is there a sociability aspect to it? Who actually cares about that crap? Everyone there is just trying ti get through the day to make money. We dont care about what happened to your family yesterday. If we did, we’d ask."

185,3,"Okay, so it’s been a year. I (22M) started working as a fresher after college. My company offer service to a 3rd party and it mainly hires freshers because they know they can pay less with least resistance for full-time job. 
      So, when this company having a lot of pressure meeting monthly targets, following case hygiene and all those stuff, my manager always threaten me that he will put me to PIP. He can offboard me for not meeting monthly targets and keep on poking for little of the things. May be the only mistake i am doing is im not licking my managers ass like others.
      Life has been good lately. You know, I’m slowly learning to stand on my feet to manage everything alone and enjoying but this pressure of targets, manager tasks and this threatening make me feel so bad from inside as what will i do, if they remove how will i pay for month next month, ive been going out on weekends to mass, having a good lunch, and spending a little for myself everything will be gone…

What will i do then?! I keep thinking… It will be a shame to go back and let everyone know that i got fired. 

Meanwhile about me, i am doing my job the best i can i am learning everyday putting all my efforts but this kind of threatening and that too me being a fresher it too much for me."
186,3,"Hi! I'm sorry for making this post, but I needed a place to vent.

I'm currently on a vacation (annual leave), but this whole time I have not been able to relax because I keep thinking about work (how I don't wanna go back). My job has made me feel worthless and stupid, good for nothing. I have wasted so many years that I feel like changing jobs is not possible. I mean, it feels like I can't do anything at all anymore. My job has destroyed my motivation and self-esteem completely. I feel stuck and as if I have not learned anything new or improved my skills. When I started at the job, I didn't get much of help or induction(?) to the job or tasks. I am not even sure what they want from me. I have talked about my struggles multiple times with my managers, HR and work doctor... But nothing much has changed.

I want to quit, but in my country the job market is so bad and there isn't many jobs available. Also I doubt any place will pay me as well as my current job 🥲 Actually the only reason why I am staying is because of the salary. I have a bank loan that I need to pay. I have payed half of it and the last payment should be in January 2027, but I feel like I won't be able to work at my current workplace for that long (although I have already worked there 6 years). I'm mentally exhausted and all this is also affecting my physical health. I do have autoimmune disease too which is not helping the situation....

Aaaaand on top of all that, there is a chance that my salary will decrease in the end of the year 🤦‍♀️😭 

I'm honestly having some very dark thoughts  too lately. I simply just don't wanna go back to work.

If you read this, thank you and I'm sorry for taking your time!

If this post breaks some rules, I'm sorry! Moderator can delete this.

Ps. english is not my native language, so please forgive me my poor english 🙈"
187,3,"Work decided to eliminate an entire shift of workers. They offered positions to all the staff on earlier time slots so they would not have any loss of employees. To sell this migration, they stated that the first day there would be a couple food trucks on premise to feed people as a way of celebrating all of the employees on one shift.  Sounds like someone not HR related got wind of the cost of the food trucks and refused to pay for everyone's food. So now we have two food trucks on-site that are pissed that they're not going to have guaranteed money, and employees are pissed because they now have to pay for the lunch that was supposed to be free. TLDR - Company makes big changes to people's lifestyle, offers food trucks as a way of smoothing it over, then decided they aren't going to pay for it and the employees can pay their own."
188,3,"So I just found out the team I have been leading for the last few years is being dissolved and the duties are being absorbed by other groups. I am being given the choice between 2 open positions in the company that are not leadership roles but because they are technical I would get a raise, or I could choose a decent severance package. Being unemployed in this climate is terrifying, however I am having a hard time looking at these other roles objectively because of my hurt. 

What would you do?"
189,3,"I’m sorry if this is not sub appropriate but my office is so weird. 

So basically no one really talks to each other. 

One guy even puts his food in the microwave and then goes back to his office and will go back and forth even if it takes multiple times to reheat the food.  

There’s really hardly any “water cooler” talk so to speak. 

The VP kind of sneaks into her office and that’s that. 

I’m kind of ranting but am just curious if anyone else has this experience working in an office or if it’s something about me maybe they don’t like me and I’m overthinking? I don’t know. 

I’m new to Houston, Texas and where I’m from (Colorado) I worked at a startup and we would have lunch together and a community table and it was great - people talked to each-other and seemed more introspective. Granted, this was years ago. 

I’m curious if this is a Houston thing, a 2025 thing or a me thing. "
190,3,"Our head trainer quit, and upper management told my boss that we're in charge of staying up to date with the trainer's duties until a replacement is hired. That was weeks ago.

Most of her duties fell to me, and I've got experience training and using these systems already, so I was a natural fit for the position. Instead, they're hiring nobody, and I'm stuck with more responsibilities.

Nah. I'm a victim of corporate greed and hierarchy. "
191,3,"I just got an annual pay raise. They were actually hype like this was something to be happy about. 2.6% increase. Took me from a big 50k to 51,300. Actually devastating working so hard to not even beat inflation. 

Genuinely acted like they were doing me a favor increasing my pretax income a month by like 108. It’s so low it’s just insulting. Don’t even give me a raise at that point. I am instantly looking for a new job.

Probably get a better raise by leaving than staying anyway. "
192,3,"Hi guys,

I just need to rant as I am stressed out.

I started a new job 4 months ago and it is NOT FOR ME. I realized this from the start but need to stick it out until I get another job.

Since my passion is not in this job I have been failing and my boss finds ways to state that I am not doing well, I received a verbal warning today.

Some of the complaints were 

- your desk can get messy can you please clean it up (taking out trash every night and occasional cans) 
- you have been leaving 10 mind early before shift ends (my bad, but also annoyed that there's no work to do so gotta look busy for 10 mins) 
- You wait for others to prompt you to start working (aren't I still in training?)
- You prematurely cut off callers during the call (meanwhile they want you to wrap up the call quickly to move onto the next one)

These all seem like valid concerns but to me they are so nitpicky about everything. They want you to do it one way but only in a particular way and you need to "" feel it out"" and go about it a specific way. It's so stupid and I'm burnt out. 

"
193,3,"This company reached out to me having got my resume from another company I had interviewed with. In all honestly the job description was a bit out of my experience and education scope, if I had discovered it on indeed or somewhere else I probably wouldn’t have applied. But they seemed to like me, they hired me and  offered me a very generous salary. I willingly commuted over an hour each way 5 days a week for a job I could have absolutely done fully from home. 
The job was very much a “ doing job” as in I would not be able to learn it without doing it. The job mostly deals with corporate online training with other significant responsibilities that I wasn’t even introduced too let alone trained on in the 7 brief weeks I was there. While I have done experience with online training, a lot of my experience is in education and content development. I did not at any point in the hiring process misrepresent my skills, experience or education. Everyone on the hiring committee and then my team knew I was coming from a different background, but I was eager to learn. I observed training for four weeks before I was allowed to start doing some elements of my job. During that time I asked questions and I practiced with my teammates, but only once or twice. When I started participating in online trainings I made some small mistakes with zoom functions that I wasn’t super familiar with but I performed well with everything else. I was reassured that my job was very didactic and it would take awhile for me to “ find my flow” I did do significantly better throughout the rest of week, learning with more practise. 
But come the next week I was let go for, initially being told “ it wasn’t a good fit” and that I was being let go “ without cause” When I asked for specific feedback I was threatened. I was told that because they were terminating me “ without cause” they couldn’t give specific feedback without it going on my ROE and impacting all future employment, but was told I “ wasn’t meeting core competencies”. I hadn’t even been trained on 2/3 of my job and had only been performing some elements of one part of my job for about 7 days. I was unemployed for almost a year before this job which means I ran out of unemployment from my previous job and hadn’t been at this one long enough to qualify again. They offered me a week of severance but I’m in the process of consulting with an employment lawyer to see if I have other options given the circumstances. While I was there I showed up, I did my best, I was professional, and eager to learn, I performed adequately for someone learning a new job they’ve never done before and that wasn’t enough for these people. "
194,3,"We have a matrix reporting structure, and are often asked to provide feedback on our colleagues. Often the colleagues themselves solicit feedback, but it's more often their direct supervisor that does so and collates the information. 

It's always rubbed me the wrong way. If provided with bad feedback, it doesn't generally serve as constructive criticism, it sends me into kind of a work depression and makes me less focused. I am apt to beat myself up over it, and it feeds my already problematic impostor syndrome, something that's pretty common in my fiend especially among women. 

So when asked to provide feedback on others, I never say negative things about them. Not unless it's someone with egregiously bad performance. I have a strong suspicion that everyone around me does that too. 

I am left to wonder how productive peer performance review even is. Do you provide honest feedback or do you just sort of smooth things over for that purpose? "

Its always been private practices in different fields, but as of late ive grown tired of how little we are paid, how much shit we do for this job with no reward. Ive asked for a raise, expressed the desire for growth since day one, and showcased ill do anything the job needs to prove im an asset to the practice. But now every time I ask for a raise im dismissed, its not the rigut time, we cant do it right now etc. I  was even assigned to do audits, about why we were losing so much money. The doctor I did not like this but I was assigned the task by my manager. Either way, I've now been assign tasks to start helping with me workman's comp. And I've done other things in the office that other employees wouldn't do such as when we've had clogged toilets. I've gone and done that. I've done mundane tasks. I've done tasks that are above and beyond that were not part of my job description.  
Every time I ask for a raise or I ask for growth. I met with resistance, or oh, they're shutting down that conversation. And this is a constant thing across the medical field. I found, but it's, I don't know what to do at this point. I'd quit if I could, but, uh I have bills to pay.And that's why I need a raise"
196,3,"I feel like my job is literally about to kill me any day, I have what's considered a good job. However my position there is the the worst lowest on a totem pole job, I work housekeeping. When I started it was okay it wasn't an unmanageable workload. However I found out only after working a few months how terribly employees that are low on the totem pole are treated at this place. We are treated basically like paid servants, people treat the housekeepers like they're stupid and sometimes wrong with you. I've been working at this job about 3 years now and I've never felt so physically bad in my entire life. The workload has steadily been increasing. I'm expected to do the work of two people every single day very physical work. I've started with a whole lot of new health issues vertigo, severe anxiety, depression.

I really want to leave but I signed a retention bonus agreement, to where we get a bonus but it is paid out over a certain amount of time only if you plan to stay working with the government.

The supervisors are horrible ,HR is basically non-existent. Due to these increased workloads and unrealistic expectations people have been getting injured at work and and lots of people including myself have been getting sick just from stress. I'm expected to keep up my own area and someone else's and I'm constantly moved I cannot focus on my main assignment. I don't know what to do I really feel like this job is Taking a toll on my body and my health, everyday I come home in pain.

Since she didn't go in, she likely doesn't have a job anymore. They still owe her for two weeks, but I highly doubt they are going to pay her unless they have to. Shit.

Employers should be arrested when they pull this garbage.

But I have plans for that day (me and hubs is going get Friday the 13th tattoos). Meetings are paid but I don't want to be at work if I'm on PTO.

200,3,"About a year back, my workplace (a building used mainly for opening and indexing a lot of mail for a much bigger company) decided that ""no more overtime unless it's approved specifically by the big boss."" Okay. We get a lot of mail on Sunday and Monday so we start being maliciously compliant, leaving after 8 hours exactly. Big boss didn't like that so the rule became ""You can't leave until all the work is done and you have to leave during the week."" We start doing that, regardless of how slammed we get on a normally not as heavy day. And because we are working as a skeleton crew, our return mail is extremely backed up because we ""can't hire"" any more people. If you are forcing us to do overtime to do the return mail that we don't have the regular time to do, why are you forcing us to do overtime to do the return mail? If it's that important, than it's important you pay us. And they're saying that if we don't reach an outrageous production number that our fastest prepper can't even reach, we're going to get fired.

202,3,"
the multinational company where i work just announced that we are now expected - actually forced - to come to office at least 2 times a month. while this doesn’t seem too much, this is literally crossing half of the country where i live,  and will take me 5 hours per day more on top of the work to come to office and return home. and for what? my team is in a different country so i will not even get to meet them…will have meetings and work just as i have been doing at home, excluding the comfortable workplace i organizad for myself at home , balanced schedule , and on top of that expenses on train ( with my minimum salary xd)

the decision to “encourage” everyone to come back to office is supported by the idea of socialising between colleagues - which i am not interested about at all

even tho i mentioned my situation they say they don’t really care how much it takes you to get to office, in the contract it says that my office is in “city x” - so i am expected to show up"

204,3,"So I guess my promotion makes me immune from inflation, not that my wages were anywhere NEAR keeping up with that.

And this is just me venting, I already know I'm leaving this job and planning to blast this place for how they treat their employees (large corporation with no unions USA).

This company sells extremely overpriced 'luxury' (read: unnecessary) items that are often the first to go when the home budget gets tight. I don't work sales as I consider my coworkers who do morally bankrupt for coercing people to finance this kind of crap for upwards of 5 YEARS. I work repair. We maintain our own items (they are cheap trash so they break constantly), which is what I do. Without the repair people this company would be lost. We do the work the sales folk are dependent on to actually make sales.

This job is a skilled position. A comparable field would be something like a mechanic at a car dealership shop. My position requires me to be independent, creative, good with my hands, attentive to detail, and FAST. This is corporate baby, we work numbers. I regularly repair 20 items in an 8 hour shift. I get paid $17/hr, which for some perspective, the Wendy's is starting at $16 in my area. And when I say repair, I mean cutting, sanding, and fabricating.

I'm smart, and have gotten my coworkers to start talking about how much we get paid. Through this I have learned our coworker, who has worked here for 20 YEARS, gets paid $23/hr. Their raise this year was \~$0.10, which was the reward for being good at their job. The 3% cost of living increase brings the total raise after 20 years of loyalty to $0.73. 73 cents to save you from the price of your rent going up another $100.

And I didn't even get it. I accidentally became quite good at this job and have been a top performer (something I've been working to stop) because I didn't realize how quick I was becoming. For some perspective I have had many jobs and know drawing attention to yourself is a surefire way to raise everyone's expectations, which I am trying to avoid.

So while the little people are just trying to do their jobs and stay employed for table scraps at a $7B company, the managers are tightening the noose on everyone as tariffs and inflation eat away at our customer base. The micro managing works its way into every aspect of our workday with each passing week, while we are punished for the failures and overpromises of the sales folk. Workload expectations go up while the amount of work available goes down and suddenly the word ""layoffs"" enters the chat.

I guess hiring the guy who was the CEO of two companies that failed is working out great.

Anyway, read your labor theory and always discuss your wages."

When I started this Tech job, my manager said I would be held accountable for anything missing and anything that went wrong with Tech. Since he was based out of state, he wanted to maintain a culture of over communication and did not like surprises. He told me there had been issues with theft before, but that they think they had it worked out as the previous tech was replaced, however, to be diligent. Turns out the culture of theft for this defense contractor is quite rampant. A senior network engineer in town for a project wanted to steal a whole bunch of stuff slated for a waste, but it was supposed to be protected devices as they had been used by people with clearances and contained at one point confidential information and classified projects. He reported himself to my manager when he asked for clarification, but said it was very common practice on the East Coast for his team to take anything they wanted. That was quickly swept under the rug.

Things kept going missing that were slated for destruction. The guy stealing it even loaded in front of people in the office, as he held an executive position. I recited the policy and asked him please not to because it would fall on my shoulders and maybe even trigger a deeper investigation. He said it was common And that he should know the policy as he had been with the company for a while and everything was fine. Hard drives went missing belonging to senior engineers with high-level clearances. I panicked and reported it to the company ethics line who referred to HR who referred to senior manager as my manager was on a long vacation at the time.

The senior manager was super cool and thankful and asked me how we should take care of it. Not wanting to make powerful enemies I wanted to approach it from a standpoint of correcting the policy and an inquiry rather than pointing fingers and quite frankly risking my safety and potentially life.

The guy was found to be an error of policy as the person stealing, carried the responsibility of taking the devices to the bases and supervising the incineration while obtaining a certificate of each device. Chalked it off to a mistake, and CCed his manager, who I guess took things off Lene with senior management. 
He continued to gloat and steal. When my manager returned, he said I was stupid for doing so and that they had worked together for a long time and I should’ve gone directly to my manager because he was friends with the person I reported, who, at that time I do not think even knew I reported him rather, that senior management just wanted to ensure the policy was being followed throughout the organization nationwide, resulting in the inquiry of certificates of destruction.

Manager, then began retaliating: no more certification reimbursement, no more educational incentives to pursue my degree. Menial tasks and demotion. Increased surveillance of my Microsoft teams, status and harassment. If I left my desk and it showed, I was away even for the slightest, as I was helping people throughout the office and working on projects and handling vendors. 

Took a real toll on my mental and physical health and he also had issues with me attending scheduled doctors appointment so I took FMLA leave, followed by short-term disability. They fired me saying they could not accommodate my ADA request and that I had failed to finish obtaining my security clearance, even though I had an interim clearance. I had tried while I was on leave to complete my clearance and the person responsible for it turns out was the person I reported, and he had some influence on the process. They never replied when I advised I had everything needed from the required agency finally to complete the process.

When unemployment reached out to me, they said that the employer stated that I refuse to come back to work or communicate with them. But I had all the evidence I needed, as well as the evidence I kept of the individual stealing, which they said never happened and was never reported by me. "
206,3,"I came in 15 minutes late today. I messaged my supervisor on duty today 30 minutes before I was expected to be late. I also called- no one answered. I come in when I said, my supervisor was no where to be found so I quickly went and put my things down to come on the floor. She comes into the back, looks at her phone, looks at me, tells me ""You didn't tell me you were going to be late"". I did. I tell her I messaged her and she keeps pushing I didn't. I tell her I did and on where the manager uses to message us and schedules. ""Oh I actually don't check that when I'm working"" but it is MY fault I did what I was told to do. She starts getting defensive when I gave her back what she gave me. She gets all up in my space ""CALM DOWN"" CALM DOWN???? ""Oh I'm usually a *very* chill manager and I don""t care that you're late but I really didn't appreciate the attitude you gave me"" okay do I sit there and take it? ""Let's have the other supervisor come in and see what he says!!"" The owner/manager gives me permission as a hostess to use my phone sparingly (communication is crucial between us and the managers especially) but she comes over and tells me to get off and she doesn't appreciate that I don't do what she tells me to. I'm already furious with her talking to me with an attitude. 

I'm debating whether or not to just walk out. I end up taking a run for it. Good fuc*ing riddance."
207,3,"EDIT: thank you everyone for the encouragement/advice, I am a very anxious person and sometimes I just need some reassurance that I’m not a complete piece of shit for wanting to say fuck this place and leave with no notice. 

I’m in a weird position right now and I really don’t know the best way to go about it. Bottom line is I need to leave my current job. 

Due to life circumstances I’m moving by the end of the month and want to give myself at least a week to finish packing up. I want my last day to be around June 20th, so I absolutely need to give my notice this week. My only problem is the people I work for are actually insane. 

It’s a very small company and the only supervisors are the owners, who are an elderly married couple. I’ve slowly come to realize that these people are completely nuts and am getting nervous about leaving. Anytime someone leaves the company they absolutely lose their minds. They’ve been trying to find a reason to sue someone who quit back in February, and when their lawyer basically told them they had no case they started digging through files to find anything they could to try and screw this individual over. They have some weird god complex and believe that everyone owes them something, which I think is why they get so angry when people do leave. 

They are constantly trying to lie and rip people off, which is also where I’m getting nervous. I’m in a financially precarious situation currently and I just want to have at the very least one last paycheck. 

My husband and I have discussed the possibilities of what could happen and have decided to give them around a weeks notice, just incase they do flip out and I need to stop working immediately. If they don’t flip out I can stay for the last week and just get another 40 hours of pay. 

I’m not worried about using them as a reference for future jobs (I have plenty of good references from a previous government job), I’m really just trying to avoid any drama if I can. 

Any advice for how to go about this would really be appreciated, I’m extremely anxious trying to figure out what exactly I’m going to do. 


"
208,3,"I told her at the beginning of last week, that I would be able to start at the end of the same week. She told me no, because she's already over hours for the week, and she wants to be there on my first few days, to walk through it with me. She wanted to wait to start me, until the next scheduled week. Weeks are Monday - Sunday. Called Friday, called Saturday- she still wasn't done with the schedule. Ran into her last night (Sunday), while doing DoorDash. And she told me she was still working on the schedule. 

I decided to stop trying to call her on Sunday, and wait for the morning to see when she calls. She didn't. I need to work, so I called the store at 10am and was told she'd be in at 1pm. The person I spoke to, told me I was scheduled for 8am tomorrow.

I call back at 1:40pm, and she's called out sick. Which sucks, but you can take 10 seconds to text me when I've been waiting all week. Damn. Guy who answers starts rattling off my schedule, and then lets it slip that the manager won't be back in until Wednesday. So now I'm confused as hell, wondering if I'm still supposed to start. I push for him to ask her to text me, and he is clearly trying to protect her personal time by refusing to pass on anything until she's back. Normally, I'd be behind that 100% but now *my* personal time has been insanely disrespected.

Then he offers to add me to the GroupMe. The biggest power and data drain that's ever seen a phone. I do not have the room for this on my phone, answers they're not paying for the use of my phone and data.

This whole thing has been so immensely disrespectful to me, my time, my money, and my resources.

I need the money, so I'm calling back in a sec to get what info I need. But this place is not getting a day's notice when I quit. Don't expect respect, when you don't give it.

Fuck outta here."
209,3,"I'm in a trade that isn't super big and most company owners know eachother to some degree. I was with this company for over a year. I worked on various projects that netted this company a pretty penny but they never really kept their promise on training me on new things. 

However 7 months in I had a workplace accident that put me out for a handful of months. When I had returned my employers demeanor shifted and they started to find asinine reasons to write me up I was given my first one not even 1 month being back, I wasn't even on their payroll I was still being supplemented by WorkSafe and we had certain rules that needed to be followed . They went as far as to reach for a mistake I made 10 months ago for one of the final 2 which they dropped 2 write ups on the same day (last monday) and then fired me.

They gave me 2 weeks of severance and offered an additional severance to sign this document. Ive been holding off because I'm pretty sure they know they've done wrong and are trying to absolve themselves considering it hasn't even been a full 3 months since I was fully back at work and I'm pretty sure there's a time limit on WorkSafe protection, but I'm also trying to feed my family and in the current economy finding work in my field isn't as fast as it normally would be. It's only been a week but every week that goes by things will become more dire.

I'm at in impasse though, because as I said it's a small field. If I did persue something this could effectively end my chance at finding work in this field again because it's pretty much a guarantee they will talk amongst themselves. However my body is pretty beat up. I've been in this trade for over 5 years and I've had a lot of fucked up things happen to me in that timeframe"
210,3,"I mean I always recall these people who worked so hard at a company for many years, yet they are still in the same spot they were when they started. I remember at one of my first jobs at a manufacturing facility, there was this older man, probably around 35 or so, who worked there for 15 years and knew so much and was so kind, yet he didn't seem to get the recognition he deserved from management. He stayed late often to help complete tasks that no one else wanted to do, even though he hadn't gotten a raise in like 8 years, and was struggling with money. I don't want that to be me when I'm his age, but it seems like most workplaces just treat you like an expendable resource and don't truly appreciate a loyal and hard-working employee. Does anyone else get discouraged when you see old people at your work who don't get the appreciation or compensation the deserve for their years of hard work and service to a company?"
211,3,"I'm not sure if this is the right thread or place to post this, but I'm so fed up with this system, Jobs, and everything related to this silly slavery. I've wasted my life struggling in low-wage jobs, never developed a practical skill other than sales, however, it's so hard to find anything that I can truly vibrate with. What do you guys do for a living/escape?"
212,3,"I’m an anaesthesiologist and work with the same group since ends of 2023. Its easy work and the work possibilities in a couple years are great, good work with little effort. The problem is, they are incredible toxic and abusive. 

In a group of 14 people the older ones years ago chose to take as much work as possible in the same clinic, because it meant more money. Now some 6/7 years later they have better offers in another clinics, same work but better payment. I’m okey with them choosing, the problem is they don’t leave the charges and days they took years back, they want to keep them and when better work appears they tose what they don’t want to other, and I’m ok with that too, if that didn’t mean someone people need to be waiting at home to be called with less than 24hs advice to fill the blank, without being paid if they are not called. I’m even okey with that. The problem is, they want me to be free Monday afternoon because it appears no one else can, and I can’t; my dad is going through cancer treatment and Mondays and Thursdays I go with him; but it appears that’s not reason enough for my lack of collaboration with the group. I do have other days free, all the rest of the days, but every time something like once every two months this happens, and they all go wild, and start saying how there is no colaboration, and how they can take me out of the group. 

I’m just venting, I still don’t know what to do with this group, but every now and then, like today, the shit hits the fan, and now I have a video call at 10pm for this and I don’t have the will to keep a neutral face. "
213,3,"I was told during the interview with the company that since it's a business with multiple small locations and that we could be alone or with only a couple other employees running the store, and therefore we'd be required to stay on the premises and interrupt our lunch to help customers, we'd be given a 30min paid lunch. So my understanding of the Washington paid lunch laws is that it's 30min of time given to sit down whether we decide to eat or not (and that interrupted time counts as worked - not against our meal break; if this understanding is wrong, PLEASE feel free to let me know!). Washington law also states that ""employees must be allowed a meal period when they work more than five hours in a shift. A meal period must be at least 30 minutes long and start between the second and fifth hour of the shift."" 4 hours and 15min into my 6 hour shift yesterday, when I asked my trainer how lunches were handled since it was getting close to my 5th hour, I was told that we don't get lunches and that if I wanted a 30min break to sit down, it would have to be deducted out of my paycheck. I subsequently did not get to have a 30min lunch that day.

Today, I texted my interviewer to ask for clarification on the matter. She called me (which sucks, because I had hoped to get it in writing) to tell me that she expects us to only sit down long enough to eat which she said was about 5-15min and that ""eating for 30min is too much"" and that we were expected to continue working the rest of the time. She also seemed so offended about the idea of someone sitting for 15-30min of their lunch break either relaxing or playing on their phone. Then she started making a fuss about how I'm ""making a big deal out of it"" and that if I'm going to be ""bookish about 5-15min, then maybe you need to take some time to consider if you want to stay with this company"". I told her I don't mind staying. Then I asked her if she'd just be able to text it to me so that I can have it for reference later on. She replied, ""okay, I don't think you're a good fit for this company"" and hung up on me. In less than 40min, I was completely removed from the schedule and could no longer see anyone else's. What's worse is I forgot to even prep some food to bring with me for lunch, so I couldn't eat even if I wanted to, so I was effectively expected to just work my lunch break, even though I gave zero consent to waive my meal break.

I know that they've not only violated my right to a meal break, but now they've added retaliation to the list by terminating me for bringing up a potential violation of my rights. AND, on a side note and potential other issue; when talking about paid hours with my trainer, such as when the clock starts and ends for a shift, I was told it was just for the times on the schedule. My schedule was 3:00pm to 9:00pm yesterday. And while I do consider that I didn't start working until 3:00pm (I arrived at 2:55pm, and they didn't have me start working for a few minutes even though they brought me behind the counter), I definitely didn't get done working until 9:20pm due to the store closing at 9pm, then having to count the money in the till, log things into the log book, turn off the lights, lock the doors, and call one of the administrators to get the code to secure the lock and make sure the store was fully closed. So I wonder if they're going to try to not pay me for that extra 20min (whether through the 7min rounding rule or for each minute worked).

After getting removed from the schedule, I immediately started working on a complaint to the Washington Department of Labor and Industries for at least the meal law violation and the wrongful termination. I plan to contact the employer tomorrow to request a copy of their records of my time worked, rate of pay, total pay for the day I worked, and a  written statement stating the reasons for and effective date of discharge, so that I not just have that, but also see if they weren't going to pay me for the 20 extra minutes that I worked, since legally they can't shave off the full 20min; at minimum, due to the 7 minute rounding rule, they have to pay me at least 15min of that. Then if I find that they do try to pull that, I'd file to get wage theft added to the investigation (I don't care that it's only a $4-5 difference for me - it's how many years they'd have done it to others).

And I was told that the employee who told me that we don't get meal breaks has been with the company for over 10 years... So, to think of just how long they've been doing this for...

Screw companies who take advantage of employees like that and grow off of illegal business practices. I hope they get to experience the full force of the law."
214,3,"

It feels like lately there's this big cultural push to steer people toward the skilled trades plumbing, electrical, welding, carpentry, etc. Like if it’s some kind of hidden golden ticket to financial freedom or a way to taunt people who went to college.

Most of the people saying this stuff I dont think have ever actually worked in the trades,maybe only as an owner,managemer or buy my course to scale your business types.

I always hear “My buddy’s a (insert skilled trades job title) and makes six figures!” But they always leave out a few key details:

* That “six figures” came from working 60–70 hours a week, every week.
* When you break it down, that’s only about **\$27 an hour** for physically brutal, dangerous and sometimes exhausting labor. 
* Some of those guys own their own business too, which makes them an entrepreneur, not a regular employee. So it skews the numbers quite a bit.
* Also you almost always need thousands of dollars in tools *payed.out of pocket* to work. Imagine going to McDonald's and needing to provide your own fryer to be a fry cook.
* And when you get sent out of town you get to hang out with a bunch of mentally unstable drunks/junkies.



I think its sill how even unions inflate their wages by tossing in the *value* of the pension and healthcare into the hourly rate, which makes the numbers look better than your actual paycheck. Like having health insurance and a 401k is some kind of elite perk when its the bare minimum.

Honestly, it makes me wonder if the trades are *so amazing,* why is there always a shortage? Maybe it's not a shortage of workers, but a shortage of people willing to get worked into the ground for glorified fast food wages dressed up as something noble.

And something else I don’t get.

Why do so many of the older trades guys seem *proud* of how much abuse they took?

Like, they’ll straight-up brag about missing their kids’ birthdays, working through injuries, and getting screamed at by bosses for years—as if that’s some badge of honor.
You didn’t get paid extra for that. You just gave your time, your health, and your sanity to people who now drive brand-new trucks while you limp to work with a worn-out back.

They pat themselves on the back for being “tough” or “old school,” but all I see is a generation that got exploited and now expects younger workers to go through the same thing—just so they can feel like it was worth it.

It’s like Stockholm Syndrome, but for job sites.

You shouldn’t be proud that you sacrificed time with your family to make some owner rich. That’s not character that’s exploitation. And if you’re telling the next generation to do the same? You’re not giving advice. You’re perpetuating the cycle.

I’m not anti-trades. If someone loves working with their hands, that's awesome. But the way this whole thing is being marketed lately feels more like a desperate push to fill jobs nobody wants by dressing them up as ""honorable"" or ""real work.""

Sorry for the rant but i kinda fell for the skilled trades shortage rhetoric and have been in this industry for a year now. And I understand why nobody wants to do it. Kinda trying to warn people that it isn't all its cracked up to be.

Edit: And before yall go on about that couldn't be me Im in the union. Please read Crowns experience with so called union protection.

215,3,"Has your work ever felt like a weird mid spot? Almost like a purgatory? I've got a job that pays just enough to keep things balanced. No trouble with bills or any of that. I'm doing mildly engaging work (editing/translating manga) and I get to work from home. I can finish my work smoothly and have time in the day on the clock to work on my own personal art and whatnot. The people I work with are incredibly amicable and kind. 

 Yet, I live in a perpetual state where I feel like what I think and express just doesn't matter... It's as if I'm leading a creatively void life. I got a degree in a creative field, did my masters in visual theory and art practice, and spent time freelance editing with art book publishers and writers and now work for a Manga Publisher translating and editing titles full time.

No one seems to give a shit when I try to point out something would sound better written this way or that or more true to a character(not unwarranted advice or anything. Just stuff I'm assigned and then told to kind of not go over the top on...) I'm probably just not expressing things right, or maybe feeling too strongly when expressing. Who knows. I feel alienated at times because of my stance on my work though...

I don't even care about recognition or raises. I've gotten some recognition for things, and even a small raise, but I didn't feel anything over it. 

I just want to know in my heart that I'm making interesting writing choices I can enjoy, make some sort of spark with what I passionately studied- making *something*  for myself... but more often in the everyday I'm being considered on how I lay out information in excel sheets and how often I make notes on things as opposed to the actual creative process.

Things are outsourced and I have to edit those outsources and I'm told here and there to stop being so ""strict"" with shitty writing too.  Part of it feels childish, like mapping things out and having formulas for everything so outsourcing work can go smoother is the ""more productive"" thing, but I feel so empty over it. It bleeds into that time I get for my personal art too, and I feel lacking there too. Hopefully I'll put together a small solo show this year, friends have been egging me on at least. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm not doing what I was brought on to do, but just brought on to look like I'm doing what I'm meant to do, and then even what I'm meant to do feels foggy. I know what I can do to make things meaningful in the writing, but I feel myself slipping away from that many a time- just say fuck it and send off a chapter of something after running through it just once cause it's not like my job is interested in my creative passion anyway. 

My incredibly supportive partner is always telling me ""people read what you work on, and write kind reviews and stuff, that's a good sign!"" And whatnot, but I don't feel much from that either. I don't get praises at work from that either.

I brought it up the last time I was recognized and prsised for something by my boss, the number of pages I work on per month- numbers. I honestly don't care how many pages I've gone through this month or the numbers. all I'm concerned with is if someone is gonna read a chapter of something I did and be convinced it was worth there 2 dollars for 30-40 pages of something. I told my boss just that. He's a nice guy and is very open about things. Our whole team is and I felt comfortable saying it. My boss vibed with it but ultimately felt kinda just like a weird silence between our conversation. Like he got me but it wasn't quite resonant of the feeling- of my lack of interest in -more-. 

I feel like maybe I'm being too perfectionist about life, denying myself some things while seeking out others that are unattainable, and then sometimes I feel like the idea of working just sucks and has been numbing me to no end. I'm probably in no position to complain since I have a loving home, can work from home, can survive and put money aside and all that, and work with nice people but idk

221,3,"I’ve been told for years: work hard, get in with a stable company, and you’ll be set. Two years into working at [logistics company] and I still can’t afford to live on my own.

I started part-time at [logistics company], working full-time hours anyway. Took a QA Admin position and got a $1 raise. Wasn’t eligible for the annual raise last October because of an HR system migration “technicality.” No raise since.

Now I’m officially full-time as an Ops Admin II on the Outbound side. Sounds good, right? Not really. It’s a lateral move, so again — no raise. I even asked if the additional responsibilities mattered. “Nope.”

And here’s the kicker: we’ve now merged with [logistics company, same company], so I have to learn a whole new side of the business — new systems, codes, procedures, etc. Oh, and I’m about to attend a full week of Dangerous Goods training so I can become the certified specialist for our station — including hazmat spill cleanup.

I brought this all up. I wrote an actual salary negotiation document with market data, my certifications, and the value I bring. I’ve taken initiative, documented discrepancies, and made it clear that I’m underpaid. Took it to my SR HR Business Partner, then escalated to District HR.

Their response?
“Wait until October.”
That’ll be two full years without a raise.

And it’s not like I’m new to work. I’ve worked customer support, tech, warehouse, driving, team leadership. I document processes, help train others, clean up literal messes — including jumping into a trailer full of spilled white paint to save packages. I’m certified in multiple FedEx internal systems. I’m the guy who quietly keeps things moving while others let it fall apart.

I’m not asking for a miracle. Just a wage that reflects the work I actually do. But apparently showing up, speaking up, and stepping up isn’t enough unless it’s October.

So...What do I do now?

222,3,"I have had a situation happen in my position at my job quite frequently where I find that if I stay poised and react with intent instead of emotionally I can remain professional and tactful in that way. 

HOWEVER..   
This particular person's demeanor and overall reactivity to my air in space around them lately is hostile. Causing me to be both confused and annoyed as I am uncertain the reason for their indifference. 

My co workers believe it is because they feel threatened by me in their own position. I have no idea why. I do not want a seat at their position. I don't even want to inch at their position. Not to say I am content in where I am but, I do not have enough experience to even inch at their position and so I haven't tried. My co workers think that the way I work and interact professionally and carry the team is inline with an intent to take over their position. It's not. I am good at my job. Not the best. That's it. 

This person, and their demeanor towards me though is absolutely disgusting. A grown person acting like a little spoiled child. It drives me nuts. I am trying to stay poised and the better person in communications. However, some days I leave heavy breathing on the way out like oh thank God i don't have to act professional anymore while I'm in my car at least...

I told him he was delusional and that most peoples salaries were not going up as fast as rent. Secondly if you actually look at an average persons house it is filled with mostly Chinese goods. Disposable incomes are so low everyone who is average or low income has no choice but to buy cheap Chinese goods. The trader looked confused as he had never been inside a low income persons house before.

So Wisconsin families were displaced via eminent domain and, to date, over $1.2B in taxpayer dollars have been wasted, as Foxconn reneged on their deal while collecting their benefits and even sold part of their free land gift to Microsoft for $100M.

230,3,"Setup: Washington State. Work for a large RV company in sales.  Work 50+ hours every week. Despite selling lots of units (came in first and second in sales my first two full months) the commissions were small enough they didn’t equal minimum hourly wage so I got paid minimum hourly rate (so I thought).

First thing: I found this document:

https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/_docs/esa10.1.pdf

From looking at it, it seems they might need to pay overtime.

Also noticed in there they are required to pay commissions on your sales even if the was completed after termination. Our handbook says no pay for any units that haven’t been delivered before you leave. (Delivery happens a few days after the sale).

Shady stuff: our paychecks do not include a breakdown of earned commissions or bonuses.  We have no way of being sure we are being paid the commissions we earned or bonuses we earned.  We do get a sheet that shows all your sales and commission for each before bonuses but today i noticed the sheet was missing 4 units I sold last month. Manager said, oh you’ll get paid those next payday - I don’t trust that. The sheet should already be showing those sales - some which were almost 3 weeks ago. And there is no way to verify which units are on what paycheck. We are supposed to get bonuses for 12 units sold in a month.  Was told sales don’t count for the bonus if not cleared through admin (happens days after the sale).

Also figured out they shorted me over half of what should have been my largest commission sale. Got paid commission on 5800 profit (commission is 20% of the profit on the sale) and I find out later the profit was closer to $13k.

After that I started looking over my previous paystubs. First month is training pay - 18.75/hr. 
My second paycheck (weeks 2&3) i worked 99.5 hours and gross pay was ~1023 - about $10.25/hour.  I know this part was flat out illegal as minimum wage is over $16/hr here.

I did bring these three concerns up to the general manager, he agreed my pay seemed all screwed up, and he fired off an email to admin.

Not happening to just me either. Been talking to the other sales people and they notice strange stuff going on too.

All in all I’m not happy with the way this place operates. They play numbers games with customers and seems they do the same to the employees too.

Another thing I just thought of too.  If you don’t make enough commission to reach minimum wage they are still supposed to pay minimum wage.  The difference between commission and minimum they call a draw. So let’s say your commissions were $500 less than what you get from minimum wage. They pay the $500 in that check but subtract it from the next check (except when they don’t, like on my second paycheck for $10.25/hr)"

It’s a misconception that every mother in California has paid maternity leave. 2 years ago my wife gave birth and her government office opted out of SDI, so she did not qualify for paid maternity leave. She had to use her own vacation and luckily got transferred hard earned vacation from her coworkers so she could recover from her emergency C-section, where her abdominal muscles were cut open and her internal organs were carefully moved aside so the baby could be delivered. Afterward, those organs had to be placed back into position before closing her up. Barbaric the way we treat women with no guarantee for paid maternity leave.

Fathers or other partners also need paid paternity leave so they can take care of the women who just birthed a child from their body and bond with their newborn.

Many other countries have a year long paid parental leave, so new parents can physically recover and bond with their newborn.

Can we, California, the world’s 4th largest economy, guarantee to provide these similar needed services as other countries?"
232,3,"I arrived at Montreal (YUL) from NYC (LGA) and noticed something strange. Each gate bound for a major U.S. city had quiet, orderly lines of men—Latino, solo, wearing work jackets, baseball caps, and carrying backpacks. No families. No chaos. Just silent groups waiting to board.

It stood out because it wasn’t the typical international terminal vibe. Usually, there’s a mix of tourists, families, and business travelers. But these men looked like they were part of a system—organized labor, not leisure.

That’s when it hit me: while the media and politicians rage about “illegal immigration,” governments are quietly flying in workers with legal visas to meet economic demand. No caravans. No tents. Just paperwork, processed behind the scenes.

Meanwhile, U.S. voters are left arguing about border walls and asylum quotas—while tech jobs get outsourced, wages stagnate, and citizens fight over the scraps of a system that no longer serves them.

The hypocrisy is stunning:
	•	Deport some migrants for the optics, fly others in legally to pick fruit or process meat.
	•	Blame immigrants for job loss, while corporations offshore white-collar jobs overseas.
	•	Cry “invasion!” while the economy depends on cheap, disposable labor.

It’s not a broken system. It’s a managed illusion.

———

Curious to hear your thoughts:
	•	Have you witnessed similar contradictions in immigration or labor policy?
	•	Where else do you see the narrative not matching reality?
	•	Do voters even have the tools to see through these distractions anymore?

233,3,"This may seem mild in comparison to some stories here, but as I live in Sweden and we have huge worker protections and work environment legislation, I'm not completely sure what this company did was legal, but as they mostly hired newly graduated students there's a risk that they don't know any better and thus don't complain about it.

Apple runs their telephone support through other companies here, and I had a friend who worked there for 6 years. The work place was quite alright according to my friend, but it came to working from home where it became crazy.

The company, probably on order from Apple, were incredibly paranoid about data leaking so to work from home you had to obey these rules:

* Your sun blinds had to be pulled down. Even if someone lived on the 7th floor with nature as the only view outside. I mean, someone could pull up a ladder and look inside!
* If you lived together with someone, they were not allowed to enter your workplace for as long as you were logged in. You also had to have your door closed.
* If you had a mobile phone it had to be turned off or move it to another room, as you could in fact be recording your calls! If you had a land line, as uncommon as it is, you had to unplug it in your room.
* You had to install spyware on your computer so that the employer could turn on their webcam at any time to make sure you sat on your chair. Anydesk/teamviewer was also to be put on so they could log in and look at what you were doing.
* If you had a second monitor you were not allowed to have it turned on.

This was so paranoid on a sickly level that I just had to share it. Like I mentioned I also live in Sweden, and I'm at least 70% sure that this breaks at least a couple of our laws and regulations."

If managers managed to push people to the point where factories require suicide nets and drive others so insane they knife the guy in the next cubicle even though we have some sort of regulation of workplaces, image the barbarity they’ll do to “just” machines.

The task used to be pleasant and made the day go by quickly but has since become a pain in the ass because of faulty technology upper management has implemented.

239,3,"

So I work at a place that prints and mails stuff. Big factory. We’ve got 24 presses(ish) across two buildings, each one with 11 overhead cranes. They're used to lift 600 to 1200 pound paper rolls over your head while you’re working. Every crane is set up the exact same way.

About 9 months ago I took a stabilizer bar to the top of the head from one of them. Ended up with five staples. Turns out the safety switch can be bypassed just by switching buttons too fast. It’s something that can happen by accident, and it did.

When I came back, some of the old timers told me it’s been a known issue since before I ever worked there. Management knew. People talked about it. Nothing was ever done. The fix was identified, but they wouldn’t order the parts or approve the overtime to get it done.

Then they laid off 8 people and announced a full shift realignment. They made us re-rank our preferences and assigned shifts based on seniority. I told them flat out I’m a single parent and I can’t do 12 hour nights. I was already on 8s. They gave me three weeks to figure out new childcare for a 9 year old in the middle of summer and still put me on 12s anyway. Told me they’re still offering me full-time work so technically I’d be quitting if I left.

Now they want to claw back vacation time I already used, because there’s a policy buried somewhere saying you owe it back if you leave too early. That was about when I decided to make the call.

I filed a complaint with OSHA. Told them everything. The injury. The known issue. How long it’s been ignored. How every single crane in the place is built the same way and could do the same thing. How they admitted to needing a fix but refused to act on it.

Inspector already contacted me. I’ve been told they’re showing up soon and not announcing it. At this point, even if they tried to hide it, it’s too late. You can’t re-engineer 200 something cranes overnight.

I don’t expect to be there much longer. I reported anonymously, but I’m under no illusion they don’t know it was me. Doesn’t matter. They could’ve just worked with me. Could’ve fixed the issue. Instead, they’re about to get hit with fines, mandatory deadlines, and whatever else OSHA decides to do when you ignore a known hazard for almost a year after it splits someone’s head open.


EDIT: I fired off a couple emails and contact forms for lawyers in the area, its Saturday tho so wont hear anything for awhile, I'll post an update in a week or so if there is any news/movement

EDIT EDIT: For those of you saying i should make them fire me and stick around, I am a blue collar worker with a strong maintenance background, i contacted 2 recruiters and put in a couple calls and my entire next week is interviews for more money than i make here.

**It’s about them vs.** ***all*** **of us.**

We don’t need another mascot. We need a movement.  
A firestarter. A symbol. We NEED someone or something that can unite us under one truth:

***No fucking more.***

And maybe that person isn’t coming. Maybe that person is you. Or me. Or all of us, waking the hell up and refusing to play their game anymore.  
This isn’t about hope. Because our hope’s been hijacked. This is about resistance**.** It’s about us standing in the fire and refusing to burn quietly. Because if we don’t fight now, our children will be born *already chained.*

243,3,"Context: I transferred internally with the company I work for (from an on-site role to an advertised fully-remote WFH position). Three weeks after training started, I was told that the job was now hybrid. I took a voluntary paycut to work from home because my car is unreliable to go into an office 5 days a week, 45 minutes away. The job was fully advertised in the job posting as WFH, during interviews (and an HR meeting to approve the transfer) it was confirmed over and over the role was fully remote. Now I’m making less on paper, and making even less money because now I have to keep paying for gas and tolls and insurance and commute time. Research keeps shedding light that this may be “detrimental reliance”, which is when an employee makes a life changing decision (like taking a paycut) based off what a company advertises in good faith. Does anyone have any experience here? Or does this situation resonate with anyone? Looking for any advice. (If it helps, the job is in NJ and I live in PA)."
244,3,"

Thanks for all the responses on my last post — solidarity to everyone who’s stuck in that grind and still finding the energy to push back. Since a few people asked, here’s what I would focus on if I lived in the U.S. and wanted to change this mess:

1. UNIONIZE. UNIONIZE. UNIONIZE.

I can’t stress this enough. In Europe, most of the rights we take for granted — paid vacation, parental leave, job security — came through decades of union pressure. The U.S. labor movement has been gutted, demonized, and sabotaged by corporations and politicians alike, but it can be rebuilt. Start small. Talk to coworkers. Normalize labor solidarity again.

2. DESTIGMATIZE REST.

One of the most toxic exports from the U.S. is the glorification of overwork. “Sleep when you’re dead” is not a personality — it’s a warning sign. Advocate for mental health, for boundaries, for actually using your vacation time (if you even get any). And stop treating burnout as a badge of honor.

3. COLLECTIVELY REJECT BULLSH*T JOB EXPECTATIONS.

Your boss messaging you on a Sunday? Don’t reply. Don’t set the precedent. Normalize saying “no” to unpaid overtime, to extra responsibilities without extra pay, to “hustle culture.” One person doing this gets punished. Ten people doing it changes company policy.

4. PUSH LOCAL AND STATE POLITICS HARD.

The federal system is slow and corrupted, yes, but a lot of labor reform can start local. Push for citywide minimum wage increases. Paid sick leave ordinances. Tenant protections. Local change matters — and builds pressure upwards.

5. DON’T BE AFRAID TO QUIT BAD JOBS (IF YOU CAN).

I get that it’s not always possible — the system is designed to trap people. But if you have a way out of a toxic workplace, take it. You are not obligated to suffer just because someone gave you a paycheck. Your dignity isn’t negotiable.

6. STOP WORSHIPPING THE RICH.

The idea that billionaires “earned” their way up is the biggest scam in U.S. mythology. In Europe, we look at someone hoarding $100 billion and think, “How many people had to be underpaid or exploited for that to happen?” Question wealth. Demand taxes. Support redistribution.



Look, I know the odds are stacked against American workers. But you’re not powerless. They want you isolated, exhausted, and scared. Organizing anywhere — workplace, online, in your neighborhood — is a radical act of resistance.

This is my first job since quarantine (took time off to go to school), and I often find myself debating whether I should be trying harder or doing more at my job. The owners and manager try to run the shop like it’s high stakes and I should always be doing something. “If you can lean, you can clean” vibe. I make okay money but I also never get breaks, am always alone on my shifts, and we’re not even supposed to sit down (they took our stool from the register bc it’s “broken”). I still do my job of course, clean up messes, be polite to customers, restock things, watch for stealing, chastise rowdy teens, etc. But when theres no management in the store and nothing is on fire, I like to secretly read on the computer and just generally don’t put in all my effort. Part of me feels guilty for that, but part of me also acknowledges that this is not a serious job and I am not harming the company. (Most of the stuff we sell is made in china garbage that’s double the price we buy it for anyway).

258,3,"This just happened...

Background: Company went WFH during the pandemic. After, they issue RTO.  Luckily, I was grandfathered in and my CFO didn't really care about.  Unluckily for me, I left the job and came back. No more WFH for me (unless I ask on occasion).

So today, entire internet went down.  And, not just in our locations, but others as well.  No emails. No phones.  No system.  Let my manager know (who's WFH today). She's still in, while we're being paid hourly to sit around for about an hour or so.

While I get the WFH option, others in our location don't.  I guess putting all your eggs in one basket, then the basket blowing up, doesn't mean much to executives mandating RTO."
259,3,"Today, in a meeting about how to have more informal meetings/time together, my boss casually suggested we run a *marathon* together... as a team bonding activity.  

Just to clarify: we are **not** a team of sprightly twenty-somethings brimming with energy. I am an elder millennial—the third youngest person on a team of 14. If anyone on this team runs anywhere, it’s usually away from responsibility.

Not if they made you shrink.

This isn’t drama.
This is reclamation.

Just stop replying.
Stop trying to be understood.
Stop re-explaining the moment they showed you they never listened.

The last message was clean.
The last look was neutral.
And that’s what makes it surgical.

They don’t panic when you’re gone.
They panic when they realize they can’t read the silence.

So they send out feelers:

“Hope all is well.”

“Just checking in.”

“Let me know if you ever want to catch up.”

It’s not care.
It’s recon.

They’re not worried about you.
They’re worried you left without giving them the chance to feel important about it.

You did it because you already saw what they do when they think you’ll stay."

262,3,"I started a new job last October at a long time friend of mine’s family business. It is a private company and I was coming over from a public company with a lot of experience specifically in accounting and financial controls. Not only was the company run haphazardly, but they started me out doing simple data entry work. Yes, they acknowledged that the department needed to improve processes and that my scope of work would gradually change during the interview, but after seven months of no changes or any meetings to put plans in place, I had enough. I called a meeting with my boss and coworker about making actual changes and giving me different work to do that was related to the work clearly stated in my resume, but it just turned into a heated argument where both of them said I have a “bad attitude” without acknowledging what might be causing this “bad attitude”. I tried my best to tough it out, but I hated it every day. I won’t get into full details, but I have never been apart of such a shit show of an organization.

It sucks to admit but we’ve been blind, intentionally or not. We’ve been cowards. Me included. 

But I’m tired of this. I want to do something. 

I’m just testing the waters here. If you had someone in your local area approach you who asked for donations to pay their bills, so they can make it their full time job to go try to educate working class people and get them to rally together, would you donate/join the cause? 

If you wouldn’t, why not? What problems do you see with it? I’m open to taking whatever approach is needed. But just to throw it out there, in my opinion, education doesn’t do much. We need action. Most people aren’t willing to actually initiate by themselves. 

I’ve asked around in my area. Most people would be on board with fighting back if a very large number of others were in on it too. I feel like we just need to band together. Obviously easier said than done. But I believe it’s possible to do something about this. "

267,3,"

I seriously don’t know how you guys do it. Watching U.S. work culture from Europe feels like watching a never-ending episode of Black Mirror, but everyone’s been gaslit into thinking it’s ""just how things are.""

Let’s start with paid vacation. You guys get what, 0 federally mandated days off? Most Americans I’ve met are happy with 10 days a year like it’s a privilege. In most of Europe, we get at least 20-25 days of paid vacation BY LAW. And that doesn’t include public holidays. You guys get grilled for taking a week off, while our employers basically expect us to disappear for most of August.

And then there’s healthcare. Jesus. You tie one of the most basic human rights—access to healthcare—to employment. You lose your job, you lose your health insurance. Meanwhile over here, I can break a leg, go to the ER, get surgery, and not pay a single cent out of pocket. You get an ambulance ride and it’s like ""congrats, that’s $3,000.""

Don’t get me started on maternity and paternity leave. Most U.S. mothers are back to work within WEEKS. WEEKS! We give people months, sometimes up to a year, with partial or full pay, and dads too. It’s considered basic decency. But apparently in the U.S., bonding with your newborn is less important than boosting quarterly profits.

Then there’s the culture of overwork. Hustle. Grind. ""If you’re not working 60 hours a week, you don’t want it bad enough."" No thanks. In most of Europe, if your boss texts you after work hours, that’s harassment. In France it’s literally illegal to expect people to check emails after work. You guys brag about having to work weekends. We riot.

No job security, no protections, no dignity. At-will employment? You can be fired for any reason or none at all? That’s not freedom—that’s instability. People working 2–3 jobs just to survive. You have billionaires in bunkers and nurses living out of their cars.

You’ve normalized corporate feudalism and called it ""the American Dream.""

And somehow you’ve all been convinced that asking for basic labor rights makes you a lazy communist? Over here, even the centrists support unions and public healthcare. You can be right-wing and still agree people shouldn’t die because they can’t afford insulin.

I’m not saying Europe’s perfect. But holy hell, compared to the U.S., we’re living in a damn utopia. How are you not rioting in the streets daily?

Sending love and solidarity from across the Atlantic. You deserve better. Seriously.

I came to the realization that we’re all slaves to money a couple years ago , but tried to compartmentalize it . Now i can’t cause i’m close to finishing my degree and i have to think about what career i want to have with a biological sciences degree . I have a new summer job, it’s full time as the front desk person at a hotel , overnight shift. Most of my time i am reading, on my phone or watching anime . It feels like im cheating the system it’s great but i know it’s only temporary . 

Anyways, is there any way i can break out of this mindset that for the next 45 yrs of my life im going to have to work 40+ hrs a week or else ill starve and be homeless? I want to be a productive member of society , I wouldn’t want to have no purpose in life but i dont know if i can find the kind of job that gives me said purpose . I love nature, animals, science. I’ve always been drawn to that for as long as i can remember, but what if even that doesn’t make me happy and it feels like im a money slave ? My parents tell me i’m wasting my potential and i’m just unmotivated , but it’s deeper than that. I see the corruption in everything , every little thing is exploited for a profit . Our food is filled with poisons , our medical system profits off of that . Healthier food is more expensive and the lower classes have no access to it . We’re politically divided , racially divided , divided by wealth class . Education is a profit and a trap to get young adults in debt . Also feels like we have no say in who the presidential candidates are , not like it matters when you can’t even be a successful politician unless you’re rich and corrupt . I’m sure the genuine people that want to be in a position of power like that get eaten alive like it’s nothing. Everything that I was taught in school about how America is the greatest country was all bullshit . I get called spoiled, ungrateful, lazy, and unmotivated for seeing through the system . How do I get motivated when i don’t know what i have to look forward to , a life of being a money slave til i die ? "

272,3,"I work full time at a nonprofit in California in a non-exempt role. I’ve been in the position for less than a year. Last week, I had a meeting with my supervisor and her boss (the director). It was framed as a feedback check-in, but it quickly turned into something that felt more like a setup. I’ve followed all workplace policies, have never been written up, and until now had only received positive feedback—including a satisfactory performance review just last month, my first since being hired. But this meeting left me feeling targeted and quietly pushed out.

Here’s what happened:

I brought up not getting lunch breaks at events—they used it to threaten to remove me from events altogether
Because I’m non-exempt, I’ve been trying to stay compliant. At some in-person events, I wasn’t always able to take a proper, uninterrupted 30-minute lunch. I brought this up and offered reasonable solutions like flexing my time or splitting my lunch into two shorter breaks. Instead of working with me, the director shot everything down. He said he doesn’t want the team working on “different schedules” and “doesn’t prefer” that kind of flexing. Then he said maybe I should stop attending events altogether and just focus on administrative work since I’m concerned about the lunches, and it’s a “gray area”. It felt like I was being punished for trying to solve a legal compliance issue.

They brought up every instance of time off—even though it was protected and approved—and reframed it as a performance concern
The director listed my sick days, a bereavement day, some medical appointments, and an upcoming vacation. Then he said:
“You’re legally allowed to take your time off, but we’re also allowed to reassess your position and value when you do.”

That line really stuck with me. He also pointed out that I hadn’t had a “full uninterrupted month” and acted like that was somehow harming our deliverables or funder relationships, even though no one had ever said anything before. I followed every policy. Nothing was last minute. But he made it clear they were holding it against me.

They blamed me for a vacation that was approved through the correct process
The trip was planned well before I was hired, but it was 10 months away, so I didn’t mention it during onboarding. Later, I submitted the time off formally and it was approved. In this meeting, the director said I should have told them up front and said I “put the team in an awkward position” by not being there for a conference I didn’t even know was being scheduled. It felt like they were intentionally using a normal PTO request to make me look unreliable.

They questioned whether I should stay in the role
The director reminded me that my contract ends soon and said whether it continues depends on whether I want to stay, whether the funder sees value, and whether the team thinks it makes sense. There were no clear deliverables or feedback about my performance—just vague criteria that made it sound like I was already on my way out.

They threatened closer monitoring of my hours and task time
After I brought up the lunch break issue, the director said:
“If you want to be exact about time and hours, we can do that,”
and then said he could start analyzing how long my tasks take. He mentioned that if a slide deck took two hours instead of thirty minutes, that could be “flagged.” I’ve never been told my pacing is an issue and have always met deadlines. This sounded like retaliation for bringing up compliance and a veiled threat to micromanage.

They ended with a “tip” about who gets promoted
Right before wrapping up, the director said something along the lines of:
“Just so you know, the people who grow here and move up are the ones who go above and beyond—not just doing the minimum.”
No one accused me of doing the minimum, but this came after a long list of ways they’d already implied I was a burden. It felt like a final dig. The message was clear: if you don’t overextend yourself—even as a non-exempt employee—we won’t see you as promotable or worth keeping.

None of this felt like genuine feedback. It felt like a coordinated conversation to justify reducing my role or not renewing my contract. Until I raised a concern about lunch breaks and started taking protected time off, everything was fine. It felt like a threat. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? Can an employer take away parts of your job over a classification issue rather than working with you? And is it legal to turn approved, protected time off into a justification for reassessing your role?

I’m documenting everything. Just trying to figure out what to do next.

All I wanted was a lunch break 😩

TL;DR:
I’m a non-exempt employee at a California nonprofit. After raising a concern about missed lunch breaks at events, I was threatened to be pulled from events work entirely. In a recent meeting, leadership brought up all my (approved and protected) time off as a problem, questioned my value to the team, suggested I might not be renewed, and said they’d start closely monitoring how long tasks take. This happened just one month after I got a satisfactory performance review. It felt less like feedback and more like retaliation and a quiet push-out.

273,3,"I have money saved up. I won’t starve, I’m just so burnt out man. But society will think I’m lazy and pass on hiring me so I guess I can’t.

I’ve been working at the same company for 6 years. The pay is OK, the people are fine, and a huge plus is I get to work from home even still in 2025 so I’ve been reluctant to spend my free time looking for something else. Grass might not be greener on the other side, I’ve seen plenty of horror stories on here.. Holy moly the work itself sucks though, especially in the last 2 or 3 years. I don’t even want to get into it, I could type paragraph after paragraph but I don’t even want to bother.

I’m 29. Haven’t even thought about dating because I’m always worried about work and I know I would be a bummer to talk to. I’m not good at faking happiness.

Up until graduating from college in 2019 I had an optimistic outlook on life. Work has converted me into a pessimist.

274,3,"My Boss started a pip with me because I wasn’t fulfilling expectations. My father died this early this semester, quite suddenly from leukemia, and I haven’t been very productive. One of the issues she stated was I wasn’t empathetic. I asked her to define what empathy means and she said it was being respectful. She also said I should do an effective communication class but couldn’t recommend any.

275,3,"Hi so I'm not from the US, but I lurk here pretty often.

As everyone knows, housing is growing scarcer and more expensive by the day. If it's not millionaires gentrifying new cities or Airbnb properties taking away long-term rentals, then it's the NIMBY crowd who refuses to allow for new construction. The one word I never hear in those discussions is -expropriation- 

In my country, things got so bad that around 100 years ago the government decided to just take land from the church and rich land owners and just give it to the people. Guess what? The church didn't disappear and rich people were still rich. I know in the US such things are disparaged because ""socialism,"" but lack of afordable housing seems like it's about to reach a tipping point. I'm not delusional. I don't think this could change the world or solve the problem,  but at least it's one thing that could help. I bet there's a lot of people who might not even know what ""expropriation"" means. 

But hey, maybe you mention it to someone at work. Maybe they mention it to their family. Maybe the family searches it on Google. Maybe now there's 20 new people who are aware of this. That's a win. Just my two cents. "
276,3,"Just started a new job last week. The interview process went smoothly and everyone seemed like nice people. The office is very nice and has some cool perks - free snacks, drinks, etc. which is nice.

Two problems: 
1) My manager is a real dickhead. He was happy as can be in the interview, very pleasant. But he ended up being a very impatient micro-manager.

2) The posting was a little misleading. I'm an IT guy - sysadmin. I was told I would be doing support for a manufacturing facility's systems. What I am actually doing is database management for products/inventory, with a side of fixing issues.

I'm continuing to apply for other things but the job market sucks and I'm stuck for now. Can't quit without something else as I need to pay my mortgage. Any advice to get the total hatred feeling to subside?"

Such BS! I already have another job lined up starting July so I'm not really worried, just such a weird way for them to fire me! "
280,3,"I work in marketing at a mid-sized company. I was hired to work on digital campaigns, strategy, and content. But my manager, who has no actual marketing background, has slowly turned my job into a chaotic soup of admin, support, and make-work tasks — while constantly micromanaging, offloading his responsibilities, and retaliating anytime I question his logic.

Here’s a list of the stuff he’s done. Let me know if I’m overreacting, or if this is as toxic as it feels.

Micromanagement 101:
	•	Constantly watches my computer screen through a glass partition. No exaggeration.
	•	Asked for KPIs multiple times — nothing. No goals, no benchmarks, no clarity.  However obsessed with me clocking in on time. Zero interest in results, just performative control.
	•	Asks me how my weekend was, every Monday, just to say the exactly same line: “Super cool. That’s the best weekend.” 
	•	On WFH days, he literally sits in the Teams chat, starts typing (but never sends anything), just to wait and see when I come online. I’ve caught him doing it multiple times. That’s straight-up creepy.

Passive aggression & retaliation:
	•	After I told him one project “wasn’t possible” to complete by deadline, he started ignoring my PTO and WFH requests.
	•	When I requested time off for a family obligation, he ghosted my emails and never gave approval, basically forcing me to beg or give up.
	•	Told other project stakeholders I was “at lunch” when I wasn’t even notified about the meeting — clearly trying to keep me out of the loop.
	•	Refuses to approve even minor flexibility after I challenged him.

No actual leadership:
	•	Zero marketing strategy, no roadmap, no clue who our audience is. When I asked about goals, segmentation, or even who our target audience is, he had nothing to offer except, “I’ll have to check with the higher management.”He blocks me from directly speaking to leadership, even though he clearly has no answers himself.
	•	He has changed roles at every past company — now randomly managing marketing.
	•	Always talks about “team spirit” but isolates me when I ask for clarity or structure.

I’ve documented everything and I’m planning my exit. But honestly, I’m just stunned by how someone this insecure and underqualified got into a position of authority — and how miserable they can make someone’s job while pretending to be “supportive.”

If you’ve dealt with a fake-nice micromanager like this, how did you handle it? Did you leave? Confront them? Escalate?"
281,3,"How do you deal with boredom in office? I feel like I actually work 3 hours tops, and the rest of time I just pretend being busy, and it's killing me.

The office also sucks. It's one of these open offices where I have 0 privacy, everyone can just walk by and see whatever I'm doing. How do you deal with it? How to make it less boring? I'm already looking for a new, hopefully less boring job.



Just wanted to vent a bit"
282,3,"Just had another ""check-in"" with our HR rep today and I'm reminded why I can't stand these people. The whole conversation was just buzzword bingo mixed with fake concern.

""How are you finding the work-life balance?"" she asks, while our team has been pulling 60 hour weeks for two months straight. When I mentioned being burned out, suddenly it's about ""managing expectations"" and ""leveraging resources more effectively."" Like, just say you don't give a shit instead of wrapping it in corporate speak.

Then there's the classic ""we're all family here"" bullshit while they're actively looking for ways to cut costs and eliminate positions. Family doesn't fire you over budget cuts, Karen.

The worst part is how they act like they're on your side during these meetings, nodding along and taking notes like they actually care. But the second there's any real conflict between you and management, guess whose side they're on? Spoiler: it's not yours.

I've worked at three different companies and it's the same shit everywhere. HR exists to protect the company from you, not to help you. They just dress it up with team building exercises and mental health awareness emails while doing absolutely nothing to address the actual problems."

I told him that I have no obligation to work outside working hours and there’s no reason for me to bring that 4lbs laptop home every single day but he told me that I am damaging a company that makes million? I told him that I work to live and wanted to keep my life-work balance I wanted to have time for my hobbies, my own personal animation project and time for myself which I can only have after working for almost 10 hours everyday at the office, in which he replied with frustration that nobody is work to live it is bullshit and everyone should strive to live for work otherwise they’re being ungrateful for the opportunity the company given to them.

I told my bosses I would have to look for something else unless they could allow me to go part time. I asked in Feb, they said no. Asked each month since, they said no. I got a job offer last week, so I called the higher ups and reconfirmed that part time would definitely not be an option, they said no. Accepted the new job and sent my resignation on Friday. Got a call Tuesday that I COULD HAVE PART TIME. I’m done. I can and can’t believe it all at the same time. What a crappy thing to do. 

Edit: not that I should need to explain, but my dog is a rescue who is an anxious basket-case who’s been rejected by multiple dog sitters and walkers. It’s not like we aren’t trying. And I did actively look for and quit my job partially because of him. So come on dude. "
289,3,"During our morning standup someone will politely say, ""Hey, just a reminder I'm out next week"" and without fail she'll make a comment like, ""Wow, you must barely have any days left"" or ""What do I do to get as many vacation days as you!"" She does it every single time someone takes a day.  ""Wow, you're taking all your vacation first half of the year, you're not going to have any left!"" Then I'm subconsciously like damn maybe I'm taking too much time, so I check the PTO calendar and I have three weeks saved.  I hate that she makes me feel so awkward about taking the time I've earned."
290,3,"Alright guys. 33M here. I posted awhile back so this is kinda an update. 

Recap: I've been burnt out since end April from work. I work as a grave digger and gardener at a cemetery . Boss not only keeps calling me, but wants me to come in weekly for coffee so I don't 'lose touch with collegues'. This is stonewalling my recovery process. Even the company doctor says I need to distance myself from work.

I went into work again because boss kept nagging that I come in for coffee. With a long sigh I agreed. I thought if I expressed how I needed to distance myself from work he would respect that so I'd finally be able to focus on recovery. This isn't what happened. We had an appointment at 9am. I requested specifically NOT to talk during break hours because I was in no mood to talk to colleagues and play 'Dr.Phil' with their questions. He made me wait 20min. I was already hearing footsteps heading towards the cafeteria so I knew it was almost break time. Luckily he pulled me in right before my colleagues saw me. He told me he has read the initial report from the company doctor. In the report it states 'He can do minimal tasks'. My boss told me that he expects me to come back into work next week Monday for 2 hours a day , and build my stamina from there. I knew this would happen . So I emailed the company doctor ahead of time to clarify what she meant by this in the report. She stated it means that I'm able to do my daily routine AT HOME (i.e. cooking, cleaning, etc) and NOT work related tasks. I showed my boss this email. I could tell he was visiably annoyed and sent me on my way as he angrily lit a cigarette. Here in my country the advice of the company doctor has priority. 

I thought I'd finally have the peace and quiet I need to recover now. But nope. Long behold after about a week and a half later my boss calls me up again. He says that my appointment with the company doctor has been moved FORWARD from the 19th June to the 11th. He stated that he did that because he feels 'i could use the help quickly' and that I should see this as something positive as he 'is concerned for me and wants to help'. I was completely speechless. If a company doctor is sick or can't make it FINE, change the date, but THIS? No way. Something fishy is going on. I know we are understaffed. I also know our department has the highest percentage of sick people out of everyone. That's why I strongly believe my boss is trying to speed up the process so I can get my butt back to work faster. Especially because summer vacation is around the corner and could use the extra hands. He simply doesn't care about my wishes and the fact of the matter is, my body decides when it wants to get better, NOT HIM . Speeding up the process won't get me back to work quicker. It's only irritating me more and stonewalling my recovery process further. I feel he doesn't respect me at all. To add insult to injury , my boss also had a burnout last year. He was able to take 6 months off. No one was breathing down his neck, he was allowed to take his sweet time. I ask for the same respect and consideration but nope, because I'm under him, I don't deserve it apparently. I'm just really upset !

Sorry for the kinda long post. I felt like venting. Thanks for bearing with me here! "
291,3,"I just need to vent. Despite 7 years of experience and a year in the company I just got demoted by my contractor to junior. They didn't even bother to tell me I just found out through new timesheet template. 

I asked for explanation and got:

The client ""decided to map everyone under the profiles which in terms of costs are the most alike the positions under the previous FWC. 

So, therefore, in your case particularly (also some other colleagues), they decided to use the “junior” profile as financially it reflects the same conditions as the previous contract.
(...) 
Nevertheless, I would still like to reiterate my message below, in terms of the conditions and your internal contract and position, nothing changes. These timesheets are only used internally for invoicing purposes and are part of an admin procedure; they in no way reflect your experience, expertise, or role.""

In the same email, she goes on responding to my request to renegotiate salary. For some context I made it because I accidentally found a document with how much our client is paying for me and turns out I make around 20% of that. 

"" While I understand and respect the right to re-negotiate conditions and communicate transparently about this, given your role did not change at all in the last 7 months, nor have you been upgraded to a different or more senior profile, I do not understand how a nearly 50% increase would reflect your position now in such a short time span. As you can imagine, we try to treat everyone fairly and keep our team happy, but I am afraid I cannot accommodate your request for a salary increase at this time.
I am of course open to further discussions in case your profile is upgraded, or any significant changes occur in the meantime.""

So we canot give you a more because you didn't get promoted but thouse roles don't mater and it should not concern you. Lol

Thank you for reading my vent. "
292,3,"why am I working? Just so that people who aren't can do nothing, smoke, play video games, and have kids and immediately after see other people? Is that the basis of American rot? Or is that just 1% propaganda and most people are decent but getting bent over daily with wages that don't keep up with the rising costs of everything? Maybe both? Maybe a mixing and matching from both schools of thought, creating a non solidified picture with no easy answer?"
293,3,"And clocking out late. And not taking my breaks and lunch on time. I'm enjoying this change in my professional career.

Good supervisors exist."
294,3,"I work in Healthcare and I am ready to switch jobs, but the issue is the job market seems like trash right now. Around this time last year, there were SO many different jobs out there, now it seems slim. I am a bit nervous to leave my company because it seems everyone is tightening up and I have seniority here. Debating on just riding out a few more months unless given a great opportunity. How about anyone else?"
295,3,"Hi all, looking for some advice and input. After several frustrating months at my last job, I was fired today. Ironically enough, I was fired shortly after I accepted a new job offer on the phone, since I've been actively looking for a little while.

My entire reason for leaving is my ex boss. He is controlling, insecure, doesn't know how to estimate or project manage but wants to micromanage every step of a task. Is extremely forgetful. I know part of my exit was due to him projecting some of his behaviors onto what he perceived I was doing, and him ignoring any explanations I could provide to the contrary.

I've never really gone to HR about any issues I was having and I was going to bring some of these things up when I resigned from my role but that conversation won't happen now. I know life isn't fair but it feels particularly frustrating that I've been treated how I was and there's no documentation of it. It's a small company and none of the employees like this manager, but other people have left because of him before and nothing is changed. I'm thinking of sending a detailed email to HR (and maybe even the owners) explicitly explaining every thing that I've been experiencing the past few months, but I just don't know if it's worth it. It might make me feel better but if nothing changes for anyone who works there, then I almost wonder what's the point. And I doubt I would face any legal issues from this but is that something I should consider to?

This turned more into a vent post than an ask for advice, sorry. I've never been fired before so I'm frustrated because I don't think it was just and also it came a day before I was going to put in my two weeks. If anyone has any advice for the conflicting feelings I'm going through that would be appreciated. "
296,3,"Well, I was pulled into HR today to be told im being let go, the reason? Not a lack of work ethic, not a poor attitude or poor performance, but because another employee is transferring to our location.

What's different between me and this employee? 

They have family members that work for the company

I have eight years of industry experience

They are fresh out of high-school and moving to our area for a fresh start

I have a wife and two children to feed

The exact words told to me while I was being fired: ""Unfortunately we had to make the decision of taking care of our own, she really needs the help and the job.""

This was also after I asked my boss when he first announced her transfer if my job was safe, he assured me in text ""You will be unaffected by this.""

Im now trying to figure out what I'll need to sell to be able to pay our bills this next month. 

The job market is in such a bad spot especially in my industry and im terrified. Im extremely angry and upset by this, and the lack of care that was shown to me as this was happening just broke me. 


I hate corporate America.

If anyone has any Sys admin/IT jobs in or near Georgia let me know. 
"
297,3,"You ever go into an interview and just get immediate ""i don't like you"" vibes from the interviewer? 

I tried to ignore it, and I felt like I did ok, but I just felt like the interviewer X'ed my name out as soon as I left the room. I don't think they ever made eye contact with me. Kept looking directly above me. Tried not to focus on it.

I got the email at 10 fucking pm.... like did they stay up late just to say ""fuck you""?

Was it like a midnight snack, and they were like ""oh yeah, that fucking guy.""

It was a fucking clamp truck job (type of forklift). I have 10+ years experience driving damn near every type of forklift.

You can't tell me the shit isn't personal sometimes."
298,3,"I need to rant.
The company I work at is huge on processes, they got a process document for everything. I am incredibly surprised that there is not yet a process on how to correctly use the shitter.
Whatever, at least I am protected if I act according to the rules, right? WRONG! 
Told a client something on the phone (strictly according to process, down to the exact wording) and got shit on by a coworker (no less) for causing issues with that client. That coworker acting like my boss is a whole 'nother can of worms that isn't even worth getting into.
But let me tell you, he is management material! All talk, no substance."
299,3,"For context I’m 15, (16 this summer) live in the middle of nowhere in England and am currently doing GCSEs. In a three months I’ll be entitled to minimum wage of £7.55 per hour, which to me currently sounds like infinite money. 

From what I’ve heard, the job market in the UK is hell. I’m too exhausted to go into detail about what I’ve read, but it doesn’t sound good. Paired with the fact that there are basically no employment opportunities where I live, and that both of my local towns (about 20 minutes away by car) rarely hire teenagers, I doubt I’ll be getting a job any time soon. Even work experience is difficult to get, I’ve emailed multiple local businesses about it and so far I’ve either not got any response, or have been told that they don’t offer volunteering opportunities. My only remaining glimmers of hope in this area would be either volunteering with my local Finds Liaison Officers with the Portable Antiquities Scheme (still need to email them) or at a local antiques shop, who are sometimes understaffed (I sorta know the owner, which might help)

At this point in my life I don’t need a job, it would just be nice to have some extra money. If it’s hard now, it’s undoubtedly going to get much more difficult in the future, especially as I’m pointing my life towards Archaeology-It’s my passion and has been for most of my life. The pay’s low, the hours can be long and it’s a very competitive yet undersaturated field, but I’d rather make ~£20,340.60 per year after tax than become trapped in an office forever. 

I’m socially awkward, struggle to talk to people I don’t know or aren’t used to being around, and don’t have many qualities that make me employable/noticeable when applying for a job. Combined with my lack of work experience and distance from most employers, I doubt I’ll be working soon

This isn’t really coherent and I can’t find the motivation to read through it all, I was meant to be revising for my upcoming Geography and English Language exams tomorrow but keep wasting time on Reddit"
300,3,"We always say that it’s impossible to fight back against these large corporations and the government when it comes to labor laws… but do you ever wonder what would happen if we ALL just stopped showing up, paying bills and spending money for a period of time? Seems silly I know, but how else are we going to end this outdated idea that we need to bend the knee and work ourselves to death. After all, we are the land of the “free.”

Edit: Nice to see I’m not alone in this way of thinking. It’s sad to see the fear in Americans. This is a reminder to take care of one another. Educate one another. Stop and think if you really NEED something or if you’re just getting sucked into consumerism. I hate to see us all working our a**es off just to live in fear. Work to live, don’t live to work 💞"
301,3,"I am so tired. I hate my job. Well not the job but rather the hours. I just looked at the schedule for this summer and it is grueling. I do need the hours because I'm hoping to study this autumn but damn, I'm not motivated to work. I do need the money if i want to be able to afford somewhere to live while studying but I'm not even sure I'll  make enough to afford housing for a year. I can't decide if I should just grit my teeth and try to make something of myself or find some old house to squat in and try to survive on mushrooms. 
This was a rant, not sure it makes sense. "
302,3,I’ve had a job since I was like 12 and man it’s just never going to end. Right when I start getting to a comfortable salary Covid hits and inflation wiped out any raise I had got for like 10 yrs. Yeah I have some money in a 401k but I have young kids so I’m realizing that I’m just working probably until I die. Shit is depressing. 
303,3,"Boss told me last week that they “can’t afford” to keep my hours the same even though business is fine. I went from 35 to 15 hours just like that. rent’s due soon, but they don’t care. They’re pushing more of my work onto the others,  feels like they just want me to quit so they don’t have to fire me. i’m done with this place. . anyone else dealing with the same BS?"
304,3,"i needed somewhere to figure out if my reaction to this situation is irrational or if other ppl would feel the same way. 

my job has a work gc that is active outside store hours. the owner of the store will sometimes send long texts of instructions or announcements for employees to read. 

i typically do not sit down and read these, i skim them and go about my day. but i just learned from a coworker that many of these texts end with something like “like this message to show you read it”. i’ve never done this before, and i don’t think i plan on doing it. 

maybe this is petty, but i do not appreciate being told what to do on my personal cell phone when i’m not clocked in. it feels kind of micromanaging too. like if you didnt get a notification that i put a heart on a message that makes me less of a worker. i work hard and enjoy my job when i’m there, not when im off the clock. 

so far, not liking these messages hasn’t negatively affected my job whatsoever. but it does worry me that my boss might think i’m lazy for this when that’s absolutely not true. and for context, this isn’t my career. i’m a college kid who gets paid 11.50 an hour…

anyway, please let me know your thoughts on this. i don’t plan on saying anything to my boss/coworkers but i would love to see what other people say. "
305,3,"Just a rant. I hate corporate culture. I hate the lunches I have to attend and make small talk with people I would have never met outside of work, I’m introverted and need my lunch to recharge (I have work friends but I don’t need to bootlick them to have a potential promotion). I hate that I’m looked as mean or rude cause I am introverted and prefer to be alone at work than be in a group of people being forced. hate the fact I have to pretend to be friends with everyone if I even want to be considered for a promotion. I hate playing the elementary work games to “strengthen our work relationship” and having to pretend it’s fun. I hate this ego stroking culture to get where you want to get. 5 minutes of interacting with coworkers is like 2 hours of actual work. I’d rather cheesegrate my balls than have another “this weather is so crazy lately” or “what’s the summer plans” conversation. "
306,3,"Mine is anything related to agile or culture, I feel it's a madeup corporate bs."
307,3,"Early tech startup, yc backed, okayish compensation, meh.

This is what happened.

So, I came across this company and found it pretty interesting.
They were hiring for growth interns and they posted that on LinkedIn to call for applications. 
I applied and asked some questions in the email about the role and setup.
I received an email a day later saying they would like me to do an assignment before they finalize the interview, because there were JUST SO MANY people who had applied.
Alright, I thought.
I lost it by the time I read the second task

It said something like.

Task one: outline growth ideas. Fair enough, it's a growth internship
TASK TWO: post about us on social media and send the sum of impressions

I am still furious. They genuinely seemed good, but this made me think more than twice. Do some people really not realize that others can sense if something is a bait?
"
308,3,"
So recently I started at a company, and things actually began pretty great. But then the real horror began.

The HR guy created such a toxic environment that I can’t believe it’s actually happening. It’s a pretty small office, and at the end of the workday, we need to announce to this HR guy that we’re leaving. Unusual and weird, but I could live with it.

Then he started staying in the kitchen with the door closed, and would get annoyed when we needed something or came in to tell him we were leaving. So he put a notice on the door — either “please be patient” or literally “please wait.” What the actual fuck?

Then he sent a message to the group chat saying that kitchen usage was now restricted to two times a day, and that from X to Y o’clock, the kitchen was for the management team only.

What the hell is going on? I’m obviously not in the US, but this behavior is still unacceptable where I’m from.
"
309,3,"I’m a full-stack dev (10+ YOE) and recently took on a client who:

1. Requires me to be on Slack 20hrs/week ""just in case"" and gets mad if I don't reply within hours.
2. Only pays when HE creates a Trello task (e.g., \~30min pay)
3. Routinely DMs ""quick requests"" that never hit Trello -> *unpaid work*

**Last week:**

* **Time spent:** 7 hours (Slack monitoring, DM requests)
* **Paid time:** 30 minutes (for 3 Trello tasks)
* **Effective hourly:** $12 (vs. my $95 contract rate)

Is this ""pay-per-task + free on-call time"" expectation normal?"
310,3,"I have a good job and for a long time I felt passionate about my work - like my career ""mattered."" As I get more experienced, have burnt out once, seen some shit... I feel like I've stopped caring a bit? Like I take some pride in doing my job well ... within limits. Within my work day with standard breaks and without losing my mind. But I feel like I'm going through this transition of work being my identity to work being... just a job? Like I don't get so emotionally invested and pour my heart into every little thing and go above and beyond trying to prove I'm the office ""rockstar.""  Now work just feels like the stupid shit I have to put up with to pay my bills, provide for my kid, enjoy my life? And I feel guilty about that because my work is ""important"" and I am privileged to make a good wage and do office work just type type typing and talk talk talking at meetings. My line of work is also coming up on big cuts and I feel like I am supposed to be hustling but I can't find the energy to give a damn? It's like I know I should try to be competitive but also why can't I just do my time and do it relatively well and earn a damn pay cheque without threats of layoffs? 

I don't know... It feels like since I became a parent that is where my heart is - and work just funds that.

Am I delusional and out of touch? Is this normal? A phase?"
311,3,"So I just came back from vacay and I have to pick up my keycard. I don't come in til the weekend but was asked to come OUT OF WORK HOURS to collect it. I said can you please leave it outside today, she said yes, and travelled to work, taking time out of my day. Turns out she didn't leave it out. So I go home empty handed, with no access to work this weekend. She said she can't leave it out til the weekend because it's ""unsafe"", but I am not going down again to collect it cause she's useless and never does her job lmao. Wtf do I do???

312,3,"I'm in the middle of a high risk pregnancy following two years of IVF and an ectopic, so I'm stressed to say the least. One of the things I'm doing is taking my full breaks (two 15s and a 1 hour lunch). I have them in my calendar so I don't get booked for meetings and so I don't forget. I usually go to the lunch room since there are plush booths there which are actually comfortable to sit in.

Three times now since I've started doing this I've had someone remark on me being there. People will come in to get coffee/water and such and most just ignore me. But two of the executives and an HR rep have all commented on my breaks. 

""Must be nice being able to just sit and do nothing.""
""You're just sitting here?""
""Isn't this your busy season?""

I've basically just said ""yup, I'm taking my contracted breaks"" and gone back to my book each time. Sure is getting annoying though.

313,3,"I am 18 and graduated high school. I recently got flown out to another state by my family to work an IT job (Support Engineer role) for the summer — not because I wanted to, but because my brother works there, my mom works in IT too, and they basically all pressured me into taking the opportunity.

It’s a “good job” on paper. They’re paying me, they’re trying to set me up for a future. But I never asked for this life. I never asked to sit at a desk 9 hours a day, surrounded by people twice my age, in a town I don’t feel safe in (literally a former sundown town), isolated from my friends and support system back home.

They told me I’d be “eased into it,” but I got thrown into meetings on day 1, watching over ticket queues, being asked to do math I don’t understand, and trying to learn complicated tools like ServiceNow and SQL while I’m still trying to process the fact I’m not in my own damn house anymore.

I’m miserable. Genuinely. I’ve been crying almost every night. I feel like I’m not built for this. 

But I don’t know what to do. My family sees this as a “once in a lifetime opportunity.” I feel like if I quit, I’ll be seen as ungrateful or lazy. They’ve already spent money to fly me out, bought me work clothes, told extended family. I feel so much guilt. But this job is making me feel physically sick.

I just want to go home. I’d honestly rather work at a grocery store, a warehouse, anything where I don’t feel like I’m pretending to be someone I’m not.

Has anyone else been in this kind of situation before? How do I get out of this without burning bridges or being seen as a failure?"

We waste away the one shot at life that we have to make rich people I don't even know even richer, while I struggle for the bare minimum to physically survive? This country is a joke, and I want to learn how to wake up and help others wake up. The 9-5 (now 8-5) is broken. We as humans were not designed for this.

""I don't feel well. I need a day to rest up.""

Perfectly acceptable. If it becomes a pattern, than we may need to have a conversation down the line, but it really bothers me that people feel the need to qualify things in depth. I'm not your dad. Work should revolve around life, never the other way around. 

I understand that not every direct report you deal with in your day to day work life will feel this way, but just know that a lot of  bosses with that mindset are aging out. If they don't, then they don't respect you and you and they don't deserve you."
317,3,"**I’ve burned out three times. I’ve finally left my career behind.**

I know “burnout” is overused these days, but I’ve experienced it in a very real way — three separate times — all from working in finance. I'm 35 so still fairly young but after 12 years I'm sorta done with this career. I've had a bunch of therapy and career coaching so I'm alright for now, but there's still a lot of anger.

**First time (2015):**  
This was my second job. I was working at a tech startup as a junior, but they never hired the finance team they were supposed to. I ended up doing the work of a manager and senior manager combined. I worked weekends, late nights (even stayed over at the office), and once cancelled my birthday plans because of a flu… that lasted six months. I kept telling myself it was normal. The company eventually agreed to sick leave — but Ubered me in for half days anyway because they had no one else. After all that, my new boss disliked how much I knew “for a junior” and managed me out. I now know it was constructive dismissal, but at the time I was too young and naive to realize.

**Second time (post-COVID):**  
Like many, I was working in my pyjamas till 4pm and forgetting to eat. I was in a more senior role but still doing the work of a full team. My COO left, and I basically took over the finance function. My boss? Hired through one interview by someone who knew nothing about finance — and they didn’t either. I imploded in 2022. My mental health hit a breaking point, which HR had been monitoring for several months. Eventually, I sued the company for negligence and got six months of paid leave.

**Third time (trying to take it easy):**  
I took a finance assistant job at a college — something quieter, lower pressure. But from day one, I'd finish at 5pm. My boss (less experienced than me) seemed insecure. What started as little digs turned into outright hostility: accusations of slacking, yelling, constant undermining. HR even stepped in after witnessing her behavior, but the situation didn’t change. I left before it got worse.

I'd like to mention that in the third job, I witnessed an older Finance Director working with my boss who had brain and lung cancer. There was a lot of reliance on this FD and when a particularly taxing financial audit arose, late working my boss had become attuned to her entire career ended up taking its toll. Needless to say, the FD's tumors increased in size and she passed away in December 2024. Management sort of accepted it and went to the funeral, there were some tears but after about 2 weeks everything went back to normal. Terrifyingly, there were no reviews on workplace culture or working hours.

Now? I’ve walked away from finance.  
I’m moving to a new LCOL city and starting fresh. I don’t know what I’m going to do yet — but it won’t be this. The wounds are still fresh, but I finally feel like I have space to figure out what *I* want.

TL;DR if you're reading this and you've been considering it for a while, make the jump and try something new. It can't be half as bad as you think it's going to be, and 'corporate slave mentality' is something people shouldn't have to put up with. What I've really come to enjoy is face-to-face contact and engaging with people, rather than constantly talking on endless video calls or trying to discern the mood of someone from 2 lines in an email.

Wish me luck! It's a bit scary but as long as I don't have to deal with another invoice, I might be alright."
318,3,"If you didn't have to work a regular job, what would you want to be doing with your extra time? Hobbies? Travel? "
319,3,"Ok gang I need to sound off ideas / options here.

2.5 years into this company,
They love me in the busy times, dont care for me that much in the slow times, but still give me full time hours (for now...) 

My department was restructured 3 times in the last year, old boss kept on mentionning how going 'casual time, might be better for me' and also tried to paint me into a corner to resign once or twice... They got De-Moted during restructuring. 

For about 4 months of the year, the busy time, travel time is nuts and alp vacation requests need to be made 3 months ahead of time (though this wasnt really written in the policy, it just came up when I filed and was denied my latest request) 

Legislative changes means Im much closer to getting laid off in the next few months, because our industry is getting shook good.

Its become apparent at home that this schedule is no longer sustainable.

Aside from 'keep looking for other work'

Do I 

1) throw my weight around and start making demands ? (With an offer elsewhere in hand)

2) tow the line, keep my head down and ride this out ? 

3) lay it all out as to why the corporate culture is contributing to a high turnover and loss productivity because upper management is incapable of accepting changes thought of by lower levels ?

320,3,I was told by my supervisor that I shouldn’t look comfortable at work (relaxing in a chair) even when the work was done. I guess it’s just the millennial in me but I can’t help but wonder why does management hate for you to look relaxed or comfortable? Always older gen x or boomers. It’s like they think you’re supposed to be miserable at work. I hate old people in the work place lol 
321,3,"Started a new job as a service writer at a local auto repair shop. Really liked it even with being new to the industry and having a learning curve ahead of me. I was told in the job interview that my lack of experience wasn't a problem and they'd happily train me on the job just like they had my predecessor. 

A week and a half after I started they told me I was being let go because they found someone with more experience. I have two takeaways from this.

1. I'm never working in automotive again.

2. If employers are going to keep looking for someone after I've already been hired, then I'm going to keep looking for a better job as well. "
322,3,"My boss is nice - a workaholic - but nice. It's her 50th birthday in a couple weeks. I offered to make a cake as that's what I've always done for colleague's birthdays, nothing fancy just a simple that doesn't take long to make. This spiralled into her asking me to invite other people we work with that she likes to enjoy said cake. The cake was planned for 4 now it'll be who knows how many. On top of that my colleague wants me chip in 50$ for a gift. I'm so annoyed by this, I should never habe to gift up or throw a party. I'm so mad that I think I'm going to start looking for a new job.

323,3,"Florida. My sister just lost a job working for a resort on a remote island that can only be accessed by ferry. The only thing on this island is the resort. No one lives there. The 1% and celebrities stay there because it’s so secluded and private. 

Long story short, the resort is under new management. The old management would clock employees in when they got on the ferry. It’s over 30 minute ride. The new management clocks them in when they reach the island. 

Here’s my issue with that. When they ride the ferry they are expected to be “on” with the customers. Customers will often ask them questions. Ask to have their photo taken. Etc. they are expected to sit there with their hands on their lap and not on their phones. If anyone ever complains about their decorum on the ferry they would be written up. 

Is this wage theft? Shouldn’t they be clocked in on the ferry? It seems like management is trying to have it both ways. "
324,3,"Sounds obvious enough. 'Time when you aren't working' is a nice blanket statement. But in some cases, especially where I work, it feels like you're expected to stay super close to where the work is happening 'just in case' or in a few cases get told 'youre just driving, it's not that hard, just have a break during travel'. Needless to say, not a popular idea.

I define a 'Break' as a period of time where theoretically, I could lock myself in for a snooze and not be bothered by anyone until that period of time is up.

Does anyone else experience this kind of (being devils advocate here) misunderstanding?"
325,3,"I’m in tech in the U.K. so it isn’t toooooo bad in comparison to others, but christ if I hear more “personal plans”, “development”, agile working and other shite, I will lose my mind.

326,3,"I was 25, fresh out of college. I only had internships and summer jobs as experience. I get through months of ignored applications and ""no""s, and after a few interviews that led nowhere, I ace an interview for a small company. I get the job, I am happy and excited, I picture myself staying there at least 5 years (if I get a permanent contract), maybe more.

2 years later, I am put on sick leave for severe burnout and depression. I quit and contributed to a lawsuit against that company with other ex-employees.

So, what happened? Our manager was a sociopath, control-freak micromanager with big emotional regulation issues. The kind who would randomly scream at you in front of everyone if he was having a bad day. Who would use all your psychological weaknesses against you. Who would stay behind you and criticize everything you were doing. He was a skilled manipulator too, and would find ways to exploit us to get power and coerce us. 

We knew HR was complicit and would report EVERYTHING we'd say, even if it was a random discussion at the coffee corner. And we were told, if you want to file a complaint, even to an external org, you had to submit it to him first. We believed him.

There was a constant climate of paranoia. We were all drowning under way more tasks, responsibilities and workload than we could handle. The turnover rate was high for a team of 20, with at least one person leaving every two months and being replaced not long after.

We should have said stop. We should have stand up for ourselves. But we didn't. And that was by design: everyone besides the manager were aged 23 to 25 yo. We were all lacking the experience and knowledge to see how dysfunctional this place was. Or to leave or confront him. We had not a good idea of what ""normal"" was and we accepted SO MANY things. We thought we were at fault and needed to toughen up. That we were lucky to have that job and the benefits.

The ones who left were so exhausted that they just wanted to move on. They were scared of the repercussions there would be on us or their reputation if they dared say something.

And then one big project failed. Huge loss. The implementation went wrong because we were all so overworked, we made a series of mistakes that escalated into a bigger problem. The manager saw this as a sign that MORE control was needed. Suddenly we were monitored, through him, software, timers. We had impossible deadlines. We were afraid to take breaks or vacations.

And so our health caught up with us. There was a wave of 6 employees (including me) getting on sick leave for burnout, depression, or both. 3 of them had documented what was going on there, and once they got back on their feet, filed a lawsuit for workplace violence. Me and the others helped them and added our testimonies but wished to remain anonymous. I don't know if it changed anything. As far as I know, we all healed to a certain extent, although the damage is deep. To have this as your first professional experience shapes you, for better and for worse."

328,3,"I’ve been working for this store coe the past 3 months, and of course i applied as a part-time worker, i am currently in uni, and dont have much expenses, so i dont really need too many extra-money, of course i told them during the application, and i also specifically told them i can be very  flexible for shifts, but that I need to study, and that its my priority.
From the start i recieved so many extra-hours, everything is of course paid, but 10 hours the first week, 10 the second, ecc ecc…

I told the manager that i applied part-time for a reason, and that I can accept some hours of extra-work but not 10, i need to study and focus on my personal life.

The first week went ok, and now they do every thing they can to take revenge, they openly “joke” (threat) me, they emotionally manipulate my (making myself feel guilty) and actually talk to me like a baby (“ so you can save up some money😊”) im trying mybesy to be professional but i cant, i think I will be very aggressive, and if they try to stalk me again like they did the week ago (calling me everyday to make sure i will be feeling guilty cause i Dont wont to put 10 hours more per week working) I will bring them to court i dont fucking care.
everywhere i worked, they always treated me with so little respect, is astonishing, they try everything to suck the life out of you, i have never found a good workplace, or one that respect my rights as a human and a worker.

This ever happened to some of you?i want to know how did you handle it, i think im gonna scream at someone this week"
329,3,"I work in Learning and Development and have been with my current company for almost 3 years. I have never had any performance related issues and my annual performance reviews have always been pretty good and I always received the annual merit increases.

In addition to facilitating various types of training throughout the year for new hires and our existing staff as well as creating e-Learning courses and other projects our department is also responsible for a presentation for our monthly all-staff meeting announcing new hires, anniversaries etc. Every month is a different theme and my manager wants them to be fun and whimsical even though we work for a financial institution and these presentation take up a lot of our time.

Anyways long story short I was written up this past Monday because they said for the past 2 months I submitted an incomplete presentation and that my other coworker had to pick up the slack. First off I want to say that in April I was attending a week long seminar the week if the all-staff meeting and I was ill in the month of May. But even if I did drop the ball I don't understand why I'm being penalized for these monthly little ""fluff"" projects that have nothing to do with L&D. I have had excellent surveys from my trainees and have been highly regarded for my training ability. I am setting our employees up for success in their roles and that's being disregarded over a couple of presentations. Plus now they're saying I can't work from home anymore because they don't feel that I'm productive. I just feel like this whole thing is coming out of left field. Any advice?

331,3,"I’m pleasant and friendly with my coworkers and I do work that’s enjoyable to me because it makes no sense to have to be at a job I hate all week. That being said, there is never a time I would rather be at work than be at home. I would take PTO whenever offered for however long. I have an entire life out of work. Not just switching to family mode at 6:00 PM. I have hobbies, interests, friends, family. 

I’ve never worked with anyone my age which contributes to this way of thinking, but I don’t really desire forming relationships with my coworkers any deeper than superficial. If one of us quit, we’d never talk again. If one of us started falling behind on our work, it would irritate the other. We aren’t friends, I don’t know why we should act like it. I have actual friends outside of work that I’m ready to get back to. I feel like a lot of people like to mix their social life with their work life and this works for shitty management because it makes you more attached to work. I truly simply just want to do my job and go home. We can be friendly and friend like even, but I feel like I can never really be a part of a workplace that’s “like a family”. My life outside of work is a lot more fulfilling and I feel like that should be acceptable.

In the same vein as above, I don’t live to work. People who stay late and come early are fine to do that. But I have a life and things going on. I’m going to come in and do my job absolutely, I don’t mind giving it my all. But I don’t want to be in 30 minutes early, stay an hour late, go to work with my coworkers and talk about work, or sit at my desk and eat while working. To each their own even though I don’t understand living to work, but it sucks that corporate culture means you’re supposed to live eat breathe and sleep the company. Some people are just so vapid. 

For as long as I’m not a partner at a company, my job is just a job. I’m going to do it to the best of my ability and I even enjoy it and I can have a positive and respectful relationship with my coworkers. I’m not going to stay late or come early. I’m not in love with the company or my manager or the CEO, I don’t have the social stamina to be BFFs with my coworkers because I’m a well rounded person with a life outside of work, I’m taking my full unpaid hour lunch, and I’m using all my PTO and sick days.

333,3,"In the past 10 years, I've had two separate occasions where I took a job out of sheer desperation and it did not work out. One was for two weeks back in January of 2019 and the other was in the winter of 2022 for about 2 months. Both women that hired me were absolutely awful. 

I've run into both woman and specifically saw one on Sunday morning at a bagel shop here in town. This was the job placement I had for two weeks and the staff was terrible. I wasn't a good fit for them. I was mad at the lady who hired me for a variety of reasons. I wanted to go say something to her, but the bagel shop was crowded. She was with her son and I saw her whispering in his ear and then she left while looking at me. If given the chance I probably would've had some choice words for her. She obviously recognized me 6+ years later.

I know a few folks who own small business who would be willing to help, and I was wondering how airtight the process could be if I were to say that I was a PM consultant with them for a few months. They would gladly field any reference checks for me, but I was curious if there were any other ""behind the scenes"" things that companies could do to determine if they were legitimate roles.

I already have a new job lined up and even I am leaving after a year of employment. I was told another coworker plans to leave soon like within two months. 

Leadership has yet to say a word to anyone. Folks are going on vacation or parental leave for new babies and things are gonna get worse. 

When I talked to my boss he seemed rather sad but was concerned that I would leave considering I've been very good to the company. But instead of giving me an incentive like more money, which is why I'm leaving among other reasons, he just congratulated me. 

I loved my job and now it's about to be in complete shambles if someone doesn't act quick. They'll have to have salary workers doing hourly workers jobs before too long if they don't act now. 

I'm ready to say goodbye but I hate leaving the building on fire. "
338,3,"I will try to keep everything as concise as possible, just bear with me.

I am a single father with full custody of a 5 year old. While I was working my most recent job, I was engaged in custody proceedings with my son's mother, and things were just really, really tough, financially. There came a month where I had to choose between keeping my car (and thus keeping my job), or keeping insurance coverage, but being unable to pay my car payment for the 3rd month in a row. So, I made my choice, and then proceeded to get into an at-fault accident that very same month, for which I did not have insurance coverage.  The other vehicle was valued at $16,000.  This is when I found out what subrogation is.  Their offer was- Pay us 25% of the total valuation, at which point we will set you up for payments to the tune of $550 a month, and do this within 30 days of this notice, or we will suspend your license indefinitely.  This is literally not possible for me in any way.  It wasn't then, and it certainly isn't now. So, my license has been suspended since then.  My only real option to get my license reinstated is to file for bankruptcy.  (My driving was totally spotless before this, by the way.  Just fair warning, literally never drive without insurance.)

I was working towards paying the attorney so I could file for chapter 7, but then I lost my job.  Since then, I have applied to over 50 jobs in various fields, and I absolutely can not get hired. Just for some context- I have about 2 years in the automotive industry, which is where my last position was, and the industry I was trying to pivot to after working in food service for about 8-9 years.  The 1 and only job I refuse to ever do again is cooking on a line, because my mental health just can't handle it anymore.  I've applied to several prep-cook/banquet-cook positions, and I haven't heard anything, presumably due in part to the 2 year gap between now and when I last worked in a kitchen.  I didn't think that mattered in kitchens, as I've never had issues getting jobs in the past, but things just seem different now, as far as getting hired ANYWHERE.  I've had a few job offers rescinded in the automotive industry once the background check returned a suspended license.  That makes sense with positions for which you have to move vehicles, so I wasn't surprised that I was having trouble getting service advisor (what I was doing at my last job) or technician positions.  Then, I was deemed ineligible by HR at a quick lube for a non-driving position.

I figured maybe it was just some corporate blanket policy where they just don't hire people that have ANYYTHING on their background check? I don't know, I just couldn't work out why that mattered.  My background is otherwise completely clean.  ALL that shows up is that I have a suspended license.  I don't even think it tells them why.  Fast-forward to today, where I just had a job offer rescinded for a housekeeping position, no driving even remotely related.  The reason? Suspended driver's license.  My state has a restricted license called a hardship license that allows people in my situation to drive back and forth to essential places, such as work, and I've had one of those for a while now.  Even so, it seems like the suspended status on my license is barring me from positions in totally unrelated industries.

I've been unemployed for going on 6 months, now.  My savings is depleted, my family was financially  stretched thin even before the help they've given me.  Something's got to give.  This is causing me extreme hardship-  I'm about to be homeless and without transportation as a single father.  ANY advice, anything I might be able to do legally to make this stop ruining my life, or even just ""What I would do, is..."" would be GREATLY appreciated.  I'm at the point where I'm silently panicking and can barely think straight.  Thank you for reading.

  
Edit: I've posted this to a few different subs, and the response on this sub was awesome!! I've compiled a list of things people have suggested through comments and DM's, and I have to say, I already feel a bit better just having new ideas to try.  You've all been extremely kind and helpful.  I know there are people on this sub that are struggling more than I am, and I just wanna say- Hang in there.  That's all we can do.

You’re not an employee; you’re a pack mule, loaded up until you buckle. The job market’s a slaughterhouse, and your willingness to “step up” is the knife they twist. Stop believing their “team player” garbage—this is exploitation, pure and vicious.This con thrives on corporate greed. Firms cut corners, understaff teams, and dump multiple roles on one worker to save a buck. It’s not about efficiency; it’s about squeezing you dry while they bank the savings.

Jokes aside, I’m in a really tough spot and could use some outside perspective. I’ve been working in HR at my current company for about 1.5 years. My boss is extremely emotionally unstable—think yelling, cussing, crying, daily criticism… the whole rollercoaster. I was hired alongside someone much more experienced, and they left four months ago. I’ve stuck it out, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s worth it.

Lately, I’ve been seriously considering quitting without another job lined up and switching careers completely. My spouse supports it and has really encouraged me to find what I want to do. My therapist says it’s okay. But everything in me screams, “Don’t leave without financial security!”

The situation hit a boiling point this week. I finally told my boss I won’t tolerate the constant verbal abuse anymore. I told them point-blank: if I’m truly that bad at my job, they should manage me out. I never imagined I’d say that to a boss.

I’ve never been in a situation like this. I’m actively job hunting, but my experience level limits my options a bit. Still, I’m burned out and honestly considering just walking away to a different career entirely.

The final straw was when she made some pretty inappropriate comments about my appearance during a team meeting that made everyone uncomfortable.

I decided to go to HR because I thought that's what you're supposed to do, right? Had documentation of everything, dates, witnesses, the whole nine yards. The HR lady seemed sympathetic, said they'd look into it, told me not to worry about retaliation because that's illegal.

Well, guess what happened three days later? Called into a meeting with HR and my manager. They said I was being let go for performance issues. Suddenly I'm getting written up for things that were never problems before, and they're acting like my complaint never happened. They offered me two weeks severance if I signed an NDA.

I didn't sign anything and walked out. Now I'm job hunting and wondering if I should talk to a lawyer. My friends are split - some say fight it, others say just move on because legal stuff is expensive and stressful.

349,3,"\*added TLDR on bottom.

I worked for the New York Public Library (NYPL) during COVID at one of their sorting/logistics union jobs and I never have lost so much respect for an organization so quickly. Originally libraries were closed for a few months from like March 2020 to around Summer 2020.  When we came back our building (which is one of the office/logistics buildings for NYPL) had set an A/B schedule to help keep social distancing. Basically, this meant that you would work one week 3 days and the next week 2 days, with departments being split into two teams (A and B). If one team worked 3 days one week the other would work 2 different days and then it would flip the next week. People would still receive their full salary and vacation/sick days despite the reduced work week, at least the union employees.

The part that got me angry was when the sorting operation, who have the same job title/pay and are in the same union as a lot of these other departments, were told they would have to be full time (5 days) by around July/August 2020. The rest of the union employees in the building would continue working with this A/B set up all the way until summer of next year. The job itself is a warehouse job and it’s already the worst job to social distance in. On top of that imagine the insult you feel when your coworkers are receiving their full salary and vacation/sick days but only working 2-3 days a week.

It was already a job that felt poorly compensated you basically work side by side with a sorting machine. Most of the time you are either putting books on a conveyor belt, replacing the bins that fill up from these books dropping in (each bin goes to a specific branch) and putting the bins on u-boats, and then from the u-boats they go on a pallet. It’s a physical job where I have seen people complain about their backs aching and have seen injuries. In addition to being a very physical job you tend to get dirty easily and get holes/rips in your cloths because of the bins or tubs sharp edges that happen from wear. They are supposed to rotate people, because of the speed of the sorting machine and the expectations of the mangers the heavier tasks tend to be rotated among only a few people, some just can’t keep up with the pace of the machine. With the heavier tasks you are lifting a 50lbs (sometimes more because people stuff these bins) every 2-5 minutes for hours. You are serving 90+ branches with 14-16 employees, any day where more than like 2 people take off ends up being terrible. If the machine goes down, the managers seem like they want you to make up for lost time as if that’s your fault.

Under this director there are two other teams that have the same job title and pay. What do they do? One team basically puts barcode stickers on books, work with records, and move books around on book trucks, probably one of the easiest jobs I have seen. The other team tends to do unboxing of books, grouping like books, and work with records. These are office jobs and the teams are diverse and have all groups of people while the sorter is a mostly male team. Some people in our team would try to get into those departments but almost never get in.  The sorting team having the same title and pay seems like a way to skimp our team.

Now comes another part of this NYPL story, they changed the sorting machine. What did they get? A machine that is basically worse, even if you produce close numbers it is more work. So now you have a job that was already very physical become even more physical. Managers weren’t happy with the results and seemed moody towards us to the point were at least one of the workers summoned a meeting to bring this up. Then this became gaslighting were we should think about the kids we are serving and the meeting felt like we weren’t heard.

This is a job that feels like punishment. I felt inspired to write this post because the NYPL has two recent lawsuits, one in regards to employee accommodations and one in regards to employee safety.  Reading these reminded me of the lack of concern and respect this place has for their employees.

**TLDR: One team at NYPL during COVID worked full time from summer 2020-summer 2021, while the rest of the employees with the same union job title recieved their full compensation while staying home 2-3 days a week in order to social distance by spliting teams into two. The team that worked full time was a warehouse team, which ironically cannot social distance effectively.** 

**They got a new sorting machine and now the team works harder for the same compensation.**

351,3,"This was several months in the making... I have been working as a full-time freelance writer for 2 major marketing companies for just short of a decade now. The first marketing company hired me to do a little writing and mostly design, which I went to college for, and they basically stopped having me do anything art-related months after I hopped on board with them. Knowing that I was doing nothing I wanted to do all these years felt like a lot of wasted time. 
Anyway, in all my free time, I've been working on my portrait business and it turned into a super busy part-time thing but could have been full time for several years now based on how many potential customers I brought in through social media. 
I finally took the leap for my mental health since I've been failing myself for so many years. And it feels GREAT. Furthermore, my husband reduced his work hours and is focusing on his creative writing. We have really inspired each other! 
I just wanted to share my story and let everybody know that leaping into your own dreams IS possible. Don't let any job make you feel like you have to throw in the towel when it comes to your dreams. And it's never too late to make a move!! "
352,3,"Had my first AI job interview.  Phone interview, lots of questions with chatgpt ish responses.  Almost sounded like a souless HR drone so that's a thing now.  Crazy."
353,3,"for context, that is what I work currently: M-F 8am-4pm (luckily my current company doesn't shaft me with an unpaid 30 min lunch). but I genuinely think there is no reason to be mandated to work 8 hours 5 days per week in an office setting (same can't necessarily be said for blue collar or some other industries). the amount of times I have to pretend to look busy is asinine. and yes, I try to find other things to do like clean around the office when it's slow, but jesus christ there's probably a whole 8-10 hours a week that are straight up wasted by just not having enough to do for the day(s). who else's pet peeve is having to look busy in an office when there is actually nothing to do???"
354,3,"I was notified two weeks ago that my job is being eliminated at the end of June. I live in the US, so this advance notice wasn't required, but since it is part of a merger and some of our European employees are affected too, they knew it would get out if the EU folks were informed and we weren't. This notice, though, is about where the good news ends.

My job prospects so far are terrible. I am making the most money I have made in my career at this job, and as the only breadwinner with a disabled partner, I really can't afford to take a pay cut. If anything, I need to be making more to keep up with bills. But my skillset is in customer service, and I seem to have hit the cap on what I can make doing that work right now. Most jobs I can find that match my experience pay $10k less or worse.

I can't afford to go back to school, and I have no idea what I could pivot to at this point. I have more than a dozen years in B2B and B2C work across various industries, and I've picked up a lot of diverse and useful skills. Unfortunately, every job I've been in, there has been no room for advancement. Getting supervisory experience has therefore been impossible, since everyone wants you to have that experience before they will hire you at a supervisory role. Everywhere I apply through LinkedIn, I either get ghosted or an automated rejection letter.

I'd go to something completely different if I could, honestly. I hate customer service, and have for some time. But I'm an absolute failure as a salesperson (I've tried) and I can't do anything that requires too much standing or walking due to my own health issues.

I'm mostly just posting this because I can't sleep and needed to get this out to someone, but if anyone has any advice, I'd really appreciate it. I'm already set up with Lyft because I was trying to get extra cash before all this, but our car is now starting to have mechanical issues and I don't dare go driving anymore because of it. Just feeling so stuck right now."
355,3,"Management put up a white board with the big message “You can do anything you put your mind to!” and left markers up for folks to write other motivational catch phrases or to remark on what they put their minds to. Maybe I’m too cynical to appreciate it, but I find things like this obnoxious

So I wrote “I put my mind to a mandoline, now my thoughts are but paper thin.” My thinking/meaning being that grind mentality just becomes obsession over money.  Little roundabout I suppose.

I’ll see if it’s still on the board after a few days."
356,3,"I was laid off last Friday after 2 years at my company. I already have a few interviews lined up, but I'm sure me being recently laid off will come up. What can I say the reason for being laid off was, without making it sound like I was not a good developer?"
357,3,"He's still looking for work, which is the bad news, but the good news is that I got a job teaching at a charter school starting in August, and until then, we both do gig work for a company that teaches AI different things.

Mostly I'm here to post that I found them hiring for his stupid job, but they changed it to a nursing position (category) with really unreasonable expectations. Hubby was supposed to get both those certifications in 18 months, and then only because they didn't have someone on staff with them until his immediate boss got hired after him. 

So yeah. Good luck finding someone who's both a good data analyst AND knows enough about trauma departments to meet your stupid standards AND who wants to work with that boss. I hope they're always behind on their projects. "
358,3,"I recently started working for a small local business that hired me at a contract worker. I took the job because the hours worked with my class schedule, and it’s doing something I have great interest and am very knowledgeable in, and I just needed some extra cash. The pay isn’t great, $17 hr but I’m reaching the one month trial period in which it was discussed that we can reevaluate pay moving forward. 

It does kinda bothers me that all of their workforce are contract workers because it just shows that they don’t want do the work of running a business by the book, or provide benefits or pay my taxes, or contribute to my social security. They say I can deduct business expenses but there really aren’t any business expenses involved in the position, so that amount will be minimal. 

I’ve don’t some research into contract workers rights and I want to make sure I’m getting all the leverage I can out of this arrangement because I don’t want to get screwed over. I want to know what are the benefits of working in the position?

A few things to take note of. 
1. I have no contract which I understand I have the right to require if I’m doing this kind of work. Should I ask for a contract and what would be the conditions of that contract? 

2. It’s a physical job so it is concerning that there is no availability for workman’s comp should I hurt myself on the job.  

3. Since they are not matching my social security contributions, the $17 I am paid is really less then what a comparable job from an employer would pay. 

4. I’m being told to not help customers but part of the reason they said contract work would benefit me is that I would be able to get clients for outside work, so by not helping customers, I’m not able to build relationships to make that happen. 

Today I was told I couldn’t wear headphones while working in the back behind the scenes. I put my foot down and said, that wasn’t going to fly because as I understand it, they can’t tell me how to do my job since I am not working for them, I’m hired by them for my expertise. I don’t think they were expecting me to say that but brushed it off, and the subject was dropped. 

Lastly, they happen to be conservatives who support the current administration which is their prerogative. I just find it so fitting that they are against Medicaid (which I am on) yet they align their company so that their contract workers can’t afford private insurance and run their business in such a way that they avoid having to pay any benefits. Tell me, it this job even worth it, or am I just wasting my time? 

The thing is I do like the job but there is some really scummy things about how they are doing business and I just need some advice on how I should approach this one month progress meeting. Should I ask for a contract and more pay? I’m really good at the job I do, I have a lot of knowledge in the product we sell, am a hard worker, the only bilingual worker there, and am very professional. I feel I am worth far more than what they pay me but I also understand that it’s not the type of job that requires much. I know I can make them a lot of money but only if it is worth it for me to do so. So what do you guys think I should do? Any advice appreciated, and thanks for reading this long post. 
"
359,3,"Informed my boss of holiday time two weeks in advance, rostered me anyway, I let him know i cant work (again). Said I didnt let him know. Once he realised I did let him know, he said I should have reminded him.

Thoughts?"
360,3,"I left a terrible work environment. I was working in an emotionally and physically draining environment. Everyday was an emotional roller-coaster. On top of just dealing with the general public, there was no management. I would bring up safety concerns that went ignored. We were constantly understaffed. Every day was a struggle. I was paid garbage and rarely got to even eat lunch. I did it for a decade. I put myself through that for a decade. 

I saw my friend/coworker not being able to afford to live on her income and move back in with her parents. I spent 6 weeks in physically therapy from a work injury. I needed stitches in my face when I was attacked by a dog. My arms are permanently scarred. The whole time, I kept at it because I was ""making a difference"". Living on 12 bucks an hour WITH a 4 year B.S. seems justified when you feel like you have a mission. But like anyone, I got burnt out. I would sit in my car for hours and just cry when I got home. It was an absolute shame. I was damn good at my job. I was the person that was called in to handle hard blood draws and tricky patients. I was the first one to jump into a situation with a crashing patient. I made it my mission to advocate for my patients. 

I eventually met this wonderful guy. He asked me why I was putting myself through all of this. He told me I was smart, I was really good at my job and had valuable skills. He found a job for me to apply to. I met all of their requirements. I applied, then got ghosted. BUT... then I saw the same position re-advertised. I reapplied, interviewed, and it seemed like an absolute shit show. The whole position was a walking red flag. They were hiring to replace someone who left due to stress. I then applied to a random nondescript research posting- just because I met the requirements and was desperate to escape. They offered me a job and I took it. 

I've been at my new position for a little over a year. My management team is fantastic. I have really good benefits. My boss tracked me down today to tell me that my work is truly exemplary. He wants to keep me as long as possible. He told me he is trying to get me a 10% raise because I truly deserve it. I let myself be miserable for 10 years by telling myself that I was making a difference. I finally stepped up and put myself first. Now I'm helping cure cancer. 

Oh, and that guy that was unknowingly my Orpheus, is talking about wedding rings. "
361,3,"My job path has not been sequential. Went from support educator to residential foster youth counseling, contact tracing , caregiving, substitute teaching and now program coordinator. In all areas of work, I struggle with forced conversation—I’m in awe of my colleagues and friends and family who can strike up and hold a conversation with anyone, and seem to enjoy it. I definitely gravitate towards those people who can do this and can easily hold conversation with them (because they can with me), but once it’s my turn to start and hold conversation with others (who also are not that good at it), it begins to feel like forced small talk. 

Fast forward to my current job (that I’m sadly grateful for solely because  job security (pay ain’t that secure) and potential growth/connections for discounted graduate school at a good university)). Anyways, current job includes absolutely mind numbing tasks that I only feel compelled to do when I know I absolutely must get it done with aka lowkey last minute : order lunches, order supplies, save files, manually enter spending on excel sheet (no data analysis, just entry), respond to emails about scheduling meetings and making sure people have the supplies they need, and lastly trying to engage in conversation with individuals I support as they walk past my office daily for their meetings. I have such a challenging time initiating anything but “hi,” and a smile and frankly, don’t really care to build rapport because I don’t see how my forced conversation would help them feel better.. my manager who I really like and very much enjoy talking to is only on site a couple days per week and is one of those people who can get excited by 1) data entry and 2) talking to anyone about anything. My other direct coworkers are remote and I rarely need to interact with them online..so it’s me alone i the office, mind numbingly entering data and anxiously awaiting this exchanges of hellos daily. What should I do? "
362,3,"Background

• 5 yrs at a famous multinational in Guangzhou, China

• Diagnosed with bipolar & depression, on medication, repeatedly approved for sick leave



What changed

• Feb 2025: org restructure, HR mentions “potential severance” but stops replying once I’m on leave

• Doctors suddenly tell me to delete one day from an already-approved leave note (a local holiday) – no written policy given

• After I questioned it, the system flips to “approved” again, still zero explanation

• The day I filed for labour arbitration my laptop keyboard died; IT kept spamming a “share your desktop” link



Chinese employment law is very different from the U.S. That said, my intent wasn’t to ask for legal advice, but to show how mental health + HR manipulation + corporate silence play out in a famous global company.

I believe many people here — especially those who’ve dealt with “soft terminations” or being quietly pushed out during sick leave — will see echoes of that pattern, even if the legal structure is different.

If anything, I'm more curious about: how have you seen HR handle similar gray-zone exits in your country?

I’m documenting everything not just for court, but also to build awareness.

363,3,"I know i'm petty for venting about this. And i also know that such coworkers are almost everywhere. But it feels good to get this off my chest. 

I'm really tired of coworkers who constantly forget things or make mistakes and NOONE is allowed to say anything against them. They always have an excuse ready to go or blame someone else. And they get very defensive and bitchy about it. 

Last Friday something happened which was beyond my control and the fault was with a third party (they didn't keep their promise). One coworker didn't stop talking about it and she seemed very happy, that i was involved. She even brought it up again yesterday (one coworker told me about it, i wasn't there)!!! Like....WTH?! This seems so uncooperative and mean. But she herself works very sloppy and constantly makes mistakes.

Then they want you to do another task, then if you get accepted, then you have to do another second interview and in that second interview it'll be one hour with the task in the interview like wtf...

367,3,Hump Day. It makes me angry when people non-ironically say it as if it's some badge of pride instead of a symbol of systemic exploitation.
368,3,"it’s easier to gaslight than to change. Addressing toxic behavior means confronting uncomfortable truths—bad managers, broken cultures, or systemic inequities. That takes work, and many employers would rather maintain the illusion of harmony than admit something’s wrong. Plus, gaslighting is profitable in the short term. If you’re too busy doubting yourself, you’re not organizing with coworkers, demanding better conditions, or jumping ship for a competitor."
369,3,"Hello all. 

So I made a post the other day about my toxic boss, and I finally submitted my letter of resignation. He always takes forever to read and respond to emails, and I gave notice last Friday about my departure. He just responded last night (you can see his response below):

[https://imgur.com/a/HTVZqhO](https://imgur.com/a/HTVZqhO)

  
I gave him this letter as notice, yet he mentioned that I did not give notice at all. He also said that we have a ton of stuff do do, but being the person that I am  (even though I totally should not have), I did absolutely everything to set up preparations so that the unsuspecting interns would not be confused.This man has a second job that he does during my job which he is supposed to be helping me with. and I lowkey wanted to give him payback for never responding to me and making it difficult for me to do my job. Now he has to train the interns by himself and conduct any work that he needs done by himself. He got angry that I left him to actually do his job for once, but I hope now he understands how I've felt.

This man has refused to give refunds to his customers despite us not having a no refund policy, including when a woman had a death in the family and begged him to have a heart to give her the refund. He accused his volunteers of being scammers for asking for a $75 stipend, yet he has money to pay 1000$ tickets back and forth from another country to the US every six weeks. He works a second job remotely yet doesn't allow his sole employee to work remotely. He is never on time or available when we need him.

He made an email in the past to me after finding out that I had a second job (which he already knew about bc it was on my resume but he thought I quit ig), and that I am a student, saying that he had better candidates and would not have hired me if he knew I had a second job or was still in school. 

Said email: [https://imgur.com/a/OPoSN6z](https://imgur.com/a/OPoSN6z) 

All of this for only 33k a year btw. 

I'm not even mad lol, I am still young and grateful for the experience and thought it was funny that a grown man with like 6 kids is behaving like this. I am stubborn and don't put up with a lot of drama, so I don't really regret leaving on the negative. This is my first adult job, and I learned exactly what red flags to look for at my next one. Now he can contact those ""better candidates"" to work for him lol."
370,3,"I grew up poor. Nobody in my immediate family had been to university. I spent 35 of my 38 years on this earth with undiagnosed ADHD.

I've never dreamed of labour. I've worked in too many companies where you're ""Family"", yet treated like a number.

The economy is awful, applying for jobs is like pulling teeth while banging your head against a wall and getting a cactus enema.

26 days ago I had an idea.

Since then I've:

- Taken an idea from a spark to pitch ready 
- Onboarded 6 staff. Zero pay, zero equity exchanged. Just belief in me and the mission (They will be paid when investment is secured)
- Proven willingness to pay and begun generating revenue (without even telling people what the product is)
- Waitlist of 200 people waiting to use it
- Built a prototype that delivers a step change improvement in the working lives of 3.5mil knowledge workers.

Imagine what I can achieve in a year.

Ignoring the financial side, what I'm building will make lives better. It'll shift the balance of power from employers to the employees. 

Companies won't like it. That's a risk. I'm willing to fight that battle. But I need help.

Fixing a broken system needs small action from a lot of people. Every action counts.

I'm pitching to investors in the coming days and I'm looking to scale and launch in weeks.

371,3,"36 M Last week here at a compost yard. Got to learn how to operate front loaders. The team has been talking about leaving for various reasons except the one that unifies us all. Low pay, high stress, more work then a small team can handle and poor leadership doesnt make it easy for me to come into work. Company keeps putting money into their pockets and our wages won't be going up anytime soon. 

It's been a long time since I've walked out of a job. I am a wuss I don't like confrontation. I've been treated poorly for as willing as I am to work. My coworker left at lunch today. Another fellow coworker is not coming back tomorrow. My manager is bitter and petty. Found myself doing circles in the yard because my manager wanted to make a point to purposefully waste my time. 3 days in a row.

I have a job lined up in two weeks that pays more.

  "
372,3,"I’m an in home behavioral therapist with two little kids, siblings. I’ve been with them for nearly a year and they’ve both have been improving exponentially. The family loves me, I have a great relationship with the mom, their extended family and the other sibling. I have a great relationship with my clients, they love me and I love them.

Out of no where my bosses and HR are trying their very hardest to remove me from both my clients. They have new people shadowing me and tell them they’re taking over soon and to “slowly fade me out”. My bosses are telling my other coworkers that I’m too loud and extravagant, I baby the kids and I don’t listen. For reference, the kids are 2yrs old and 8yrs old. 

They’re pressuring the Mom to take me off the case for random reasons. The HR guy keeps saying my commute is too far (45mins) and he “doesn’t want me to drive that far” when my other coworker drives well over an hour. I got sick for 4 days and for those 4 days my shadow ran session with my 8yr old alone. My bosses told her over and over that week, “good thing [me] is gone this week so you can focus one on one with the client and build rapport without interference”. They ask my coworker if my data is accurate but they’ve never asked me.

Today my two bosses were at session on zoom. They texted me privately and told me to have my shadow take lead. I did, I gave her tons to do and she would do it but not continue it. Like, I would give her the hose to fill up water balloons, she would fill 1 up and stop the water etc. so I continued where she stopped playing with them. So one of my bosses literally called the mom and told her to tell me that she needs help inside to get me away from my client so the shadow can be with him. The mom told me that made her really uncomfortable. 

I have no idea what their problem is. I’ve been working with kids for five years, I’ve never had an issue before. My clients improve more and more every day, literally. Last year my 2yr old only had 2 words and would maybe say a total of 15 words a session. Now he has upwards of 30 words and says nearly 150 total words a session.

It’s really hurting my feelings bc my bosses haven’t told me a single thing that I do wrong but instead they’re telling everyone else? I constantly ask for feedback to improve and I get nothing. I’ve asked the mom, the family, my coworkers and even my clients if I do anything wrong / how can I improve and they say I’m doing great so what’s the problem???

How do I address this? My coworkers and the mom aren’t supposed to be telling me what my bosses say to them and I’m not trying to get anyone in trouble. All session today I just felt like crying. SOS"
373,3,"So I've been working at this company for about 8 months now as a marketing coordinator. The pay is decent but not amazing, so I picked up a part-time gig doing freelance graphic design on weekends and some evenings. Nothing crazy, maybe 10-15 hours a week max.

My boss found out last week when a coworker mentioned seeing my design work on Instagram. Now he's acting like I betrayed the company or something. He called me into his office last friday and basically said he's ""concerned about my commitment"" and that having a second job ""sends the wrong message about priorities.""

The thing is, I've never missed work, never been late, and my performance reviews have been solid. I do my freelance stuff entirely on my own time and it's not even in the same industry - we do B2B marketing and my side work is mostly small business logos and social media graphics.

He didn't outright tell me to quit the second job, but he made it pretty clear he's not happy about it. He also mentioned something about ""reviewing my workload"" which honestly sounds like a threat.

I checked my employment contract and there's nothing about not being allowed to have other work. The employee handbook has some vague language about ""conflicts of interest"" but my freelance clients aren't competitors or anything.

I'm kind of torn because I actually like this job and the team, but I also need the extra income. The freelance work helps me pay down student loans faster and I'm saving up for a house down payment. Plus I genuinely enjoy the creative work.

Has anyone else dealt with this? Am I being unreasonable for wanting to keep both jobs? I feel like as long as I'm doing good work and not violating any actual policies, what I do in my free time shouldn't matter.

Starting to think I might need to have another conversation with him or maybe talk to HR, but I don't want to make things worse. Any advice would be appreciated."

377,3,"Hey I don't use reddit much but I live in Australia and was wondering if anyone can relate to my experience.

I'm 24 and have been off work for the past few months due to a shoulder injury that happened at my job and have had time to think about my working carrier and how its destroyed my work ethic.

I'm one of those workers who like to excel at what I do and I want to do it the best and work as hard as I can as I find it personally rewarding and I was always told as a teenager that if you work hard you'll be successful and get a good job. This is just wrong. No other words for it.

My first job was trolley pushing that I worked while I was in high school and I was renting at the time with my ex (I didn't live with my parents).

That company closed down and then I wanted to pursue work in wildlife fields however my parents at the time have wanted me to become a tradesmen (Something I was extremely against as I hated the type of work). Because I was young and my family had connections with people in the industry they made it out to me that it was my only option and I HAD to work in industry and due to me being young and trusting that they had good intentions I went along with it. I have never regretted a decision more in my life.

**First Job:**

I was working as a Sandblaster Painter but on paper I was a Trades Assistant so my wage was low. For the next two years I worked my but off staying back for overtime, rocking up early and doing everything I could to be a good worker and towards the end of my job there I realized that this company just exploited me by making do so many tasks that a qualified tradesmen was meant to do this is not limited to boiler making, sparky work, scaffolding, bricklaying etc. Pretty much every job under the sun with no increase in pay or change in job title or offer for apprenticeship what so ever. They knew I could do all these things and knew I was better than some of the qualified guys and I was sent to work on major sites like RIO TINTO, GPC Coal Port's due to being specifically requested by the project managers at those sites.  All while still under a TA and I'm pretty sure that they signed off on some of the jobs they made me do claiming I was fully qualified.

**Seccond Job:**

After this I moved out of my home town and went to Perth there I got a job as a TA/Spray Painter and was asked to paint over rust, not allowed to sandblast, and deadlines for massive jobs would be the same day the job was given. For example they would deliver me 6 4m high by 4m vessels which were rusted asf and expect me to clean all the rust off with a little bristle blaster and prime, coat and dry these things without a spray booth by the end of the day (8 Hour Shift). It was genuinely impossible to do some of the tasks and I frequently clashed with management as they kept pushing me to cut corners. But I knew the second a vessel came back with a client angry about paint flaking due to rust they would pin it on me. I still went above and beyond to complete some of these ridiculous tasks but I left not to long after working there for about a year due to them pulling these stunts every day nearly. And again I left feeling exploited as the work to pay ratio was in the toilet.

**Third job:**

By the time my next job came around I had 10+ quals with forklift, crane, dogging/rigging, HR license just to name a few. I got a new spray painting job that paid less that my previous job however had far better facilities so I took the W's with the L's. Not to long after I was found to have lesions in my lungs from one of my previous jobs giving me a dust filter instead of a paint filter for my mask without my knowledge early into my carrier as I couldn't tell the difference back then. I explained this to my boss that I want to fix my lungs and I had to step down to which he came down from the office and verbally abused me in the workshop which I told him to ""Get F\*cked"" as this wasn't really my choice. I chose my health over my job and that was the outcome.

**Fourth Job:**

Fast forward a few months and I'm working in a paint store selling paint instead of applying it. I worked along side two (At the time) great guys. Then we got a new manager and she proceeded to make my life a living hell. I'm a pretty reasonable person it takes a lot to get me to not like somebody and I'll do my best to get along with everyone I meet a work to make the job easier and this woman was the devil. From day 1 she would give me the wrong addresses for deliveries and then change it so when I got back she would pin it on me. When I stayed back for an hour unpaid to unpack a shipment so she wouldn't have to do it on the opening shift I arrived the next morning with her giving the speech of ""Do you really want to work here?"" in a snarky tone because when I didn't the shipment I forgot to resupply the coffee machine in the break room. After a while she would swear her head off at me and throw insults at me on the regular and at the time I had worked at different stores and every other manager loved me and even tried to have me relocated to their stores. Eventually I took this to HR and learned first hand they aren't there to help you. I told them I was being verbally abused, I had evidence and the other store managers even stepped in to back me up in the situation. However its a lot easer to replace a sales assistant instead of a manager so they fired me anyway.

**Fifth Job:**

Fast forward a few months again to the job I just left. I join them 3 years ago and worked my butt off to the point where I ended up being the guy who is unofficially is a supervisor. I didn't want to be a supervisor but my current supervisor for the areas I was based in were that inept that most workers ignored them and instead sought after me for guidance and info on the projects to the point where the project manager would talk to me instead of our supervisor. After some time I thought well I should be getting paid better for managing different areas and staff and going above and beyond to be the best at my job. So I talked to management about it and was constantly hit with ""When we have an opening we will get you in"" or ""We are currently drafting a new position for you just give it time"". Eventually I injured my shoulder on the job and had to have surgery and was back in the office 3 weeks after my surgery and while still in the sling. I again kept working my butt off even while in a sling and my arm was hurting like crazy. And again was constantly told that I couldn't be promoted with a workers comp claim open which was BS. Then not to long after I had fully recovered a crane had snapped near myself and another worker and I was nearly crushed to death. I was literally half a meter away from being crushed and that was eye opening. And if anyone was wondering it was operator error we were in a safe spot and the operator was not paying attention to the hook block and it got caught and snapped.

**My Current Situation:**

So back to current time I have now resigned from that position as nearly being crushed by a crane and injuring myself to the point of needing shoulder surgery. I can't say any of it was worth it. I worked my a\*\* off for these jobs and my only reward was being exploited, underpaid and now am left with a life long pain in my left shoulder and I'm only 24. This whole experience has destroyed my work ethic. I once wanted to get a job and smash it and excel in every aspect but now after know all my hard work will only ever reward me with more work. I'm already over it. It's also trapped me as original I wanted to work with animals or be a teacher but due to my family manipulating me into this job I now only have XP with this industry and in this job market it's incredibly difficult to change professions as I start back at LvL 0 and its hard getting a job with no xp in that field.

If anyone has been through similar please let me know how you delt with this. I'm young and am already done with all this."

Low pay, high stress, more work then a small team can handle and poor leadership doesnt make it easy for me to come into work. Company keeps putting money into their pockets and our wages won't be going up anytime soon. 

It's been a long time since I've walked out of a job. I am a wuss I don't like confrontation. I've been treated poorly for as willing as I am to work. My coworker left at lunch today. Another fellow coworker is not coming back tomorrow. My manager is bitter and petty.

The worst part is I am on swing shift this month and I am exhausted. 

While I am technically on call right now, there is another guy on call as well. I am assuming he did not answer so my boss called me hoping I would answer. 

I answered thinking we were getting laid off because that is what is going to happen soon due to budget cuts within the Department of Homeland Security, but I should have let it go to voicemail. 

Lesson learned never answer your boss’s call because they most likely want you to come in and cover for someone. "
385,3,"I had a day off planned and had already made personal commitments. Out of the blue, my manager added a 12 hour shift to my schedule without consulting me.

(C) You get punished for having human flaws that don't hurt anybody (such as needing to go home when sick) by risking being fired.

I happened to take a couple PTO days earlier this year, and noticed that my paycheck for that pay period was normal in comparison to the paid out PTO.  After looking at paystubs, I discovered that the discrepancy comes from our paid half hour lunch.  When I took an actual day off, I still got paid for the half hour paid lunch.  The PTO payout does not include that paid lunch time.

I checked the laws in my state, and the laws are basically nonexistent around PTO payouts.  Companies are not required to pay out PTO, and they can fully dictate the terms of the payout.  That's probably fairly common, but it's also annoying."

397,3,"Its so frustrating going through Indeed and whatnot and seeing that hundreds+ have applied to a position. I know the common advice to apply to basically everything out there that you might have a chance of, and hope that a couple make it through the filters and into the eyes of an actual human being. I understand this approach, and on occasion do it, sending my resume out to dozens of places with basic tweaks to it and the cover letter to match the job description. But every once in a while, I'll come across an open job position that's for something that I'm really really passionate about. I'm talking about doing that exact sort of work on my free time, without pay, as a personal project, because its the exact type of thing that I really care about as a human being. And yet, when I find myself applying, I wind up having an application that really doesn't look much different that any of the applications I send out to places that I really wouldn't care about doing other than it being a job that pays me. Worse, I feel like some of those applications might not even get through, because some of the job experience they're looking for is with a slightly different piece of software than what I have professional/personal experience with, even though I know switching would be trivially easy and I'd be able to pick up something similar in no time, esp considering how much personal passion/drive I'd have for the projects. I'm talking like proprietary enterprise software when I have years of experience on an open source tool that does more or less the same thing. Is there any way to let an employer know that I'm actually super pumped for this kind of work, and that my answer to ""Why do you want this job"" is genuinely far more than just ""Because I need to get paid."" I know I can say that during an interview, but I need to get my foot in the door to get to that point in the first place. For what its worth, most of the jobs I've had this experience with are Govt jobs or in the non-profit sector.

399,3,"Back in January I posted to this sub about my previous job (911 for Jefferson county AR) not paying us. After 47 days of no pay and 3 weeks of waiting through interviews and BS I got a new job working at a casino. 

Been here for a few months now. It’s been alright. Some ups and down but nothing I couldn’t handle. 

I know my federal rights as an employee and I use them to my will and often. Well, me and another coworker I’ve become close to were talking a few days ago about about what we made the day before ($11.00/hr +tips which for both of us was like $95- ish for that day). 

Apparently the bartender and another waitress overheard (which I don’t gaf anyway) and ran back to the supervisor.

This morning I come in and am told they need to talk to me. Which cool, I don’t care. To which they inform me that the manager has it policy that employees are not to talk about their wages and if I’m heard of doing it again I’ll be written up. That this is my only warning…. 

I inform them that policy does not trump federal law. That myself and anyone else has the right to talk about their wages as they see fit and should be done often. They say that our manager doesn’t want us talking about our wages because some people will think what they make is unfair. Which… if it’s unfair, then it needs to be talked about. And that, “at work you can’t talk about it, but off the clock I don’t care what you do.”

I’m going to keep talking about it because that’s my federal right. And when I get wrote up/suspended/fired I’m going to my contact in the federal department of labor over Arkansas and I’ll rain fire down on this half build casino. 

This job gives me more and more spite by the day. And I’m here and petty for it. "

We have a union that says we get a 30 min break on anything over 12 but its almost always over 90°-100°f all day so I feel like we should be getting more breaks.

How do you once in a while find a lifetime retail worker who will be like ' Yeah, you know it was my first management job at 18."" - what management jobs are allowing this to happen?

Or did I somehow miss a memo. Is it connections? Is it low-tier 'bad' jobs that take anything they can get on a technicality and maybe people were able to take them at that age where it being bad didn't matter maybe they still got home support? Just different times? 

I do not dream of work, but man. as a 27/f - I certainly wish I could find some way to break out of only the piss-on jobs. But then I guess I can't apply to a management job that's like 'part time assitant manager, 12 hourly' - I can't even \*dream\* of taking it as any benefit of the position still manages to not exist at the hours and even though it would likely become basically full anyway... with how these workplaces work I suppose.

408,3,"Just want to start off saying I'm sure it will be long as I mostly want to complain, so sorry ahead of time. It will likely be all over the place as well. If you don't feel like reading through it all: she doesn't know how to run all press, yet expects to be able to problem solve it; doesn't understand how I keep falling behind as sure has me helping others or training; she gets SO easily overwhelmed, she'll tell people that she can't talk to them because of this and to just ask me for help... Wanting to go to her supervisor, just don't know how to go about the meeting. 

I work in a small printing factory and I've worked various machines, departments, and shifts. In my current department, I'm one of the only persons to have run (and truly know how to run) all the printers, along with a couple other machines (the others, I haven't had quite a lot of time running, so it's just a very basic understanding).
The manager was told a few months ago that the guy who was the minor problem solver (who you call if you don't quite need maintenance yet to fix it) was no longer working on that part of his job, but was going to focus on what he was mainly hired for. He's been giving her help figuring some stuff out. So if we have a problem with a press, we're to contact her first. Then if it's found that maintenance or the press company is needed, she'll contact. Otherwise, she's to fix it. 

One of our large printers had gotten a system update. Herself, her daughter, and the two girls who normally run the printer daily all got training on the new system; myself, who fills in (the girl who runs through the day pumps and I'm to cover for her when we fall behind on her breaks and pump times, or if she's not at work I cover). We start falling behind and I still haven't been shown the new system (which works very different). I ask the manager how to run it. Her answer was, ""I've been shown how to problem solve, not how to run the press."" That answer made NO sense to me: if you DON'T know how to RUN it, how can you problem solve?! She ends up calling the girl while she's pumping to find out how to run it. Truthfully, I normally just explore and button-push stuff until I figure things out. With all the crap I've been thrown my way, I wasn't going out of my way. Plus, I wanted her to realize that the one person who ""digs us out of any hole we fall into at any given press"" wasn't given the shovel to dig and want going to waste energy digging without it. 

She, also, doesn't seem to realize that when I have to cover at this press, it puts me behind. I've timed it and averaged it out: I spend just under 4 hours covering her breaks (two paid ten minute, plus the unpaid 30 minute lunch) as well as he pumping sessions. That doesn't include the time I take for my own breaks. About half my shift is covering her butt. 

She's recently told another employee at her recent review that she's to learn one of the presses that I run. I run 3 printers (all the same printer, running rolls), two cutters that are like large cricut (don't think that spelling is right, don't care), and another machine that cuts rolls into sheets. She'll be learning that last one (which I fall behind at most frequently, as it takes the most time to run). I just about cried with joy when I learned this, though I know she won't constantly be running it, but having the help will be amazing. Manager walked up to me apologizing for forgetting to inform me and for having the other operator tell me. I told her I don't mind, that I was so happy when she told me this that I almost cried. She looked at me totally confused and asked, ""Really? Why?"" And I could tell by how she looked at me that she TRULY had no idea that I've been feeling like I can barely keep my head above water, and I about wanted to cry knowing that. I told her about exactly that: I feel like I'm drowning in my own work and barely keeping afloat as she has me all over the place recently. She still looked confused and just said, ""oh..."" and walked away to go to break. 

As I stated at the start, she has anxiety and gets easily overwhelmed. I understand that, but I've also managed to find ways to help me cope with it at the workplace, especially since working here. We had a new hire, who also made it clear they were not great with computers, and were put in a department RUN by computers. He was struggling! His first two weeks training, the company had sent their maintenence three times to fix his presses (under contact, so our in-house cannot touch). He began falling more and more behind, and the office don't OT to play catch up with orders wasn't helping. The manager went to help him play catch up. He asked for help. She told him, ""I'm sorry. Don't take this personal, but I'm just so overwhelmed right now, I can't talk to anybody. You'll have to go see OP for help."" At that moment, I had my presses on hold while I was running the large printer while the operator was pumping. And I'M not overwhelmed. As well as pregnant. 

I'm about to go to HER supervisor and see what can be done. I don't see her hearing me out, especially after not realizing that I'm struggling. I know there's other options: there's a girl who runs another machine who gets thru her work quickly, why can't SHE take over for pumping when she's ALWAYS hurting for work to do? I'm sure he doesn't know that she doesn't know how to run a press, let alone problem solve it. I don't think he'll really care, though. I'm just getting SUPER stressed. I've mouthed off a few times recently due to all this and just not being able to keep the anxiety at bay as well. I'm about ready to ask to either transfer to another department or shift. I'd hate to drop out like that and would like to figure something else out first. I'm also the only one (besides manager's daughter, who's supposed to have minimal time in our department due to their relationship) who knows how to run the presses I run, which would leave them SOL. I hate doing that to my coworkers, not so much her. I'm just trying to get a clear head before doing anything. I don't want to go in hot. If you made it through this long, hot mess: thank you! And any advice (outside of just quitting, I'm trying to just hold out until baby), would be very much appreciated."
409,3,"Basically, my company is going full time RTO. But, my manager is exempt from this as her classification is a ""remote worker"". She has expressed an openness in discussing how this will actually function in practice, as well an awareness of the optics of having to enforce something that doesn't apply to her.

410,3,"I don’t mind rejection but I wish that employers were more respectful. I know that online rejections and template rejections are the norm. 

But one employer was really bad. It was Toyota. For some reason they were the only employer to physically mail me rejection letters. For some reason they would send “prospective employee” info like benefits package, how much salary increase you get after a certain amount of years of work. The main one they would send is a mailed rejection template like “we regret not proceeding forward”. 

I emailed my interviewer back to tell them about this but they didn’t care. I even called my local Toyota locations and they confirmed that I don’t work there lol and they stopped the letters for me. 

It was really bad because email is pretty much unlimited but your mailbox especially a community mailbox gets flooded quick and my postal service will keep mail for you for like a week if you go to your local postal location but if you keep doing it they will toss your mail in the garbage because you need a PO box or extra mail box they charge you for.  They don’t want to ruin their grift after all!

So imagine if your interviewer mails you junk like crazy, that was a horrible week. The letters were all fancy and had official logos on them. My family was happy seeing Toyota logo and thought I got a job there and I’m like no lol they’re sending me spam. This usually happens during interviews too where they’ll give me prospective benefits packages and a lot of extras but never send me the job offer letter.

I had employers get temper tantrums and toss my resume on the floor and stomp on it as well as toss it into a garbage next to them and tell me “don’t bother” but that’s just how some people are. I found prospective employers sending junk mail to my box actually very harmful for me because I was losing actual important mail!"
411,3,"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share a few shower thoughts and am curious to hear your opinions and input.

We grow up with a promise: “If you work hard and save with discipline, you can achieve anything.” But… is that really true?

Numerous studies from sociology, education research, and economics consistently show: Your socioeconomic background (i.e., your parents’ wealth, education level, and social network) often shapes your life path more than intelligence, effort, or performance.

If you start out in life with mental health issues, illness, caregiving responsibilities, unstable housing, or without a supportive environment, things are significantly harder — regardless of how much effort you put in.

Even if we did have ""equal opportunities"" (which we realistically don’t), society wouldn’t function if everyone went to college. We don’t need a million engineers or doctors.

Our society still heavily depends on so-called “low-skill” jobs — in care work, logistics, hospitality. These jobs are systemically essential, yet they’re rarely socially recognized and even less frequently fairly paid.

If everyone truly gave 100%, we’d just end up with more competition, more stress, and more cutthroat mentality — without actually enabling more upward mobility. The system is built in a way that inequality and disadvantage are structurally inevitable.

And ironically, it’s often the people in these essential jobs who then get lectured that they should’ve “made more of their lives.”

Many successful people believe they’re where they are because they’re smarter or harder working than everyone else. But research has long since debunked that: People consistently underestimate how much luck, timing, and initial advantages helped them. They rarely compare themselves to those who worked just as hard, but never had the same chances — or simply got unlucky (survivorship bias).

And if you dig deeper: Is diligence, talent, or intelligence even a personal achievement? Or just a result of a genetic and environmental lottery?

Of course, there are people who are less motivated or abuse the system — but a) it’s worth asking why that is, and b) most people are still willing to work extremely hard for extremely little money — in jobs that many successful people would never do themselves.

Honestly, I’m often impressed by how many people stay so diligent and responsible despite tough conditions — even when their working environments are far from ideal.

But hey — supposedly you can outsmart the system through saving. All you need is “discipline,” right?

Sounds easy when you’re making €4,000 net a month. But for many, there’s barely a two-digit amount left at the end of the month — especially with kids, rising rent, utilities, and cost of living.

And I totally get it if people would rather treat themselves once in a while than constantly deprive themselves for a future that’s uncertain anyway.

Saving isn’t a character trait — it’s a privilege.

Even if a family manages to scrape together €50 a month, that’s €600 a year. Sure, compounding interest and all that — but realistically, inflation and rising costs eat up most of it.

And when you’re already stretched thin, a single car repair or unexpected expense can wipe out a whole year’s savings.

In my opinion, this problem doesn’t just affect the oft-blamed “trust fund kids.” Even people from modest backgrounds who now earn €10,000 a month fall victim to survivorship bias. That doesn’t mean they work ten times harder or contribute ten times more to society. And there are thousands who were just as diligent, but didn’t make it.

Society shifts responsibility with messages like “people should take care of their own retirement and social security” — which just masks systemic failure and once again punishes the most vulnerable, those who actually need support and benefits (and then even gaslights them for it).

Of course, I’m not saying everything is bad. Capitalism has undoubtedly brought prosperity and progress, and especially in Northern Europe, we enjoy a high standard of living, even for many people considered “poor.”

But that doesn’t mean this system isn’t still full of deep inequalities we should address. And we mustn’t forget that our wealth often comes at the expense of countless people outside the Western world — and that even many “developed” countries, like the U.S., already show near-barbaric social conditions.

So, how do you see it? Can we really make a difference as individuals — or can we only try to carve out a comfortable niche for ourselves?

Even parties on the left rarely challenge the foundations of the system. They tend to focus more on the lower middle class — because they’re the easiest to tax."

413,3,"Been trying to get another hotel job as a server. I was invited for an interview at a 5 star hotel in LA, just for the pool server position. Like why not, sounds fun and probably good tips. 

The hiring manager asked me if I could come in at 10am and I said yes. She said she was looking forward meeting with me. I arrive there and there are like 8 more people waiting. She didn't tell me this was a job fair but an interview. It seems she told everyone to come in at 11am. 

So she takes the first group and then after some minutes, the least attractive out of the guys leaves first. They only kept the most attractive guy out of the 4, which is sad. 

I was in the second group with 4 other girls. I am invited inside the hiring manager's office and we spoke only for like 10 minutes. I already work for another hotel, so I always offer personalized service, initiate first, etc. Told her all of that. She said she heard what she wanted to hear and then she told me the food and beverage manager was only able to interview the previous people because she had to leave early, so she will have to email the rest of us and schedule another interview with her. 

What a joke, because it was an obvious lie. Waste of time but I guess most people in LA want to work at a fancy hotel, so they take advantage of it. "

415,3,"I think working corporate makes people mean. It makes us bitter and defensive because on top of not getting paid our worth, probably never being able to afford a house when previous generations could, we now also have to fight to not get fired when office politics kick in.  It makes us distrustful of everyone we deal with on a day to day basis. 

I keep seeing people saying they don’t want to work. Is it really that you don’t want to work, or that you don’t want to work under these conditions? 

What if you worked for you, without the bs and the fear of losing your job and got paid on what you do without you working to make a ceo rich?

I just simply hate injustice and fake people and it seems most people are at work. You can do your job well, be nice, you suddenly become a troublemaker.

419,3,"I currently work in a sports centre. I don't really like working there, but it is relatively comfortable and laidback. Well, it was for many years. Now, it is becoming increasingly formal and business-minded, with every day being filled with meeting and box-ticking exercises.

So, I'm looking for a new job. I want something that will allow me to work from home and zone out. Minimal stress. Minimal interactions with others.

Like many of you, I hate the idea of working five days a week. I want to work as little as possible. I'm smart and capable \[Brad Pitt voice\], but I dislike taking orders, and I HATE being micro managed. Just tell me what the end result is, and let me get on with it.

Is data processing my best bet? If so, is there a way to make decent (or semi-decent) money from that?

I'm currently looking into copywriting, as I have 15 years experience as a freelance journalist (I wrote for some pretty decent publications) but it seems quite tricky to get into.

420,3,"I’ve been retired for almost three years now but I still think about this. I worked in an office where the work was somewhat sporadic. But there were always things that needed to be done. There were between three and five of us at any given time and one guy whose job was less hands-on and more administrative. He openly slept at his desk on a regular basis. The manager knew this but it was a union job and she was a new manager and never confronted him about it. When he wasn’t sleeping, he was on the phone arranging jobs for his weekend side-hustle. The manager retired and it got even worse. Then Sleepy took a job in a different branch. At this point, I had about four months left before my retirement. On his last day, he showed me a bunch of files in the bottom drawer of the filing cabinet and said, “This should have been done a year ago. Before you go, here’s what you have to do…” I said, “I’m going to stop you right there. If you knew this had to be done a year ago and you didn’t think it was important enough to even start it, there’s no way I’m doing it in my last four months.” He had no response for that. "

That’s history. Today, companies merge, downsize, or “restructure” to pad stock prices or chase trends like AI. Since 2000, over 2 million U.S. jobs were lost in corporate shake-ups, with long-serving workers often hit hardest, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Loyalty didn’t save them. In 2023, tech giants like Google and Meta axed 26,000 and 21,000 jobs respectively, despite record profits, per company filings. Workers are fed lines like “your dedication matters” while severance packages are prepped. It’s a one-way street, and you’re not driving."

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to have steady income and all that, but man the routine is killing me. Wake up, commute, sit at a desk for 8+ hours, commute back, maybe squeeze in some dinner and Netflix, then repeat. Weekends fly by doing errands and trying to recover enough energy for Monday.

I see older coworkers who seem content with this setup and I genuinely don't understand how they do it. Maybe I'm just naive or expecting too much from life, but there has to be more than this right? Sometimes I think about just saying screw it and trying something completely different, but then reality hits and bills need to get paid.

The worst part is feeling guilty for complaining when I know plenty of people have it worse. But that doesn't make the existential dread go away when my alarm goes off every morning.

425,3,"I have this mid 50s co worker who is going through menopause and other personal life stressors as of late.  I noticed in the past 6 months she's started to act differently around me (more passive aggressive and short).  I had been trying to give her grace knowing what I know about her personal struggles when others would make comments about her behavior.  

Well a few weeks ago her behavior towards a different colleague and myself escalated.  My other colleague stumbled upon the problem colleague in a conversation about the two of us and walked off once she approached.  As the problem colleague was walking away she said, ""I'm gonna leave because I'm not gonna get in a fight today.""

At this point I have to reach out to this person because she's clearly not handling whatever is upsetting her in a professional manner and shes never acted like this hostile before.  I simply texted her and asked if everything was okay and that I'd like to talk to her. She doesn't respond until the following day and we chat on the phone.

She tells me she doesn't think I'm part of the team anymore and she said ""it just seems like you're not a part of us anymore"".  I did recently get a bigger office (I'm in our office 4 days a week- everyone else works from home 4 days a week and I'm a supervisor to two other colleagues).  She said, ""I'm at a different place in my career, I've had the big office and the leadership roles, I'm good.  I'm more fighting for <other colleague i supervise> because she doesn't have a big office like you and <other colleague i previously mentioned who heard the troubled colleague say she didn't want to get in a fight>.  She kept saying ""I fight for the underdog.""  This person is only in the office once or twice a week at most and had no clue why we have bigger offices compared to the rest of our colleagues.  

Anyway, in our conversation I validated her feelings and explained why some of the changes have happened (granted our supervisor had already done that prior).  I didn't have to explain myself but I felt like it was the right thing to do and I also wanted to help ease the tension.

So I left our conversation feeling better - at least hopeful, right?  Well a couple of days later she's in the office and I happen to pass her in our hallway and I greet her with a peppy ""hello!"" and all I got back was a flat ""hey.""

I think i say all this because working with people is exhausting and no matter what you do people are still going to suck.  End rant."

I am a qualified maths and physics teacher, and through some weird luck ended up teaching maths at an arts school. It has been really fulfilling, but the pay was 25 thousand, where the government set rate for my job in a school is 36 thousand.

I dont even work full time, so they would have to have paid me like 5 grand a year more.

They wouldn't.

I resigned.

I got an email from HR ""would you please reconsider your resignation"" and explaining how if I resign it will cost them a lot of money to replace me, and they will have to reapply for some funding, etc,etc.

I have already found a new job to start next academic term - full time and 30 percent **above** the government set minimum. So, no, no I am not going to reconsider.

I was brazen enough and replied ""you said you could not afford to pay me the same as a school teacher, and now this is the consequence of that. I will not reconsider""

428,3,"Companies don’t just demand loyalty—they manipulate you into feeling guilty for not giving it. They call you “family” so you’ll feel like a traitor when you leave. They lean on team dynamics so you’ll work late “for the group.” They preach “passion” so you’ll accept garbage pay for “meaningful work.” It’s a psychological trap, a cult with a 401(k) match, designed to keep you compliant while they exploit your goodwill.
And it works because many workers do care about their coworkers, their projects, the mission. That care is real, human, and admirable. But corporations? They see it as a weakness to be weaponized. They’ll milk your loyalty until you’re burned out, then replace you without a second thought. It’s not a relationship. it’s emotional blackmail, and it’s disgusting.

429,3,"Dario Amodei — CEO of Anthropic, one of the world's most powerful creators of artificial intelligence — has a blunt, scary warning for the U.S. government and all of us:

- AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years, Amodei told us in an interview from his San Francisco office.

- Amodei said AI companies and government need to stop ""sugar-coating"" what's coming: the possible mass elimination of jobs across technology, finance, law, consulting and other white-collar professions, especially entry-level gigs.

Why it matters: Amodei, 42, who's building the very technology he predicts could reorder society overnight, said he's speaking out in hopes of jarring government and fellow AI companies into preparing — and protecting — the nation.

Few are paying attention. Lawmakers don't get it or don't believe it. CEOs are afraid to talk about it. Many workers won't realize the risks posed by the possible job apocalypse — until after it hits.

430,3,"It’s the byproduct of an always-on, hyper-connected world where boundaries between work and life have all but vanished. The expectation to be reachable at all hours isn’t just for high-flying executives anymore; it’s creeping into every job, from baristas to software engineers. Your boss might not hand you a company phone, but that doesn’t stop the late-night “quick question” texts or the “urgent” emails landing at 10 p.m. Work doesn’t end when you leave—it follows you home, pinging your phone during dinner, interrupting your Netflix binge, or invading your thoughts as you try to fall asleep.

431,3,"I was wondering if anyone else had experienced something similar. I just started a new job working in an office. Our building is large and has programs that take place in it, such as a daycare and some social services. All the individuals here, regardless of whether they work in the daycare or office, are employed by my employer (it's all the same company). 

I was told that the people working in the office aren't allowed to work from home because of ""confidentiality"" reasons, as I work with spreadsheets that sometimes contain birth dates and social security numbers (wow!). However, I was also strongly encouraged to bring my work laptop home every day after work because of ""snoopy"" employees from the social service programs. They literally told me that I should probably bring my laptop home to keep it safe from people who might wander into my office after I leave, and go through my computer. And that I should consider buying a computer bag to make it easier to carry back and forth from work.

Of course I didn't buy the bag and I also don't take the laptop home. I've just been storing it away in my file cabinet. Has anyone else experienced something like this??"
432,3,"Hello all,

I recently left a job where I faced relentless ableist bullying as an autistic adult, being talked to like I was a child for almost grabbing wrong flyers for a shift I was early for because the boss didn’t bother to check the actual time, to having my handwriting openly ripped on, to being told to go step by step through copying and pasting just in an attempt to belittle me. I’ve left the job a week ago but these are still sore memories and I’m wondering if it’s worth it to put the company on blast for this, or if I should just email the ceo to put the bully on blast to prevent her from talking to anyone else this way. It’s a small business so the ceo was involved in employee affairs."
433,3,"Employer responded to my application, *they* suggested the interview time, I arrived 10 mins early, filled out paperwork, etc.

I was told “he’s on the phone, he’ll be right out.” 35 minutes after the appt time, no update, current employees apologizing to me for the wait every 5 minutes—I of course responded that it’s not their fault—someone went back to the dude once again to see if he could end his phone call and speak to me. He told them he would, and I was told “ok he’s REALLY on his way out now.” 5 minutes later, dude had not emerged, and I told the lovely employees that this seemed like it wasn’t a good fit and that it felt disrespectful to be made to wait this long.

Over an hour after our originally scheduled time, dude sent me a snarky non-apology “apology” on indeed, saying that he’d been on the phone with a firefighter’s association he’d helped raise money for and “it’s not like I could just hang up on them.”

It couldn’t be clearer that he thinks his time is more valuable than mine—he made a point of saying how much money he’d raised for the firefighters lol—so bullet dodged, and it felt good to walk out."
434,3,"I work(ed) as the Program Director for a non-profit focused on programs for people with disabilities. Unsurprisingly, all of our funding has been abruptly cut off since Jan 20. We knew things were bad, and were anticipating layoffs. The layoff isn't the problem - we all worked hard to avoid it, but it was inevitable.

However, the way I found out was WILD. Our Executive Director was cancelling an upcoming fundraiser at a brewery (because we knew we couldn't support it), but didn't realize she had replied all to me and my other coworker (also laid off). She said, and I quote, ""my two employees don't know it yet, but Monday is their last day"".

Excuse the fuck out of me?!? What a fucked way to receive that message. That was at around 8:30am today; she then didn't even come in to the office to face us. Apologized via text and email, told us to leave our laptops and office keys, and join a zoom meeting on Monday.

435,3,"My relationship with my boss has been on a downward trajectory for about a year now. It all started when I first established that I will not be working more than 3 hours on Saturdays, and I leave at 5pm everyday no matter what. I can maybe log on later that evening for an hour or two, maybe I can’t, because I may have plans and whatever needs done will have to wait. 

Needless to say, she does not like these boundaries and has made it pretty clear. I’ve kind of tuned her out and I “yes” her sometimes in the moments when she’s complaining, meanwhile continuing to enforce those boundaries around overtime and leave at 5 no matter what. Latest I’ve stayed has been 5:30. 

She also doesn’t like that I have established a no interruption during the day boundary. She likes to receive emotional support and validation throughout the day from my other coworkers, and I simply won’t do it for her. She has tried to assert that she will continue, but I wear headphones and literally let her talk to herself until she realizes I’m not responding, she is embarrassed, and shuts up. She has been starting to just come to my desk, which is irritating, but at least then I know it’s legitimately something I need to know instead of just her rambling about her problems. 

She has been going out of her way to try and stress me out because I won’t put up with her nonsense. She has tried to make me move next to her. I tried a soft approach of saying I don’t want to at first, and she dismissed me. I then sent an email to her threatening HR, which changed her tune and she replied with “yes I can accommodate you”.

She continues to try and push her stress onto us, particularly me. She seems to get off on the idea of giving us our “reviews”. I believe she wants it to stress me out, because she brings up “I need to schedule your reviews” in meetings, after she has flailed around for about 30 minutes letting us know how under water and stressed she is and she needs us to take some work off her plate. Our reviews aren’t until November, so I don’t see why they are being brought up in May unless it is being used to manipulate me. She never looks at me in meetings when she is talking about our actual work, but when she says things like how she needs us to take work off of her plate, she’s scheduling reviews soon, etc. she looks right at me during those moments. Any other time though, she does not look at me. 

Any suggestions? I don’t want to just find a new job right now, because in my line of work this seems to be the overwhelming majority of how managers operate. So I’d prefer to just figure out how to deal with managers that act in this manner. "

Don’t let those corrupt people make you listen through made up flaws about yourself and your work.

When I was let go, once for budget cuts and another time because I wasn’t trying to kiss up to everyone in the office, I cried for three days.

437,3,"BTW, this is not in America, so US labor laws don't apply here.

This was a small team of 10 people that the manager was assigned to. Myself included. I was the last person to be hired on the team. Everybody was my ""senpai"". And on the first day I worked there, they called a team meeting after work. We log off our computers at 4:55 PM, go to the meeting room, and we clocked out at 5:15 PM. Every day like clock work. I said, ""no problem. That's an extra 2 and half hours on the biweekly paycheck. And we didn't have to do any actual work except listen?""

When my first pay day came, I saw my full 80 hours, but the extra 2.5 hours were nowhere to be found. So I asked a couple of the guys if they only got paid 80 hours too. They all confirmed it. We were not getting paid for these meetings. The shift ends and once again the manager called for the daily team meeting and to log off at 4:55 PM then head to the meeting room. I do so.

And so I sit there for 5 minutes. As soon as it hit 5:00 PM. I get up and say, I need to be somewhere important (with everyone's eyes on me), the manager says ""OK"", I leave the room, clock out and go home.

The next day, I do the same. And again and again. The manager never stops me. Then the manager pulls me to the side one day and asks what's this ""important thing"" that I need to get to after work every day. And I tell him it's a personal matter and he leaves it at that.

Pretty soon. It catches on. The other guys start leaving right after me. And eventually, within a matter of days of me starting to leave at 5, everyone else started doing it too.

The manager started scheduling the meetings for 4:40 PM. All it took was one person to not take this shit anymore."
438,3,"About a decade ago I worked as a Field Engineer for a company in the UK. My time was mostly spend visiting customer sites to maintain and repair our equipment, driving all over the country by myself, working solo. However on occasion I would be required to assist with an installation job, and on those occasions I'd jump in a van with one of our installers.

On the return journey from one job I was in a van with one of the installers, who kept on using his phone while driving. This is illegal in the UK, but as he was just occasionally looking at it when we were stationary it didn't bother me. That changed when we got on the motorway and he was still doing it, the distraction causing him to end up drifting out of his lane on multiple occasions. It got even worse when I looked over and he was watching a youtube video, phone held below the steering wheel, and barely even looking at the road.

Being young, in my first ""proper"" job, and 20+ years his junior I didn't want to get into a confrontation, but at the same time I didn't want to let this issue go. So, without him noticing, I recorded a short video showing him watching youtube while on the motorway, and figured I'd mention his behaviour to management later.

Next day I went to speak to my boss. I said that I didn't want to get the guy in trouble, but thought that I should say something before he ended up wrecking the van or worse. After all, in that one journey he'd drifted out of his lane on the motorway dozens of times, had at least half a dozen close calls with other cars, and nearly driven into the back of a lorry when he didn't see their brake lights come on.

We spent a good while talking about how to handle this so that I didn't end up as the bad guy, and came up with a plan that we both agreed on. After his next install job, one which I wouldn't be on, the manager was going to say that a member of the public had called in to say they'd seen him using his phone on the motorway. It was a believable lie, we were in vans with our branding and contact numbers very clearly on the outside, and anybody in a 4x4 or van would be at a height where they could clearly see him on the phone, so that was the approach that was going to be gone with. At all times I made it very clear I didn't want to get the guy in trouble, I just wanted something being said before he ended up wrecking a van or worse.

Instead of doing any of that, the next day the manager called all of the installers into a meeting. He then told them that I had reported one of them for phone use.

Of course this immediately made me the enemy. The drivers all refused to work with me. They wouldn't accept me being assigned to support them on a job, and refused to provide any help if I needed it on one of mine.

I confronted the manager about this. Complained to him that we literally spent 40 minutes discussing how to handle it so that this very situation didn't occur. That we agreed on a course of action that would have made sure there was no suspicion of my involvement, so that the issue could be addressed without any drama. He claimed none of that was true, that we'd never spoken about any of that.

A month later I was called into the bosses office and told I was being let go, because with the installers refusing to work with me it meant I was no longer a productive member of the team. The official reason given for my firing was that my conduct had been unprofessional and unacceptable to the organisation. My conduct being asking for a driver to be reminded that they're not meant to flagrantly break the law while driving, because I didn't want to be killed in a car crash."
439,3,"The uncomfortable truth is that our hard work will never be rewarded. While we break our minds and bodies for the necessities, a vast portion of our labor is poured in excess to the few who own it all, and will continue to use us until our bodies break.

We have repeated this message many times over, and yet we are powerless to do anything about it. We desperately need a solution. We desperately need to take power out of the hands of politicians and owning class, or we and our children are doomed to slavery.

The only way we can take our lives back is by removing ourselves from the businesses owned by the cruel few, withholding access to our labor entirely.  How do we accomplish this when our very livelihoods are completely dependent on the measly paychecks they provide in return?

# What do we do?

In order to stick it to the owning class, we need to gain control of resources that fulfill our most basic needs. We need to cut out dependency on employers for things such as food, water, clothing, and housing. We need to build community from the ground up, sharing the few resources we have access to until the rich are not the only ones that can provide them. We can show everyone else stuck in the grind that there is a safety net they can retreat to.

# Where do we start?

There could be other ways to explore this, but I propose we start by pooling our money together to buy as much land and property as we can possibly share across the nation, then **Not** requiring high rent for others to utilize it. The only hope to remove power from the wealthy is to give space for our peers to not worry about money.

In addition to providing shelter for our overworked peers, we also need a source of food. Dependency to grocery stores only forces us into the same trap of needing money from the wealthy to feed ourselves. The land we acquire must accommodate gardens and farms cared for and maintained by the community.

# I need your ideas

The most I can do right now it start a Kickstarter to raise funds for safe worker-friendly spaces I am looking to create, but this will not be enough. I need other ideas on how we can come together as a community to take back power from the rich without greatly disrupting each other's lives and safety."
